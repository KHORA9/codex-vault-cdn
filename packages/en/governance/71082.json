C. 4\r\n  1920\r\n\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT, 1920, BY THE\r\n  MCGRAW-HILL BOOK COMPANY, INC.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE MAPLE PRESS YORK PA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accompanying series of studies is to shed light\r\nupon the vast importance of commercial control of raw materials by\r\ndifferent powers, or by the citizens of those powers, through invested\r\ncapital. The question of domestic and foreign governmental policies\r\nof the United States is closely involved. It appeared to many of us\r\nwho were engaged (as all the authors of these papers were) in studying\r\nthe mineral problems during the war, that our Government had never\r\ngrasped the vast political significance of commercial domination,\r\nand especially of the control of mineral wealth; and that other more\r\nseasoned nations had done so, and thereby affected the interests of\r\nAmerica and her policy very deeply, without her being aware of the\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid increase of the world’s population and the exploring and\r\nexploiting of the hitherto undeveloped natural resources, competition\r\nfor this wealth has become and will still become keener. In past ages\r\nwar, pestilence, and starvation held down the earth’s population; and\r\nin the last few years all these grim spectres have returned in force,\r\nsuggesting the possibility of a permanent return of the old primitive\r\ndays. Nevertheless, modern science and organization, if not quenched\r\nby vast social disorders, will so safeguard life, as in recent times,\r\nthat the world is in a fair way to become crowded. All of us, like\r\nGermany, yearn for our “place in the sun,” and our share of comfort\r\nand power. Of all the fundamental necessities for this, nothing is so\r\nmuch in the nature of a fixed and unmultipliable quality as the metals;\r\nthey constitute the basis and foundation of our modern civilization\r\nand power over man and natural forces. Other raw materials are of\r\nvegetable or animal origin; they propagate and duplicate themselves in\r\nsuccessive incarnations according to the law of life; they are born in\r\nsome magical fashion of air and water, with a minimum of the earth,\r\nand they return their loans faithfully to air and water and earth with\r\nthe passing of each generation and the dawning of a new. There is the\r\nhint of such a law of growth in the mineral kingdom, but it is so\r\nvastly slow that the evanescent animal man has no personal interest\r\nin it; for all his purposes and by all his standards of measurement\r\nit is inert, and these riches, once dug and used, will never again be\r\navailable. The treasures of commercially valuable ore-deposits have\r\nbeen hid by nature whimsically throughout the earth, here and there,\r\nby no rule of geography or latitude, and with a great disregard of\r\nequality. A nation’s needs or desires for mineral wealth have no stated\r\nrelation to its actual mineral possessions; what it needs is often in\r\nthe territory of another nation which does not need it. Commerce is\r\nthus born, and the nation which must have the metal or ore in question\r\nbacks up its commerce and helps it to fasten its claims for permanent\r\ncontrol of the deposits in question, by legislation, by diplomacy, and,\r\nif need be, by war. In the case of war, the metallic prize falls to the\r\nstrongest--usually the nation which before, through its necessities,\r\nexercised only commercial control, but which, as the result of the\r\ntrial of strength, now frankly asserts its sovereignty.\r\n\r\nHave we as Americans realized these forces? Absolutely not, I should\r\nsay. How many realize that the Alsace-Lorraine question is and was\r\nnot a sentimental one, but a struggle for the greatest iron deposits\r\nof Europe and the second largest in the world, which gave Germany her\r\nimmense growth and power, and may now transfer that wealth and power\r\nto France? That the dispute between Poland and Germany as to Upper\r\nSilesia is not a question of nationality, sentiment, or even territory,\r\nbut concerns the greatest coal field of Europe as well as great\r\ndeposits of lead and zinc? If Poland gets this, she may rival Germany\r\nin wealth and importance; if Germany loses it, she may drop into the\r\nposition of a second-rate power, now that she has also had to give up\r\nAlsace-Lorraine. To submit such a question to the vote of the native\r\npopulation is of the same order of fitness as tossing a coin for it;\r\nbut how many of us have understood this? Population shifts and changes,\r\nswells or shrinks, may be at one time predominantly Polish and at\r\nanother time mainly German; but the coal deposits are fixed. To clarify\r\nthese things we should in place of Silesia say Coal, in the place of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, Iron, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe reason we have not realized these facts is on account of our own\r\nvast mineral wealth, so abundant that not till recently has American\r\ncapital and enterprise found it necessary to adventure into the outside\r\nworld, as the European nations had long ago done. Their natural wealth\r\nwas limited so that they have become familiar with those fundamental\r\nprinciples and laws of which we have been unconscious. From this has\r\narisen European foreign policies, the protection of their national\r\ncommerce and national capital in foreign enterprises and consequently\r\nat home; governmental participation in business combinations, as in\r\nGermany, England, France, and Italy; while the United States has\r\nbeen engaged in “trust-busting” and has neglected the protection of\r\nits investors in foreign countries. This illustrates the difference\r\nbetween European diplomacy and American guilelessness. How well this\r\nplayed into the hands of foreign powers it is unnecessary to explain.\r\nThe spectacle of the United States maintaining a Monroe Doctrine of\r\nprotection over Latin-American republics which she took no vigorous\r\nsteps to unite with her by the powerful bonds of commerce, must well\r\nhave excited the amusement of those European commercial nations like\r\nGermany who have been strengthening themselves in those countries by\r\nthe closest commercial, and hence political, ties.\r\n\r\nThis volume simply takes up the study of the actual situation, as to\r\nthe distribution and ownership of mineral supplies in the world, and\r\nthe author of each chapter is a well-known specialist.\r\n\r\nFirst is considered the question of petroleum, source of power and\r\nlight, the key to the mastery of the air, and, on account of its fluid\r\nand easily transportable condition, of extraordinary future importance.\r\nNext are taken up the great fuel mineral, coal, and its ally, the great\r\nmetallic mineral, iron, which must go together for the manufacture of\r\niron and steel, the backbone of all our mechanical achievements. Next\r\ncome those metals indispensable in steel making and in the manufacture\r\nof specially hard or tough steels. These are of great importance, and\r\ninclude manganese, chromium, nickel, tungsten, vanadium, antimony,\r\nmolybdenum, uranium, and zirconium. Radium is closely associated with\r\nuranium and is considered with it. Closely allied with zirconium are\r\nthorium and mesothorium, and their treatment therefore closely follows\r\nthat of zirconium.\r\n\r\nThe next great group is that of the major metals, other than iron\r\nand the ferro-alloy metals: copper, lead, zinc, tin and mercury, and\r\naluminum. Aluminum ores are used not only as sources of the metal,\r\nbut for the manufacture of refractories and abrasives. Therefore they\r\nare classed partly with the metallic and partly with the non-metallic\r\nminerals; and the other non-metallic minerals, used likewise for\r\nabrasives, refractories, and other uses--such minerals as emery and\r\ncorundum, magnesite, graphite, mica, and asbestos--follow.\r\n\r\nThe next great group is that of the fertilizer minerals--phosphate\r\nrock, potash, nitrates and nitrogen, and pyrite and sulphur, all\r\nessential for agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe last group is that of the precious metals, gold, silver, and\r\nplatinum, essential for coinage and in the arts.\r\n\r\nThese various studies are essentially both inclusive and elementary:\r\ntogether they form almost the first contribution to the branch of\r\ninvestigation--that of the relation of geology to industry, commerce,\r\nand political economy--which they cover; and it is natural that\r\nbeginnings should be rather crude. Moreover, many of the chapters were\r\nwritten a year or more previous to the publication of the volume,\r\nand although brought to date to the extent possible in the brief\r\ntime available, are considered inadequate by the authors themselves.\r\nApologies for shortcomings and possible inaccuracies are therefore\r\nvery much in order. Nevertheless, it is felt that the volume merits\r\npublication, and that the beginning here made is far better than no\r\nstart at all.\r\n\r\n  JOSIAH EDWARD SPURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n  PREFACE                                                              v\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER\r\n\r\n       I.

NORTHROP[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] In this article, prepared in June, 1918, by Mr. Northrop, have\r\n  been incorporated certain notes and additions; as, for example,\r\n  information furnished by E. Russell Lloyd, of the United States\r\n  Geological Survey; A. G. White and W. E. Perdue, of the Bureau of\r\n  Mines, and others. (J. E. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nBY J. E. SPURR\r\n\r\nCoal and iron are the backbone of industrial civilization, and should\r\nbe considered first in any attempt to analyze the ownership and\r\ncontrol, as between nations, of the world’s mineral resources. Kin to\r\ncoal in growing importance, however, is the lighter, fluid and volatile\r\nmineral substance, petroleum, whose significance is vast and as yet\r\nnot wholly defined. More easily transportable than coal, and yielding\r\nrefined products whose explosive action in internal-combustion engines\r\nfurnishes greater power in proportion to weight than was once deemed\r\npossible, petroleum and its products, apart from their immense direct\r\neconomic importance, may, in the automobile, the submarine, and the air\r\nplane, and through numerous other applications, control strategically,\r\nfrom a nationalistic standpoint, the more inert foundations of\r\ncivilization. Moreover, the use of crude petroleum as fuel, especially\r\nfor ships, is of the most vital importance in these days of greater\r\ncompetitive plans for expanding world-wide commerce, and establishing\r\nthe strength and ready efficiency of navies. Great maritime nations\r\nmust have, for their oil-burning ships, oil-bunkering stations under\r\ntheir own control in all parts of the world where they wish their\r\ncommerce to dominate, and their navies to protect their interests\r\nefficiently.\r\n\r\nThe recognition by certain strong and aggressive nationalities of\r\nthis critical factor has brought about a situation that is perhaps\r\nunparalleled in the mineral history of the world. Coal and iron\r\nhave always been decidedly static as to control--they have remained\r\nlargely under the supervision and direction of the countries in which\r\nthey occur. Transportation costs, the conjunction of iron and coal\r\ndeposits, and other factors have prevented these minerals, in spite\r\nof their vast importance, from being fully used as a world commodity.\r\nBy contrast, petroleum is coming to be universal, like gold, in its\r\nacceptance and applicability; but, unlike gold, it is essential in the\r\nhighest degree to the advance of modern civilization. The fluidity\r\nof this mineral, its consequent amazingly cheap transportation and\r\nhandling by pipe lines, the completeness with which it can be utilized,\r\nall combine toward making it in the future the crucial factor of\r\ncommercial and of political control. Moreover, this fluidity of form\r\nand ease of application facilitate the control of petroleum by vast\r\ncommercial organizations, like the Standard Oil of America, and\r\nothers in various parts of the world; and even make its world control\r\nfeasible and probable. Recognizing this tendency, many nations, like\r\nEngland, France, Holland, Argentina, and Mexico, have taken steps\r\nlooking toward a partial nationalization of their petroleum resources,\r\nin order to protect themselves against foreign commercial aggression\r\nin this particular. England has gone farthest in this direction, and\r\nhas reached and is reaching out aggressively into other countries to\r\nsecure, through commercial control, backed where necessary by political\r\npressure, a world empire of petroleum to serve her world-wide colonial\r\nempire. The United States, on the other hand, has dominated the world’s\r\npetroleum industry through her own vast resources, worked by interests\r\nwhich have grown without conscious governmental help or even in spite\r\nof governmental and popular opposition, and have reached out and\r\nsecured footholds in other countries.\r\n\r\nIn the past the mineral development of the world has led to great\r\nchanges in political sovereignty. Important as these have been, the\r\nevents that may result from the nationalistic competitive exploitation\r\nand control of the world’s petroleum supply bid fair to exceed in\r\nimportance all similar changes of the past. The perception of the\r\nproblem and of the necessity, and the advantage of the initiative,\r\nnaturally belongs to those nations with restricted area and resources,\r\nthat have grown great by trading and by exploiting the resources of\r\nother countries. Such a nation, for example, is England, a country\r\nthat is fortunately the natural ally of the United States. By\r\ncontrast, in the United States, a nation concerned hitherto only with\r\nthe development of its own vast resources, commercial enterprise in\r\nforeign countries has been backed by no fixed national policy, and\r\nindeed has often been treated as unworthy. In the new international era\r\nthat was initiated by the World War, however, this policy of Chinese\r\nself-sufficiency and exclusion can not be safely continued, and the\r\nUnited States must not only perceive clearly the tendencies and\r\nmovements of other nationalities, but consider how best to direct its\r\nown commercial and political plans so as to uphold its independence and\r\npower. Such a policy would naturally lead to international agreements\r\nas to the distribution and division of petroleum lands, resources, and\r\nproduction, and probably no one thing would contribute more to the\r\npromotion of frank understanding between nations and the removal of\r\nobstacles to permanent peace.\r\n\r\nMr. Northrop’s paper follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF PETROLEUM\r\n\r\nIn its crude or semi-refined state, petroleum is extensively utilized\r\nas fuel under locomotive and marine boilers and to a small extent in\r\ninternal-combustion engines of the Diesel type. Certain grades of\r\npetroleum are utilized in the crude state as lubricants.\r\n\r\nThe principal use of petroleum is for the manufacture of refined\r\nproducts, of which the number and uses are legion. The lightest\r\ngravity, etherial products are employed as anaesthetics in surgery.\r\nThe gasolines are the universal fuels of internal-combustion engines,\r\nand the naphthas are widely used as solvents and for blending with\r\nraw casinghead gasoline in the manufacture of commercial gasoline.\r\nThe kerosene group includes a variety of products utilized primarily\r\nas illuminants, but in annually increasing quantities as fuel in farm\r\ntractors. The lubricating oils and the greases derived from petroleum\r\nare indispensable to the operation of all types of machinery. The\r\nwaxes derived from petroleum of paraffin base are utilized in many\r\nforms as preservatives and as sources of illumination, and in the\r\nlast three years have become indispensable constituents of surgical\r\ndressings in the treatment of burns. Petroleum coke, because of its\r\npurity, is in demand for use in certain metallurgical processes and for\r\nthe manufacture of battery carbons and arc-light pencils. Fuel oils\r\nobtained as by-products of petroleum refining satisfy the fuel needs of\r\nmany industrial plants, railroads and ocean steamers. Road oils, as the\r\nname implies, are employed for minimizing dust on streets and highways;\r\nand artificial asphalt, a product of certain types of petroleum, has in\r\nmany localities superseded the use of other forms of asphalt for paving\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Substitutes.=--For petroleum as a fuel under boilers in the generation\r\nof steam there are numerous substitutes, including wood, charcoal,\r\ncoal, peat, natural gas, artificial gas, and electricity; as a fuel in\r\ninternal-combustion engines some demonstrated substitutes are natural\r\ngas, artificial gas, benzol, and alcohol, and in the Diesel type of\r\nengine certain vegetable and fish oils can be utilized.\r\n\r\nFor illuminating purposes, animal fats, oils distilled from coal,\r\nnatural gas, artificial gas, acetylene gas and electricity may be\r\nsubstituted for kerosene.\r\n\r\nFor certain types of lubrication carefully refined vegetable and\r\nmineral oils are acceptable, but for lubricating high-speed bearings\r\nand for all lubrication in the presence of high temperature and of\r\nsteam no satisfactory substitutes for mineral lubricants derived from\r\npetroleum are known.\r\n\r\nSubstitutes for petroleum asphalt are available in the form of native\r\nasphalts, bituminous rocks, and coal-tar residues. For petrolatum,\r\nanimal fats and vegetable oils can be substituted, and for paraffin\r\nwax, ozokerite might be made to satisfy such essential requirements as\r\ncould not be met by refrigeration or by vegetable and animal oils.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nProbable changes in practice that may be expected to affect the\r\npetroleum industry within the next ten years include an increased\r\ndependence by oil producers on geologic investigations in advance of\r\ndrilling, the development of methods for deeper drilling than is now\r\npracticable, and the more efficient handling of individual wells and\r\nof entire properties, with a view to the ultimate recovery, at minimum\r\ncost, of a higher percentage of the oil originally present.\r\n\r\nThe tendency toward amalgamation of individual producing, transporting,\r\nrefining and marketing interests into strong units capable of\r\ncompetition in domestic and foreign markets on relatively equal terms\r\nwith each other and with pre-existing combinations of equivalent\r\nstrength will doubtless increase, and with the growing strength of the\r\nseveral units will come an efficient and thorough quest for petroleum\r\nin all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the refining of petroleum it is probable that methods will be\r\ndevised and perfected for recovering more of the light-gravity products\r\nfrom low-grade petroleum and for the conversion of the less-salable\r\nproducts of petroleum into products of greatest current demand.\r\nMoreover, it is believed that internal-combustion engines will be\r\nso modified as to run successfully on petroleum products of lower\r\nvolatility than gasoline. The use of petroleum as railroad, marine, and\r\nindustrial fuel is destined to increase enormously in the next decade.\r\n\r\nAlthough an important contributor to the oil-supply of Great Britain,\r\nthe shale-oil industry has received little attention in recent years\r\noutside of Scotland. Investigations by the United States Geological\r\nSurvey have demonstrated that the United States contains vast deposits\r\nof oil shale in Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Nevada, much of which will\r\naverage higher in oil content than the Scottish shale. Efforts already\r\nbegun to develop methods for the recovery of shale oil on a commercial\r\nscale in the United States will undoubtedly result in the establishment\r\nof a shale-oil industry in this country within the next two or three\r\nyears. The future growth of this industry will depend largely on the\r\nrapidity of the decline in the domestic production of petroleum.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCommercial accumulations of petroleum are everywhere restricted\r\nto strata of sedimentary origin. In the United States petroleum\r\nis produced commercially from strata of all periods from Cambrian\r\nto Quaternary, the most prolific sources being in strata of the\r\nCarboniferous and Tertiary systems. The geological age of the chief\r\nsources of petroleum production in each of the other oil-producing\r\ncountries of the world is indicated in the table following:\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.--GEOLOGIC AGE OF PETROLEUM-BEARING FORMATIONS\r\n\r\n  Country              System\r\n  _North America_\r\n    Canada             Silurian and Devonian\r\n    Mexico             Cretaceous and basal Tertiary\r\n    Alaska             Tertiary (?)\r\n  _West Indies_\r\n    Trinidad           Tertiary\r\n    Cuba               Cretaceous and pre-Cretaceous\r\n  _South America_\r\n    Colombia           Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\n    Venezuela          Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\n    Peru               Tertiary\r\n    Argentina          Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\n  _Europe_\r\n    Russia             Tertiary\r\n    Roumania           Tertiary\r\n    Galicia            Tertiary\r\n    Italy              Tertiary\r\n    Germany (Alsace)   Tertiary and pre-Tertiary\r\n  _Asia_\r\n    India              Tertiary\r\n    Turkestan          Tertiary\r\n    Persia             Tertiary\r\n  _Africa_\r\n    Algeria            Tertiary\r\n    Egypt              Tertiary\r\n  _Oceania_\r\n    Japan              Tertiary\r\n    Dutch East Indies  Tertiary\r\n    New Zealand        Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing table one might conclude that a direct relation\r\nexists between the distribution of Tertiary rocks and the supply of\r\npetroleum, but in the United States, which produces two-thirds of the\r\nworld’s current supply, the quest for petroleum has, under scientific\r\ndirection, included the entire range of the stratigraphic column, and\r\nhas found petroleum in considerable quantities in the rocks of each\r\ngeologic system younger than the Cambrian.\r\n\r\nThe fact that seeps and other surface indications of petroleum are\r\ngenerally more pronounced in the relatively younger Mesozoic strata\r\nthan in the older Paleozoic formations, and the further fact that\r\ngeologic exploration for oil and gas in countries other than the\r\nUnited States has been restricted in the main to areas containing the\r\nmost pronounced indications of petroleum, tend to account for the\r\npredominance of the Tertiary system in the foregoing table and to\r\nindicate the fallacy of attempts to estimate the world’s reserves of\r\npetroleum on stratigraphic evidence alone.\r\n\r\nDespite the broad geologic range of petroleum, its occurrence in\r\nspecific members, formations, groups, series or systems is by no means\r\nuniversal. On the contrary, its occurrence is restricted to specific\r\nlocalities in which are fulfilled certain variable relations, as yet\r\nbut little understood, that involve (1) the constitution, sequence\r\nand content of organic matter of the sediments; (2) the nature and\r\ndegree of metamorphism they have undergone; (3) their structure; and\r\n(4) their degree of saturation with salt water. Because the most\r\ndetailed geologic work is insufficient to provide a basis for the\r\nappropriate evaluation of the numerous factors involved, and because\r\nonly a relatively small percentage of the areas of sedimentary rocks in\r\nthe world have been examined geologically in appreciable detail, any\r\nestimate of the future supply of petroleum in the world is peculiarly\r\nhazardous.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of petroleum is as wide relatively as\r\nits geologic range. The oil fields of present commercial significance\r\nare situated, in the order of their importance as contributors to the\r\nworld’s production of petroleum in 1917, in the United States, Russia,\r\nGalicia, Mexico, Dutch East Indies, India, Persia, Japan and Formosa,\r\nRoumania, Peru, Trinidad, Argentina, Egypt, Germany, Canada, Venezuela\r\nand Italy. Small quantities of petroleum have also been reported from\r\nGuatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, Haiti, Porto Rico, Bolivia,\r\nChile, Spain, Arabia, China, Australia, Papua, Philippine Islands,\r\nNigeria, Belgian Congo, Gold Coast, Madagascar, and elsewhere. The\r\ngeographical distribution of petroleum in the world is shown on the\r\naccompanying map. (Plate I.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.--Geographical distribution of the producing\r\npetroleum fields of the world. By John D. Northrop.]\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the author the most conspicuous developments of the\r\nworld’s supply of petroleum in the next decade will take place in the\r\ncountries that border the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The\r\ntrend in this direction is unmistakable. From 1913 to 1917, the annual\r\nproduction of petroleum in Mexico increased from 21,000,000 barrels to\r\n56,000,000 barrels, and the potentialities of future production in that\r\ncountry have been demonstrated to be almost beyond comprehension. The\r\noutput, originally considered valuable only as a source of fuel oil,\r\nis now yielding, by modern refining methods, increasingly important\r\npercentages of illuminating oils and gasoline. The only obstacles to\r\nenormously increased production are unsettled political conditions and\r\ninadequate facilities for marine transportation. These obstacles will\r\ndoubtless be overcome within the next few years, and barring unforeseen\r\ncontingencies Mexico will soon rank second among the oil-producing\r\ncountries of the world.[2] Judged by the results of exploratory work\r\nalready done in Venezuela and Colombia, both of those countries are\r\ndestined to contribute appreciably to the world’s supply of petroleum\r\nwithin the next decade. Recently Colombia has given enough evidence of\r\nability to furnish high-grade petroleum from wells of large individual\r\ncapacity to warrant the large interests holding concessions there to\r\nexert every effort to overcome the adverse natural conditions that\r\nhave so long barred the way to exploitation. Enough drilling has\r\nalready been done in Venezuela to demonstrate that the resources of\r\nheavy-gravity asphalt-base petroleum in that country are large, and the\r\nrecent installation of a modern petroleum refinery for the treatment\r\nof these oils on the island of Curacao, off the Venezuelan coast, has\r\nprovided the market necessary to active field development.\r\n\r\n  [2] Mexico ranked second in 1918 and 1919.\r\n\r\nIn Trinidad the production of petroleum exceeds 1,500,000 barrels\r\na year and has doubled in the last few years. With the increased\r\nfacilities for ocean transport of petroleum that are becoming\r\navailable, a large output is assured.\r\n\r\nCuba is not expected to become an important producer of petroleum, and\r\npresent knowledge concerning the petroleum resources of the Central\r\nAmerican countries is not such as to warrant the belief that oil fields\r\nof material consequence will be developed in any of them.\r\n\r\nPetroleum production in the United States is expected to reach its\r\nmaximum within the next two or three years and to decline steadily\r\nthereafter, although this country is expected to remain the leading\r\noil-producing country of the world for the greater part, if not all, of\r\nthe coming decade.\r\n\r\nAs regards those oil-producing countries of North and South America\r\nthat have not been already mentioned, no significant changes in their\r\npresent status are anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe petroleum resources of Russia (including Asiatic Russia) are\r\nbelieved sufficient to assure that country retaining its position\r\nas the leading producer of petroleum in the Eastern Hemisphere far\r\nbeyond the next decade. During the last few years the output has\r\nbeen obtained under increasing difficulties, and as a consequence\r\nthere has been no measure either of present productive capacity or\r\nof potentialities. Concerning the future of Russia as a source of\r\npetroleum Arnold[3] says: “Such large areas, both in European and\r\nAsiatic Russia, yield unmistakable evidence of the presence of oil in\r\nlarge quantities that it is to this country, among those of Europe and\r\nAsia, to which the future must look for a supply.”\r\n\r\n  [3] ARNOLD, RALPH: “The World’s Oil Supply”: Report Am. Min. Cong.,\r\n  19th annual session, 1917, pp. 485-486.\r\n\r\nRussia being endowed with petroleum reserves, both proved and\r\nprospective, of great magnitude, the ultimate position of that country\r\nas the leading oil-producer of the world seems reasonably assured.\r\nIts immediate future is too intimately dependent on the progress from\r\npolitical turmoil to warrant a forecast.\r\n\r\nThe oil fields of both Roumania and Galicia are believed to have passed\r\ntheir maximum yield, and the possibilities of opening new fields of\r\nconsequence in those countries are not considered large enough to\r\njustify a forecast of anything but a moderate decline of production in\r\nfuture years. No material change in the status of the negligible oil\r\nfields of Italy or of Alsace is anticipated at any time in the future.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the situation in Asia, the writer believes that the next\r\ndecade will witness a steady increase in the output of petroleum in\r\nIndia, and the probable development of one or more important oil fields\r\nin Persia and possibly of fields in Asia Minor, Turkestan and China.\r\nIn Oceania the same period will doubtless witness a material increase\r\nin the production of petroleum in Japan and Formosa and in the Dutch\r\nEast Indies, together with the possible opening of new fields in Papua.\r\nAfrica will doubtless receive considerable attention from oil operators\r\nin the next ten years, but on the basis of available evidence the\r\nresults obtained in that period will probably not be large enough to\r\naffect the petroleum situation of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe status of the political control of the world’s output of petroleum\r\nin 1917, as determined by the best data now available, is indicated in\r\nthe table following.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram (Figure 1) shows the proportion of the world’s\r\nproduction of petroleum contributed annually by each of the principal\r\nproducing countries in each of the last ten years.\r\n\r\nTABLE 2.--POLITICAL CONTROL OF THE WORLD’S PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM IN\r\n1917\r\n\r\n  -----------------+-----------+----------+-------------\r\n  Source of        |           |          |Country\r\n  production       |Quantity of|          |exercising\r\n                   | production|Percentage|political\r\n                   |  (barrels)| of total |control\r\n  -----------------+-----------+----------+-------------\r\n  United States    |335,315,601|   66.17  |United States\r\n  Russia           | 69,000,000|   13.62  |Russia\r\n  Mexico           | 55,292,770|   10.91  |Mexico\r\n  Dutch East Indies| 12,928,955|    2.55  |Holland\r\n  India            |  8,078,843|    1.59  |Great Britain\r\n  Persia           |  6,856,063|    1.36  |Persia\r\n  Galicia          |  5,965,447|    1.18  |Poland (?)\r\n  Japan and Formosa|  2,898,654|    0.57  |Japan\r\n  Roumania         |  2,681,870|    0.55  |Roumania\r\n  Peru             |  2,533,417|    0.50  |Peru\r\n  Trinidad         |  1,599,455|    0.32  |Great Britain\r\n  Argentina        |  1,144,737|    0.23  |Argentina\r\n  Egypt            |  1,008,750|    0.20  |Great Britain\r\n  Germany          |    995,764|    0.20  |Germany\r\n  Canada           |    205,332|    0.04  |Great Britain\r\n  Venezuela        |    127,743|    0.03  |Venezuela\r\n  Italy            |     50,334|    0.01  |Italy\r\n  Cuba             |     19,167|          |Cuba\r\n                   +-----------+----------+\r\n                   |506,702,902|  100.00  |\r\n  -----------------+-----------+----------+-------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Proportion of the world’s output of petroleum\r\ncontributed annually by each of the chief producing countries,\r\n1908-1917.]\r\n\r\nAside from the control exercised by Great Britain through its\r\nprotectorate relation over the petroleum resources of Egypt, control\r\nof the petroleum resources of the various countries is mainly by\r\nvirtue of state sovereignty. This political control is in proportion\r\nto the strength of the government in the country exercising it. Recent\r\ndevelopments whereby the British government becomes the majority\r\nstockholder of a corporation controlling the oil resources of Persia,\r\npractically transfer the political control, as well as the commercial\r\ncontrol, of Persian petroleum from Persia to England. Mexico’s recently\r\nattempted firm political control of her vast petroleum resources\r\ndepends for its success upon her diplomatic ability in dealing with the\r\nstronger governments of England and the United States, whose nationals\r\nhave acquired a commercial control that is threatened by Mexico’s new\r\nand decided nationalistic policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe commercial control of the world’s production of petroleum, as far\r\nas nations are involved, is determined in the main through direct\r\nownership, of lands, leases and concessions, or by the control, through\r\nholding corporations, of subsidiary companies holding fee, leases,\r\nmineral rights or concessions of petroleum land. Except in Argentina,\r\nwhere the domestic petroleum industry is owned and operated by the\r\nstate; in Germany, where the government participates directly in the\r\nfinancing of petroleum enterprises through the Deutsche Bank; and in\r\nPersia, where the British government owns a substantial interest in\r\na company owning and operating extensive concessions, the commercial\r\ncontrol of the petroleum industry is determined almost wholly by\r\naggregations of private capital acting in their own interests.\r\n\r\nTABLE 3.--NATIONALITY AND EXTENT OF CONTROL OF DOMINANT INTEREST\r\n\r\n  ------------------+-----------+----------------+------------------\r\n                    |           |                |Approximate extent\r\n                    | Production|  Nationality   |  of control by\r\n                    |  in 1917  |  of dominant   |dominant interests\r\n  Country           | (barrels) |   interests    |   (per cent.)\r\n  ------------------+-----------+----------------+------------------\r\n  United States     |335,315,601|United States   |       96\r\n  Russia            | 69,000,000|British-Dutch   |       40+\r\n  Mexico            | 55,292,770|United States   |       65\r\n  Dutch East Indies | 12,928,955|British-Dutch   |      100\r\n  India             |  6,078,843|British         |      100\r\n  Persia            |  6,856,063|British         |      100\r\n  Galicia           |  5,965,447|German          |      100\r\n  Japan and Formosa |  2,898,654|Japanese        |      100\r\n  Roumania          |  2,681,870|British-Dutch   |       36\r\n  Peru              |  2,533,417|United States   |       70\r\n  Trinidad          |  1,599,455|British         |       80\r\n  Argentina         |  1,144,737|Argentinian     |      100\r\n  Egypt             |  1,008,750|British-Dutch   |      100\r\n  Germany and Alsace|    995,746|German          |      100\r\n  Canada            |    205,332|United States[4]|       80-\r\n  Venezuela         |    127,743|British-Dutch   |       80 (?)\r\n  Italy             |     50,000|French          |       96\r\n  ------------------+-----------+----------------+------------------\r\n\r\n  [4] By control of refining facilities.\r\n\r\nSo far as the author is aware, Canada is the only country in which the\r\npetroleum industry may be said to be controlled by foreign (United\r\nStates) interests, this control being by virtue of an essential\r\nmonopoly of pipe-line and refining facilities.\r\n\r\nThe preceding table shows, according to the best information available,\r\nthe nationality and approximate extent of control exercised by the\r\ndominant interest in each of the principal oil-producing countries of\r\nthe world in 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL CONTROL OF RESOURCES\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram (Figure 2) shows graphically the approximate\r\ncommercial control of the world’s production of petroleum in 1917.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Approximate commercial control of the world’s\r\nproduction of petroleum in 1917.]\r\n\r\nCommercial control of the petroleum industry in the _United States_\r\nis in the hands of the so-called “Standard Oil Group” of companies,\r\nthrough their control of most of the great pipe-line systems of the\r\ncountry, of probably 75 per cent. of the refining facilities and of a\r\nsubstantial part of the actual production. Other domestic interests\r\nhaving important shares in the control of the petroleum industry in\r\nthe United States include the Southern Pacific Railroad Co., Cities\r\nService Co. (Doherty interests), General Petroleum Corporation, Gulf\r\nOil Corporation, Ohio Cities Gas Co., Cosden & Co., Sinclair Oil &\r\nRefining Corporation, The Sun Co., the Texas Co., the Tide Water Oil\r\nCo., and the Union Oil Co. Foreign interests in the United States\r\ninclude purely British companies, which control a production of\r\nabout 2,000,000 barrels a year; British-Dutch companies represented\r\nby the Royal Dutch-Shell Syndicate, which control a production of\r\nabout 9,000,000 barrels a year, together with refining and marketing\r\nfacilities; and Franco-Belgian companies controlling a yearly\r\nproduction of about 1,000,000 barrels. Aside from the very probable\r\nholdings by individual Germans of shares in companies engaged in one or\r\nmore phases of the petroleum industry of the United States, the author\r\nis aware of no organized German interest in any phase of the domestic\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nCommercial control of the petroleum industry of _Russia_ is, under the\r\npolitical conditions now existing in central Europe, largely a matter\r\nof speculation. As nearly as can be ascertained, the dominant control\r\nis in the hands of purely British, Franco-British, and British-Dutch\r\n(Royal Dutch-Shell Syndicate) interests. Certain of the second-named\r\ninterests are allied closely with an additional group of capitalists\r\nrepresented by the firm Nobel Bros., of much importance, the present\r\ncontrol of which is by no means clear, from the literature available\r\non the subject. Though originally Swedish, the financial interests now\r\ninvolved in Nobel Bros. are believed to include representatives of\r\nfinancial groups in England, France, and Germany as well, with control\r\nprobably lying with the Anglo-Swedish interests. Before the war, direct\r\nGerman interest in Russian petroleum included control by the Deutsche\r\nBank through a Belgian company (the Petrole de Grosny) of the important\r\nproducing and refining company, A. I. Akverdoff & Co., control of which\r\nis now in British or British-Dutch hands. As in the United States,\r\na considerable part of the actual production of petroleum in Russia\r\nis distributed among a large number of individually weak companies,\r\ndominated, through the control of pipe-line or refining facilities, by\r\none or another of the principal groups.\r\n\r\nOf considerable importance in Russian petroleum affairs at one time was\r\nthe European Petroleum Union, organized for combat in the world markets\r\nwith the Standard Oil trust. This union included among others such\r\nimportant petroleum operators as Nobel Bros., the Rothschild interests\r\n(now Dutch-Shell), Mantaschoff (now Russian General Oil Corporation)\r\n(British), and the Deutsche Bank, the latter controlling Akverdoff and\r\nSpies in Russia, together with important companies in Roumania and\r\nGalicia. How far this union controlled the affairs of its constituent\r\ncompanies is not evident from available data, and its present influence\r\non companies now operating in Russia is uncertain.\r\n\r\nConditions in Russia make impossible any definite statement on the\r\npetroleum situation. A decree of the Bolsheviki government, dated June\r\n20, 1918, on the nationalization of the petroleum industry, declared as\r\nthe property of the state all movable and immovable property employed\r\nin and belonging to that industry. Trading in oil was declared a state\r\nmonopoly and was delegated to the chief petroleum committee of the fuel\r\ndepartment of the supreme Council of National Economy. As the chief\r\nproducing areas are now under British military control, this decree is\r\nineffective.\r\n\r\nCommercial control of petroleum in _Mexico_ is divided among United\r\nStates, British, and British-Dutch interests, which controlled about\r\n65, 30 and 2 per cent., respectively, of the production in 1917. The\r\ninterests of the United States include the Doheny group, operating\r\nprincipally as the Huasteca and Mexican Petroleum companies; the\r\nStandard Oil Co. of New Jersey, operating as the Penn-Mex Fuel Co.;\r\nthe Sinclair interests, operating as the Freeport and Mexican Fuel Oil\r\nCo.; the Texas Co.; Gulf Co.; Southern Pacific Railroad; and others.\r\nThe British interests are represented by the Pearsons, operating as\r\nthe Mexican Eagle Oil Co.; and the British-Dutch interests by La\r\nCorona Petroleum Co., and Chijoles Oil, Ltd., controlled by the Royal\r\nDutch-Shell Syndicate. No exclusively German interests are known to\r\nhold a substantial portion of any important company operating in Mexico.\r\n\r\nFormerly concessions were freely granted to foreign individuals and\r\ncompanies for the exploitation of mineral deposits, and oil lands were\r\nsold by the native owners to foreigners. Article 27 of the constitution\r\nof 1917 expressly forbids any but Mexican companies acquiring directly\r\nor operating directly petroleum lands in Mexico.\r\n\r\nAll recent concessions for the exploitation of oil properties contain a\r\nprovision stating that the concession will be declared null if any of\r\nthe rights are transferred to any foreign government. The provisions\r\nand the intent of a series of presidential decrees issued on February\r\n19, 1918, July 8, 1918, July 31, 1918, and August 1, 1918, are to\r\nnationalize all petroleum lands and to permit them to be worked only\r\nby Mexican citizens or by companies that agree to consider themselves\r\nMexican and further agree not to invoke the protection of their\r\ngovernments. A bill was presented in December, 1918, to carry out\r\nArticle 27 of the new constitution, but thus far no action has been\r\ntaken in the matter. The decrees and legislation growing out of Article\r\n27 have been protested by the chief petroleum companies operating in\r\nMexico and by their respective governments.\r\n\r\nCommercial control of the petroleum resources of the _Dutch East\r\nIndies_ is in the hands of the Royal Dutch-Shell Syndicate and is\r\nessentially absolute by reason of the restrictions contained in the\r\nNetherlands East India Mining Act and subsequent supplements on foreign\r\nacquisition of mining rights in the East Indian Archipelago. Actual\r\ncontrol is in the hands of the Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij,\r\nwhich has a capital of $56,000,000 divided into five shares, three of\r\nwhich are owned by the Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., and two by the Shell\r\nTransport Trading Co. (British). Purely British interests control an\r\ninconsequential production of petroleum in British North Borneo and in\r\nSarawak.\r\n\r\nProspecting licenses and concessions are granted only to Dutch subjects\r\nand to Dutch companies. It is officially stated that the object of\r\nthese restrictions is not to exclude foreign capital; this is precisely\r\ntheir effect, and on account of the economic monopoly which the Royal\r\nDutch-Shell now has of the petroleum industry of the Dutch East Indies,\r\nit would be very difficult for any new enterprise to gain a foothold.\r\n\r\nCommercial control of the petroleum resources of _India_ is exercised\r\nby the Burma Oil Co. through its dominance of production, refineries,\r\nand pipe-line facilities, and by reason of agreements as to marketing\r\nwith its principal competitor, the British Burma Petroleum Co., both\r\ncontrolled by British capital. The Burma Oil Co. is allied with, if not\r\ndirectly controlled by, a group of British financiers, one or more of\r\nwhom is interested in companies in Trinidad and in Persia.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the petroleum industry of _Roumania_ was temporarily\r\nwholly in control of German and Austrian interests. The advanced stage\r\nof development of the oil fields prior to the war and the intentional\r\ndamage, much of which is irreparable, wrought in the fields by British\r\ndetachments in 1916, when capture of the fields by Austro-German forces\r\nbecame inevitable, are believed, however, to have deprived Germany of a\r\nlarge part of the fruits of her conquest, as it is considered doubtful\r\nif the Roumanian fields can ever again be made to yield petroleum at\r\nthe pre-war rate of 12,000,000 barrels per annum.\r\n\r\nThe American Petroleum Institute states that “Roumania is considering\r\nthe erection of a state monopoly of both production and distribution on\r\nthe ruins of the monopoly which Germany sought to establish there but\r\nwas compelled by the armistice to renounce.”\r\n\r\nPrior to the war Dutch or rather British-Dutch (Dutch-Shell) interests\r\ncontrolled about 30 per cent. of the annual production of petroleum in\r\nRoumania, German interests about 26 per cent., United States interests\r\n(Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey) about 18 per cent., French interests\r\nabout 16 per cent., purely British interests about 6 per cent., and\r\nBelgian and Roumanian interests the remainder.\r\n\r\nThrough the Austrian “Society Gaz” and the German “Deutsche Erdoel\r\nAktien-gesellschaft,” German interests have dominated the petroleum\r\nindustry of _Galicia_ for years through the direct control of the\r\nlarger producing and refining interests and by reason of the fact\r\nthat the smaller scattered interests were dependent almost entirely\r\non the two leading companies, the Galizische Karpathen Petroleum A.\r\nG. (controlled by Society Gaz), and the Premier Oil & Pipe Line Co.\r\n(controlled by the Deutsche Erdoel A. G., which is in turn controlled\r\nby the Diskonto und Bleichroeder, a branch of the Deutche Bank) for\r\ntheir transportation and refining facilities. British and Dutch capital\r\nwere involved in the Galician fields prior to the war, but not, it is\r\nbelieved, to a controlling extent in either of the dominant companies.\r\n\r\nThe petroleum industry of _Japan_ is controlled wholly by Japanese\r\ninterests and to a preponderant extent by a single company, the Nippon\r\nOil Co. So far as the author is aware, no foreign interests share\r\nin any way in the development or control of the Japanese petroleum\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nCommercial control of the petroleum industry of _Peru_ is exercised by\r\nthe Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey through its subsidiary, the Imperial\r\nOil Co. of Canada. This control involves about 70 per cent. of the\r\nannual production, the remaining 30 per cent. being divided in the\r\nratio of 27 to 3 between British and Italian interests respectively. So\r\nfar as is known no other interests are involved.\r\n\r\nThe interests engaged in the petroleum industry of _Trinidad_ include\r\nfinancial groups purely British, controlling about 57 per cent. of\r\nthe production; British-Dutch interests (Dutch-Shell) controlling\r\nabout 23 per cent., and United States interests (General Asphalt Co.),\r\ncontrolling the remainder. The leading operator in Trinidad is the\r\nTrinidad Leaseholds, Ltd., a British company that in 1917 produced\r\nabout 42 per cent. of the petroleum output credited to Trinidad that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nCommercial control of the petroleum resources of lower _Alsace_\r\nhas been in the hands of the Vereinigte Pechelbronner Oelbergwerke\r\nGesellschaft and the Deutsche Tiefbohr A. G. Both of these companies\r\nare believed to be controlled by the Deutsche Bank through the Deutsche\r\nErdoel A. G., and the Diskonto und Bleichroeder. The negligible\r\nproduction of petroleum in _Hanover_ is doubtless under the same\r\nfinancial control, although data that would warrant a positive\r\nstatement to that effect are not at hand.\r\n\r\nThe petroleum reserves of _Argentina_, which comprise the only areas\r\nfrom which petroleum is being commercially produced in that country,\r\nare operated by the state through the Comodora Rivadavia Petroleum\r\nCommission. German interests are thought to have been involved in two\r\nor three unsuccessful efforts in the last decade to obtain petroleum on\r\ntracts adjacent to the government reserves in the Comodora Rivadavia\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe petroleum industry in _Egypt_ is controlled wholly by British-Dutch\r\ncapital operating as the Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields, Ltd., a subsidiary\r\nof the Royal Dutch-Shell Syndicate, through the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum\r\nCo., the last-named company being predominantly British.\r\n\r\nCommercial control of the petroleum industry in _Canada_ is exercised\r\nin effect by the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey, through its subsidiary\r\nthe Imperial Oil Co. of Canada. This control is exercised through a\r\nvirtual monopoly of pipe-line and refining facilities, and by the\r\nproducing interests, though British and Canadian, being individually\r\nsmall and unorganized.\r\n\r\nThe production of petroleum in _Italy_, which is small, represents the\r\noutput of two companies, the Petroli d’Italia, in which French capital\r\nis predominant, and the Petrolifera Italiana, which is believed to be\r\nessentially Italian.\r\n\r\nFinancial groups interested in petroleum in _Venezuela_ include the\r\nRoyal Dutch-Shell Syndicate (British-Dutch), the General Asphalt\r\nCo., (United States), and a group of British financiers who control\r\nproperties in Trinidad as well as the most important group of\r\ncompanies, other than Nobels and the Dutch-Shell, in Russia.\r\n\r\nUnited States interests, including the Standard Oil Co., the Doherty\r\ninterests, the Texas Co., the Gulf Corporation, and the Island Oil\r\nTransport Corporation, are predominant in the quest for petroleum in\r\n_Colombia_. The Venezuelan Oil Concessions, Ltd., an English company\r\noperating in Venezuela, is reported to have obtained a concession to\r\nexplore for oil in the northwest district of _British Guiana_.\r\n\r\nThe Sinclair interests (United States) are particularly active in\r\nthe search for petroleum in _Costa Rica_ and _Panama_; and the Sun\r\nCo. (United States) is understood to be investigating petroleum\r\npossibilities in other Central American republics.\r\n\r\nThe Pearson interests (British) have expended considerable effort in\r\nthe quest of petroleum in _Algeria_ and _Morocco_, and in the former\r\ncountry American interests (E. E. Smith) are reported to have recently\r\nsought petroleum concessions from the French government.\r\n\r\nBritish interests, including the British government, control extensive\r\npetroleum concessions in _Persia_, from which oil in unreported\r\nquantities is now being produced.\r\n\r\nThe most promising oil territory of Persia has recently been closed\r\nto American activity through the granting of a concession aggregating\r\napproximately 500,000 square miles to a British concern, the\r\nAnglo-Persian Oil Co., a majority of whose voting stock is owned by the\r\nBritish government. This concession runs until 1961. The importance of\r\nthe oil territory is indicated by its reported potential capacity of\r\n30,000,000 barrels yearly, with tremendous reserves undeveloped.\r\n\r\nUnited States interests (Standard Oil Co. of New York) are understood\r\nto still retain control over the petroleum rights in certain provinces\r\nin _China_, where active prospecting in two or three localities a few\r\nyears ago was reported to have yielded unfavorable results.\r\n\r\nPetroleum in small quantities is produced in _New Zealand_ by purely\r\nBritish interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE LEADING POWERS\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--As regards probable developments in the petroleum\r\nindustry within the next decade, the United States, thanks to the\r\nenterprise and foresightedness of financial interests of domestic\r\norigin, seems to have a strong position. United States interests\r\nare practically supreme in the commercial control of the petroleum\r\nresources of the Western Hemisphere, dominating the petroleum\r\nindustry in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Peru, holding\r\nsubstantial interests in Trinidad and Venezuela and in the prospective\r\npetroliferous areas in Central America and Colombia. Its only\r\ncompetitors are British and British-Dutch interests, which control the\r\npetroleum situation in Trinidad and are not only strongly intrenched in\r\nthe United States, Mexico, and Venezuela, but are aggressively seeking\r\nto enlarge their holdings in those countries and to gain footholds\r\nelsewhere. Unless the United States adopts measures, such as Federal\r\noperation of the trunk pipe-lines, to limit the aggressions of foreign\r\ncapital in this country, and erects a firm forward-looking governmental\r\npolicy toward the protection of investments of its citizens in\r\npetroleum properties in other countries, particularly Latin-American\r\ncountries, it may witness its commercial supremacy in petroleum affairs\r\nwane and disappear, while it is yet the largest political contributor\r\nto the world’s supply of petroleum.\r\n\r\nAs contrasted with the strongly nationalistic and deliberately\r\naggressive governmental policy adopted by Great Britain, France,\r\nHolland and some other nations, the United States has never adopted\r\nany policy founded on recognition of the importance of political and\r\ncommercial control of petroleum. American companies may not own and\r\noperate oil lands in the British Empire, in the French possessions,\r\nor the Dutch colonies, but the only American restrictions on foreign\r\nactivity in the petroleum industry are those which cover all minerals\r\ncontained in public lands. Only American citizens, or those who have\r\ndeclared their intention of becoming American citizens, can apply for\r\npatents to such land. However, after the application is made, there is\r\nno restriction on transfer of the mineral rights thus secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Great Britain.=--British and British-Dutch interests easily dominate\r\nthe petroleum situation in the Eastern Hemisphere by supremacy in the\r\npetroleum industries of Russia, Persia, India, and the Netherlands\r\nEast Indies. Domination of the petroleum situation in Russia alone\r\nis believed tantamount to dominion of the petroleum situation in the\r\nentire Eastern Hemisphere for the greater part of the next century. The\r\nstrength of Great Britain’s present position in the world’s petroleum\r\naffairs lies in a strong governmental policy and in the wide scope of\r\nBritish petroleum investments, embracing practically every country\r\nwhere petroleum is an important product and nearly every country where\r\nit is a product of potential importance. The general policy of the\r\nBritish Empire seems to be to control all oil development and restrict\r\noperations by foreign capital. In Australia licenses are required for\r\nthe exploitation of oil lands, and only companies incorporated in the\r\nUnited Kingdom or a British possession may receive such licenses. The\r\nGovernor General has the right of pre-emption of all oil produced\r\nand in case of war may take control of all oil properties. In Canada,\r\nin those western provinces where minerals are the property of the\r\nCrown, petroleum and natural gas lands may be leased only to British\r\ncompanies. A similar restriction exists in Burma. In Burma a monopoly\r\nof the petroleum industry for 99 years was granted to the Burma Oil Co.\r\nin 1865. This grant seems to have been inspired by fear of the Standard\r\nOil Co. of the United States, for the agreement between the company\r\nand the government stipulates that the former shall not amalgamate\r\nwith other oil companies. Regulations of like effect exist in other\r\nBritish colonies where oil exists; in Barbados the British government\r\nhas the right of pre-emption of all oil residues; in British Guiana,\r\nnon-British companies can only hold lands by special license of the\r\nGovernor; in British Honduras all mineral oil is reserved to the Crown;\r\nin southern Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Trinidad, and Tobago the British\r\ngovernment has the right of pre-emption over all petroleum.\r\n\r\nThe recent granting of a concession amounting to a monopoly in the\r\nmost promising oil district of Persia (a region that many oil experts\r\nbelieve likely to become one of the most important in the world) to a\r\nBritish company controlled directly (by stock ownership) by the British\r\ngovernment, signifies an aggressive policy of England, outside of her\r\nown dominions, to secure and hold, under government control, oil lands\r\nin all parts of the globe.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the best-known oil territories in Venezuela are\r\nalready covered by concessions that are practically all controlled\r\neither directly or indirectly by British interests, chiefly the\r\nDutch-Shell Syndicate.\r\n\r\nSo far as observed, German interests actually dominate the petroleum\r\nindustry in Galicia and at home. Whether forced back on its own\r\npetroleum resources or on these reinforced by those of Galicia, Germany\r\nwill obviously have an inadequate supply, and in consequence German\r\ninterests are likely to be particularly aggressive in seeking petroleum\r\nin Mesopotamia, Africa and South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n=France.=--Since control of the petroleum interests of the\r\nRothschilds passed into the hands of the Royal Dutch-Shell Syndicate\r\n(British-Dutch), the influence of French finances in petroleum affairs\r\nhas been negligible, outside Galicia and Italy, where its potency was\r\nnot great. French capital will undoubtedly participate in efforts\r\nto determine the petroleum reserve of the Barbary States, French\r\ndependencies, but it will hardly be much involved in organized efforts\r\nto control the world situation with respect to petroleum.\r\n\r\nThe French mining law holds that oil and gas belong to the state, and\r\nmay be exploited under concessions, the area and time limit of which\r\nare matters of negotiations between the applicant and the authorities.\r\nIt is understood that the French government is unwilling to grant oil\r\nconcessions except to companies the majority of whose stock is held by\r\nFrench citizens. A company incorporated recently to work the Algerian\r\noil fields contains in its articles of incorporation the provision that\r\n60 per cent. of its stock must be held by French citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Japan.=--Japanese investments in the world’s petroleum industry have\r\nnot yet attained significant proportions outside Japan itself, though\r\nthe Japanese government is officially alive to the importance of\r\nJapanese investments in petroleum properties in Mexico, particularly\r\nLower California and Sonora; China; and undoubtedly Russia. Hence large\r\ninvestments of Japanese capital in the petroleum industry in one or all\r\nof those countries may be expected in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nPetroleum in its crude or semi-refined state is used as fuel under\r\nlocomotive and marine boilers and as a lubricant. The principal use\r\nof petroleum, however, is in the manufacture of numerous refined\r\nproducts. Some of the more important products and their uses are\r\nas follows: ether, as an anæsthetic in surgery; gasoline, as fuel\r\nin internal-combustion engines; naphthas, as solvents and in the\r\nmanufacture of commercial gasoline; kerosene, as an illuminant and as\r\na fuel for farm tractors; lubricating oils; waxes, as preservatives,\r\nilluminants, and surgical dressings in treatment of burns; petroleum\r\ncoke, in metallurgical processes and in the manufacture of battery\r\ncarbons and arc-light pencils; heavy fuel oils; road oils; artificial\r\nasphalts, for pavements. The use of petroleum and its products as fuel,\r\nas a lubricant, and for illumination may be considered essential.\r\nSubstitutes for most of these uses are known, but they are either\r\ninefficient or not readily available.\r\n\r\nThe most prolific sources of petroleum are in sedimentary strata of the\r\nCarboniferous and Tertiary periods. Because the most detailed geologic\r\nwork is insufficient to provide for the appropriate evaluation of the\r\nnumerous factors involved in the occurrence of petroleum, and because\r\nonly a relatively small percentage of the areas of sedimentary rocks\r\nthroughout the world have been examined geologically in any appreciable\r\ndetail, it is difficult to estimate the future supply of petroleum\r\nor to predict that large accumulations will be discovered in any\r\nparticular region.\r\n\r\nThe principal countries contributing to the world’s production of\r\npetroleum rank as follows in general order of importance: United\r\nStates, Russia, Mexico, Dutch East Indies, Roumania, India, Persia and\r\nGalicia. Other countries produce less than 2 per cent. of the annual\r\ntotal. The greatest change that is likely to come in the geographical\r\ndistribution of production is a larger output from the countries\r\nbordering the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and from the\r\nPersian and Mesopotamian fields. Mexico now ranks second to the United\r\nStates, and South American countries promise to become more important\r\ncontributors to the world’s production than they now are. Russia is\r\nexpected to become ultimately one of the chief producers of petroleum.\r\n\r\nWithin the next decade, through improved methods of production and\r\nthrough the further amalgamation of producing, transporting, refining,\r\nand marketing companies into strong units, the output will undoubtedly\r\nbe larger and will be more economically produced. In the refining of\r\npetroleum it is probable that improved methods will make possible the\r\nrecovery of a larger percentage of lighter products from low-grade\r\npetroleum. Internal-combustion engines are being modified so as to\r\nrun on petroleum products of lower volatility than gasoline. The use\r\nof petroleum as fuel under railroad and marine boilers is expected to\r\nincrease enormously in the next decade. As the output of the producing\r\nfields declines, the vast deposits of oil shale in the western United\r\nStates will be developed as a source of oil.\r\n\r\nSo far as is known, political control of the petroleum resources of\r\nthe world is determined by state sovereignty (see Plate I, page 7).\r\nIn normal times, the United States controls politically over 66 per\r\ncent. of the present output of petroleum. Russia and Mexico ranked\r\nsecond and third in 1917, controlling 13.6 per cent. and 10.9 per\r\ncent., respectively. The remaining 9 per cent. was controlled by\r\nGreat Britain, Holland, Persia (British government owned), Roumania,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Japan, Peru, Germany, Argentina and Italy in the order\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nThe table showing the nationality and the approximate extent of the\r\ncommercial control exercised by the dominant interests in each of\r\nthe principal oil-producing countries, and Fig. 2 (page 12) are the\r\nbest possible summaries of commercial control. United States capital\r\nis supreme in the commercial control of the petroleum industry of\r\nthe Western Hemisphere. British and British-Dutch interests easily\r\ndominate the petroleum situation in the Eastern Hemisphere. France no\r\nlonger exercises control over any important fields. Japanese interests,\r\ncontrolling at present all the oil fields of Japan, may be expected to\r\nmake large investments in the petroleum fields of Mexico, China and\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCOAL\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE S. RICE AND FRANK F. GROUT\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF COAL\r\n\r\nCoal is among the most important of all minerals. It furnishes power\r\nand heat, and its distillation yields a great number of useful\r\nmaterials, such as gas for lighting and fuel, explosives, ammonia,\r\naniline dyes, etc. Coke, which is bituminous coal with the more\r\nvolatile constituents removed by distillation, is used for smelting\r\nmetallic ores; and thus the contiguity of fields of high-grade coking\r\ncoal and of iron ore determined the location of the centers of steel\r\nindustry, which are the very main-springs of our modern machine-made\r\ncivilization. Near such coal districts, other manufactures of all kinds\r\nnaturally developed, the coal being cheaply available for power and\r\nconstituting practically the only source of power in regions where\r\ncheap hydro-electric power is not available. About 66 per cent. of the\r\ncoal mined goes to the production of power, including transportation;\r\nabout 12 per cent. to coking and the by-products; and about 22 per\r\ncent. to the heating of buildings.\r\n\r\nCommercial coal is of three varieties: (1) anthracite (Pennsylvania\r\nanthracite is popularly termed hard coal), and semi-anthracite\r\ncontaining a high percentage of fixed carbon and a relatively low\r\npercentage of the volatile constituents (3 to 12 per cent.); (2)\r\nbituminous (ambiguously termed “soft coal” in the United States),\r\ncontaining less fixed carbon and more volatile matter (12 to 40 per\r\ncent.); and (3) lignite, containing a still smaller proportion of\r\nfixed carbon and a large proportion of water. Of the bituminous coals,\r\nsome coke satisfactorily, but many do not, so that good coking coals\r\nare highly prized. Anthracite, because it makes no smoke, is in great\r\ndemand for house heating; whereas bituminous coal is chiefly used for\r\npower production, including locomotive and steamship firing. Lignites\r\nas a rule are used only where the better grades of coal are not\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nCoal was first used for heating before steam power came into use, and\r\niron was smelted with charcoal instead of with coke as at present.\r\n\r\nShip bunkering calls for the best grades of bituminous coal, low in\r\nash and preferably high in fixed carbon, because the use of low-grade\r\ncoals would require carrying larger amounts, leaving less space for\r\ncargo. However, no country that has enough coal to bunker ships, need\r\nbe dependent on foreign supplies; the low grade of coal would simply\r\nreduce efficiency and thus increase expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Substitutes.=--The proportion of coal used for power, as distinct\r\nfrom that used for heat and coal products, is increasing, and is now\r\ntwo-thirds of the total. As a source of power there is really no\r\ncomplete substitute for coal. All the great industrial nations, like\r\nEngland, Germany and the United States, have developed their industries\r\non the basis of large coal supplies. Some countries make large use of\r\nhydro-electric power, but for most it is an insufficient substitute.\r\nWood and other fuels are rarely sufficient to maintain an industry\r\nbuilt up on a supply of coal. Oil is being successfully substituted in\r\nsome industries, notably in shipping, but the importance of coaling\r\nstations will no doubt persist.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nThe technique of coal mining in many districts, and the development of\r\nheat, power and coal products are not far advanced. Wasteful methods\r\nare used, mostly as a result of competition and lack of co-operation\r\nand organization among producers. Economies are being advocated,\r\nhowever. Labor-saving machinery has been installed in many mines. A\r\nnumber of power plants have been erected near the mine mouth and the\r\npower distributed electrically, thus eliminating freight charges on\r\ncoal. Central heating and power plants that can burn coal efficiently\r\nwill no doubt be more popular and numerous in a few years. Government\r\ncontrol and legislation may be expected to hasten the changes. In\r\nEurope the technique of coal mining, except in undercutting machinery,\r\nis further advanced than in the United States, as regards mining _all_\r\nthe coal and in supporting the surface.\r\n\r\nImprovements in coking ovens may soon make possible the manufacture\r\nof some sort of coke from almost any bituminous coal. While all coke\r\nmay not be satisfactory for modern blast-furnace practice, any future\r\nlack of coke will probably be offset by the development of electric\r\nsmelting, so the seriousness of the metallurgical need is doubtful. The\r\nproportion of by-product coke ovens, which make for cheaper coke by\r\nproviding for other marketable products, is increasing.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCoals are found in the sedimentary deposits of several geological eras:\r\nPaleozoic, Mesozoic, and Tertiary. The Paleozoic era, embracing the\r\nCarboniferous period, is by far the most important as regards quality\r\nand availability of its coal resources; but the lower-grade and chiefly\r\nlignitic coals of the Mesozoic and Tertiary are of great importance\r\nlocally, and there are enormous reserves that exceed in quantity the\r\ngenerally higher-grade coals of the earlier periods.\r\n\r\nThe geologic distribution of coal is described in “The Coal Resources\r\nof the World,” the most important and comprehensive compilation on coal\r\nreserves ever made, which was undertaken by the Executive Committee of\r\nthe Twelfth International Geologic Congress, held in Canada in 1913. As\r\nthe compilation was made with the assistance of geological surveys and\r\nmining geologists of the several countries of the world, it is cited in\r\nthis paper as authoritative on geologic distribution and resources.\r\n\r\nThe geographic distribution of the chief coal fields of the world is\r\nshown in Plate II.\r\n\r\nIn _North America_ the most important coals in the Central and Eastern\r\npart are of Paleozoic age, but in the Rocky Mountain region vast\r\nquantities of coal occur in the Cretaceous (Mesozoic) strata. In the\r\nGulf province and in the Northern Great Plains province of the United\r\nStates, which extends into Canada, are coals of Triassic (Mesozoic) age\r\nthat are relatively unimportant at present.\r\n\r\nIn beds of the Eocene period of the Tertiary era are large deposits\r\nof brown lignite locally converted by mountain-building forces into\r\nbituminous and semi-bituminous coal, and also a little anthracite under\r\ndifficult mining conditions. Such locally altered beds are found in the\r\nState of Washington, in British Columbia, and in Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe limited coal resources of _South America_, in those deposits east\r\nof the Andes and in southern and eastern Brazil, are of Paleozoic age.\r\nSmall areas of Tertiary coals are found in southern Argentina and in\r\nChile.\r\n\r\n  Key to Plate II.\r\n\r\n  World’s Coal Reserves as of 1916--Coal Fields in Solid Black.\r\n\r\n  1. Countries possessing coal reserves of the first magnitude\r\n  (4,000,000 million to 1,000,000 million tons): The United States\r\n  (3,527,000 million), Canada (1,234,000 million), and China (1,500,000\r\n  million).\r\n\r\n  2. Countries possessing coal reserves of the second degree of\r\n  magnitude (500,000 million to 100,000 million): The British Isles\r\n  (189,533 million), Germany (before the war) (423,356 million),\r\n  Siberia (173,879 million), and Australia (165,572 million).\r\n\r\n  3. Countries possessing coal reserves of the third degree of\r\n  magnitude (80,000 million to 16,000 million tons): France (before\r\n  the war) (17,583 million), Alaska (16,293 million), Colombia (27,000\r\n  million), Austria-Hungary (before the war) (55,553 million), Russia\r\n  in Europe (before the war) (60,106 million), India (79,001 million),\r\n  Indo-China (20,000 million) and South Africa (56,200 million).\r\n\r\n  4. Countries possessing coal reserves of the fourth degree of\r\n  magnitude (16,000 million to 6,000 million tons): Spain (8,768\r\n  million), Japan (7,970 million), Belgium (11,000 million),\r\n  Spitzbergen (8,750 million).\r\n\r\n  5. Countries possessing coal reserves, but of inferior magnitude\r\n  (less than 4,000 million tons): Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru,\r\n  Ecuador, Venezuela, Greenland, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Italy,\r\n  Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece, Roumania, Asia Minor, Persia, Arabia,\r\n  various islands of Malaysia and various countries in Africa. Coal\r\n  fields shown in black--country not shaded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.--Geographical distribution of the coal\r\ndeposits of the world, and relative reserves. By F. F. Grout.]\r\n\r\nIn _Europe_ the principal coal deposits occur in the Carboniferous\r\nsystem, either in the upper or the lower part. The Lower Carboniferous\r\nis the principal series in which coals occur in Scotland, whereas the\r\nmost important coals in England and in Wales lie in Upper Carboniferous\r\nrocks. In northern France, in Belgium, and in Westphalia, Germany, the\r\nmiddle Carboniferous measures contain the most important reserves.\r\nMesozoic coals are found in northern Australia and in central France.\r\nThe lignites or brown coals of middle Europe are locally very important\r\nin Germany; those of Austria are found in numerous small but thick\r\ndeposits of the Tertiary age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Coal output of the chief coal-producing\r\ncountries, 1880-1916.]\r\n\r\nThe principal coal resources of _Africa_ are in the southern part\r\nof the continent and are chiefly in deposits whose ages range from\r\nCarboniferous to Triassic.\r\n\r\nIn _Asia_ the coal fields are not well defined. There are coal basins\r\nof note in India and China. In China important coals are found in the\r\nUpper Carboniferous. Coals of the Lower Carboniferous are found east\r\nof the Urals and also in Turkestan. In Japan the Mesozoic coals are\r\nimportant. Tertiary coals are widely distributed in Asia but are not\r\nhigh-grade nor of importance.\r\n\r\nIt may be safely stated that geological reconnoissance has covered\r\nthe world so well that further development is not likely to disclose\r\ncoal resources of great magnitude not now known with more or less\r\nexactitude. Estimates of resources of some regions will undoubtedly be\r\nrevised many times, especially those of reserves in the middle portion\r\nof Africa, in South America, and China.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL PRODUCTION OF THE WORLD IN 1913\r\n\r\nAs the great World War began on July 31, 1914, the last normal\r\nproduction figures were for 1913. The following table of the world’s\r\nproduction of coal for the years 1911-1914 is from “Mineral Resources”\r\nof the U. S. Geological Survey, the compilation being credited by Mr.\r\nLesher, of the Survey, to Mr. Wm. G. Gray, statistician of the American\r\nIron and Steel Institute, and Prof. G. A. Roush, editor of “Mineral\r\nIndustry.”\r\n\r\nThe output (1880-1916) of the chief coal-producing countries of the\r\nworld is shown graphically in Figure 3.\r\n\r\nTABLE 4.--THE WORLD’S PRODUCTION OF

tons.\r\nSquares are to scale: lines showing relative production are not on same\r\nscale as squares.]\r\n\r\nThe reserves of the principal productive coal fields are graphically\r\nshown in Figure 4.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the coal deposits of the world and the estimated\r\nreserves in these deposits are shown in Plate II.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL WORLD SITUATION\r\n\r\nThe districts with coal for export have been chiefly the British Isles,\r\nUnited States and Germany; there might be included also New South\r\nWales, British South Africa, Japan, French Indo-China, Canada, New\r\nZealand and Spitzbergen. China, with her large reserves, may become an\r\nexporter in the future; or, if her industries develop, may find use for\r\nher coal at home.\r\n\r\nAnthracite of good grade is found in large amounts in Pennsylvania and\r\nSouth Wales only. Poorer supplies are known in Germany, France, Italy,\r\nIndo-China, and also in the states of Colorado and New Mexico.\r\n\r\nCoking coals in large amounts are found in the eastern United States,\r\nGermany and the United Kingdom and are coked extensively. Smaller\r\namounts of coke are made in France, Belgium and old Austria. Relatively\r\nvery small amounts are made in Canada, Chile, New South Wales, Japan\r\nand Spain.\r\n\r\nThe coal reserve of a country bears no direct relation to its present\r\nproduction, for the latter, which has to be developed in competition\r\nwith other countries, depends upon relative facility of transportation\r\nand proximity of iron-ore deposits, which render steel making and other\r\nindustries economically feasible.\r\n\r\n_Great Britain_ is particularly favored through the possession of\r\nhigh-grade coal immediately adjacent to coast ports, as in the North\r\nof England, Scotland and Wales. Hence Great Britain became a great\r\nexporter of coal. First, coal for heating purposes traveled by sea\r\nfrom Newcastle to London; next coal was carried to European ports, and\r\nfinally to all parts of the world. The possession of easily worked iron\r\ndeposits in the north of England and the discovery that iron could\r\nbe smelted with coke rapidly accelerated the development of the coal\r\nindustry in Great Britain, so that by the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury Great Britain had a commanding lead.\r\n\r\nNo other country possesses high-grade coal in such quantity immediately\r\nadjacent to the coast, and this fact has enabled Great Britain to\r\nremain the great exporter. The average length of haul of export coal,\r\nfrom mine to ship, is less than 20 miles. In Germany coal for ocean\r\nexport must be hauled 118 miles to 168 miles; in the United States\r\nfrom 150 to 375 miles, except for Washington coals, which are within\r\n40 miles of tidewater, but are small in quantity and of indifferent\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nAfter the war with France in 1871, when _Germany_ annexed Alsace\r\nand Lorraine, the coal industry of the German Empire developed\r\nwith tremendous rapidity, largely through the discovery--from the\r\ninvestigations of Thomas, of Great Britain--of a method of utilizing\r\nthe high-phosphorus iron ores of German and French Lorraine, and the\r\nnearness of these iron-ore deposits to the high-grade bituminous coals\r\nof Westphalia. The coal industry was also developed by fostering the\r\nexport trade with adjacent countries, which have small coal resources\r\nor none, this trade nearly all going by rail.\r\n\r\nHowever, the long rail haul and the correspondingly high cost of mining\r\nhave retarded the ocean export business of Germany, in spite of the\r\nfostering care of the government. With the transfer of practically all\r\nits iron deposits and its important Lorraine potash deposits, as well\r\nas the ownership of its Saar coal mines, to France, and the possible\r\nloss of its Upper Silesian coal and zinc deposits to Poland, the\r\nbalance of commercial prosperity, as well, may be handed over.\r\n\r\nNo other countries except the United States, Canada, Australia and\r\nChina have reserves for extensive export trade. In _Canada_ the coals\r\nare mostly inland, and those near the coast, as on Vancouver Island and\r\nin Nova Scotia, are limited in quantity and difficult to mine, so that\r\nexport business is perforce restricted.\r\n\r\nOne change that seems likely is a rapid increase in output of coal\r\nin _China_. The resources are enormous, the reserves of the higher\r\nclasses of coal being surpassed by those of no country but the United\r\nStates. The ambitious and aggressive Japanese, with their strategic\r\nneighboring location, have given every indication that they will take\r\nadvantage of an opportunity to develop such a resource. It may be a\r\nquestion how soon Chinese coal will be developed, but great changes are\r\ninevitable when development begins. Some of the coal fields are so near\r\nthe coast and have coals of such good quality as to permit an extensive\r\ndevelopment of export business in the Orient.\r\n\r\n_Australia_, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, has coal\r\nresources that are considerable, in comparison with the needs of the\r\nsmall population. In New South Wales the coals are excellent and are\r\nadjacent or close to harbors, so that the coal is extensively supplied\r\nfor bunkerage and export trade to the South Pacific and has become a\r\nlarge factor in the ocean trade of that part of the world.\r\n\r\nA large factor in the coal trade of the Pacific Ocean is the carrying\r\nof coal as return cargo. This is also important in South American\r\ntrade. South Africa during the war sent considerable coal to the\r\nwestern Mediterranean, but its coal cannot be a large factor in ocean\r\ntrade in normal times.\r\n\r\nOf all the continents South America is the poorest in coal resources.\r\nThere is coal in _Brazil_ and _Chile_ and other South American\r\ncountries, but it is difficult to reach and the fields so far known\r\ndo not give promise of being able to take care of the needs of the\r\ncountries in which they occur. The total annual production of South\r\nAmerica is less than two million tons, mostly from Chile. It is\r\nprobable that for the next generation South America will continue to\r\nimport coal as it has in the past, to the extent of 15 million tons or\r\nmore per annum, although developments in Brazil are now promising for\r\nthat country’s future supply. For estimates of reserves, see Table 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Summary.=--By way of summary, it may be said that the United States\r\nleads the world in coal resources; moreover, its resources are most\r\nimmediately available, because of their shallow depth and general\r\nundisturbed (geologic) condition and their accessibility through\r\nrailway systems. This is particularly true in the Appalachian region,\r\nwhich contains by far the best coal, is the nearest to the coast, and\r\nhence is the most available for ocean trade. On the other hand, the\r\naverage haul to export points, as already noted, is far greater than\r\nthat of Great Britain and greater than that of Westphalia; but to\r\noffset this the coal has been and can be mined more cheaply than in\r\neither Westphalia or Great Britain. The resources of Upper Silesia are\r\nlarge, and the coal is easily mined, but the output will all be needed\r\nfor central Europe. As regards both quality and quantity, Pennsylvania\r\nanthracite is unique; nevertheless, the home needs will continue to\r\nbe a brake on extensive exports. United States steam and coking coals\r\navailable for shipment average a little poorer than the corresponding\r\ncoals of Great Britain, but are superior to the German coals.\r\n\r\nThe total resources of Great Britain, possible, actual, and probable,\r\nare only 190,000 million tons, as contrasted with 423,000 million tons\r\nin the old German Empire and 3,838,000 million tons in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Probable Future Production.=--The possible depletion of coal resources\r\nis of course important in considering the future, but it can be safely\r\nstated that in none of the principal fields now being mined are the\r\nresources so depleted that the output therefrom will be reduced for\r\nanother generation at least.\r\n\r\nOf the great coal-producing countries, Great Britain, with its\r\nincreasing rate of production, most nearly approaches the point of\r\nultimate depletion, but that point has been variously placed at one\r\nhundred to several hundred years in the future, much depending upon\r\nwhether with better methods of use the output will continue to increase\r\nat the same rate as in the past. Meantime, certain areas in Great\r\nBritain with shallower coal beds will be depleted much sooner and the\r\nremaining coal will become more and more difficult to get, because of\r\nthe increasing depth of mining, which in turn will cause a continually\r\nincreasing cost.\r\n\r\nAlthough the exhaustion of coal is a distant prospect, there are clear\r\nsigns of the approaching exhaustion of certain grades of coal. It has\r\nbeen estimated that the output of American anthracite will seriously\r\ndecline in 60 to 100 years. Probably this will result in a change in\r\npractice, the use of coke, and other methods of house heating. If the\r\nrate of production continues to increase, high-grade American steam\r\ncoal, New River and similar grades, will probably be exhausted in a\r\nlittle over 150 years. American coking coal of the best Connellsville\r\nquality is of equally short duration. British coal of similar high\r\ngrade may last longer than American, as the production rate is less\r\nrapid, even though the total American coal should last much longer than\r\nthe British.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nIn several countries state ownership of coal mines is established;\r\nas, for example, in parts of Prussia, Australia, Chile and Bulgaria.\r\nIn others the undeveloped coal lands are still largely owned by the\r\ngovernment, as in Alaska and the western United States. In some\r\ncountries the government retains control of all mineral rights, simply\r\nleasing the property and granting a mining concession. Many governments\r\nhave a department or administration of mines. In every country, of\r\ncourse, in an emergency, the sovereign state would exercise control of\r\ncoal resources as fully as was necessary. Where the state owns mines,\r\nand favors organization, as in Germany, the more drastic regulation of\r\nwar time is easily effected. It is quite possible that coal may in time\r\nbe generally considered a public utility.\r\n\r\nIn England a movement toward nationalization of mines, with miners as\r\nwell as the government having a hand in the control, seems to be making\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nEngland’s colonies excel all others in extent of coal resources.\r\nThere is coal in Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa,\r\nRhodesia, Newfoundland, South Nigeria and British North Borneo--the\r\ntotal being many times greater than that in the British Isles. The\r\ncolonies and possessions of France, Denmark, Portugal, United States\r\nand Japan have relatively small amounts of coal.\r\n\r\nCoal resources, along with other raw materials, have been influenced by\r\nsome trade treaties. However, no permanent advantage in commerce has\r\nbeen secured to any nation by a trade treaty. Nearly all such treaties\r\nare made for short periods and renewed. If not satisfactory to one\r\nparty they are soon corrected. Various informal or tacit agreements\r\nmight be mentioned. When shipping was scarce during the war, England\r\nand the United States divided the coal business of South America\r\naccording to the requirements of ship economy. Germany made agreements\r\nto send coal to Austria-Hungary and Switzerland during the period of\r\nthe war. England had agreements with France, Spain, Portugal and Italy,\r\nthese agreements changing with conditions, about supplies of English\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nAlthough the ownership of mines in most countries is nominally open to\r\ncitizens and aliens alike, exceptions and restrictions tend to keep\r\nthe control in the hands of citizens. For example, it is impossible\r\nfor foreigners to control any mining company in Japan. Concessions\r\nin Holland and the Dutch colonies are limited to Dutch subjects and\r\nin Bolivia to Bolivian citizens. The legislation suggested since the\r\noutbreak of the World War may develop a similar condition in the\r\npossessions of Great Britain and those of her allies.\r\n\r\nIn peace the relations of two countries may be largely determined by\r\nthe ownership of property; owners of property in a foreign country may\r\nstrongly influence the policy of the two governments toward each other.\r\nIn emergencies, the political and the commercial control are put to the\r\ntest, and there results either a deadlock or the victory of one over\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nAn important commercial relation exercising political influence is\r\nthe incorporation of companies under the laws of different countries.\r\nMining companies in China, like the Kailan Mining Administration,\r\norganize at Hong Kong to obtain British protection and are thus subject\r\nto British control, in spite of the fact that Belgian money finances\r\nthe company. Some companies organized in Japan may also own Chinese\r\ncoal mines.\r\n\r\nAs relatively few regions of the world have coal in excess of their\r\nown needs, the larger number are dependent on imports. If a country\r\nwith coal controls also steamship lines, it may completely control the\r\ncoal situation in the importing country. England, with about half the\r\ntotal world’s shipping and a good supply of seaport coal, has been in a\r\nposition to dominate coal exports, even to handling the excess American\r\ncoal. During the last three or four years the scarcity of shipping\r\nhas given increased importance to American and Japanese shipping, but\r\nthe English still exert a strong influence. Their docks and storage\r\nfacilities are the best, and their ships are still numerous.\r\n\r\nRailroad shipping rights over the National Lines in _Mexico_ give a\r\ncertain amount of control over the coal industry. The National Lines\r\nare state owned and have a special agreement giving trackage rights to\r\ntwo companies, the American Smelting and Refining Co., and the Peñoles\r\nCompany, of German ownership. Since the Mexican railway service has\r\nbeen disturbed, the German company has been operating with cars and\r\nengines of its own. It has many coke ovens and large coal reserves,\r\nand has been the chief competitor of the American company in Mexican\r\nmetallurgy.\r\n\r\nNo patent is likely to limit coal industries, except as regards the\r\nby-products of coke. Before the war, coal-tar products were largely\r\ndeveloped by Germans, who patented their processes in many countries,\r\nbut offered no such protection to foreign inventions by patents in\r\nGermany. They limited production chiefly to their German plants, and\r\nexported about $50,000,000 worth a year.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, these patents in the United States were taken over by\r\nthe Alien Property Custodian, and the American industries that sprung\r\nup in consequence may be permanently protected. Other allied countries\r\ntook the same steps to free themselves from German control, which has\r\nretarded the development of the by-product coke industry in non-German\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIn _Germany_ the large mining companies generally own the coal rights.\r\nThe only government that has mined coal on a commercial scale and\r\nfor commercial purposes is Germany, and even there the government\r\nproduction covered only a small part of the total output of the German\r\nEmpire. Mines of the Saar coal field and a group of mines in the Upper\r\nSilesian field owned by the Prussian government have been the only\r\nextensive state-operated mines of the world, and now, under the terms\r\nof the Treaty of Peace, the ownership of the Saar mines will pass to\r\nFrance. (The details are given on p. 39).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the government exercised a quiet but real control\r\nover the whole German coal industry. Through its ownership of the\r\nKoenigen Louise mines it acted as a member of the Upper Silesian coal\r\nsyndicate. Formerly, through its ownership of the Saar mines, it was\r\nalso a member of the Westphalian coal syndicate, but whether a member\r\nor not it practically approved the syndicate operations and the fixing\r\nof prices in advance; also, it co-operated with the syndicate in\r\nhauling the latter’s coal over state-owned railway systems. In certain\r\nundeveloped coal fields in Germany, the northern extension of the\r\nWestphalian field, the Prussian government retains most of the coal\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThe Rhenish Westphalian coal syndicate is a classic example of a great\r\ninterlocking trade combination. Capitalized at $571,000, it covered an\r\nenormous capitalization of individual members. The mines have votes in\r\nproportion to production, which in turn is limited for certain periods.\r\nPrices are fixed and coal is marketed for the syndicate as a unit, but\r\nother affairs are left to the companies. The syndicate as a whole is\r\na member of a transporting and exporting combine, and disposes of its\r\nproduct through a combine of coal dealers. The several minor combines\r\ninterlock and are practically merged in a larger organization, the\r\nKohlen Kontor. Thus the combination had exceptional power to study\r\nthe various problems of the industry, and became very powerful. It\r\nmaintains a research department and an explosion testing gallery near\r\nDortmund. In several countries German companies through the control of\r\nadvertising contracts have been able to influence the editorial policy\r\nof the leading newspapers, even during the war. Over half of the German\r\ncoal mined before and during the war was syndicate coal. All of the\r\n600 other German cartels have not been as moderate in their action and\r\nregulations as the coal syndicate. When the coal syndicate, however,\r\nat one time, found it could not supply its German market with coal, it\r\nis reported to have bought inferior British coal for its customers,\r\nso that they would not themselves get good British coal and refuse to\r\nreturn to the German supply.\r\n\r\nEfforts were made by the cartel to absorb and control foreign coal\r\ntrade, where political and financial reasons served to render this\r\nadvisable, and therefore these efforts were out of all proportion to\r\nthe intrinsic value of the trade. When it was planned to capture such\r\na trade, the German-invented “dumping” system was used, coal being\r\nsold cheaper abroad than it could be sold or produced at home, the\r\ndifference being met by export bonuses. This German dumping became so\r\nserious in some countries, as Canada, New Zealand and South Africa,\r\nthat special import duties were imposed to counteract it. When\r\ndesirable, the syndicate purchased collieries abroad, including even a\r\nSouth Yorkshire plant in England, the Heraclea collieries, in Turkey,\r\nand many mines in Australia.\r\n\r\nIn _Great Britain_ is a powerful coal combine, the Cambria, closely\r\nallied with great shipping concerns. An important trade asset in this\r\norganization, like that in the German cartel, is a banking connection\r\nby which the combine can offer long-term credit.\r\n\r\nCoal syndicates are mentioned in Belgium. Some sort of central\r\norganization interested in coal is known in Italy, Russia,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Sweden, Greece, Argentina, Chile, and Ecuador.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SITUATION IN FRANCE, ENGLAND, AND THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n_France_ has a modified form of ownership of coal resources: this was\r\nvested formerly in the Crown and now in the Republic. The government\r\ngives concessions for mining the mineral and charges a royalty. The\r\nmineral is not considered to be owned by the surface owner or by\r\nthe original surface owner, as is the case in all other important\r\ncountries. The concessions granted are liberal and for large areas.\r\nThe royalty or rental is small and is now paid on the basis of so much\r\nper superficial unit of area (hectare) in the concession, but the\r\nchief returns received by the public are through a percentage of the\r\nnet earnings, that is, earnings available for dividends. Under the\r\nconditions prevailing in France the system seems eminently fair, and\r\nthe undertakings have been profitable both to the operators and to the\r\ncountry. The books of the company are open to inspection by government\r\nofficials, and the annual reports are published in detail. The system\r\nvirtually makes the government a partner in the business.\r\n\r\nIn _Great Britain_ most of the coal ownership is vested in entailed\r\nestates, and the royalties are a shilling a ton and upwards.\r\n\r\nBoth private and government ownership exist in the _United States_.\r\nThroughout the greater part of the country the large operating\r\ncompanies own the coal rights, although in the anthracite district of\r\nPennsylvania the fortunate owners of the surface, or their assigns,\r\nreceive large royalties, 25 to 50 cents a ton. In the Middle West most\r\nof the operators have bought the coal rights from the surface owners.\r\nWhen leased, the royalty is relatively small, 2 to 6¹⁄₄ cents a ton.\r\nOperators in the Rocky Mountains generally own the coal they mine.\r\nThe government has sold the coal rights, but the state school lands\r\nof Colorado and Wyoming have generally been leased at royalties of\r\nabout 10 cents a ton. In Oklahoma the Five Civilized Tribes have until\r\nrecently, under government control, leased their lands and coal rights\r\nat about 10 cents per ton, but these rights are now being sold.\r\n\r\nIn the State of Washington a considerable amount of the bituminous coal\r\ndistrict now opened is owned by the Northern Pacific Railway, which\r\nsecured these lands as grants when the railroad was constructed. The\r\nroyalty is about 15 to 25 cents a ton.\r\n\r\nIn Alaska in the Matanuska and Bering River bituminous fields, and\r\nin the Nenana lignite field, the government has offered the coal\r\nfor leasing purposes at 2 cents a ton for the first period, under\r\nrestrictions providing for conservation of coal and reasonable prices\r\nto consumers. Some units have been taken up in the Matanuska and Bering\r\nRiver fields, but, as the measures are badly contorted and the coal\r\nbeds difficult to trace, progress has been slow and production has\r\nscarcely begun. Temporarily, the Alaskan Railway Commission is working\r\nsome mines at Chickaloon and Eska Creek, to obtain a supply of coal\r\npending the development of other mines by lessees. Congress, in opening\r\nthe coal lands in the Matanuska and Bering River fields for leasing,\r\nhas reserved tracts of not exceeding 7,680 acres and 5,120 acres\r\nrespectively for the use of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe United States still owns large areas of coal and lignite lands in\r\nthe western states. Most of these lands are remote from railroads and\r\ndifficult of access, but they contain enormous reserves. At present,\r\noutside of Alaska, only one mine, the Gebo mine, Gebo, Wyoming, is\r\nleased by the government, but extension of a leasing system similar to\r\nthat of Alaska has been recently effected.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the anthracite industry is well organized, and its\r\nrailroad connections make it notably efficient and powerful. Bituminous\r\ncoal, on the other hand, is so widely distributed on both public and\r\nprivate lands that no private organization has attempted to control\r\nthe industry. Such control has always been opposed by Congress and the\r\ngeneral public.\r\n\r\nExcept during the war, neither Great Britain nor the United States has\r\nattempted any control over commercial mining and the sale of coal.\r\nEach country created a fuel administration, and the coal was shipped\r\nunder government instructions and paid for at prices fixed by the\r\nfuel administration. In the United States this government control has\r\npractically disappeared with the war, but in England the Coal Control\r\nhas so far been continued, and the tendency is for the government to\r\nretain for the present a strong guiding hand on the various “key”\r\nindustries. Certainly, in the final analysis, coal mining is a public\r\nutility and should be supervised and adjusted by the government\r\naccordingly, allowing free latitude for private initiative.\r\n\r\nOf the important coal-producing countries, only the German Empire,\r\nmore or less openly, has fostered in peace times the coal industry and\r\nto some extent controlled it. In France there was only an indirect\r\ncontrol, through the control by the government of the concessions and\r\ntaxation of revenues and through tacit knowledge of the operations\r\nof the French coal syndicate, which ostensibly at least obtains and\r\ndisseminates information and conducts mine safety investigations. In\r\nthe United States, Great Britain, and other countries free competition\r\nhas been permitted. Free competition does not seem serious in countries\r\nlike France, where the supply of coal is limited, but it has had more\r\nor less serious financial effects where the supply of coal has been\r\nvery large. In Germany before the formation of the syndicates the coal\r\nmining industry had periods of overproduction and serious financial\r\ndepression; and at other, rarer, periods there was great prosperity.\r\nIn Great Britain there have been similar times of depression and\r\nprosperity, but generally the business has been profitable.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, except in the anthracite district, where for\r\nmore than twenty years the operations have been in the hands of\r\ncomparatively few companies, depression and prosperity have alternated\r\nrapidly. The statistics obtained by the census show that the average\r\nprofits of the bituminous industry prior to 1917 were smaller than\r\nthose of any other great industry, and this has had an unfortunate\r\neffect on the best development of the coal resources. The companies\r\ngenerally have had little or no surplus to develop properly in the\r\nlean years; hence they have mined only the best or thickest coal, and\r\nin short periods of great prosperity many mines not directly owned by\r\nthe railroads and steel companies have been worked so as to lead to\r\n“squeezes” and great loss of coal. Moreover, these conditions have\r\nalso been unfortunate for labor; in times of prosperity too many new\r\nmines were opened, because of the tremendous and easily accessible\r\nresources, and in times of depression the number of days the miners\r\nworked has been so reduced that their monthly or yearly earnings have\r\nbeen low enough to make their living a hard one. The average number of\r\ndays worked per year from 1901 to 1915 was 213. Some system of limited\r\ncontrol of trade combinations by the government would appear to be\r\nhighly advantageous for both the operators and the miners, and should\r\ninsure a steady supply of coal to the consumers and steady prices with\r\nreasonable profits.\r\n\r\nAs regards trade relations between the United States and other\r\ncountries concerning fuel supplies, except for a possible agreement on\r\nnon-subsidy of the coal-carrying shipping, any attempt at a general\r\nagreement on so vital a necessity as coal seems unwise, except for\r\nnon-duplication of elaborate coal storage and rehandling plants in\r\nports requiring small tonnages, and preventing ruinous competition\r\nby systematic “dumping” of surplus coal to drive a competitor out of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nOf all the continents, South America has the smallest coal resources.\r\nAlthough there is coal in _Brazil_ and _Chile_ and other South American\r\ncountries, it is difficult to reach, and the fields so far known do not\r\ngive promise of being able to take care of the needs of the countries\r\nin which they occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Coal Situation as Affected by the War.=--Immediately after the\r\nopening of the war in Europe, July 31, 1914, the German military forces\r\nattacked and advanced in the east through Russian Poland, promptly\r\nsecuring the important Dombrova field, which is an extension of the\r\nUpper Silesian coal fields. The German forces also advanced in the west\r\nthrough the Belgian coal fields and thence through the extension of\r\nthese fields in northern France, at the same time seizing the important\r\nBriey iron-ore deposits north of Verdun.\r\n\r\nThe economic effect of these advances was of enormous importance in\r\nsecuring all the productive coal mines of Belgium, the most productive\r\ncoal mines of Russia, and most of the coal fields of northern France.\r\nThe French coal and iron mines seized produced one-half of the coal\r\noutput of France (20 million tons out of 40 million tons), and 95 per\r\ncent. (20 million tons) of the output of iron ore. Necessarily under\r\nthese conditions France had to rely upon England and the United States\r\nto meet the military and economic need for iron, leaning chiefly upon\r\nGreat Britain for the necessary supply of coal. Great Britain during\r\nthe war continued to supply coal to Italy; also to Spain and other\r\nneutral nations.\r\n\r\nThe armistice ended Germany’s occupation of the coal fields of Belgium\r\nand northern France. On the other hand, the French took charge of the\r\nimportant Saar coal field, and the Allies occupied German territory\r\nreaching to the Rhine and beyond the Rhine at certain bridgeheads, this\r\noccupation including the supervision of the mines in the coal and brown\r\nlignite basins near Aix-la-Chapelle and Cologne and the western margin\r\nof the Westphalian basin on the left bank of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of peace gives to the French the important iron resources\r\nof former German Lorraine, which together with imports from French\r\nLorraine were the chief sources of iron ore for German iron works, and\r\nthe ownership of the Saar coal mines.\r\n\r\nThe terms under which the Saar mines are transferred, and the future\r\ngovernment of the district, are indicated in the following extracts\r\nfrom the treaty:\r\n\r\n“As compensation for the destruction of the coal mines in the north\r\nof France, and as part payment towards the total reparation due from\r\nGermany for the damages resulting from the war, Germany cedes to France\r\nin full and absolute possession, with exclusive rights of exploitation,\r\nunencumbered and free from all debts and charges of any kind, the coal\r\nmines situated in the Saar basin.”\r\n\r\nThis is exclusive of that part of the Saar basin in Lorraine which\r\nbelonged to France prior to 1870, and which now reverts to France with\r\nsome minor rectifications of boundary. The treaty further specifies,\r\n“all the deposits of coal situated within the Saar basin will become\r\nthe complete and absolute property of the French state. * * * The right\r\nof ownership of the French state will apply not only to the deposits\r\nwhich are free and for which concessions have not yet been granted, but\r\nalso to the deposits for which concessions have already been granted,\r\nwhoever may be the present proprietors, irrespective of whether they\r\nbelong to the Prussian state, to the Bavarian state, to other states or\r\nbodies, to companies or to individuals. * * * The value of the property\r\nthus ceded to the French state will be determined by the Reparation\r\nCommission. * * * This value shall be credited to Germany in part\r\npayment of the amount due for reparation. It will be for Germany to\r\nindemnify the proprietors or parties concerned, whoever they may be.”\r\n\r\nAs concerns the government of the territory of the Saar, at the\r\ntermination of a period of fifteen years, the population will be called\r\nupon to indicate their desires, and then, “The League of Nations\r\nshall decide on the sovereignty under which the territory is to be\r\nplaced, taking into account the wishes of the inhabitants as expressed\r\nby the voting.” In the meantime, the territory will be governed by\r\na commission of five members chosen by the Council of the League of\r\nNations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to turning over the ownership of the mines and minerals in\r\nthe Saar basin, Germany accords the following options for the delivery\r\nof coal to the undermentioned signatories of the present treaty:\r\n\r\n  “Germany undertakes to deliver to France seven million tons of coal\r\n  per year for ten years (it is understood that this is to provide fuel\r\n  for the Alsace Lorraine territory ceded back to France). In addition,\r\n  Germany undertakes to deliver to France annually for a period not\r\n  exceeding ten years, an amount of coal equal to the difference\r\n  between the annual production before the war of the coal mines of\r\n  the Nord and Pas de Calais, destroyed as a result of the war, and\r\n  the production of the mines of the same area during the years in\r\n  question; such delivery not to exceed twenty million tons in any one\r\n  year of the first five years, and eight million tons in any one year\r\n  of the succeeding five years. It is understood that due diligence\r\n  will be exercised in the restoration of the destroyed mines in the\r\n  Nord and the Pas de Calais.”\r\n\r\nBesides furnishing France with coal, “Germany undertakes to deliver\r\nto Belgium eight million tons of coal annually for ten years;” and\r\nto Italy from four and one-half to eight and one-half million tons\r\nannually; and also to Luxemburg, “a quantity of coal equal to the\r\npre-war annual consumption of German coal in Luxemburg.”\r\n\r\nThe prices to be paid for coal under these options shall be as follows:\r\n\r\n  “(_a_) For overland delivery, including delivery by barge, the German\r\n  pithead price to German nationals, plus the freight to French,\r\n  Belgian, Italian or Luxemburg frontiers, provided that the pithead\r\n  price does not exceed the pithead price of British coal for export.\r\n  In the case of Belgian bunker coal, the price shall not exceed the\r\n  Dutch bunker price. Railroad and barge tariffs shall not be higher\r\n  than the lowest similar rates paid in Germany.\r\n\r\n  “(_b_) For sea delivery, the German export price f.o.b. German ports,\r\n  or the British export price f.o.b. British ports, whichever may be\r\n  lower.\r\n\r\n  “The allied and associated governments interested may demand the\r\n  delivery, in place of coal, of metallurgical coke in the proportion\r\n  of 3 tons of coke to 4 tons of coal.”\r\n\r\nGermany undertakes to deliver to France during each of the three years\r\nfollowing the coming into force of this treaty,\r\n\r\n  Benzol               35,000 tons\r\n  Coal tar             50,000 tons\r\n  Sulphate of ammonia  30,000 tons\r\n\r\nThe price paid for coke and for the articles referred to shall be the\r\nsame as the price paid by German nationals under the same conditions of\r\nshipment.\r\n\r\nThe ownership of the Saar mines is a most welcome addition to the coal\r\nresources of France; and the Saar basin, as it is capable of further\r\ndevelopment, may in the future make France more nearly self-sustaining\r\nas regards coal production.\r\n\r\nThe requirement of furnishing coal to France during the rehabilitation\r\nof the French mines wrecked by the Germans is a most equitable\r\narrangement. Germany at first, owing to the drop in the output of the\r\nWestphalian fields, claimed not to be able to furnish coal, but this\r\nsituation will no doubt right itself in time, especially as France\r\nholds the whip hand through control of the iron ores necessary for the\r\ngreat iron and steel plants of the Rhine district. In the meantime it\r\nis hoped Great Britain, with the assistance of the United States, will\r\nbe able to supply the deficiency in the coal requirements.\r\n\r\nThe problems connected with the Russian coal fields are complicated,\r\nbut at least the Dombrova coal field would seem to be in the hands of\r\nthe new Poland, and this carries coal resources estimated at 2,525\r\nmillion tons, with an output before the war probably exceeding 7\r\nmillion metric tons per annum.\r\n\r\nAccording to the terms of the peace treaty, a plebiscite will determine\r\nthe political control of the Upper Silesian coal fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Probable Changes in Coal Trade.=--In the ocean coal trade of the world\r\nthe greatest change likely is that the United States will more largely\r\nsupply South America, its coal being substituted for that of Great\r\nBritain. The ocean distance is markedly in favor of the United States,\r\nparticularly on the west coast of South America by vessels passing\r\nthrough the Canal. With the increased shipping facilities of the United\r\nStates, there is every reason to believe exports of coal to South\r\nAmerica will be equally shared between the United States and Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, it is evident that the British coal-mining\r\nindustry is in a bad way, and publicists are expressing serious alarm\r\nat the possible loss of the greater part of the export trade and the\r\ncurtailment of home industries through a great decrease in production\r\naccompanied by a rapid increase in cost.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 Great Britain produced 287,000,000 long tons, and exported\r\n77,000,000 long tons of coal. During the war, owing to the large\r\nnumber of miners entering the military service, the output greatly\r\ndeclined, but was expected to recover rapidly with the signing of the\r\narmistice and the return of the miners. But labor unrest, resulting in\r\nstrikes and absenteeism, kept the output down, and on July 16, 1919,\r\nthe so-called Sankey award went into effect. This award shortened\r\nthe miners’ working day from eight to seven hours, exclusive of the\r\ntime taken in hoisting and lowering, but inclusive of the time taken\r\nin reaching the working place. Rates were raised so that the miner\r\nreceived more in a day with the seven-hour day than formerly with\r\nthe eight-hour day, and the Controller raised the price of coal six\r\nshillings a ton to offset the increased cost.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Redland, chief inspector of mines, predicted that the\r\noutput for 1919 would be 230,000,000 tons, and for 1920, 217,000,000\r\ntons, or a reduction of 70,000,000 tons from the output of 1913.\r\nPresumably, in the course of time, by using additional shifts, Great\r\nBritain may recover its former output, though manifestly at greatly\r\nincreased cost; so that unless the cost in the United States goes up\r\ncorrespondingly, there is every probability that this country will be\r\nable to compete successfully in export business, not only in South\r\nAmerica, but also in Mediterranean ports.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, demands for coal are reaching the United States\r\nnot only from those parts of the world, but also from Scandinavia,\r\nSwitzerland, Denmark, and The Netherlands. On account of nearness,\r\nhowever, Great Britain should be able to take care of the fuel\r\nrequirements of northern Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific, it is not probable that either the State of Washington\r\nor the Territory of Alaska will produce coal in such quantity and at\r\nsuch a price that the output can be a general factor in the Pacific\r\nCoast trade. The demands of Alaska, Washington, and adjoining states\r\nwill absorb the local production; and California will continue to\r\nimport in ballast more or less coal from Vancouver Island, British\r\nColumbia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe immediate changes in Asia are more likely to be in the development\r\nof mines in the interior of China and in India to supply domestic\r\nneeds rather than extensive exports, although, as before stated, it is\r\npossible that China will gradually get into the Pacific Coast markets.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF LEADING COMMERCIAL NATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--The United States has the best coal reserve of\r\nany country--about 3,527,000 million out of a total world reserve\r\nof 7,900,000 million tons--and good reserves of each of the several\r\nclasses of coal. For many years there will be no danger of a shortage\r\nexcept for anthracite, good coking coal and the highest grades of steam\r\ncoal, which are now actively mined. About 600,000,000 tons a year, or\r\nnearly 40 per cent. of the annual output of the world, is mined in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the reserves and production, the exports in 1913 were\r\nonly about 12 per cent. of the exports of coal from all countries;\r\nand a large part of the American exports goes to Canada by rail. Of\r\nsea-borne coal, the United States sent out only 4 per cent. This\r\nsmall proportion of international trade is due to the distance of our\r\ncoal from seaports, the lack of organization and related shipping\r\norganizations; and, further, to the relative independence of the United\r\nStates, which, from most countries, requires only a small amount of\r\nimport as a return cargo for coal-carrying ships. We use our coal at\r\nhome, but the advantage of exporting a considerable quantity of coal\r\nfor its effects on increasing trade relationships with other countries\r\nis now becoming evident.\r\n\r\nCorrelated with the large supply and small export of coal is the\r\nremarkable development of home industries using our own coal. From the\r\ncurves of production (shown in Figure 3) it seems that within a century\r\nthe United States will surpass all Europe in coal production. As our\r\nindustries have kept pace with coal production, our consumption of coal\r\nis indicated roughly by the production curve. Hence it seems that the\r\nUnited States is likely to be a center of manufacturing and wealth; and\r\nwith this will come an equally certain continual increase in population\r\nand power.\r\n\r\nThe second great world supply of coal is likely to be that of China.\r\nTo be sure, European production is large, but it will be divided among\r\nseveral powers. The main part of the world’s power and industry for\r\nthe next century is so definitely located by the coal deposits (and\r\nby associated iron in most cases) that the part the United States\r\nshould take in the world’s program is clear. Every precaution should be\r\nobserved to have the Chinese resources controlled by powers that will\r\nnot abuse them to make the world “unsafe for democracy.”\r\n\r\nThe war opened several foreign markets, especially in South America, to\r\nUnited States coal. Some of these markets may be permanent, but Welsh\r\ncoal is still likely to dominate sea-borne trade. The United States\r\nhas coaling stations as far away as Manila and the Samoan Islands, but\r\nlittle coal reaches them from this country. American coal supplies our\r\ngovernment coaling stations in Alaska; Hawaii; our home ports, both\r\nAtlantic and Pacific; Cuba; Porto Rico; Nicaraguan ports; Panama Canal\r\nports; Mazatlan, Mexico; and some South American ports. No attempt\r\nseems to have been made to establish strategic ports around the world,\r\nsuch as may be needed if the present increase in American shipping is\r\nto be maintained under the American flag.\r\n\r\nNo foreign control has been influential in mining or handling coal\r\nin the United States. The ownership of coal mines by aliens has been\r\npossible, but apparently has not become important.\r\n\r\nAmerican coal resources are so great that no single organization,\r\nforeign or domestic, has been able to dominate the situation. The\r\nlack of a strong trade combination made it possible (in 1916) for\r\na combination of British shippers to fix the price of bunker coal\r\nin Atlantic ports, so that the mines got even less for it than for\r\nindustrial coal. This was the result of competitive bids, and the lack\r\nof organization here, but it is expected that organization will develop\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nSince the war began the development of industries based on coal tar has\r\nbeen remarkable. There are signs, however, of an unhealthy competition\r\nin this country, and the government should be careful that internal\r\nsquabbles do not open the door for German control again.\r\n\r\n\r\n=England.=--The British Isles have only one-fortieth of the total\r\nworld’s supply of coal, but this is of better than average quality.\r\nHigh-grade steam coal is abundant and there is a fair supply of coking\r\ncoal. The annual production, 300 million tons, is about one-fifth the\r\nworld’s production, and is second only to that of the United States.\r\nEngland before the war exported about one-fourth of the production,\r\noverseas exports from England being six times as much as from any other\r\ncountry in the world. Coal has constituted about three-fourths of all\r\nEnglish exports. The coal mines are near seaports, and ocean freight\r\nrates are low, because the demand for imports gives return cargoes to\r\nEngland from all parts of the world. There are large supplies of coal\r\nalso in the colonies, especially India, Australia and South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe coal business and shipping of Great Britain grew up together. About\r\none-fourth of the coal shipped goes for bunkering. In 1916 England\r\nowned 40 per cent. of the world’s shipping and exported nearly 70 per\r\ncent. of the world’s sea-borne coal. The maintenance of the shipping\r\nrequires bunkering ports all around the world. Coal from Wales and\r\nBritish colonies was sufficient to supply them all, and they constitute\r\nby far the most strategic system that any country possesses.\r\n\r\nEngland, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta, Suez, Port Said, Aden, Maskat,\r\nColombo, Singapore, Bombay, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Fiji Islands,\r\nVancouver, Valparaiso, St. Lucia, Jamaica, Halifax, Newfoundland, St.\r\nHelena, Bermuda, Cape Town and Durban, and others encircle the globe.\r\nFrance, Japan, Holland and the United States have each a few stations,\r\nbut no such comprehensive system. The German proposals of terms of\r\npeace (during the war) recognized the importance of these stations by\r\nspecifying that England should give up Aden, Malta and similar ports.\r\n\r\nTrade arrangements between Great Britain and other countries have been\r\nsuch as to grant “most favored nation” treatment to both parties, even\r\nwith Germany, where no formal treaty was in force. The free-trade\r\npolicy of England is well established, and on that basis England’s\r\ncommercial growth has been very great. Studies since the war began\r\nshow that Germany took advantage of the freedom in British countries\r\nand the protection at home. For example, German capital controlled\r\nsome collieries in South Yorkshire, through Mr. Stinnes, one of the\r\nlargest components of the German Kohlen Kontor. This organization had\r\nbranches in Newcastle, Cardiff, Glasgow, Hull, and many foreign ports.\r\nThe French also had purchased an English colliery before the war, the\r\nStonehall colliery, at Lydden, near Dover.\r\n\r\nThe Australian colonies and probably others found that German\r\nfinanciers owned and controlled most of the mines when war broke out.\r\nIt took some time to destroy this influence. Early in the war, British\r\nsentiment seemed to call for action against all such German commercial\r\naggression, and at an Allied Economic Conference at Paris in June,\r\n1916, plans were suggested for protection by tariff and exclusion of\r\nalien ownership in allied countries. More recently it seems that the\r\nBritish plan is to keep British certain key industries at all hazards\r\nand at any expense, but not to abandon free trade or in any way\r\ndecrease the amount of trading done.\r\n\r\nCommercial control of the Welsh steam-coal export trade is largely\r\nin the hands of the Cambria Coal Combine, but in the trade there are\r\nseveral other large combinations. The anthracite industry of England is\r\nnot as well organized as that of America.\r\n\r\nCommercial control of coal exported from Wales is largely in the hands\r\nof the large combinations of British shippers, in agreement with the\r\nCambria. Even when the war interfered with shipping, it is estimated\r\nthat two-thirds of the South American coal trade was in British control.\r\n\r\nMany instances of British financial control of coal in countries other\r\nthan British colonies have not been noted. British capital is invested\r\nin a few mines in Siberia and there are extensive holdings in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany.=--The reserves of coal in Germany before the war were greater\r\nthan those in England, counting possible reserves, and of fair quality.\r\nGermany formerly controlled 70 per cent. of the coal on the Continent.\r\nAustrian coal was controlled, and the coal of Spitzbergen has been\r\nclaimed, though now in British and Norwegian control.\r\n\r\nAlthough the most important deposits of coking coal of the Continent\r\nare in Westphalia, those of Belgium and northern France are very\r\nimportant to a general control of the coal situation. It cannot be\r\nassumed that these important coal fields were seized by the Germans\r\nfor other reasons, or that the Germans included coal and iron by\r\naccident. In 1911 the Rhenish Westphalian _Zeitung_ advised that French\r\nLorraine and Luxemburg should be dominated as thoroughly as Westphalia\r\nwas. In 1915 the six greatest associations of business men in Germany\r\npetitioned the Chancellor to consider the control of the coal (and\r\niron) of northern France as a military as well as economic necessity.\r\n\r\nThe annual production of coal in Germany before the war was about\r\none-fifth of the world’s total output, closely approaching the\r\nproduction of Great Britain. In the first years of the war the coal\r\noutput declined somewhat. In coal exports, Germany has been second only\r\nto the British Isles, but no country exports by sea one-sixth as much\r\nas Great Britain. Before the war Germany had established some fourteen\r\n“Kohlen depots” abroad and had a large amount of shipping. These\r\nbunkering ports were taken by the Allies.\r\n\r\nAn example of German industrial penetration is furnished by the case\r\nof Kiau Chau, China. In 1899 the Shantung Eisenbahn Gesellschaft was\r\nformed in Berlin with headquarters at Tsingtao. It acquired exclusive\r\nrights for 5 years to search for minerals in a zone 10 miles each\r\nside of the railway and to acquire claims. Chinese mines were not to\r\nbe allowed to adopt modern methods and compete, unless they bought\r\nGerman material and employed German men. The mines that were developed\r\nproduced good steamship coal and good enough coke, so that a blast\r\nfurnace was planned. The Germans lost their control when war broke out,\r\nand these rights have passed, under the terms of the peace treaty, to\r\nJapan. German capital that had been invested some years ago in the\r\nChung Hsing Coal Co. was bought out in 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n=France.=--Before the war France was fifth in the list of world’s coal\r\nproducers, but for many years needed more coal than she produced.\r\nPossibly enough coal could have been mined in France by greater\r\ndevelopments, but to import it was cheaper. French capital was invested\r\nin some foreign coal deposits. A company of French control owned the\r\nStonehall colliery, near Dover. Before the war a French company was\r\none of the largest operators in Turkey and was steadily acquiring new\r\nmines. A French company owned an important colliery in the Dombrova\r\nfield, now part of Poland.\r\n\r\nFrance has maintained government coaling stations for shipping in\r\nIndo-China, Tahiti, Society Islands, Martinique, and Madagascar; but\r\nno attempt is made to supply them wholly with French coal, or to be\r\nindependent of other coaling stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Italy.=--Italy has a poor supply of low-grade coal, and the normal\r\nproduction is insignificant. Imports have been large, those from Great\r\nBritain amounting in 1914 to 10,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Russia.=--Russia has several important coal fields. The production\r\nwas 31,000,000 tons in 1915 and 23,000,000 in 1916, so that Russia,\r\nincluding the province of Ukraine, has ranked fifth or sixth among the\r\nworld’s producers. If the demand for coal develops under the stimulus\r\nof industrial stability, the output will all be consumed in Russia.\r\nAbout two-thirds of the production has been raised in the Donetz basin.\r\nHalf of this is coking coal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Japan.=--Japan has on the main island, Hondo, enough coal to permit\r\nconsiderable exports. Supplies in Korea and Formosa are less abundant.\r\nIn all Japan’s coal there is very little of good coking quality.\r\n\r\nWhen the war reduced the amount of British shipping in the North\r\nPacific, Japanese ships supplied Japanese coal to a number of new\r\ncoaling stations, and the British may find it difficult to regain their\r\nformer prominence in bunkering there. Japanese coal now gets as far\r\nwest also as Colombo, Ceylon.\r\n\r\nJapanese law specifies Japanese control of the policy of mining\r\ncompanies, though some foreign financial interests are allowed. Japan\r\ncontrols a part of the coal produced in China, and by presenting\r\ninsistent demands is increasing her control in that country. If given a\r\nfree hand, Japan is in a position to exercise industrial and military\r\ncontrol in Asia almost as thoroughly as the United States can in\r\nAmerica. English and Belgian interests have some Chinese coal, and thus\r\nare about the only real competition at present with Japanese control.\r\n\r\n\r\n=China.=--Outside the United States, China has the largest coal\r\nreserves of any country in the world. The coal varies in quality and\r\ngrade; some of it is excellent, but the production has reached only\r\nabout 18,000,000 tons a year. Some districts export and others import\r\ncoal. The country could easily be independent if there were internal\r\nmeans of distribution. There might even be large exports if production\r\nbegan in advance of other industrial development. Coking coal is\r\navailable only in certain areas, mostly in the south.\r\n\r\nThe largest and best-equipped producer is the Kailan Mining\r\nAdministration, operating British and Chinese properties. The ownership\r\nof the company is mostly in Belgian hands, but the incorporation is\r\nunder Hong Kong law, so that the company is under British control.\r\n\r\nThe chief producers in China are:\r\n\r\nTABLE 6.--CHIEF PRODUCERS OF COAL IN CHINA\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------+-----------+----------------------------\r\n  Company                     |Tons a year|Control\r\n  ----------------------------+-----------+----------------------------\r\n  Kailan Mining Administration| 3,000,000 |British and Chinese\r\n  Funshun Collieries          | 2,000,000 |Owned by the South Manchuria\r\n                              |           |Railway Co.

The Chinese law designed to\r\nprevent foreign control of this sort is not effective. It requires that\r\nthe share of a mining industry held by foreigners shall not be over\r\none-half; but if a foreign company owns half the shares and finances\r\nthe Chinese half by a loan, the foreign control may be complete. There\r\nis a further control of mining, through the ownership of railways. All\r\nthe larger producers must ship coal by rail, and foreign nations are\r\nallowed to finance railways. The difficulty of a government exercising\r\nadequate political and commercial control when it grants concessions in\r\nthis way is evident.\r\n\r\nGeneral mining affairs in China are supervised by a Bureau of Mining\r\nAffairs. Any specific enterprise is controlled by a commissioner\r\nof finance in each province. It is questionable, however, whether\r\ngovernmental control will be strong enough to overbalance commercial\r\nand financial control, and diplomatic pressure from outside. Those\r\ncompanies incorporated under Hong Kong law can count on British\r\nprotection. Japanese demands on China have been very insistent, and\r\nit is said that about a third of the production of the country is now\r\ncontrolled by Japan.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, China seems to take a small part in the control of her own\r\ncoal. The opportunity for other powers to get financial, and, through\r\nthat, industrial favors may be involved in the problem of financing the\r\ncentral government.\r\n\r\nTABLE 7.--PRODUCTION, EXPORTS AND IMPORTS FOR 1913[8]\r\n\r\nMillions of metric tons\r\n\r\n  ---------+------------+----------+-------+-------+--------------------\r\n  Country  |Kind of coal|Production|Exports|Imports|Remarks (1919)\r\n  ---------+------------+----------+-------+-------+--------------------\r\n  United   |Anthracite  |    85    |  4.1  |  ...  |Resources greater\r\n  States   |Bituminous  |   432    | 18.0  |  1.4  |than those of any\r\n           |Coke        |    42    |  1.0  |  0.1  |other country; can\r\n           |Bunker coal |   ...    | (7.7) |  ...  |easily increase\r\n           |            |          |       |       |ocean exports with\r\n           |            |          |       |       |more shipping\r\n           |            |          |       |       |available.

The\r\nefforts of England during the war temporarily prostrated her, and\r\ndiminished the grip of her export coal and bunkering trade, but\r\nconditions late in 1919 indicated that recovery might be rapid. The\r\nimmediate growth in the mining of coal for use at home, with consequent\r\nprogress in steel and other industries, however, will be greatest in\r\nthe United States, because of our gigantic resources. In the East,\r\nhowever, are indications of a development of China’s coal and the\r\ngrowth of attendant industries on a scale which may in time outstrip\r\nthose of any country except America, and transfer the bulk of wealth\r\nand power to the two great civilizations, on either side of the\r\nPacific--the newest, that of America, and the oldest, that of China\r\nand Japan. The war and the settlements after the war proved an unmixed\r\nbenefit and opportunity to Japan, and enabled her so to strengthen\r\nherself in China and Korea that she is not only the preponderating\r\npower in the East, but may claim a sphere of influence and a wide\r\nprotectorate for Asia, far more effective than the American Monroe\r\nDoctrine.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to national internal economy and external and internal\r\neffectiveness, the United States will clearly neglect the main function\r\nof government if it fails to exercise an effective supervision and\r\nregulation of the coal industry. This industry is national; every\r\ncitizen has an interest in it, and a right to expect its administration\r\nfor the highest benefit of all.\r\n\r\nTABLE 9.--PRODUCTION AND IMPORTS OF FUEL OF SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN\r\n1913[10]\r\n\r\nMillions of metric tons\r\n\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+---------------------------------------\r\n  Country    |Production|Imports|Remarks (1919)\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+---------------------------------------\r\n  Argentina  |          |  4.0  |Argentina has no coal resources.\r\n             |          |       |Imports chiefly from Great Britain;\r\n             |          |       |Cardiff coal.\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+---------------------------------------\r\n  Brazil     |          |  2.2  |Brazil has coal, but it is inaccessible\r\n             |          |       |for transportation.\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+---------------------------------------\r\n  Chile      |   1.23   |  0.6  |Chile has some coal, but does not mine\r\n             |          |       |enough high-grade coal for its needs;\r\n             |          |       |has imported from Great Britain.\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+---------------------------------------\r\n  Colombia   |          |       |Colombia has some undeveloped coal\r\n             |          |       |resources; has imported a little coal\r\n             |          |       |from time to time from the United\r\n             |          |       |States.\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+---------------------------------------\r\n  Peru       |   0.28   |  0.02 |Peru has small coal resources and mines\r\n             |          |       |a little coal, practically enough for\r\n             |          |       |its needs.\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+---------------------------------------\r\n  Uruguay    |          |  0.8  |Uruguay has no coal resources and\r\n             |          |       |imported some in the past, chiefly from\r\n             |          |       |Great Britain.\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+---------------------------------------\r\n  Total South|          |       |\r\n  America    |   1.51   |  7.6  |\r\n  -----------+----------+-------+---------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  [10] Compiled by George S.

EDDINGFIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF IRON\r\n\r\nThe uses of iron ore are so well known that their enumeration is hardly\r\nnecessary. From iron ore are manufactured cast iron, wrought iron, and\r\nsteel. By the addition of one or more other elements, chiefly silicon,\r\ncarbon, chromium, nickel, manganese, vanadium, sulphur, and phosphorus,\r\nin quantities less than 5 per cent. and usually less than 1 per cent.,\r\nvarious qualities, such as hardness, toughness, elasticity, durability,\r\nbrittleness, density, porosity, endurance, resistance to oxidation or\r\ncorrosion, malleability, and fusibility, can be controlled and given to\r\nthe cast iron or steel in the desired degree.\r\n\r\nThe uses of the products of iron ore are so common that the finding of\r\nobjects which do not contain some of them is difficult. Besides being\r\nused as a metal, iron enters into the manufacture of paints (especially\r\nred, yellow, and blue), chemicals of various kinds, medicines, coloring\r\nmatter in glass and pottery, and in the form of specular hematite it is\r\nmade into jewelry. Considerable amounts of iron ore are also consumed\r\nannually for flux in the smelting of silver, copper, lead, and other\r\nmetalliferous ores.\r\n\r\nIron and its products are more widely used than any other metal; and\r\nthe yearly production of pig iron makes up 94 to 96 per cent. of the\r\ntotal amount of all the metals produced in the world, and in normal\r\ntimes averages about 80,000,000 tons annually.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nIron ores are associated with many different classes of\r\nrocks--sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic. Where associated with\r\nsedimentary rocks the ores may be the result of direct sedimentation or\r\nmay be later replacements of sedimentary beds by magmatic or meteoric\r\niron-bearing waters. Many iron-ore deposits associated with sedimentary\r\nrocks are formed by the enrichment of original iron-bearing beds,\r\neither by solution and transportation of iron compounds or by the\r\nremoval of other associated mineral constituents.\r\n\r\nAmong those important iron-ore deposits of sedimentary origin that have\r\nundergone little or no further enrichment since deposition, except\r\nperhaps directly at the surface, are the iron ores of the Clinton type\r\nof the eastern United States, the Wabana iron ores of Newfoundland, the\r\n“minette” ores of the Lorraine district in northern France, Luxemburg,\r\nand southern Germany, the oolitic siderite beds of the Cleveland\r\ndistrict in northern England, and the hematite ores of Minas Geraes in\r\nBrazil. The most important of the sedimentary iron ores that are the\r\nresult of further enrichment since deposition are those of the Lake\r\nSuperior district in the United States.\r\n\r\nIron ores associated with igneous rock are mostly of deep-seated\r\norigin, usually having been formed by solutions that accompanied or\r\nfollowed the intrusion of the rocks with which the ores are associated.\r\nThese ores are of two main classes: (1) Those associated with siliceous\r\nigneous rocks; and (2) those associated with basic igneous rocks.\r\nThe ores associated with siliceous igneous rocks consist either of\r\nhematite or, more commonly, magnetite. They occur in granite, syenite,\r\nand monzonite, and in gneiss derived from these by metamorphism. Many\r\nimportant ore deposits in different countries belong to this class,\r\namong them being the magnetite and hematite deposits of Swedish Lapland\r\nand of central Sweden, the magnetite bodies of the Adirondacks and\r\nnorthern New Jersey in the eastern United States, various magnetite\r\nand hematite bodies in California and elsewhere in the western United\r\nStates, the mixed hematite and magnetite deposits of the south coast\r\nof Cuba, most of the iron-ore bodies of Chile, and the newly developed\r\niron ores of Manchuria. As a class, the iron ores associated with\r\nsiliceous igneous rocks rank next in importance to iron ores of\r\nsedimentary origin.\r\n\r\nIron-ore deposits associated with basic igneous rocks are nearly all of\r\na distinct type known as titaniferous magnetites. These ores consist\r\nof a mixture of magnetite and ilmenite in varying proportions, and\r\ntherefore carry a variable amount of titanium. Many large ore deposits\r\nof this class are found in different parts of the world, among the\r\nlarger ones being certain ore bodies in Wyoming, in the Adirondack\r\nregion, and elsewhere in the United States, and several deposits in\r\nNorway and in northern and southern Sweden.\r\n\r\nAn important group of iron-ore deposits has resulted from mineral\r\nreplacement along the contact of sedimentary rocks with igneous\r\nintrusives. These ores usually occur in limestones not far from\r\nintrusive masses of granite, monzonite, syenite or diorite, but they\r\nmay be found within the igneous rocks themselves, near the contact.\r\nThey are rarely associated with the more basic igneous rocks. These\r\nores are known as igneous contact ores, and their origin is ascribed\r\nto iron-bearing solutions that accompanied or followed the intrusion\r\nof the igneous rocks with which the ores are associated. Such ores\r\nare extremely widespread, occurring in practically every continent.\r\nLocally, extensive deposits exist, as in the Cornwall district of\r\nPennsylvania, in the western United States and British Columbia, in\r\nChile, and in China and Japan. Igneous contact ores have furnished\r\nonly a relatively small percentage of the world’s total production of\r\niron ore, however.\r\n\r\nThere are also widespread replacement deposits in sedimentary rocks\r\nthat are not associated with igneous rocks. These are believed to be\r\nformed by ordinary meteoric waters which dissolve disseminated iron\r\nminerals from certain beds or masses of rock, and redeposit the mineral\r\nelsewhere in a more concentrated form. Such ore deposits may be roughly\r\ntabular and resemble bedded deposits, or they may be very irregular.\r\nMost deposits of this type consist of siderite which has replaced\r\nlimestone, but hematite and limonite deposits formed by replacement\r\nalso exist. Among the important deposits of this group are the siderite\r\nores of Bilbao, Spain, largely altered to limonite near the surface;\r\nthe siderite ore of Eisenerz, Styria; and the hematite deposits near\r\nHartville, Wyoming. Small deposits of siderite, hematite, and limonite\r\nof this type are found in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nBesides the classes of iron ores already mentioned, widely distributed\r\niron ores occur as residual products derived from the weathering of\r\neither igneous or sedimentary rocks. These ores have been formed by the\r\nconcentration of iron-bearing materials originally disseminated through\r\nthe rocks whose weathered products they now constitute. They are mainly\r\nin the form of limonite and occur either as large bodies of relatively\r\npure ore or as aggregates of irregular masses of various sizes imbedded\r\nin clays. To this class belong the brown iron ores associated with clay\r\nin the Appalachian region of the United States, the limonite ores of\r\nparts of Russia, and similar ores in Korea. In this class should also\r\nbe included the extensive limonite deposits derived from the weathering\r\nof serpentine which have recently been developed along the north coast\r\nof Cuba, as well as the lateritic iron-ore deposits found in many\r\ntropical countries. Limonite ores associated with clays have been\r\nsmelted since early ages, owing to their accessibility and the ease\r\nwith which they could be smelted by crude methods. They have, however,\r\nfurnished a decidedly minor percentage of the world’s production of\r\niron ore.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe iron ore consumed by the world has been obtained principally from\r\nthe four great iron-producing countries: United States, Germany, France\r\nand Great Britain.\r\n\r\nOther countries that yield important quantities of iron ore are, in\r\nthe order of their importance: Spain, Russia, Sweden, Luxemburg,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Cuba, Newfoundland, and Algeria. The normal annual\r\noutput in each one of these countries is more than one million tons.\r\nMinor amounts of iron ore are produced in many other countries.\r\n\r\nTABLE 11.--IRON-ORE OUTPUT OF

This district is, therefore, by far the most important\r\niron-ore district in the world, producing annually more than 30 per\r\ncent. of the world’s total of iron ore.\r\n\r\nGermany and France have been next in importance to the United States\r\nas iron ore-producing countries, about 80 per cent. of the ore mined\r\nin these two countries being obtained from the Lorraine iron fields\r\nsituated on the border. The annual output of these fields, which\r\nincludes also the ores of Luxemburg, has been about 25 per cent. of\r\nthe world’s production. The Lorraine district and the Lake Superior\r\ndistrict together, therefore, produce somewhat more than one-half of\r\nthe total iron ore annually mined in the world.\r\n\r\nThe iron ore produced in Great Britain is obtained mainly from the\r\nCleveland district of northern England, this district furnishing about\r\n40 per cent. of the British total, equivalent to about 2.6 per cent. of\r\nthe world’s annual production. In comparison, the Birmingham district\r\nof Alabama and the Krivoi-Rog district of southern Russia, which are\r\nnext in importance to the Lorraine and Lake Superior districts, furnish\r\nabout 3.5 per cent. and 3.2 per cent., respectively, of the world’s\r\nannual production.\r\n\r\nTABLE 13.--PRODUCTION AND MOVEMENT OF IRON ORE AND PRODUCTION OF PIG\r\nIRON, 1913[29]\r\n\r\nGross Tons\r\n\r\n  --------------+----------+----------+----------+-----------+----------\r\n                |Production|          |          | Apparent  |Production\r\n                |    of    | Iron ore | Iron ore |consumption|   of\r\n                | iron ore |  imports |  exports | (in part  | pig iron\r\n                |          |          |          |  stocks)  |\r\n  --------------+----------+----------+----------+-----------+----------\r\n  United Kingdom|15,997,328| 8,028,532|    21,223| 24,004,637|10,260,315\r\n  Canada        |   307,634| 2,110,828|   126,124|  2,292,338| 1,015,118\r\n  Belgium       |   149,450| 4,400,000|       ...|  4,549,450| 2,484,690\r\n  France        |19,160,407| 1,410,424|10,066,627| 10,504,264| 5,311,316\r\n  Italy         |   603,116|     7,666|    20,000|    590,772|   426,755\r\n  Russia        | 8,077,000|       ...|   565,000|  7,512,000| 4,557,000\r\n  Austria       | 3,039,324|   942,312|   106,071|  3,875,565| 1,757,864\r\n  Hungary       | 2,059,000|       ...|   700,000|  1,359,000|   623,000\r\n  Germany       |          |          |          |           |\r\n  (including    |          |          |          |           |\r\n  Luxemburg)    |35,941,285|14,019,045| 2,613,158| 47,347,172|19,291,920\r\n  Spain         | 9,861,668|       ...| 8,907,202|    954,466|   424,774\r\n  Sweden        | 7,475,571|       ...| 6,440,000|  1,035,571|   730,257\r\n  United States |61,980,437| 2,594,770|       ...| 64,575,207|30,966,152\r\n  Algeria       | 1,349,000|       ...| 1,350,000|           |\r\n  Chile         |    70,000|       ...|    65,000|           |\r\n  Cuba          | 1,500,000|       ...| 1,582,431|           |\r\n  Newfoundland  | 1,605,900|       ...| 1,605,920|           |\r\n  --------------+----------+----------+----------+-----------+----------\r\n\r\n  [29] Advisory Council, Dept. of Sci. and Indust.

The United States is the largest producer of iron\r\nore in the world, and annually yields more than two-fifths of the\r\nworld’s supply. More than 80 per cent. of the output comes from the\r\nLake Superior district and most of the remainder from Alabama, New\r\nYork, and Pennsylvania. In 1917 there were mined in the United States\r\n75,000,000 tons of iron ore, of which 63,000,000 came from the Lake\r\nSuperior region, 7,000,000 from Alabama, 1,000,000 from New York, and\r\nabout 500,000 each from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Tennessee, Virginia,\r\nand Wyoming; in 1918 the total production was 69,000,000 tons, of\r\nwhich 60,000,000 came from the Lake Superior district, 6,000,000 from\r\nAlabama, 900,000 from New York, 500,000 from Pennsylvania, and 400,000\r\neach from Tennessee, Virginia, New Jersey and Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the approximate reserves of iron ore in the\r\nprincipal districts of the United States:\r\n\r\nTABLE 14.--IRON-ORE RESERVES OF THE UNITED STATES IN GROSS TONS[30]\r\n\r\n                                                          Millions\r\n                                                          of tons.\r\n  Lake Superior District (hematite)                          3,500\r\n  Birmingham District (fossil hematite)                        355\r\n  Tennessee and Virginia (fossil hematite)                     100\r\n  Adirondack District (non-titaniferous magnetite)              40\r\n  Adirondack District (titaniferous magnetite)                  90\r\n  Northern New Jersey and Southeastern New York (magnetite)     15\r\n  Southeastern Pennsylvania (magnetite)                         40\r\n  Appalachian region (magnetite)                                50\r\n  Northeastern Texas (limonite)                                260\r\n  Western United States (magnetite and hematite)               100\r\n  Other Districts                                              150\r\n                                                             -----\r\n    Total                                                    4,700\r\n\r\n  [30] Kemp, J. F.: “The Iron-Ore Resources of the World,” Stockholm,\r\n  1910 (with minor revisions).\r\n\r\nThe greatest single iron and steel industry in the United States\r\nis that of the United States Steel Corporation, which controls the\r\nfollowing iron- and steel-producing companies: Carnegie Steel Co.,\r\nIllinois Steel Co., Indiana Steel Co., American Steel & Wire Co.,\r\nAmerican Sheet & Tinplate Co., National Tube Co., The National Tube Co.\r\nof Ohio, Minnesota Steel Co., The Lorain Steel Co., Tennessee Coal,\r\nIron & Railroad Co., and the Shelby Steel Tube Co., with a total of\r\n124 blast furnaces, having an annual capacity of about 18,000,000 tons\r\nof pig iron. Most of the blast furnaces are in Pennsylvania, Ohio,\r\nIllinois, and Alabama.\r\n\r\nWith the United States Steel Corporation is connected the Oliver Iron\r\nMining Co., which produces about 43 per cent. of the iron ore mined\r\nannually in the Lake Superior district, this being equivalent to nearly\r\n37 per cent. of all the iron ore mined annually in the United States.\r\nThe Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Co. is the chief producer of iron\r\nore in Alabama.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the United States Steel Corporation as a producer\r\nof iron and steel is the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, with its\r\nsubsidiaries, the Bethlehem Steel Co., Pennsylvania Steel Co., Maryland\r\nSteel Co., Jurugua Iron Co., Spanish-American Iron Co., and Bethlehem\r\nIron Mines Co.\r\n\r\nThe works of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation have a total pig\r\niron-producing capacity of 3,060,000 tons annually from 23 blast\r\nfurnaces. Seven of the furnaces are in South Bethlehem, Pa., seven in\r\nSteelton, Pa., four in Lebanon, Pa., three in Cornwall, Pa., and four\r\nin Sparrow’s Point, Md. The Bethlehem Steel Corporation owns large\r\niron-ore deposits in Cuba and Chile. Most of the ore consumed in its\r\nfurnaces at present comes from Cuba, from the Lake Superior district,\r\nand from Cornwall, Pa.\r\n\r\nThird in importance of the iron- and steel-producing companies of the\r\nUnited States is the recently organized Midvale Steel & Ordnance Co.,\r\ncontrolling Worth Brothers, Midvale Steel Co., Remington Arms Co.,\r\nCambria Steel Co., and others. The combined pig iron-producing capacity\r\nof the 14 blast furnaces controlled by the Midvale Steel & Ordnance\r\nCo. is 2,420,000 tons of pig iron. Three of the blast furnaces are at\r\nCoatesville, Pa., and eleven are at Johnstown, Pa. This company owns\r\nimportant iron-ore deposits in Cuba and in the Lake Superior district.\r\n\r\nFour other large companies produce more than a million tons of pig iron\r\nannually, these being the Republic Iron & Steel Co., with an estimated\r\ntotal capacity from its 11 blast furnaces in Ohio and Alabama of\r\n1,430,000 tons of pig iron, and of 2,500,000 tons of ore from its mines\r\nin the Lake Superior district and in Alabama; the Lackawanna Steel\r\nCo., with an annual capacity in 1918 from its nine blast furnaces at\r\nLackawanna, N. Y., of 1,440,000 tons of pig iron; the Jones & Laughlin\r\nCo., of Pittsburgh, with a capacity of 1,920,000 tons from 11 blast\r\nfurnaces; and the McKinney Steel Co., with eight furnaces in Ohio, New\r\nYork, and Pennsylvania, and an annual capacity of 1,205,000 tons of pig\r\niron. The last three companies named have extensive iron mines in the\r\nLake Superior district.\r\n\r\nImportant iron and steel companies producing somewhat less than a\r\nmillion tons of pig iron annually are: the Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.,\r\nwith an annual capacity of 990,000 tons of pig iron from six blast\r\nfurnaces, all of which are at Youngstown, Ohio; the recently organized\r\nSteel & Tube Co. of America, having six blast furnaces in and near\r\nChicago, with an annual pig-iron capacity of 900,000 tons; the Colorado\r\nFuel & Iron Co., an important western iron and steel producer, which\r\nhas six blast furnaces near Pueblo, Colo., with an annual capacity\r\nof 625,000 tons of pig iron, and has iron-ore mines in New Mexico,\r\nWyoming, and Colorado; and the Schloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Co. of\r\nAlabama, with seven blast furnaces and a pig-iron capacity of 530,000\r\ntons. Many other plants with smaller capacity are scattered through\r\neastern and central United States. So far as is known, practically the\r\nentire iron and steel business of the United States is in the hands of\r\nAmerican capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany.=--The “minette” ore of the German Lorraine district before\r\nthe war constituted by far the largest iron-ore reserve of Germany and\r\nis the chief source of present supply. Next in importance of the German\r\nore reserves are the brown hematites occurring north of the Harz, and\r\nthird and fourth in importance, respectively, are the deposits of the\r\nLahn and Dill districts in the Rhineland, and those of Siegerland. All\r\nof these districts are in western and southwestern Germany and all of\r\nthem, except Lorraine, are in the region lying east of the Rhine in\r\nHanover, Westphalia, Hesse-Nassau, and Rhenish Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe Lorraine district is on the French border and forms a part of the\r\nlarge ore field of Luxemburg and northern France. The deposits, of\r\nsedimentary origin and Jurassic age, comprise extensive beds of oolitic\r\nlimonite varying in thickness up to 20 feet, interlayered with marl and\r\nlimestone. Seven principal beds of ore are found within a thickness of\r\nsediments ranging from 75 to 150 feet, the most important being known\r\nas the Grey seam. The tonnage[31] of “minette” ore available in the\r\nGerman Lorraine district is estimated at 1,830 million[32] as compared\r\nwith 300 million in Luxemburg and 2,975 million[33] in northern France.\r\nThe “minette” ores average 30 to 40 per cent. in metallic iron content\r\nand 0.3 to 0.7 per cent. or more in phosphorus.\r\n\r\n  [31] The ore reserves in this chapter are given in metric tons unless\r\n  otherwise stated.\r\n\r\n  [32] EINECKE, G., and KOHLER, W.: “Iron-Ore Resources of the World,”\r\n  Stockholm, 1910.\r\n\r\n  [33] NICOU, L., idem.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of the Salzgitter and Ilsede districts north of the Harz\r\nMountains are beds of brown ironstone conglomerate with an average\r\nthickness of 20 to 30 feet, consisting of limonite pebbles in a clayey\r\nor calcareous cement. These deposits cover many square miles, the\r\nreserves being estimated at 248 million tons. The ores contain 30 to 40\r\nper cent. of iron and average 0.7 to 0.8 per cent. in phosphorus.\r\n\r\nThe ores of the Lahn and Dill region are mainly red hematites, that\r\nlie in an extensive sedimentary bed. They contain about 48 per cent.\r\nof iron, 0.2 to 0.3 per cent. phosphorus, and are high in silica. The\r\nreserves are estimated at about 135 million tons.\r\n\r\nIn Siegerland the iron ores are mainly carbonate, carrying 38 to 40 per\r\ncent. metallic iron and 6 to 9 per cent. manganese. They form irregular\r\ndeposits abundantly scattered through the region, the available\r\nreserves being estimated at about 100 million tons.\r\n\r\nThe total iron-ore reserves of Germany (not including those of\r\nLuxemburg) actually available have been estimated at 2,540 million\r\ntons, and the probable further reserves at 1,067 million tons. Of\r\nthese amounts, however, Lorraine has by far the largest part, so that\r\nthe transfer of this province to France reduces Germany’s available\r\nreserves to 28 per cent. of the pre-war figure, and her further\r\nprobable reserves to one-half, altogether reducing her iron-ore\r\nresources to one-third of the former amount.\r\n\r\nAs far as is known, the German iron and steel business is in the hands\r\nof German capitalists, who, besides, have important iron-ore holdings\r\nin France, Spain, Sweden, and elsewhere. Among the important iron-ore\r\nand pig-iron producing firms in Germany are Gutehoffnungshütte, de\r\nWendel & Co., Krupp, Gebrüder Stumm, Aschener Hütten Aktien Verein,\r\nRombacher Hüttenwerke, Thyssen & Cie., and others. All of these firms\r\nhad large ore reserves in the Lorraine district when the war began.\r\n\r\n\r\n=France.=--The iron ores of France are divided into three distinct\r\ngroups: the “minette” ores of the Briey, Longwy, Crusnes, and Nancy\r\ndistricts; the Silurian ores in Normandy; and the vein deposits of the\r\neastern Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nThe “minette” ores of northern France form part of the great basin of\r\n“minette” ores of France, Luxemburg, and Germany already mentioned.\r\nIn 1913 they furnished about 91 per cent. of the total production of\r\nFrance. The iron ores of Normandy and Brittany are of sedimentary\r\norigin and are composed of hematite or carbonate or a mixture of both.\r\nThe carbonate becomes more abundant with depth. The iron-ore deposits\r\nof the eastern Pyrenees consist of both hematite and siderite and are\r\nof high grade, constituting the only considerable source of Bessemer\r\nore in France. The iron content of the ores of Normandy and Brittany\r\nranges from 30 per cent. to 50 per cent.; that of the Pyrenees ores\r\nfrom 51 per cent. to 57 per cent. The latter range includes calcined\r\nsiderite.\r\n\r\nThe production of iron ore from French Lorraine was about 19,500,000\r\ntons in 1913; that of Normandy and Brittany about 1,500,000 tons, and\r\nthat of the eastern Pyrenees about 500,000, making a total production\r\nof more than 21,000,000 tons for France.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the relative output of iron ore from the\r\ndifferent iron fields of France and Germany during the last three\r\nnormal years before the war:\r\n\r\nTABLE 15.--PRODUCTION OF IRON ORE IN FRANCE AND GERMANY, 1911 TO 1913\r\n\r\nMetric tons\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------+----------+----------+----------\r\n  District                         |   1911   |   1912   |  1913\r\n  ---------------------------------+----------+----------+----------\r\n  German Lorraine                  |17,734,576|20,050,245|21,135,554\r\n  Luxemburg                        | 6,059,797| 6,553,930| 7,331,050\r\n  French Lorraine, including Briey,|          |          |\r\n  Longwy and Nancy                 |14,878,000|17,235,125|19,499,166\r\n  Germany, outside of Lorraine     | 6,968,000| 7,167,000| 7,472,000\r\n  France, outside of Lorraine      | 1,584,000| 1,925,000| 1,686,000\r\n  ---------------------------------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nThe available reserves in the different districts of the French\r\n“minette” ore field are estimated as follows:[34]\r\n\r\nTABLE 16.--ORE RESERVES IN FRENCH “MINETTE” FIELD\r\n\r\n           Million tons\r\n  Briey       2,000\r\n  Crusnes       500\r\n  Longwy        275\r\n  Nancy         200\r\n              -----\r\n    Total     2,975\r\n\r\n  [34] NICOU, L.: “Iron Resources of the World,” Stockholm, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe list of operating companies in France shows a considerable number\r\nof German companies among the predominating French. German or probably\r\nGerman companies produced in 1913 six and a half million tons of iron\r\nore, or one-third of the whole production. In the Normandy and Brittany\r\nregion two German companies made 11 per cent. of the whole production;\r\nand in the eastern Pyrenees one German company produced 20 per cent.\r\nAltogether, German capital controlled over one-third of the iron and\r\nsteel industry of France in 1913. The rest seems to have been in the\r\nhands of French capital.\r\n\r\nThe most important iron-producing firms in the Lorraine field in recent\r\nyears have been those of de Wendel & Co., Gutehoffnungshütte, Société\r\ndes Hauts Fourneaux et Fonderies de Pont-a-Moussons, Société des Forges\r\net Acieries de la Marine et d’Homecourt, Société Anonyme des Acieries\r\nde Longwy, Société des Acieries de Micheville, and Société des Mines\r\nd’Ammermont Dommery. The first two firms are chiefly German and have\r\ncontrolled lands not only in German Lorraine, but also in French\r\nLorraine. Thus, the iron-ore lands of the Lorraine district will, even\r\nafter the cessation of the territory to France, be owned largely by\r\nGerman-controlled firms. Politically, however, France will have control\r\nof the output.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Great Britain.=--The iron ores mined in Great Britain come chiefly\r\nfrom the Cleveland Hills in Yorkshire and from Lincolnshire,\r\nNorthamptonshire, Cumberland, Staffordshire, Leicestershire, Scotland,\r\nand Lancashire, in order of importance. More than one-third of the\r\ntotal production is derived from the Cleveland Hills. The ore from the\r\nCleveland Hills, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, and\r\nScotland is bedded oolitic siderite of Middle and Lower Jurassic age;\r\nthat from Cumberland and Lancashire is hematite, exceptionally low in\r\nphosphorus, found in pockets in Carboniferous and Silurian limestones;\r\nand that in Staffordshire is siderite of the “black band” and “clay\r\nband” varieties found in the Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the production of iron ore in the United\r\nKingdom in 1915:\r\n\r\nTABLE 17.--PRODUCTION OF IRON ORE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN 1915\r\n\r\n                                     Long tons\r\n  Cleveland Hills                    4,746,293\r\n  Lincolnshire                       3,149,079\r\n  Northamptonshire                   2,517,150\r\n  Cumberland                         1,323,408\r\n  Staffordshire                        703,231\r\n  Leicestershire                       685,137\r\n  Scotland                             375,241\r\n  Lancashire                           333,086\r\n  Other Great Britain and Ireland      402,387\r\n                                    ----------\r\n    Total                           14,235,012\r\n\r\nA large part of the iron ore in Great Britain can not now be\r\nworked profitably, and much of the ore that was merchantable a few\r\nyears ago could not now be worked, on account of increased cost of\r\ntransportation, labor, and particularly of fuel. The actual reserves of\r\nore of present merchantable grade are estimated at 1,300 million tons;\r\nthe total reserves have been estimated by H. Louis at 39,500 million\r\ntons.[35]\r\n\r\n  [35] LOUIS, H.: “Iron-Ore Resources of the World,” Stockholm, 1910.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 the United Kingdom produced 14,000,000 tons of iron ore. In the\r\nsame year nearly 7,000,000 tons were imported, of which 4,000,000 came\r\nfrom Spain and between one-half and one million from Algeria and Norway\r\neach, making a total of over 20,000,000 tons smelted in the United\r\nKingdom. The total production of pig iron was nearly 9,000,000 tons,\r\nof which nearly 7,000,000 tons were produced in England, 1,000,000\r\ntons in Scotland, and nearly 1,000,000 tons in Wales. Ireland produces\r\nno pig iron. The iron and steel industry of Great Britain, so far as\r\ninformation is available, is in the hands of British subjects.\r\n\r\nEckel[36] reviews the British iron-ore situation as follows:\r\n\r\n  The position of Great Britain as regards iron-ore resources is\r\n  peculiar--perhaps more curious than satisfactory. The matter may be\r\n  summarized by saying that England has still several hundred million\r\n  tons of high-grade ore which would be salable anywhere; that she has\r\n  in addition perhaps double that quantity of low-grade ore, workable\r\n  because of its nearness to coal and markets; and that England,\r\n  Scotland, and Wales have thousands of millions of tons of ore now\r\n  unworkable, but which may be serviceable in the future provided that\r\n  at that future date there is still any other good reason for making\r\n  steel in Great Britain. This last limitation may not be palatable,\r\n  but it is really the crux of the whole question, and it seems to\r\n  have been overlooked by the British geologists who have discussed\r\n  the subject. People do not make iron out of low-grade ores simply to\r\n  use up the ores; and with an increasing coke cost and a narrowing\r\n  export market it is a very serious question whether the bulk of these\r\n  British carbonates will ever be used. The duration of the British\r\n  steel industry will be fixed by its coal supply, and not by its\r\n  supply of local ores; for so long as coke and markets justify it, ore\r\n  can be imported to good advantage. If other conditions do not justify\r\n  the importation of ore, they will certainly not justify the use of\r\n  these hypothetical reserve tonnages.\r\n\r\n  [36] ECKEL, E. C.: “Iron Ores, Their Occurrence, Valuation and\r\n  Control,” p. 320, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spain.=--Spain is rich in iron-ore reserves, but the iron and\r\nsteel manufacturing industry has had little development. The annual\r\nproduction of iron ore in Spain during the last years before the war\r\namounted to about 9,000,000 tons, of which more than 8,000,000 tons\r\nwere exported. The consumption of iron ore by Spanish blast furnaces\r\nhas been in the neighborhood of 800,000 tons annually.\r\n\r\nThe principal iron ores of Spain lie in the northwestern part,\r\nin the provinces of Viscaya, Oviedo, Lugo, and Santander; in the\r\nnortheastern part, in the provinces of Teruel and Guadalajara; and in\r\nthe southeastern part, in the provinces of Granada, Almeria, Murcia,\r\nSevilla, and Huelva.\r\n\r\nThe iron ores of the Bilbao district of Viscaya are all of Bessemer\r\ngrade, and for many years large amounts have been exported to England\r\nfor use in Bessemer plants to supplement ores from the Cleveland and\r\nother districts of England. Because of their excellence, they have\r\nbeen in continuous demand, and the English iron and steel industry has\r\ndepended to a considerable extent upon these and other high-grade ores\r\nof Spain. In more recent years, Germany has also become interested in\r\nthe Bilbao iron fields, and in the last years before the war Germany\r\ntook more than one-third of the total Spanish production, including\r\nlarge amounts of ore from southern Spain as well. Spanish interests own\r\nimportant deposits in southeastern Spain and in the Bilbao district.\r\n\r\nMost of the ore of southeastern Spain is of high grade, being rich in\r\niron and low in phosphorus. Nearly all of it is of Bessemer quality,\r\nand some is very low in phosphorus; the latter is exported extensively\r\nfor use in the manufacture of low-phosphorus pig iron. The United\r\nStates has been largely dependent in past years upon Spain for this\r\ngrade of ore, more than 100,000 tons being imported annually.\r\n\r\nSpain has a number of blast furnaces and steel plants, the principal\r\nones being at Bilbao, in the Province of Viscaya. More than 300,000\r\ntons of pig iron are produced annually in Viscaya, this being\r\napproximately three-fourths of the total output of pig iron in Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n=European Russia.=--In European Russia[37] the principal deposits of\r\niron ore are distributed over four chief districts: Ural Mountains,\r\ncentral Russia, southern Russia and the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n  [37] BOGDANOWITSCH, K.: “The Iron Resources of the World,” Stockholm,\r\n  1910.\r\n\r\nIn the Ural Mountains for the greater part the ores are associated with\r\nigneous rocks. The most important deposits are in the neighborhood of\r\nGora Blagodat, in the northern Ural regions, and near Gora Mongnitnaja,\r\nin the southern Urals. The ores are mainly magnetite and limonite\r\nand come from an extremely large number of small mines. In central\r\nRussia, over widely scattered areas, are deposits of calcareous ores,\r\nclay ironstones, and bog ores. Many of the deposits are thin and can\r\nnot be profitably worked. The only reserves in southern Russia of any\r\nimportance are divided among three centers: Krivoi-Rog, the Donetz\r\nbasin, and the Kertsch peninsula. By far the most important deposits\r\nare the magnetite-hematite ores in the region of Krivoi-Rog. The\r\nironstones of the Coal Measures in the Donetz basin and the limonite\r\nof the Kertsch peninsula are of secondary importance. The mines of\r\nKrivoi-Rog are extensively worked, and their reserves are estimated at\r\nsome 86 million tons of commercial ore. The mines are controlled mainly\r\nby the following three companies: the Briansk company; Krivoi-Rog Iron\r\nOre Co.; and the Providence company.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the production of iron ore in different parts\r\nof Russia in 1912:\r\n\r\nTABLE 18.--OUTPUT OF IRON ORE IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\n                             Long tons\r\n  Southern Russia            5,679,000\r\n  Ural                       1,817,000\r\n  Central Russia               286,000\r\n  Other Russia and Siberia       6,000\r\n                             ---------\r\n    Total                    7,788,000\r\n\r\nThe ore reserves of Russia may be summarized by districts as follows:\r\n\r\nIRON-ORE RESERVES IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\n              Millions of tons\r\n  Ural               282\r\n  Central Russia     789\r\n  Southern Russia    536\r\n  Caucasus            14\r\n                   -----\r\n    Total          1,621\r\n\r\nEckel[38] reviews the iron-ore situation in Russia as follows:\r\n\r\n  On their face the ore reserves noted seem satisfactory enough, and\r\n  until the data are examined more critically it is difficult to\r\n  explain why the relatively large furnishing capacity of the Moscow\r\n  and other central Russian districts is so far out of line with the\r\n  comparatively small ore production of that area. As a matter of fact,\r\n  however, the large total ore reserves credited to central Russia are\r\n  in reality less important than they seem, owing both to grade of\r\n  ore and thinness of the ore bodies. From an international viewpoint\r\n  the ore deposits of southern Russia are the ones which require most\r\n  attention; for these are so located as to be of importance to foreign\r\n  competitors, while the total reserve tonnage is high, and the grade\r\n  of much of the ore is excellent.\r\n\r\n  [38] ECKEL, E. C.: “Iron Ores, Their Occurrence, Valuation and\r\n  Control,” 1914, p. 326.\r\n\r\nActual available ore reserves of merchantable grade in Russia are\r\nestimated at 865 million tons.\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution the greater part of the Russian iron and steel\r\nindustries was controlled by syndicates.[39] The oldest of these\r\nconsisted of manufacturers of medium sheets (1902); then followed\r\nmanufacturers of joists and =~U~=-iron (1903), axles and tires (1904),\r\niron tubes (1906), rails (1907), and bar iron and hoops. These six\r\nsyndicates were afterwards combined into one, officially styled the\r\nAssociation for the Sale of Products of the Metallurgical Works of\r\nRussia, but generally known as “Prodameta,” from its telegraphic\r\naddress. There were separate syndicates for wire, wire nails, and\r\nroofing sheets. The “Prodameta” consisted, at last advices, of nineteen\r\nworks, of which sixteen are in southern Russia, and one each in\r\nPetrograd, Moscow, and the Ural region. The “Prodameta” expired at the\r\nend of 1915, but was provisionally prolonged for one year, and again\r\nat the end of 1916 it was extended for a similar period. The aggregate\r\ncapital of the eighteen works was 198,400,000 roubles, and their net\r\nprofit for 1915-16 was 76,200,000 roubles.\r\n\r\n  [39] Ironmonger Metal Market Year-Book, London, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sweden.=--The iron-ore fields of Sweden are among the most important\r\nin Europe and have for the last ten or fifteen years furnished a large\r\noutput, which has gone mainly to England and Germany. A relatively\r\nsmall amount of iron ore is used in Swedish iron-smelting works. The\r\niron mines of central Sweden have been actively worked since about the\r\nbeginning of the twelfth century, whereas those of Swedish Lapland\r\nhave been developed recently. At present about one-half the output of\r\niron ore in Sweden comes from Swedish Lapland, and the other half from\r\ncentral Sweden.\r\n\r\nSwedish Lapland is estimated to have iron-ore reserves amounting to\r\n1,128 million tons. The ores are mostly magnetite associated with\r\nigneous rocks and show wide difference in phosphorus content. Certain\r\ndeposits or parts of deposits are composed of ores that are moderately\r\nlow in phosphorus, whereas others are high enough to obtain a special\r\nbonus from German steel plants that produce high-phosphorus slag for\r\nfertilizer purposes. Practically all the ores of Swedish Lapland\r\nare exported. In recent years the total production has amounted to\r\nabout 3,500,000 tons annually. The principal mines are worked by\r\nthe Trafikaktiebolaget Grängesberg Oxelosund, in which English and\r\nGerman capital is interested with the Swedish government. The Swedish\r\ngovernment controls the output of the mines and receives a large sum in\r\nroyalties on the ore produced. The ore deposits from which ore is being\r\nproduced at present are Kiruna, Gellivare, and Tuolluvarra, the first\r\ntwo being operated by the firm mentioned above and the last being an\r\nindependent operation.\r\n\r\nThe ore reserves of central and southern Sweden are estimated at 140\r\nmillion tons, included in a great number of relatively small deposits.\r\nMost of the mines of central Sweden are controlled by small Swedish\r\noperators. Some of the mines, however, such as Blotberg, are to a\r\nlarge extent under German control, and the largest one, Grängesberg,\r\nis operated by the same firm that controls the deposits of Swedish\r\nLapland. Some of the ores of central Sweden, such as those of\r\nDannemora, Norberg, Strossa, and Stripa, are very low in phosphorus,\r\nand are used in the manufacture of special low-phosphorus iron; others,\r\nlike those of Grängesberg and Blotberg, contain more than 1 per cent.\r\nof phosphorus.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Austria-Hungary.=--The iron ores of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire\r\nare mainly low-grade hydrous iron silicates that require roasting,\r\nlarge deposits of iron carbonate, and some limonite. The total probable\r\nore reserves have been estimated at 940 million tons, of which about\r\n560 million are very low grade.\r\n\r\nThe principal sources from which the domestic iron ore used in\r\nthe past in the Austro-Hungarian Empire has been obtained are the\r\nchamosite-hematite deposits at Nucitz and elsewhere in Bohemia; the\r\nsiderite beds at Erzberg, in Styria, estimated to contain more than 200\r\nmillion tons of ore; the siderite-limonite deposits on the slopes of\r\nthe Carpathians; and deposits of various ores in northern and central\r\nBosnia.\r\n\r\nBy far the largest of the deposits is that at Erzberg, owned and\r\noperated by the Oesterreichische Alpinen Montan Gesellschaft,\r\npresumably Austrian. The Bohemian deposits, also important, are largely\r\nunder the control of the Prager Eisen Industrie Gesellschaft. The\r\nCarpathian deposits are largely controlled by local individuals and\r\nfirms, among them Duke Philipp of Sachsen-Coburg-Gotha-Kohar. Thus the\r\nprincipal deposits have been largely under Austro-Hungarian control.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the war and the disruption of the Austro-Hungarian\r\nEmpire, the Bohemian deposits, estimated to contain 35,100,000 tons\r\nof high-grade ore and 221,800,000 tons of low-grade ore, will come\r\nunder the control of Czechoslovakia, whereas the Bosnian ores, with an\r\nestimated reserve of 21,500,000 tons, will go to Jugoslavia. Austria\r\nwill retain control of the large Erzberg deposit in Styria, and the\r\nores of the Carpathian region will continue under Hungarian control.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco.=--The iron ores of Morocco, Algeria,\r\nand Tunisia, in northern Africa, are mainly high-grade hematite. The\r\nreserve tonnage of Algeria and Tunisia is estimated by Nicou at 100\r\nmillion to 150 million tons, and about 30 million or 40 million tons is\r\nreported in the Spanish territory of Riff, Morocco.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of Morocco and Algeria are nearly all near the north\r\ncoast, and the ores are shipped from various small ports, such as\r\nMelilla, Benisaf, Arzeu, Algiers, Bougie, and Bona. The deposits of\r\nTunisia are 180 to 200 kilometers southwest of Tunis, the shipping\r\nport, with which they are connected by rail.\r\n\r\nThe principal mines of El Riff, Morocco, are owned by the Sociedad\r\nEspañola de Minas de Riff. German interests, the “Netta Company,” held\r\na large concession, but since the war these interests are controlled by\r\nthe Company of Bilbao.\r\n\r\nThe North African deposits are important as a source of high-grade\r\nlow-phosphorus ore for European blast furnaces. All of the ore produced\r\nis exported, the annual shipments amounting to about 1,500,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cuba.=--There are two principal groups of iron-ore deposits in\r\nCuba--the magnetite and hematite ore on the south coast, and the brown\r\nore, or limonite, on the north coast. All are near the eastern end of\r\nthe island. The ores of Firmeza and Daiquiri, on the south coast, are\r\nmixed magnetite and hematite, averaging about 58 per cent. iron and\r\n0.03 per cent. phosphorus. They are associated with igneous rocks.\r\nA determination of tonnage is difficult because of the irregularity\r\nof the ore bodies, and estimates of reserves range from 5 million to\r\n9 million tons. The brown ore of the north shore is hydrated brown\r\nhematite, a laterization product of serpentine. The dried ore averages\r\nabout 46 per cent. iron, 0.01 per cent. phosphorus, and 1.7 per cent.\r\nchromium. The reserve tonnage, estimated as high as 3,000 million tons,\r\nis mainly contained in the three large deposits of Camaguey, Mayari,\r\nand Moa.\r\n\r\nThe principal deposits of Cuba are owned and operated by the Bethlehem\r\nSteel Co. Important undeveloped deposits are owned by the Buena\r\nVista Iron Co. (Midvale Steel & Ordnance Co.), United States Steel\r\nCorporation, Guantanamo Exploration Co., and Eastern Steel Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Newfoundland.=--The principal iron ores of Newfoundland are bedded\r\noolitic hematites, which average 50 per cent. to 52 per cent. in\r\nmetallic iron. The ore reserves of Newfoundland have been estimated as\r\nbetween 3,250 million and 3,500 million tons, making them among the\r\nlargest and by far the most compact iron-ore reserves in the world. The\r\noutput of ore has been 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 tons annually, except\r\nduring the war, when the production decreased. These deposits are\r\nimportant on account of both their size and their situation. Ore can\r\nbe placed readily in American or European ports at a cost far lower\r\nper unit of iron than any competitive ore, so that the market is\r\npractically unlimited.\r\n\r\nThe ores have been mainly exported to Sydney, Nova Scotia, and to\r\nPhiladelphia, while about 10 per cent. has gone to Holland (Germany).\r\nThe phosphorus content is too high for normal economic basic\r\nopen-hearth practice if the ores are used alone, but not too high for\r\nfoundry use or for the basic Bessemer process developed in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Wabana iron-ore deposits are owned and mined by the Dominion Iron\r\n& Steel Co., and the Nova Scotia Steel & Coal Co., two Canadian firms.\r\nBoth companies operate steel plants near Sydney, Cape Breton.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Norway.=--The principal iron ores of Norway are low-grade magnetite\r\nand specular hematite, much of which can profitably be concentrated.\r\nThey occur in the northern part, north of the Arctic Circle. Small\r\ndeposits of high-grade ores, consisting mainly of magnetite lenses,\r\noccur in southern Norway.\r\n\r\nThe Sydvaranger deposits, in the extreme north near the border of\r\nFinland, are estimated to contain 100 million tons of low-grade\r\nmagnetite. The ore is treated in a large concentrating plant erected by\r\na Norwegian company but controlled by Swedish and German capital. The\r\nconcentrates analyze 70 per cent. iron and 0.02 per cent. phosphorus.\r\nThe Dunderland deposits on Rannenfjord, near the Arctic Circle, are\r\nestimated to contain 80 million tons of mixed low-grade specular\r\nhematite and magnetite.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 Norway produced 652,273 tons of iron ore, of which\r\nseven-eighths came from the Sydvaranger deposit.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Italy.=--The most important iron mines in Italy are the hematite\r\nmines of the island of Elba, which have furnished between 500,000 and\r\n1,000,000 tons of ore annually in recent years. Ten or twelve large\r\nore bodies are found in the eastern part of the island, all under\r\ncontrol of the Elba Company, which has obtained a concession giving it\r\nexclusive iron-mining rights on the island. Important but as yet little\r\ndeveloped magnetite deposits are found in the Aosta Valley, Piedmont,\r\nand limonite deposits are found on the island of Sardinia. These have\r\nfurnished a very small output. Minor deposits of iron ore occur in\r\nLombardy, in the Apennines of central Italy, and elsewhere. The total\r\nreserves of iron ore in Italy are estimated at about 25 million tons.\r\n\r\nItaly has several important iron-smelting works, among them being the\r\nElba Company furnaces on the island of Elba, the Piombino furnaces\r\nat Piombino, on the mainland opposite Elba, and the Ilva furnaces\r\nat Bagnoli, near Naples. In addition there are some small plants in\r\nnorthern Italy.\r\n\r\nItaly’s iron-ore deposits and iron manufactures are controlled by\r\ncommercial organizations, mainly Italian, but in part English. The\r\nItalian government exercises control over the ore deposits by granting\r\nconcessions for comparatively short terms.\r\n\r\nAgreements made among the Italian manufacturers for the rational\r\ndivision of work have led to the formation of a syndicate of the\r\nfollowing firms: Ilva, Elba, Siderurgica di Savona, Metallurgica di\r\nLestre, Ferriere Italiane, and the Piombino Steel Works. These firms\r\nundertook to maintain the syndicate for eleven years, dating from\r\nJuly, 1911. The affairs of the organization were directed by the Ilva\r\nCompany. “In 1916 the constituent companies renewed their agreement up\r\nto the year 1930, but the Ilva Company ceased to direct the affairs\r\nof the Syndicate, and the relations between the Syndicate and the\r\nGerman Stahlwerks Verband were abrogated and replaced by Anglo-Italian\r\nrelationships.”[40]\r\n\r\n  [40] Ironmonger Metal Market Year Book, 1918.\r\n\r\nA further organization was made called the “Societa Ferro ed Acciaio,”\r\na combination of steel works.\r\n\r\nItaly is important as a producer of iron ore and as a manufacturer\r\nof iron products. She has been able to supply her own needs in iron\r\nore for many years and at the present rate can continue to do so for\r\nprobably twenty years longer. There appears to be no tendency toward\r\nexpansion into other fields to control foreign ore deposits.\r\n\r\nItaly produced 593,000 tons of iron ore in 1913; 669,000 tons in 1915;\r\nand 927,000 tons in 1916. In 1915, 408,000 tons of pig iron were\r\nproduced, and 87,000 tons were imported.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Greece.=--Chromiferous iron ores are found in eastern Greece and\r\nadjacent islands. They contain 46 to 52 per cent. iron, 2 to 3 per\r\ncent. chromium, and about 0.10 to 1.00 per cent. nickel and cobalt.\r\nThe normal annual production of iron ore in Greece has been in the\r\nneighborhood of 400,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canada.=--Small iron-ore deposits occur in New Brunswick and Nova\r\nScotia. In Ontario there are two principal iron-ore districts--the\r\nAtikokan and the Michipicotan ranges. The ore in the former is\r\nmagnetite, and in the latter hematite and siderite with some limonite.\r\nThe ores of western British Columbia are largely magnetite. The\r\nprincipal deposits are on Texada and Vancouver islands, where the ore\r\nis of excellent grade, averaging 63 per cent. iron, 0.02 per cent.\r\nphosphorus and 4 to 10 per cent. silica. Low-grade magnetite ore is\r\nfound at the Moose Mountain mine, Ontario, and is being concentrated.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of blast furnaces in Canada, among them being those\r\nof the Dominion Iron & Steel Co., Sydney; the Nova Scotia Steel & Coal\r\nCo., Sydney Mines, and the Londonderry Iron & Mining Co., Londonderry,\r\nall of which use ores from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia; the Algoma\r\nSteel Corporation, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario; the Steel Company of\r\nCanada, Hamilton, Ontario; the Canadian Furnace Co., Port Colborne,\r\nOntario; the Canada Iron Foundries, Midland, Ontario; the Standard\r\nIron Co., Deseronto and Parry Sound, Ontario; and the Atikokan Iron\r\nCo., Port Arthur, Ontario, which use largely Lake ores of the United\r\nStates and Canada. The Moose Mountain Co., of Sellwood, Ontario, has a\r\nmagnetic concentrating and briquetting plant using ore from the Moose\r\nMountain mine. In May, 1920, the British Empire Steel Corporation, the\r\nsecond largest in the world, was formed by the merger of nine steel,\r\ncoal, ship-building and transportation companies.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 Canada produced 156,000 tons of iron ore, and made 906,000\r\ntons of pig iron.[41] In 1918 she made 1,066,071 tons of pig iron. The\r\niron mines of Canada are largely of Canadian and partly of American\r\nownership.\r\n\r\n  [41] Board of Trade, “Reports on Iron and Steel,” London, 1905-1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n=China and Manchuria.=--Little information is available on the extent\r\nof the iron-ore deposits of the Chinese Empire. The principal producing\r\narea is that of Tayeh, south of Yangtse River in the Province of\r\nHupeh, where a series of ore bodies, consisting of mixed hematite\r\nand magnetite, occurs along the contact of limestone and intrusive\r\nsyenite. The deposits are estimated to contain about 40 million tons\r\nof ore.[42] The Han-Yeh-Ping Iron & Steel Co., largely controlled in\r\nJapan, owns these deposits and the Han Yang steel plant near Hankow.\r\nIron ore similar to that of Tayeh is reported to occur farther down the\r\nYangtse at Tungling, in the Province of Ngan-whei, and also along the\r\ncoast near Amoy, Province of Fukien. The deposits near Amoy are said to\r\ncontain about 25 million tons.\r\n\r\n  [42] BAIN, H. F.: “Notes on Iron-Ore Resources of China,” _Trans._\r\n  Am. Inst. Min. Eng., 1918.\r\n\r\nOf considerable importance are the mixed hematite and magnetite ores\r\nof Chin-ling-chen, near Kiaochow, Shantung Province. A series of ore\r\nbodies, some of them 100 feet in width, are said to occur along a\r\ncontact zone two kilometers in length.[43] The deposits were exploited\r\nby Germans and are being developed by Japanese.\r\n\r\n  [43] KOERT, W.: “Iron-Ore Resources of the World,” Stockholm, 1910.\r\n\r\nSedimentary beds of oolitic ore of some extent are reported in the\r\nprovinces of Chih-li and Kiang-si, but they are of low grade.\r\n\r\nBedded siderite ores similar to the Coal Measures ores of England have\r\nbeen mined for many years in Shan-si Province and smelted in native\r\nfurnaces. In Hunan Province, also, this type of ore is mined.\r\n\r\nThe principal iron ores of Manchuria are magnetites that occur as a\r\nseries of deposits in a northwest-southeast belt south and southeast\r\nof Mukden, in southern Manchuria. They are interbedded with schist,\r\ngneiss, and porphyry. In this belt are the An-shan-chang deposits\r\nthat are now being developed by Japanese interests affiliated with\r\nthe South Manchurian Railway, and the Miaor-kow deposits operated\r\nby a Sino-Japanese company, the Pen-hsi-hu Coal & Iron Co., Ltd. The\r\nsouthern Manchuria magnetite belt is reported to contain reserves\r\namounting to about 500 million tons.[44] Much of the ore is of low\r\ngrade.\r\n\r\n  [44] WANG, C. F.: “Coal and Iron Deposits of the Pen-hsi-hu District,\r\n  Manchuria,” _Trans._ Am. Inst. Min. Eng., 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n=India.=--Iron ores of four types are found in India[45]: (1) lenses of\r\nspecular hematite with some magnetite, occurring in quartz-hematite and\r\nquartz-magnetite schist of the Dharwar series and other older rocks;\r\n(2) granules of magnetite and hematite scattered through granite and\r\nschist; (3) clay ironstones in the Coal Measures of Bengal; and (4)\r\nlateritic ores.\r\n\r\n  [45] DE LA TOUCHE, F. E.: “Iron-Ore Resources of the World,”\r\n  Stockholm, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe hematite-magnetite lenses interlayered with iron-bearing schists\r\nare the most important of the Indian ores, although it is only recently\r\nthat they have been exploited. The Tata Iron & Steel Co. owns the\r\nprincipal deposits of this type, including Mayurbhanj, in Bengal,\r\nwhere mining is being conducted at present, and the large undeveloped\r\ndeposits of the Raipur district, Central Provinces. Important deposits\r\nof this type are also found in southern India.\r\n\r\nMagnetite and hematite derived from the disintegration of schist and\r\ngranite are now being used by the Bengal Iron & Steel Co., of Barakar.\r\nThey consist of surface accumulations of iron sands and are found in\r\nvarious parts of India. Clay ironstones scattered through shales were\r\nformerly used by the Bengal Iron & Steel Co., but its supply of these\r\nis exhausted. Lateritic iron ores lying at the surface are widespread\r\nbut undeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe principal iron and steel company of India is that of Tata & Sons,\r\nan Indian firm. Its plant, which has been mining since 1912, is at\r\nSakchi, in Bengal, and comprises three blast furnaces with a total\r\nmonthly capacity of 24,000 tons of pig iron. There are also extensive\r\ncoke ovens, open-hearth furnaces, and steel mills. Many additions are\r\nbeing planned. The Bengal Iron & Steel Co., which has been in operation\r\nfor thirty years, has three small blast furnaces at Barakar, with a\r\nmonthly capacity of 12,000 tons. A steel mill and rolling mill built by\r\nthis company have been abandoned.\r\n\r\nSeveral new developments are being planned in the Indian steel\r\nindustry, among them being the Indian Iron & Steel Co., an English\r\nfirm, which is building a plant near Asanol on the East Indian Railway.\r\n\r\nThe production of iron ores for 1915 was 390,270 tons, the production\r\nof iron and steel for 1914 was 504,564 tons and for 1915 to 1916 it was\r\n584,775 tons. Total imports of iron and steel, 1914 to 1915, amounted\r\nto 698,635 tons, and 1915 to 1916, to 424,597 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Japan and Korea.=--The iron ore used in Japanese furnaces is obtained\r\nin part from domestic mines and in part from Korean, Manchurian,\r\nand Chinese mines. The iron ore produced in Japan comes mainly from\r\nthe Kamaishi group of deposits in the northern part of the island\r\nof Honshu. These mines yield more than one-half of the total annual\r\nproduction of iron ore in Japan, the remainder coming mainly from the\r\nSennin and Kuriki mines, also in the northern part of Honshu; the Abuta\r\nand other bog ore deposits in Hokkaido, and the black sand deposits of\r\nChugoku, in southern Honshu. The Kamaishi, Sennin, and Kuriki deposits\r\nconsist of magnetite and hematite associated with sedimentary rocks\r\nnear igneous intrusions. The iron-ore reserves of Japan are estimated\r\nby Inouye[46] at about 60 million tons.\r\n\r\n  [46] INOUYE, K.: “Iron-Ore Resources of the World,” Stockholm, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe Korean iron ores used in Japan have come mainly from the surficial\r\nlimonite deposits of Hoang-hai-do, about 100 miles northwest of\r\nSeoul, which have been actively mined for 10 years or more. Recently\r\nJapanese-controlled blast furnaces have been established at Ken-ji-pho,\r\nKorea, which use ore from the Ken-ji-pho iron mine, situated in the\r\nsame region as the Hoang-hai-do mines. The pig iron produced by this\r\nplant is sent to Japan for use in Japanese steel plants.\r\n\r\nChinese iron ore used in Japan has been obtained from the Tayeh mines\r\nof Hupeh Province. A part of the ore from these mines goes directly to\r\nJapan, and a part goes to the Han-Yang furnaces, near Hankow, to be\r\nmanufactured into pig-iron and steel products which also go to Japan.\r\nThe Han-Yeh-Ping Iron & Steel Co., which owns both the Tayeh mines and\r\nthe Han-Yang furnaces, is a Chinese concern, the capital of which is at\r\npresent controlled largely by Japanese banking firms.\r\n\r\nOf considerable interest at the present time is the development by\r\nJapanese of the Chin-ling-chen iron-ore deposits on the peninsula of\r\nKiaochow, Shantung Province. These deposits were being exploited by the\r\nGermans just before the war and have recently been taken over by the\r\nJapanese, who are continuing development.\r\n\r\nTwo important Japanese-controlled iron and steel manufacturing projects\r\nare at present being developed in Manchuria. The older of these is the\r\nplant of the Pen-hsi-hu Colliery & Mining Co. at Pen-hsi-hu, southeast\r\nof Mukden, where pig iron is being manufactured from ore obtained from\r\nthe neighboring Miaor-kou magnetite mines. The pig iron is being sent\r\nto Japan. The other Manchurian enterprise is the An-shan-chang iron and\r\nsteel works at Sha-ho-kou, south of Mukden. The ore is derived from\r\nthe An-shan-chang iron mines and the pig iron and steel products which\r\nit is later planned to manufacture are to be sent to Japan. It is also\r\nplanned to send Manchurian ore to Japan.\r\n\r\nOn page 77 are shown the production and importation of iron ore into\r\nJapan in recent years:\r\n\r\nTABLE 19.--PRODUCTION AND IMPORTATION OF IRON ORE INTO JAPAN, 1914 TO\r\n1916\r\n\r\n(Metric tons)\r\n\r\n  ----+----------+---------------+---------------\r\n      |          |  Importation  |\r\n      |          |      from     |Total including\r\n      |          +-------+-------+     other\r\n  Year|Production| Korea | China |   countries\r\n  ----+----------+-------+-------+---------------\r\n  1914|  136,385 |163,747|300,305|   465,754\r\n  1915|  136,121 |204,101|311,310|   516,132\r\n  1916|  158,815 |192,225|282,149|   474,955\r\n  ----+----------+-------+-------+---------------\r\n\r\nA considerable quantity of pig iron is imported into Japan from British\r\nIndia, Great Britain, and other countries.\r\n\r\nThe principal iron-smelting works in Japan are as follows: Imperial\r\nSteel Works, Yawata; Kamaishi Iron Works, Kamaishi; Wanishi Iron Works,\r\nTanburi; Sennin Iron Works, Waka; Kuriki Iron Works, Kisen. All are\r\ncontrolled by Japanese, the first being the Japanese government works.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Poland.=--In Poland the chief deposits of iron ore are the limonite\r\ndeposits in the Vistula district, carrying 22 to 50 per cent. iron. The\r\nproduction in 1912 was 289,000 long tons. The resources are estimated\r\nat 300 million to 800 million tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Belgium.=--Belgium’s production of iron ore in recent years has\r\namounted to about 150,000 tons annually, of which more than half was\r\nderived from the “minette” ore beds in the southeastern part along the\r\nFrench border, and the remainder came in part from beds of oolitic\r\nhematite of Devonian age in the Namur and Liege basins and in part\r\nfrom bog-ore deposits in the northern part. In the past the largest\r\nproduction has come from the Namur basin, and there are still large\r\nreserves of these oolitic hematite ores. The total iron-ore reserves of\r\nBelgium are estimated to be about 62,500,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThe iron ore produced in Belgium supplies only a very small part of the\r\nrequirements for the Belgian iron and steel industry, most of the ore\r\nbeing imported from France.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Portugal.=--The largest deposits of iron ore in Portugal are those of\r\nMoncorvo, in the northeastern part. The ore is a bedded sedimentary\r\ndeposit of low grade and the estimated reserve is 45 million tons.\r\nSmall deposits of magnetite and brown hematite are found in the\r\nsouthern part in the Province of Alemtejo. Portugal produced 48,342\r\ntons of iron ore in 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Turkey and Bulgaria.=--Minor deposits of magnetite and hematite occur\r\nin Bulgaria and former European Turkey, and in western Asia Minor\r\nseveral important ore bodies are known.[47] The largest of these\r\ndeposits occurs in the Berut Hills, 90 miles northwest of the Gulf of\r\nAlexandretta. It is reported to be capable of producing 300,000 tons\r\nannually.\r\n\r\n  [47] EDWARDS, G. M.: “Notes on Mines in the Ottoman Empire,” _Trans._\r\n  Inst. Min. Met., vol. 23, 1913-14.\r\n\r\nOther important deposits are found near Ayazmat, on the mainland\r\nopposite the island of Mitylene, and near Tireboli and Trebizond, on\r\nthe Black Sea. The only producing mine is near Ayazmat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chile.=--Scattered iron-ore deposits occur in Chile in the coastal\r\nmountain region; the principal deposits extend a distance of about 150\r\nmiles parallel to the coast, some of them being north and some south\r\nof Coquimbo. The ore bodies are within 10 to 40 miles of the coast.\r\nMost of them are enclosed as lenses in granitic rocks; a few are in\r\nsedimentary rocks near the contact of igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nFurnaces and a steel plant were erected by a French syndicate 10 to 15\r\nyears ago in southern Chile. The plant ran only a few months, there\r\nbeing apparently no market for the product. The iron ore was obtained\r\nfrom the Tofo deposit, and green wood was used for fuel.\r\n\r\nOf the Chilean deposits, the largest, Algarrobo, is owned by a\r\njoint Dutch-German syndicate controlled by Wm. H. Müller & Co., and\r\nGutehoffnungshütte. Tofo, next in size to Algarrobo, is under lease\r\nto the Bethlehem Steel Co. Most of the other deposits are owned\r\nby Chileans. The tonnage of Chilean ore controlled by different\r\nnationalities is approximately as follows:\r\n\r\n                             Millions of tons\r\n                               (long tons)\r\n  German                            50\r\n  American                          40\r\n  Chilean (in part English)         50\r\n                                   ---\r\n   Total                           140\r\n\r\nIron ore was mined at Tofo during 1914, 1915, and 1916, and exported to\r\nthe United States. In 1915 about 153,000 tons were shipped. During the\r\nwar the mining practically ceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Brazil.=--The iron-ore deposits of Minas Geraes, Brazil, are among\r\nthe most important in the world. The ore bodies, which as yet are\r\npractically undeveloped, lie in an area roughly 100 miles square, the\r\ncenter of which is 225 miles in a direct line north of Rio de Janeiro.\r\nThe principal ores are hematite and are associated as beds and lenses\r\nwith a laminated ferruginous quartzite known as “itabirite” that covers\r\nmany square miles. The interlayered beds and lenses of ore are high\r\ngrade, carrying up to 69 or 70 per cent. of metallic iron and averaging\r\nbetween 0.003 and 0.025 per cent. phosphorus. Nearly all ores of this\r\ntype are of Bessemer or low-phosphorus grade. There are also large\r\nareas of recently formed surface ores consisting of mixed hematite and\r\nlimonite moderately high in phosphorus; these average 55 to 65 per\r\ncent. in metallic iron.\r\n\r\nOn account of the distance from the coast and high cost of\r\ntransportation, only the high-grade bedded ores are considered at\r\npresent as available. The Central Railroad of Brazil runs through the\r\niron-ore district to the port of Rio, 310 miles from the southern edge\r\nof the district, but unfortunately, on account of heavy grades, it can\r\nnot be used for extensive transportation of iron ores. As workable\r\nbodies of coal suitable for iron manufacture are not known to exist\r\nin Brazil, the Minas Geraes deposits have up to the present produced\r\nlittle ore.\r\n\r\nThe principal iron-ore deposits of Minas Geraes are owned by the\r\nItabria Iron Ore Co., the St. John del Rey Gold Mining Co., Ltd., the\r\nBrazilian Iron & Steel Co., and the Compania Metallurgica, the first\r\ntwo being English, the third American, and the fourth Brazilian.\r\nThe Deutsch-Luxemburgisches Bergwerks und Hütten Aktiengesellschaft\r\n(German), the Société Anonyme Franco-Bresiliene (French), Jules\r\nBernard, Mathiew Goudchaux et Cie (French), the Minas Geraes Iron\r\nSyndicate (American), and others, own local deposits. The following\r\ntable shows approximately the tonnage of ore controlled by each\r\nnationality:\r\n\r\nTABLE 20.--BRAZILIAN IRON ORE CONTROLLED BY DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES\r\n\r\n  ----------+---------------------\r\n            |  Millions of tons\r\n            |    (long tons)\r\n            +--------+------------\r\n            |Bessemer|Non-Bessemer\r\n  ----------+--------+------------\r\n  English   |   145  |    300\r\n  American  |   160  |    420\r\n  French    |    21  |     15\r\n  German    |    40  |     10\r\n  Brazilian |    44  |    400\r\n            +--------+------------\r\n    Total   |   410  |  1,145\r\n  ----------+--------+------------\r\n\r\nIron ores similar to those of Minas Geraes, and magnetite deposits of\r\nminor importance are reported in other parts of Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mexico.=--Mexico has important deposits of iron ore in the States of\r\nLower California, Coahuila, Durango, Guerrero, Michoacan, and Oaxaca.\r\nThe largest iron and steel making plant in Mexico is that of the\r\nCompañia de Aciero y Fierro de Monterey, State of Nuevo Leon, operated\r\nby Spanish capital. This plant produces between 50,000 and 100,000 tons\r\nof pig iron yearly. Ore is obtained from Coahuila, and coke from nearby\r\ncoal fields. At Durango is a charcoal furnace, which has been idle for\r\nmany years. It is owned by the Durango Iron & Steel Co. (American).\r\nSmall iron-making operations exist in Hidalgo, Puebla, Vera Cruz and\r\nOaxaca. The best known of the Mexican iron-ore deposits is that of\r\nIron Mountain (Cerro de Mercado), near Durango City, a large body of\r\nmagnetite. In Lower California there are important deposits of iron ore\r\nat several localities. They are owned by the International Development\r\nCo., an American firm with headquarters at Los Angeles, California. The\r\ndeposits in Guerrero, Michoacan and Oaxaca are reported to be extensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n=South Africa.=--Various deposits of low-grade iron ore are found in\r\nSouth Africa. In Transvaal there is siliceous sedimentary hematite\r\nand magnetite in ferruginous schists of different ages, titaniferous\r\nmagnetite associated with basic igneous rocks, and local clay-band\r\nore; and in both Cape Colony and Transvaal there are lateritic surface\r\nores. A 15-ton blast furnace has been built within the last year or two\r\nnear Pretoria by the Pretoria Iron Mines Co., Ltd., for the purpose of\r\nmanufacturing pig iron from local ores. This is the first attempt to\r\nestablish an iron industry in South Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand.=--In Australia and New Zealand\r\nare some important iron-ore deposits, but only a few are developed.\r\nMost of the iron ore mined in Australia has been used for flux in\r\ncopper, lead, zinc, and other smelting plants; a small amount has been\r\nused in the two local iron and steel works--that of the Broken Hill\r\nProprietary Co., at Newcastle, New South Wales, and that of the Eskbank\r\nIron Works at Lithgow, about 75 miles west of Sydney, New South Wales.\r\nThe former is the more important, having in operation at the present\r\ntime two blast furnaces as well as steel furnaces, rail mill, and plate\r\nmill.\r\n\r\nAmong the important Australian iron-ore deposits are the hematite ores\r\nof Coombing Park, near Carcoar, and of Cadia, near Millthorpe, both in\r\nNew South Wales, estimated to contain reserves of 42 million tons of\r\nore; the hematite deposits of the Murchison district, about 400 miles\r\nnortheast of Perth, western Australia, where one single deposit--that\r\nof Wilgi Mia--has been estimated to contain more than 25 million tons;\r\nthe Iron Monarch manganiferous iron-ore deposit, estimated to contain\r\n20 million tons of ore, and the neighboring Iron Knob hematite deposit\r\nof one million tons, both about 40 miles from Port Augusta, at the\r\nhead of Spencer Bay, South Australia; and the hematite deposits of Mt.\r\nLeviathan, estimated at 10 million tons, located about 250 miles from\r\nNormanton, on the Gulf of Carpentaria, Queensland. Numerous smaller and\r\nless important ore bodies are found in all the provinces.\r\n\r\nThe Coombing Park ores have been used at the Eskbank Iron Works, 90,200\r\ntons being produced in 1916. The ore averages about 55 per cent.\r\niron. The Iron Monarch deposit is being developed by the Broken Hills\r\nProprietary Co., and the ore is to be used in the furnaces at Newcastle.\r\n\r\nAn important iron-ore deposit, estimated to contain 23 million tons of\r\nminable ore, is reported to occur on Blythe River, in the northwestern\r\npart of Tasmania, about 6¹⁄₂ miles from the coast. There have been\r\nrumors recently of a possible exploitation of this deposit.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand large deposits of limonite occur in the Nelson district,\r\nin the northern part of South Island. The principal group of deposits,\r\nknown as Parapara, is estimated to contain about 64 million tons.\r\nTitaniferous magnetite sands, measurable in millions of tons, are\r\nreported to occur in the southwestern part of North Island near New\r\nPlymouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF LEADING COMMERCIAL NATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Statement.=--The world’s chief iron- and steel-producing\r\ncountries are, in the order of their importance: United States,\r\nGermany, Great Britain, France, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Belgium.\r\nThe annual pig-iron production of these countries ranged in 1913 from\r\n2,300,000 tons in Belgium to 30,900,000 tons in the United States. The\r\nnormal consumption of iron ore by these countries in the last years\r\npreceding the war and their recent maximum annual production are given\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\nTABLE 21.--MAXIMUM ANNUAL OUTPUT AND NORMAL CONSUMPTION OF IRON ORE BY\r\nCHIEF IRON- AND STEEL-MAKING COUNTRIES\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-----------+--------------\r\n                 |Consumption|  Production\r\n     Countries   |(long tons)|  (long tons)\r\n  ---------------+-----------+--------------\r\n  United States  | 62,000,000|    75,288,851\r\n  Germany        | 40,600,000|[48]33,987,112\r\n  Great Britain  | 19,000,000|    15,997,328\r\n  France         | 12,300,000|    21,572,835\r\n  Russia         |  8,900,000|     9,362,746\r\n  Belgium        |  6,800,000|       164,734\r\n  Austria-Hungary|  5,200,000|     5,233,055\r\n  ---------------+-----------+--------------\r\n\r\n  [48] Includes production of Luxemburg.\r\n\r\nThe consumption figures represent metallic iron consumed in terms of\r\niron ore and are obtained on the basis of production and imports of\r\niron ore, and imports of pig iron and crude iron and steel products.\r\nExports of iron ore, pig iron, and crude iron and steel products are\r\nnot considered as forming part of the countries’ consumption.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the consumption and production indicates that the\r\nUnited States, France, Russia and Austria-Hungary were self-supporting\r\nas far as raw materials for their iron and steel industry were\r\nconcerned. Great Britain and Germany are dependent for a small\r\npercentage of their requirements upon foreign countries. Belgium\r\nproduces a very small percentage of her consumption of iron ore, being\r\nalmost entirely dependent upon foreign sources, mainly France and\r\nGermany, for her iron-ore requirements.\r\n\r\nIn several countries that produce much iron ore the iron and steel\r\nindustry is still in its infancy. The iron ore from these countries is\r\nnearly all exported to the large iron and steel making countries. The\r\nfollowing table shows the recent maximum annual production and normal\r\nannual consumption in some of these:\r\n\r\nTABLE 22.--MAXIMUM ANNUAL OUTPUT AND NORMAL CONSUMPTION OF IRON ORE IN\r\nSEVERAL COUNTRIES\r\n\r\n  ------------+-----------+-----------\r\n              |Consumption|Production\r\n  Countries   |(long tons)|(long tons)\r\n  ------------+-----------+-----------\r\n  Spain       | 1,000,000 |9,705,963\r\n  Sweden      |   700,000 |6,878,318\r\n  Cuba        |       ... |1,585,431\r\n  Newfoundland|       ... |1,433,858\r\n  North Africa|       ... |1,349,000\r\n  ------------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\nThus, considerable quantities of iron ore are available from these\r\ncountries for consumption in countries that have to import iron ore and\r\niron products.\r\n\r\nThere is shown below the pig-iron and steel production in 1913 of the\r\nworld’s principal iron and steel manufacturing countries.\r\n\r\nTABLE 23.--PIG-IRON AND STEEL OUTPUT OF THE CHIEF PRODUCING COUNTRIES,\r\n1913\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-----------+-----------\r\n                 | Pig iron  |   Steel\r\n  Countries      |(long tons)|(long tons)\r\n  ---------------+-----------+-----------\r\n  United States  | 30,966,152| 31,300,874\r\n  Germany        | 19,004,022| 18,659,000\r\n  Great Britain  | 10,481,917|  7,664,000\r\n  France         |  5,227,378|  4,349,000\r\n  Russia         |  4,474,757|  4,750,000\r\n  Austria-Hungary|  2,335,170|  2,641,000\r\n  Belgium        |  2,318,767|  2,475,000\r\n  Canada         |  1,015,118|  1,044,000\r\n  Sweden         |    728,103|    574,000\r\n  Spain          |    418,061|    359,000\r\n  Italy          |    420,011|    897,000\r\n  Japan          |    236,491|    251,000\r\n  ---------------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--The United States has for many years had in the Lake\r\nSuperior district the chief iron-ore producing fields in the world.\r\nIn recent years the Lake Superior district has furnished more than\r\ntwo-fifths of the world’s output of iron ore. In 1917, 75,288,851 gross\r\ntons of iron ore, 38,647,397 gross tons of pig iron, and 45,060,607\r\ngross tons of steel were produced in the United States, as compared\r\nwith 61,980,437 tons of iron ore, 30,966,152 tons of pig iron, and\r\n31,300,874 tons of steel in 1913. The imports of iron ore in 1917\r\namounted to 971,663 tons and of crude forms of iron and steel to\r\n306,189 tons, as compared with 2,594,770 tons of iron ore and 250,592\r\ntons of crude iron and steel products imported in 1913. The exports of\r\niron ore from the United States in 1917 amounted to 1,132,313 tons and\r\nof crude forms of iron and steel to 4,744,527 tons, as compared with\r\n1,042,151 tons of iron ore and 1,278,131 tons of crude forms of iron\r\nand steel exported in 1913.\r\n\r\nThese figures indicate that in normal times the United States consumes\r\nabout 85 per cent. of the domestic output of iron ore, in the\r\nmanufacture of finished iron and steel products. Fifteen per cent. is\r\nexported either as iron ore, or as crude iron and steel products which\r\nare manufactured into finished products in other countries. Of the\r\nfinished iron and steel products made in this country the United States\r\nitself consumes the larger part. However, large quantities of iron and\r\nsteel articles and machinery are exported to other countries as well.\r\n\r\nThe iron ore exported from this country is mainly Lake ore, which goes\r\nto Canadian furnaces. The iron ore imported is largely Cuban ore,\r\nwhich is used at the Sparrow’s Point plant of the Bethlehem Steel\r\nCorporation. This plant has facilities for using only ore arriving by\r\nboat and has been running almost entirely on foreign ores. The Cuban\r\niron mines are largely under the control of this company, and an\r\nincreased production is expected from them in the future.\r\n\r\nThe Bethlehem Steel Corporation has also developed an extensive\r\niron-ore deposit in Chile, from which some shipments were made during\r\nthe first years of the World War. It has been allowed to remain idle\r\nrecently on account of lack of shipping facilities. Large shipments are\r\nexpected from Chile in the future.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of Swedish ore has been imported in recent years\r\nby the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, to supplement its shipments of\r\nCuban ore. During the war, however, the Trafikaktiebolaget Grängesberg\r\nOxelosund decreased its ore shipments and finally refused altogether to\r\nexport ore to the United States. These shipments recommenced soon after\r\nthe cessation of hostilities in Europe.\r\n\r\nCertain high-grade low-phosphorus iron ores which are not present in\r\nthe United States in sufficient quantity to supply domestic needs have\r\nbeen imported in past years from Spain, North Africa, and to a small\r\nextent from Sweden. During the war, when the shortage of shipping\r\nfacilities necessitated combing this country for supplies of high-grade\r\nlow-phosphorus ores, it was shown that the United States is more or\r\nless dependent upon foreign sources for such ores.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of mines in the United States, such as the Lyon\r\nMountain mine in New York, and the Cranberry mine in North Carolina,\r\nwhich produce limited amounts of high-grade low-phosphorus ore.\r\nSeveral mines on the Menominee Range, Michigan, produce a very\r\nsiliceous low-phosphorus ore that can be used to supplement in part\r\nthe high-grade ores. A considerable quantity of low-phosphorus pyrite\r\nresidue from sulphuric acid and fertilizer plants is also used for\r\nmaking low-phosphorus iron. Much of the pyrite yielding this residue is\r\nimported from Spain, some of it is of domestic origin, and some of it\r\ncomes from Canada. Altogether, the United States supplies about 60 per\r\ncent. of the material required for the manufacture of its normal output\r\nof low-phosphorus pig iron.\r\n\r\nCertain developments in progress make it probable that a greater\r\npercentage of ore used for this purpose can be supplied from domestic\r\nmines. The principal enterprise is one that plans to concentrate the\r\nsiliceous magnetite ore of the eastern Mesabi Range. Experiments have\r\nyielded a high-grade product and work on a commercial scale is planned.\r\n\r\nThe reserves of the ordinary grades of iron ore in the United States\r\nare large, and no shortage of such ore is anticipated for many years.\r\nThey are easily capable of taking care of a considerably increased\r\nconsumption. The largest reserves are in the Lake Superior district and\r\nin the southeastern states, but large untouched reserves occur in the\r\nwestern states as well. The iron ores in the Pacific Coast region have\r\nremained undeveloped from the lack of sufficient demand for pig iron\r\nand crude forms of iron and steel on the Pacific Coast. Undoubtedly\r\nthis demand will increase in the future, and iron and steel industries\r\nwill be established there.\r\n\r\nThe reserves of ore in the Lake Superior district are large. The grade\r\nof ore mined, however, has been gradually getting lower, and it is\r\npossible that before many years Lake iron ores averaging considerably\r\nbelow 50 per cent. will have to be utilized. At present the average\r\ngrade of the ores mined in the Lake Superior district is about 51 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that there is not likely to be a shortage of the ordinary\r\ngrades of iron ore in the United States. Reserves of high-grade ores,\r\nhowever, are being gradually depleted, and high-grade ores from foreign\r\ncountries will find an increasingly ready market. American capital\r\ncontrols a large reserve of high-grade iron ore in Brazil. Much of the\r\nBrazilian ore averages about 68 per cent. in metallic iron and is very\r\nlow in phosphorus, making it an exceedingly desirable raw material\r\nfor the manufacture of special iron and for mixing with lower-grade\r\ndomestic ores. Doubtless much of the Brazilian ore will go to Europe,\r\nas British and other foreign holdings of this ore are extensive.\r\nHowever, it is highly desirable that a certain proportion of the ore\r\nshould be diverted to American furnaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany.=--The annual consumption of iron ore in Germany just before\r\nthe war was about 40 million tons, and the maximum annual output at\r\nthis time, including more than 7 million tons from Luxemburg, was only\r\nabout 34 million long tons. In order to supply German furnaces it was\r\nnecessary, therefore, to import more than 6 million tons of iron ore\r\nfrom foreign countries. More than 58 per cent. of the iron ore mined in\r\nGermany has come from the Lorraine district. The production from German\r\niron mines outside of the Lorraine district amounted to 6,906,809 tons\r\nin 1913. The production of pig iron during that year was 19,004,022\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nThe pre-war imports of iron ore into Germany were large, amounting to\r\nnearly 14 million tons in 1913; against these the exports were somewhat\r\nmore than 2 million tons.\r\n\r\nThe iron ore imported from Sweden is mainly high-phosphorus ore from\r\nthe mines of Swedish Lapland and central Sweden. This is especially\r\nadapted to the manufacture of pig iron for the Thomas process, much\r\nused in Germany. Most of the ores from the Lorraine district are\r\nslightly too low in phosphorus to be suitable for the Thomas process;\r\nand Swedish high-phosphorus ores, phosphate rock, and phosphatic slags\r\nare in places mixed with Lorraine ore to raise the phosphorus content.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of low-phosphorus iron ore used in the\r\nmanufacture of low-phosphorus pig iron is also imported from Sweden,\r\nand a larger amount of this ore is imported from Spain. This material\r\nis used in Germany for the manufacture of pig iron to be used in making\r\nacid open-hearth steel.\r\n\r\nSince Germany has lost the Lorraine iron fields, the remaining domestic\r\niron mines will be able to supply less than 20 per cent. of the\r\nrequirements of iron ore for the German furnaces. However, it is likely\r\nthat Germany will continue to receive most of her supplies from the\r\nLorraine fields, in which German holdings at present predominate over\r\nFrench holdings and will probably continue to predominate.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Great Britain.=--The United Kingdom has produced from 10 to 14 per\r\ncent. of the iron and steel of the world annually for the past 10\r\nyears or more, and apparently has consumed in normal times about\r\n50 per cent. of the product and exported 50 per cent., mainly to\r\nBritish possessions. During the war about 75 per cent. of the British\r\nproduction was consumed at home and 25 per cent. was exported, largely\r\nto France. Fifty per cent. of the iron and steel products manufactured\r\nhas been obtained from ores mined in Great Britain, and 50 per cent.\r\nfrom imported ores. Thus, normally, the domestic yield of iron ore\r\njust about equals the domestic demand for iron, whereas during the war\r\nthe domestic demand for iron was greater than the domestic supply of\r\nore. Great Britain depends upon outside sources for one-third of her\r\niron-ore supply and this constitutes the source of about one-half of\r\nthe iron products.\r\n\r\nThe iron industry in Great Britain before the war was loosely\r\ncontrolled by merchants who acted as intermediaries between producer\r\nand consumer, an arrangement that did not work to the advantage of\r\nthe consumer.[49] British manufacturers had little interest abroad\r\nand were themselves insufficiently organized to operate successfully.\r\nIf the sources of foreign iron ore were cut off, the situation might\r\nbecome critical and exceedingly embarrassing until the domestic mining\r\nindustry could be expanded. To meet this condition the British Board\r\nof Trade Committee advised a consolidation of iron interests by the\r\nformation of a syndicate for the purchase and distribution of iron\r\nores and particularly for the acquiring of interests abroad. This\r\nsyndicate would establish sales agencies and arrange for transportation\r\nand trade, similar to the organization of W. H. Müller & Co., of The\r\nHague. The committee recommended that these operations be backed by the\r\ngovernment and that all the resources of the British Empire be under\r\nthe control of the government, especially in regard to the granting of\r\nconcessions to aliens and the imposing of restrictions to favor home\r\nproducers. It has recently been reported that the iron interests have\r\norganized along the lines indicated.\r\n\r\n  [49] British Board of Trade, “Reports on Iron and Steel,” London.\r\n\r\n\r\n=France.=--The annual consumption of iron ore in France for the\r\nmanufacture of pig iron and crude iron and steel products amounts to\r\nabout 12 million tons under normal conditions. The productive capacity\r\nof the iron mines of France is more than 21 million, leaving a surplus\r\nof 9 million tons of ore annually available for export. More than 90\r\nper cent. of the iron ore produced in France is obtained from the\r\nLorraine iron mines.\r\n\r\nMost of the ore exported from France in the past has gone to German\r\nblast furnaces. Much has gone to Belgium. Imports of iron ore are\r\nsmall, being mostly high-grade ore from Sweden, in which class of ore\r\nFrance is deficient. French possessions in North Africa have large\r\nreserves of high-grade ore, but the bulk of the ore mined there has\r\ngone to England and Germany.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the war, that part of the Lorraine iron fields within\r\nthe boundaries of the disputed provinces of Alsace and Lorraine has\r\nbeen given to France, who thus has control of the entire output of the\r\ngreat Lorraine iron fields with the exception of the part included in\r\nLuxemburg. The production of the Lorraine iron fields, including the\r\npart that formerly belonged to Germany, has been nearly 48 million tons\r\nannually, of which about 7 million tons is mined in Luxemburg. Outside\r\nof the Lorraine district France produces about 1,500,000 tons of ore.\r\nThus, unless iron and steel making expand greatly in France, much iron\r\nore will be mined for export.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Russia.=--In 1913 Russia ranked sixth in the output of iron ore and\r\nfifth in the output of pig iron, producing about 4¹⁄₂ per cent. of the\r\nworld’s production of iron ore and 6 per cent. of the pig iron.\r\n\r\nRussia’s iron-ore reserves are estimated at about 1,600 million tons,\r\na part of which, especially in central Russia, is not economically\r\nminable. The district of southern Russia is important on account\r\nof its large reserves, large output, and its location. This is\r\nparticularly true at this time on account of Germany’s need of iron ore\r\nfor future use.\r\n\r\nThe Russian output of iron ore grew from about 2 million tons annually\r\nin 1891-93 to 7 or 8 million tons annually in 1913-1917. Southern\r\nRussia (almost exclusively the Krivoi-Rog district) produced nearly\r\n7 million tons in 1913, but by 1916 the production from this region\r\nhad been cut down to half, its difference being made up from other\r\nregions.[50] Between 1913 and 1917, Russia produced about 4 million\r\ntons of pig iron annually, of which 3 million tons came from South\r\nRussia, and most of the remainder from the Ural region.\r\n\r\n  [50] Advisory Council, Dept. of Sci. and Indust. Research, “Report on\r\n  the Sources and Production of Iron and Other Metalliferous Ores Used\r\n  in the Iron and Steel Industry,” 1918. Also British Board of Trade,\r\n  “Reports on Iron and Steel,” London; and Ironmonger Metal Market Year\r\n  Book, 1918.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the Central War Industry Committee estimated the monthly\r\nrequirements of the whole country at 300,000 tons of pig iron for\r\nwar purposes, and at 80,000 tons for the requirements of the civil\r\npopulation, making a total annual consumption of about 4,500,000 tons,\r\nor only about one-half of the normal consumption. In 1917, the total\r\nproduction in the country was estimated to amount to only 30 per cent.\r\nof these minimum requirements.\r\n\r\nThe situation in Russia is so unsettled that a statement of present\r\nconditions in the steel industry is valueless. It is reasonable to\r\nassume, however, that the iron and steel situation will not materially\r\nchange as to operations and control. Moreover, it will be safe to\r\npredict that Poland will develop more rapidly as an iron-ore producer\r\nin the future, as she was handicapped in the past by restrictions on\r\nexportation of ore.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Belgium.=--Belgium has been negligible as a producer of iron ore but\r\nhas been a comparatively large importer of iron ore and manufacturer of\r\npig iron. The country ranked sixth as a producer of pig iron in 1913,\r\nin which year it produced 147,048 tons of ore and imported 4,400,000\r\ntons.[51]\r\n\r\n  [51] Board of Trade, “Reports on Iron and Steel,” London.\r\n\r\nBelgian iron works were greatly damaged by the Germans during the war,\r\nand probably some time will elapse before the industry again reaches\r\nthe position it occupied before the war. The country offers a good\r\nmarket, however, for the iron ores of France and should in future years\r\nbe a larger producer of iron and steel wares.\r\n\r\nBelgium is practically dependent upon outside sources for ore supply,\r\nbut is conveniently situated as a market for ores from many countries.\r\nThe total iron-ore reserves of the country have been estimated at\r\n62,500,000 tons, not enough to last 10 years at the present rate of\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Austria-Hungary.=--The former Austro-Hungarian Empire yielded in\r\nrecent years 2 to 3 per cent. of the annual iron-ore production of the\r\nworld, and about 2 per cent. of the pig-iron production; therefore it\r\nhas been of minor importance in the iron industry. The ore reserves\r\nhave been estimated at 284 million tons of available ore, and 807\r\nmillion tons additional of probable ore.\r\n\r\nThe present unsettled conditions will probably result in considerable\r\nchange in the operation and control of the iron mines and works.\r\nEventually the upheaval may stimulate the iron industry, but the result\r\nshould not materially alter the international position.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Japan.=--The iron and steel industry of Japan is of small magnitude\r\nas compared with that of the United States, Germany, Great Britain,\r\nand other leading iron and steel manufacturing countries. The total\r\nreserves of iron ore are probably not much more than 60 million tons,\r\nor less than has been mined annually in the Lake Superior district in\r\nrecent years. The steel-making industry is expanding rapidly, however,\r\nand at present blast furnaces, steel-making furnaces, and steel mills\r\nare being erected in Japan, Korea, Manchuria, and China by Japanese\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThe output of iron ore in Japan is utterly inadequate to supply this\r\nexpanding industry. The production of iron ore in Japan has averaged\r\nabout 150,000 tons annually in recent years, whereas the consumption\r\nof crude, semi-crude and manufactured articles of iron and steel\r\nis approximately 1,500,000 tons. In order to supply her needs,\r\ntherefore, from her own manufacturing plants, Japan would require in\r\nthe neighborhood of 3 million tons of iron ore annually. As compared\r\nwith this, Japan’s entire consumption of iron ore, both imported and\r\ndomestic, is less than 700,000 tons. The remainder of the iron and\r\nsteel required in Japan is being imported in the form of pig iron and\r\ncrude and manufactured products.\r\n\r\nJapan is making a strong effort to develop iron-ore deposits in\r\nneighboring countries, especially in China, Manchuria, and Korea; and\r\nthe production from these sources which goes to Japanese-controlled\r\nfurnaces is rapidly increasing. Among the more recent Japanese iron and\r\nsteel enterprises in these countries are the blast furnaces and steel\r\nplant now being built at An-schan-chang, south of Mukden, in Manchuria;\r\nthe blast furnaces at Pen-hsi-hu, southeast of Mukden, in Manchuria;\r\nand the blast furnaces at Ken-ji-pho, in Korea. The last two of these\r\nplants are now producing pig iron, which is being sent to Japan. In\r\nthe future all three plants will probably build steel works. Iron-ore\r\ndeposits are being mined in connection with all of them. Besides being\r\nused in the local blast furnaces, iron ore is being sent to Japan from\r\nthese mines. In China, the most important iron and steel enterprise\r\nis that at Han-yang, in the Province of Hu-peh. This operation was\r\nstarted by the Han-Yeh-Ping Iron & Steel Co., as a Chinese enterprise\r\nin connection with the Tayeh mines in the same province. This\r\ncompany, however, became involved in financial difficulties, and\r\nJapanese capital was called upon in order that work might continue.\r\nConsiderable expansion of the plant is at present taking place under\r\nJapanese supervision. Iron ore from the Tayeh mines and pig iron from\r\nthe Han-yang plant are sent to Japan for use in Japanese iron and steel\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether, with the rapid expansion of the Japanese\r\niron and steel industry, mines in China, Manchuria and Korea can be\r\ndeveloped fast enough to supply the raw materials necessary. There are\r\nrumors that several deposits of iron ore in eastern China are now being\r\ndeveloped, including that of Chin-ling-chen, and these may afford some\r\nadditional supply. The iron mines of India also may be called upon to\r\nfurnish more iron ore to Japan than they have done in the past. The\r\nonly other important iron-ore deposits known elsewhere in the Orient\r\nare in the Philippine Islands. These deposits are reported to be fairly\r\nimportant and they are favorably situated for supplying Japanese\r\nplants. They are controlled by Americans.\r\n\r\nThe present expansion of the Japanese iron and steel industry is such\r\nthat it is a question whether the consumption of iron products in\r\nJapan will be sufficient to take care of the entire output. It seems\r\nvery probable that Japan is looking for a large export trade in iron\r\nand steel products. The Japanese may be ambitious not only to displace\r\nEuropean and American goods in the Orient, but may even attempt to\r\nsecure a market on the Pacific Coast of the United States and Canada.\r\nIt is quite probable that Japanese manufactured articles will be able\r\nto compete in the western United States with articles manufactured in\r\nthe eastern states and subject to heavy transportation rates. On the\r\nother hand, there is an active movement to start an iron industry on\r\nthe Pacific Coast, and it is hoped that plants established there will\r\nbe able to manufacture iron and steel products at a low enough cost to\r\nenable them to compete with Japanese products in the Orient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMANGANESE\r\n\r\nBY D. F. HEWETT\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF MANGANESE\r\n\r\nAlloys of manganese are essential in the manufacture of steel by the\r\nopen-hearth and the Bessemer processes, which produce 99 per cent.\r\nof the total output of the United States. In this country, about 14\r\npounds of metallic manganese as alloys, equivalent to about 40 pounds\r\nof high-grade ore, is used in making a ton of average steel. Two alloys\r\nare in common use: ferromanganese and spiegeleisen. Ferromanganese,\r\nwith 70 to 80 per cent. manganese, is largely used in making\r\nopen-hearth steel carrying less than 0.30 per cent. carbon, whereas\r\nspiegeleisen, with 20 to 32 per cent. manganese, is used in making\r\nBessemer steel carrying more than 0.30 per cent. carbon. The first\r\ngroup of low-carbon steels is used in making structural shapes, sheets,\r\nbars, wire, etc., and the second group of high-carbon steels is used in\r\nmaking rails, forgings, etc.\r\n\r\nIn making 70 to 80 per cent. ferromanganese, so-called “high-grade”\r\nore with more than 35 per cent. manganese and less than 5 per cent.\r\niron and 15 per cent. silica is needed. In making 20 to 32 per cent.\r\nspiegeleisen, so-called “low-grade” or ferruginous manganese ore with\r\n10 to 35 per cent. manganese, 20 to 35 per cent. iron, and less than\r\n20 per cent. silica is needed, although here and there spiegeleisen is\r\nmade by mixing high-grade manganese ore with iron ore.\r\n\r\nSeveral other alloys such as silico-manganese, ferro-silicon,\r\nand ferro-carbon-titanium may be used as partial substitutes for\r\nferromanganese, but although they may be capable of wider use under\r\nstress, they are electric-furnace products and under normal conditions\r\ntheir cost is prohibitive.\r\n\r\nVery pure manganese oxide is used in making the common dry battery,\r\nthe production of which has greatly increased with the wide use of\r\nthe internal-combustion engine. About 25,000 tons is used annually in\r\nthe United States for this purpose. The manganese oxide thus used is\r\nnot consumed, but becomes exhausted through the loss of oxygen. Under\r\nstress of high prices, the oxide may be regenerated by treatment or by\r\nmixture with new refined material.\r\n\r\nSmall quantities of manganese ore are used in making many chemical\r\nproducts and pigments.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nAny consideration of the need for manganese ore and ferromanganese\r\nand of dependence upon foreign sources of supply should take account\r\nof the degree to which low-grade ore and spiegeleisen may be used as\r\nsubstitutes for high-grade ore and ferromanganese. Thus, although\r\nboth Germany and the United States have only insignificant resources\r\nof high-grade ore, both possess unusually large reserves of low-grade\r\nore. Under recent conditions in the United States the percentage of\r\ntotal manganese used as spiegeleisen increased in three years from 10\r\nto about 18 per cent. Competent authorities have estimated that this\r\nsubstitution may be further increased to nearly 70 per cent. with\r\nslight modifications in practice and modest addition of equipment.\r\nSome competent engineers further contend that by other modifications\r\nof practice a large part of the manganese now needed as alloys may be\r\neliminated by the addition of low-grade manganese ore during early\r\nstages of the smelting and refining process.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nAlthough concentrated masses such as are useful in the arts are rather\r\nuncommon, manganese is widespread throughout the earth; it forms a part\r\nof about 100 minerals and most of the common rocks, igneous as well as\r\nsedimentary, contain 0.1 to 2 per cent.\r\n\r\nPresent requirements as to grade are such that manganese ores are\r\nlargely oxides. The carbonate, rhodochrosite, contains enough manganese\r\nto permit its use in making 80 per cent. ferromanganese, but only in\r\na few places are the masses large enough to be the basis of extensive\r\nmining. The common silicate contains 43 per cent. manganese, but the\r\nsilica content is so high (23 per cent.) that it can not be used alone\r\nin making the ordinary alloys.\r\n\r\nThe common oxides of manganese are deposited under many conditions\r\nwhich are found near the surface of the earth. Large masses of oxides\r\nwere deposited in shallow marine waters, in shallow fresh-water basins\r\nand under many other conditions in the relatively thin mantle of\r\nweathered rock that is found over the entire world. Although most of\r\nthese large masses were formed in the surface zone where the underlying\r\nunweathered rocks are unusually rich in manganese, some large masses\r\nof oxides accumulate under peculiarly favorable conditions by the\r\nconcentration of small quantities of manganese disseminated through the\r\ncommon rocks.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of geologic study, deposits of manganese oxides may be\r\nconsidered in two groups, as follows: (1) those derived from more or\r\nless localized masses of carbonate or silicate materials, generally\r\nwith more than 5 per cent. manganese, that seem to have no relation to\r\nthe surface of the earth; and (2) those originally deposited near the\r\nsurface as localized bodies of oxides.\r\n\r\nUnder the first group are zones of carbonate or silicate rocks in\r\ncontact with intrusive igneous rocks, such as are found in Brazil and\r\nIndia. These zones contain manganiferous carbonates (mixed with iron,\r\nlime, and magnesia); and silicates (spessartite or manganese garnet and\r\npiedmontite or manganese epidote and possibly rhodonite, or manganese\r\npyroxene). By the weathering of such rocks, large bodies of high-grade\r\noxides have been formed.\r\n\r\nManganese also occurs in fissure veins or the adjacent wall rocks in\r\nregions that have been intruded by igneous rocks. The veins commonly\r\ncontain rhodochrosite, manganiferous siderite, or rhodonite, associated\r\nwith quartz and metallic sulphide minerals, including alabandite, the\r\nsulphide of manganese. Such veins are known in Philipsburg and Butte,\r\nMont.; Silverton, Colo., and elsewhere. In such regions if the wall\r\nrocks adjacent to fissures are limestone or dolomite, they may be\r\nextensively replaced by manganiferous siderite or other carbonates\r\nwhich on weathering yield large bodies of manganese oxides, locally\r\nmixed with iron oxides. Such bodies are known at Leadville, Colo.\r\n\r\nThe manganese existing in sediments, notably clayey, but in part\r\ncarbonate, may migrate locally after the sediments are slightly buried\r\nand form zones of manganiferous carbonate and silicate concretions\r\nparallel to the bedding. Where, as in the Batesville district,\r\nArkansas, these zones are exposed by erosion, the manganese is further\r\nconcentrated as masses of oxides in residual clay.\r\n\r\nMetamorphic rocks, such as slates and schists, here and there, as in\r\nSpain, Newfoundland, California, and Washington, contain extensive\r\nlenses of rhodonite or other silicate with or without rhodochrosite,\r\nroughly parallel to the bedding. The origin of these lenses, which are\r\ngenerally rather remote from igneous intrusions, is obscure. Some are\r\nconsidered to be materials laid down during sedimentation, others are\r\nthought to represent concentrations effected during metamorphism when\r\nthe sediments were deeply buried.\r\n\r\nIn the second group mentioned above (manganese deposits first\r\nconcentrated near the surface as oxides) are included extensive\r\ndeposits of oxides interbedded with marine sediments, as in the\r\nCaucasus region, Russia. Others interbedded with volcanic material,\r\ntuffs and flows, are known in the Mediterranean region and in Chile. In\r\nIndia important beds of oxides are interbedded with quartzite and slate.\r\n\r\nMany deposits of oxides have recently formed and are probably now\r\nforming in bogs in many regions, notably New Brunswick, Canada. They\r\nare not important as sources of production.\r\n\r\nAlthough no simple relation seems to govern the distribution of\r\nmanganese in unweathered rock, there is reason for believing that the\r\naccumulation of manganese oxides in the weathered mantle is favored by\r\nclimates that cause unusually complete or deep rock decay. Although\r\na few manganese oxide deposits are found within the belts of recent\r\nglaciation, and some have no relation to weathering, most of the\r\nimportant deposits occur in areas now or recently favored with warm,\r\nhumid climates, and there is reason for suspecting that such areas will\r\nyield other important deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n=North America.=--In the United States, the occurrence of manganese\r\nore can be most clearly described by grouping the districts according\r\nto grade or ore: (1) high grade, containing 35 per cent. or more of\r\nmanganese, which is used ordinarily for making the high-grade alloy,\r\nferromanganese, and (2) low-grade, ferruginous manganese ore, used\r\nordinarily for the low-grade ferro-alloy, spiegeleisen. The country is\r\ndeficient in natural supplies of the former, but has abundant resources\r\nof the latter, which under the stress of necessity could be largely\r\nsubstituted for the high-grade ore, which is now mainly imported.\r\n\r\nThe following districts in the United States yield high-grade ore:\r\n\r\nAt Philipsburg, Mont., are bodies of manganese carbonate that replace\r\nCambrian limestone near veins and igneous contacts. These are weathered\r\nto oxides to a depth of about 200 feet below the surface. At Butte,\r\nMont., veins in granite contain manganese carbonate and silicate,\r\nlocally weathered to oxides.\r\n\r\nIn the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, and in similar valleys in\r\nTennessee and Georgia, the residual clays from certain Cambrian\r\nlimestones and Silurian shale and sandstone yield bodies of manganese\r\noxides to depths that range from 200 to 250 feet below the surface.\r\nMany small deposits also occur in Arkansas, Arizona, California,\r\nNevada, and Utah.\r\n\r\nThe total production of the United States from 1838 to 1918 was 893,734\r\ntons, and the maximum was 305,869 tons in 1918.\r\n\r\nAmong the chief districts yielding the lower grade of ore (10 to 35\r\nper cent. manganese) the most conspicuous is the Cuyuna district in\r\nMinnesota, where beds of iron-manganese carbonate of pre-Cambrian age\r\nare weathered to oxides to depths of 250 to 500 feet below the surface\r\nand contain ore bodies carrying 7 to 20 per cent. manganese, and 25 to\r\n50 per cent. iron. The single deposits range from 50,000 to 7,500,000\r\ntons each. Since the first shipments in 1913, the production through\r\n1918 has been 1,666,677 tons of ore carrying more than 5 per cent.\r\nmanganese.\r\n\r\nLarge deposits of low-grade manganese ore also occur in the Leadville\r\ndistrict in Colorado, where irregular bodies of iron-manganese\r\ncarbonate have replaced magnesian limestone of Carboniferous age and\r\nare weathered to oxides to depths as great as 850 feet. From 1885 to\r\n1918, the total production was 3,202,678 tons of material, most of\r\nwhich contained from 15 to 30 per cent. manganese.\r\n\r\nOther deposits of ferruginous manganese ore have been exploited in\r\nEagle County, Colorado; the Pioche district, Nevada; Silver City\r\ndistrict, New Mexico; and in Arkansas, Georgia, and Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn _Canada_, large deposits of siliceous manganese ores occur in\r\nNewfoundland, and several small deposits in New Brunswick, Alberta, and\r\nBritish Columbia.\r\n\r\nIn _Costa Rica_, manganese occurs in four districts near Playa Real,\r\nNicoya Peninsula, in the form of oxides that seem to be interlayered\r\nwith sedimentary rocks. The most productive deposits are owned by\r\ncitizens of United States and of Cuba; others are owned entirely by\r\nCubans. They were first exploited in 1916, and to the end of 1918 had\r\nexported 18,000 tons to United States.\r\n\r\nIn _Cuba_, manganese is mined near Santiago and Bueycito, in the\r\nprovince of Oriente. Near Santiago, manganese oxides occur as\r\nlenticular or irregular bodies in tuff, clay, and limestone. Other\r\ndeposits are reported in Santa Clara and Pinal del Rio provinces.\r\nThe mines that have been the source of more than 90 per cent. of the\r\nexports are owned jointly by citizens of Cuba and of the United States,\r\nand the remaining mines by Cubans.\r\n\r\nFrom 1888 to 1910, 266,621 tons were exported. In 1915, after four\r\nyears of idleness, the mines were reopened, and imports into the United\r\nStates from 1915 to 1918, inclusive, were 163,189 tons.[52]\r\n\r\n  [52] Production data, long tons, unless otherwise specified.\r\n\r\nIn _Mexico_, manganese ores are found four miles north of Chihuahua\r\nCity and south of Palomas, in the State of Chihuahua. It is assumed\r\nthat the deposits are owned by native Mexicans. Manganese also occurs\r\nnear Conception Bay, Lower California, where the mines are owned by\r\nnative Mexicans but are under lease to Americans. From both of these\r\ndistricts, 1,500 tons were produced and exported to the United States\r\nin 1917.\r\n\r\nIn the Republic of _Panama_, near Nombre de Dios and Madinga, there are\r\nirregular lenses of manganese oxides in decomposed sedimentary beds.\r\nSeven groups of deposits were exploited near Nombre de Dios. Five of\r\nthem were exploited by Americans, one by native owners, and one by\r\nFrench. The Nombre de Dios deposits yielded 50,000 tons of ore from\r\n1871 to 1902, largely during the last six years. The Madinga deposits\r\nwere opened in 1916 and during 1916 and 1917 exported 11,000 tons to\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n=South America.=--The largest deposits of manganese ore in South\r\nAmerica are in _Brazil_, and especially in the important mining state\r\nof Minas Geraes.\r\n\r\nIn the Lafayette district in this state, manganese oxides occur in\r\nwide lenticular bodies, that seem to have no definite arrangement\r\nor association, except that most of them are bounded by schist\r\nor gneiss. The deposits lie in a complex of granite, gneiss, and\r\ncrystalline schists; and the manganese oxides are probably derived from\r\nmanganese-bearing carbonate and silicate minerals. The most productive\r\narea, known as the Morro da Mina, 2,500 feet long by 1,000 feet wide,\r\ncontains four distinct bodies that range from 320 to 1,300 feet long\r\nand from 48 to 320 feet wide. Here manganese oxides persist 410 feet\r\nbelow the surface.\r\n\r\nThe area has yielded about 1,000,000 tons of ore and the reserves are\r\nprobably between 7,000,000 and 10,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIn the same State of Minas Geraes, in the Miguel Burnier and Ouro\r\nPrieto districts, manganese oxides are interlayered with ferruginous\r\nsedimentary rocks of pre-Cambrian age.\r\n\r\nIn the State of Bahia, the Nazareth district contains bodies of\r\nmanganese oxide in a thick surface zone of highly weathered schistose\r\nrocks. The oxides are probably derived from lenses of manganese garnet\r\nin schist. The largest deposit yielded 70,000 tons of ore. Manganese\r\ndeposits are also reported near Bom Fim, in the same state.\r\n\r\nOther deposits of manganese ore in Brazil are reported in the states of\r\nMaranhao and Matto Grosso.\r\n\r\nThe known manganese deposits of Minas Geraes lie within an area about\r\n30 miles square, the center of which is about 300 miles north of\r\nRio Janeiro. The ore is readily mined from open cuts, but existing\r\ntransportation and loading facilities practically limit the annual\r\nexports to 550,000 tons.\r\n\r\nMost of the important deposits in the Lafayette-Miguel Burnier and Ouro\r\nPrieto districts are owned by resident Brazilians. In 1915 a German\r\ncompany had worked a part of the Morro da Mina deposit for six or\r\nseven years and produced a total of 200,000 tons of ore. During 1915 a\r\nBelgian company was operating the Cocuruto mine near Ouro Prieto and\r\nwas shipping 2,000 tons monthly. The largest deposit of the Nazareth\r\ndistrict is owned by an American and the undeveloped deposits near\r\nTuryassu are owned by Norwegians.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the industry in 1894 to 1918, 4,660,000 tons of\r\nmanganese ore were exported from Brazil. From 1900 to 1913, the annual\r\nexports ranged from 99,000 to 250,000 tons, but with the elimination of\r\nRussian sources in 1914, exports rose to 503,130 tons in 1916, 532,855\r\ntons in 1917, and 393,388 tons in 1918. In October, 1917, the export\r\ntax on manganese ore was advanced from $0.85 to $3.00 per metric ton.\r\nEven before the war a large part of the Brazilian exports went to the\r\nUnited States. The destination of the 1913 exports was as follows:\r\nUnited States, 60 per cent.; Germany, 18 per cent.; Great Britain, 16\r\nper cent.; France, 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn _Chile_, manganese ores occur at Corral Quemada, and nearby\r\ndistricts in the State of Coquimbo. In these districts, beds of\r\nmanganese oxides are interlayered with sandstone, shale, and volcanic\r\nflows. Manganese is also found in the Carrizal district in the State\r\nof Atacama, where beds of manganese oxides are interbanded with shale\r\nand limestone. From 1885, when explorations were begun, to 1905, the\r\nexports of manganese ores from Chilean ports amounted to 549,716 tons,\r\nthe maximum exports for one year being 50,871 tons, in 1892.\r\n\r\nIn _Uruguay_, deposits of ferruginous manganese ore, reported to\r\ncontain 80,500,000 tons, occur at Zapucay, in the Department of Rivera.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Europe.=--In the former empire of _Austria-Hungary_, the principal\r\nmanganese district is near Dorna Vatra, in Bukowina. Here there are\r\nlenses of manganese carbonate and silicate in schists that have\r\nweathered to oxides near the surface. The deposits are owned by\r\nthe Bukowina Greek Church. The average annual production from 1906\r\nto 1912 was 13,600 tons. Other deposits are reported in Bohemia,\r\nIstria, Styria, Hungary and Bosnia. Since 1901, the production of\r\nAustria-Hungary has ranged from 18,000 to 25,000 tons annually.\r\n\r\nIn _Belgium_, near Chevron, in the Province of Liège, ferruginous\r\nmanganese oxides have formed by the weathering of manganese and iron\r\ncarbonates. Since 1901, the annual production in peace times has ranged\r\nfrom 2,000 to 15,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIn _France_, manganese occurs chiefly near Romaneche, in the Department\r\nof Saone and Loire, where several bodies of manganese oxides lie in a\r\nfault between sedimentary rocks and granite. The deposit has been known\r\nsince 1823, and the production in 1901 was 9,500 tons. Other French\r\ndeposits have been explored in the Departments of Hautes-Pyrenees,\r\nL’Ariege, L’Allier, L’Ande, and La Nievre. The annual production rather\r\nsteadily declined from 22,000 tons in 1901 to 6,000 tons in 1913. The\r\nownership of the French manganese deposits seems to be largely French,\r\npossibly aided by some English capital.\r\n\r\nIn _Germany_, manganese ore of the better type, containing over 30 per\r\ncent. of the metal, occurs in Sachsen-Gotha, Central Germany, in small\r\nveins of manganese and iron carbonates weathered near the surface to\r\noxides. A similar grade of manganese ore occurs in small quantities at\r\nHessen and Waldeck, in Rhenish Prussia.\r\n\r\nManganiferous iron ore, containing from 12 to 30 per cent. of\r\nmanganese, occurs in Hessen-Nassau, Rhenish Prussia, where manganese\r\nand iron oxides form irregular flat lenses imbedded in clays derived\r\nfrom the weathering of underlying Devonian limestone. During the period\r\n1907 to 1911, nine deposits yielded 262,000 to 283,000 tons annually.\r\n\r\nManganiferous iron ore (containing less than 12 per cent. manganese)\r\nis found at Siegerland and at Nassau, Rhenish Prussia. The veins are\r\nlarge and contain manganiferous siderite; they cut Devonian sediments.\r\nThese deposits are largely owned by the principal iron works of Rhenish\r\nPrussia. During the period 1907 to 1911, the annual production ranged\r\nfrom 2,200,000 to 2,600,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIn _Great Britain_, the principal deposits are in North Wales. Veins\r\nof manganese carbonate and silicate, as well as interlayered lenses,\r\nare found. The material contains 20 to 36 per cent. manganese. Other\r\ndeposits are recorded in Devonshire, Cornwall, and Shropshire. The\r\nmaximum production of Great Britain of about 23,000 tons was attained\r\nin 1906, when two mines in North Wales yielded 19,300 tons.\r\n\r\nManganese occurs in _Greece_, in the western end of the island of\r\nMelos, where nodules and masses of manganese oxides are disseminated\r\nthrough beds of tuffs of Pliocene age. The maximum production of 15,000\r\ntons was recorded in 1902. The output has since steadily declined to\r\n550 tons in 1913. Manganese also occurs on the peninsula of Kassandra,\r\nwhich was formerly in European Turkey. A vein explored mainly for\r\nargentiferous galena yields manganese oxides from the surface zone.\r\nThe maximum production of 52,000 tons was attained in 1902, steadily\r\ndeclining thereafter to 12,000 tons in 1910.\r\n\r\nIn _Italy_ there is manganese in Tuscany, where irregular bodies of\r\nmanganese and iron oxides occur in Triassic limestones. Other deposits\r\nin Liguria and Sardinia have recently yielded a little ore. Of the\r\nmaximum Italian production of 18,147 metric tons (18 to 45 per cent.\r\nmanganese) in 1916, 14,072 metric tons was derived from the Tuscany\r\ndeposits in Tuscany. Normally the annual production has ranged from\r\n1,600 to 4,700 tons.\r\n\r\nIn _Portugal_ there is manganese in Alemtejo. The deposits, reported to\r\nbe lenses and veins in Silurian quartzites, are owned by a Portuguese\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n_Russia_ contains the most important manganese deposits in Europe, if\r\nnot in the world. The principal mining district is near Chiaturi, in\r\nthe Kutais Government, on the south side of the Caucasus Mountains,\r\nin southern Russia. Layers of oolitic grains of manganese oxides\r\nare interbedded with horizontal sandstone and shale of Lower Eocene\r\nage. Within a zone that ranges in thickness from 4.5 to 7.5 feet and\r\naverages about 6.5 feet, seven distinct layers of very pure manganese\r\noxide aggregate about 40 inches in thickness, and the remainder is\r\nlow-grade material and sand. It is estimated that an area of 120 to\r\n143 square kilometers was originally underlain by the bed of oxides,\r\nbut that about half has been removed by erosion. Estimates of reserves\r\nrange from 23,000,000 tons to several hundred million tons.\r\n\r\nThe mines are operated in a crude, inefficient manner and scarcely\r\ntwo-thirds of the ore is recovered. The number of actual producers\r\nranged from 183 in 1902, to 376 in 1906, but declined to 96 during\r\nthe political troubles in 1908. The ore is sorted by hand and the\r\nlow-grade material is washed in crude plants. From 20 to 25 per cent.\r\nof the exported material has been concentrated by washing.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 there were 5,000 concessions, of which 3,750 were owned by 14\r\npersons, each with 25 to 500 concessions; the remainder belonged to 300\r\npeasants and small merchants. By 1912 a producers’ association had been\r\nformed to permit the owners to deal collectively with the exporters.\r\nLarge investments had also been made by German capitalists in mines\r\nas well as in undeveloped territory. The Gelsenkirchen Gesellschaft,\r\na German firm, had been formed partly for the purpose of mining but\r\nlargely to purchase and export ore to Germany. In 1912, this firm,\r\nalthough it produced only a little ore, exported nearly one-third of\r\nthe total. German groups also established necessary financial agencies\r\nto facilitate export of ore as well as to make loans to mine operators.\r\nIn 1913, of 16 exporting firms, only 3 were Russian.\r\n\r\nThe output of the mines of the Chiaturi district is hauled to Chiaturi\r\n(1.3 to 3.3 miles), loaded on narrow-gauge cars for transport to\r\nSharopan (25 miles), and then reloaded on cars for shipment to Poti\r\nor Batum (107 miles), the ports of export. Large stocks ranging\r\nfrom 1,030,000 tons in 1912, to 1,525,000 tons in 1908, are kept at\r\nChiaturi, Poti and Batum. From 1910 to 1912, the distribution of\r\nexports ranged as follows: Holland (for Germany), 30 to 43 per cent.;\r\nEngland, 22 to 23 per cent.; Belgium (largely for Germany), 15 to 21\r\nper cent.; Germany (direct), 5 per cent.; France, 4 to 6 per cent.;\r\nUnited States, 4 to 10 per cent.; Austria, 4 to 10 per cent. About\r\n1913, an export tax equal to 40 cents per long ton was levied by the\r\nRussian government.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that from 1848 to 1914, inclusive, this deposit yielded\r\nabout 11,000,000 tons of washed ore of marketable grade. The maximum\r\nproduction of 1,300,000 tons was attained in 1913.\r\n\r\nAnother important manganese mining region is the Nicopol district, in\r\nthe Province of Ekaterinoslav, north of the Black Sea. In this district\r\na bed of manganese oxides lies between clays and sandstone of Oligocene\r\nage. This bed is 1 to 5 feet thick, averaging nearly 3 feet. It is\r\nestimated to extend over an area of 20 square kilometers (7.5 square\r\nmiles) and to contain 7,400,000 tons of manganese ore. The ore is mined\r\nand washed in a crude way to free it from the attached clay.\r\n\r\nThe deposits in this district are probably owned largely by Russians,\r\nalthough French capital is interested in one company and German capital\r\nin another. During the period 1901 to 1910, between 80 and 90 per cent.\r\nof the production was consumed in southern Russia and the remainder was\r\nexported. From 1886, when the deposits were first exploited, the output\r\nrose rather steadily to the maximum of 271,000 tons in 1907, then\r\ndeclined to 173,000 tons in 1910. The total production of the district\r\nis about 1,800,000 tons.\r\n\r\nManganese deposits are also known in the Province of Podolien and\r\nTerek, and in the governments of Tiflis, Erwin, Elisabetpol, and Perm.\r\n\r\nThe principal manganese deposits of _Spain_ are on the south slope of\r\nSierra Morena, in the Province of Huelva. Vertical lenticular bodies\r\nof manganese carbonate and silicate with a little pyrite, garnet,\r\nand mica occur interlayered with slate of Paleozoic age. About one\r\nhundred bodies are known, many being 500 feet long and 100 feet wide,\r\nwhereas the largest is 3,300 feet long and 330 feet wide. The manganese\r\nminerals are weathered to oxides to an average depth of 65 feet and a\r\nmaximum depth of 250 feet. From 1881 to 1905, when the oxide ores were\r\nnearly exhausted, nearly 700,000 tons had been shipped. From 1906 to\r\n1910 about 125,000 tons of mixed carbonate and silicate was produced.\r\n\r\nManganese is also found in the Covadonga district, Province of Oviedo,\r\nwhere large boulders of manganese oxide are found in clay resulting\r\nfrom the weathering of underlying limestone. These deposits yielded\r\n3,800 tons in 1915. Other productive deposits occur in the provinces of\r\nSeville and Teruel. Deposits are also known in the provinces of Ciudad\r\nReal, Murcia, and Almeria.\r\n\r\nIn _Sweden_, there are manganese ores north of Philipstad, in Wermland,\r\nwhere tabular bodies of manganese oxides are interlayered with dolomite\r\nand magnetite. These deposits contributed 7,607 tons out of a total of\r\n7,733 tons in 1915, which was the maximum recorded production of Sweden.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Asia.=--In _India_, on the east coast in the Vizagapatam and Ganjam\r\ndistricts, Madras, is a unique group of rocks known as the Kodurite\r\nseries, containing manganese garnet, manganese pyroxene, potash\r\nfeldspar, apatite, and quartz. These rocks, supposed to be of igneous\r\norigin, have been deeply weathered and the manganese concentrated as\r\noxides in the surface zone. The manganese ore bodies have been explored\r\nonly to 100 feet in depth, but it is expected that they will extend to\r\n500 feet. The largest ore body explored at the Garbham mine is 1,600\r\nfeet long and 100 feet wide, and, from 1896 to 1913, yielded 736,192\r\ntons of ore. The Kodur deposit yielded 370,382 tons of ore from 1892 to\r\n1913. Production began in 1892, reached a maximum of 111,501 tons in\r\n1906, and slowly declined to 44,127 tons in 1913.\r\n\r\nManganese also occurs in the Balaghat, Bhandara, Chindwara, and Nagpur\r\ndistricts in the central provinces; Narukot and Panch Mahals districts,\r\nBombay; Jhabua district, central India; and the Gangpur district in\r\nBihar and Orissa. These districts form a belt that extends from Baroda,\r\non the west coast, across northern India nearly to Calcutta on the\r\neast, a distance of 700 miles. In these districts, beds of manganese\r\noxides with manganese garnet and rhodonite form a rock type known as\r\ngondite, which is interlayered with quartzite and mica schist. These\r\nrocks are considered to be sediments of the Dharwar group (Archean).\r\nThe manganese oxides may have been laid down as sediments, or may\r\nrepresent the weathering of the silicates. The ore bodies are lenses\r\nand layers. The largest single deposit, Balaghat, has the form of a\r\nshallow trough, is 1³⁄₄ miles long and 45 to 50 feet thick, and yielded\r\nfrom 1901 to 1913, 725,248 tons of ore. In 1913, thirteen distinct\r\ndeposits had yielded more than 100,000 tons each, the range being from\r\n101,721 to 725,248 tons.\r\n\r\nFrom 1901, when the deposits of this type were first exploited, the\r\nrate of production rose steadily to the maximum of 697,035 tons in\r\n1913. During 1907, fifty-two separate deposits contributed 598,437 tons.\r\n\r\nWhere rocks of Dharwar age (Archean), such as mica schists, that do\r\nnot seem to contain the manganese-bearing Gondite series, are deeply\r\nweathered, manganese and manganiferous iron oxides form irregular but\r\nlocally extensive deposits on the crests of hills. These deposits are\r\nunderlain by barren clays that represent the residue of the underlying\r\nrocks. The largest deposit yielded 160,000 tons of ore in three years,\r\n1906 to 1908, but is probably almost exhausted. The principal deposits\r\nof this class are in the Sandur Hills district, Madras; the Shimoga\r\ndistrict, Mysore; and the Belgaum district, in Bombay; which lie within\r\nan area less than 100 miles in diameter in southwest India. From\r\n1905, when deposits of this group were first explored, the production\r\nincreased to a maximum of 11,353 tons in 1909,then declined to 62,770\r\ntons in 1913. The total yield of this group to the end of 1913 was only\r\n765,401 tons.\r\n\r\nAs regards the commercial control of the manganese deposits, a law\r\nrecently passed forbids aliens to own more than a minor interest in\r\nmineral deposits in India. Previous to this, during 1907, the latest\r\nyear for which complete data are available and in which 899,055 tons\r\nwas produced, the entire output was from mines owned by resident\r\nEnglish or natives, except for 21,500 tons produced by the Carnegie\r\nSteel Co., of Pittsburgh, U. S. A.\r\n\r\nThe annual production of manganese ore in India rose steadily from\r\n1892, when the first shipments were made, to 1907, when 899,055 tons\r\nwas shipped; and since then has ranged from 450,000 to 815,000 tons.\r\nThe total production, up to and including 1916, was 8,748,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIndian ores are transported to the shipping ports by rail for distances\r\nranging from 56 miles for the Vizagapatam district to 783 miles for the\r\nChindwara district, with the result that freight charges are heavy.\r\nThe ports of export in order of tonnage handled are, Bombay, Mormugas,\r\nCalcutta, and Vizagapatam. The destination of exports in 1913 was as\r\nfollows: United Kingdom, 36 per cent.; Belgium (largely to Germany), 26\r\nper cent.; United States, 15 per cent.; France, 14 per cent.; Germany,\r\n2 per cent.; others, 7 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn the _Japanese Empire_, in the islands of Mutsu, Echigo, Ugo, and\r\nNato, are irregular lenticular bodies of rather pure manganese oxides\r\nthat occur more or less parallel to the bedding of metamorphosed\r\nPaleozoic sediments. Below water level, the oxides grade into rhodonite\r\nand are probably derived from this mineral. The ore bodies are not\r\nlarge, but many are known and they are the source of a small but\r\nregular production. In the islands of Mutsu, Nogo, Hokkaido and Ugo\r\nmany irregular but locally large deposits of manganese oxides are\r\nassociated with highly altered volcanic tuffs and flows of Tertiary\r\nage. Most of the deposits in Japan seem to be owned by natives in small\r\nholdings. The maximum production of 18,076 tons is reported for 1913,\r\nbut since 1900 the range has usually been from 5,000 to 15,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIn the _Philippine Islands_, manganese occurs on the islands of Ilocos\r\nNorte, Masbate, Bulacan, Pangasinan and Tarloc, largely as veinlets and\r\nboulders of oxides in weathered igneous rock. On Ilocos Norte a maximum\r\nproduction of 3,000 tons was attained in 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Africa.=--On the _Gold Coast of West Africa_ (a British colony), near\r\nDagwin, are several deposits of manganese, the largest being 400 feet\r\nlong and 70 feet wide. The concession is owned by a British exploration\r\ncompany. The deposit was discovered in 1914; and from the beginning\r\nof exploration in 1916 up to November 7, 1917, 28,465 tons had been\r\nshipped to England.\r\n\r\nIn the _Belgian Congo_, there is manganese ore in the valley of the\r\nUpper Fungwe River, and in southern Katanga. The deposits are too\r\nremote from the ocean to justify exploration, but are reported to be\r\nlarge. In the _Union of South Africa_ (British) several manganese\r\ndeposits are found along the sea coast, within 30 miles east and west\r\nof Capetown. Of the seven known deposits the largest is estimated to\r\ncontain 15,000 tons. In _Egypt_, in the Sinai peninsula, are large\r\nmanganiferous iron deposits as well as small manganese deposits, but\r\nnone has been exploited. In _Tunis_, there are deposits reported to\r\ncontain 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 tons of manganiferous iron ore, and also\r\nseveral manganese deposits which yielded 5,800 metric tons of manganese\r\nore in 1917.\r\n\r\nAlthough the known deposits of manganese in Africa are few and\r\nrelatively unimportant, the continent offers an unusual prospect for\r\nthe discovery of deposits that will contribute largely to the world’s\r\nsupply. Inasmuch as the moist tropical climate of large areas favors\r\nextraordinary rock decay and surface concentration of manganese oxides,\r\nexploration will probably show the presence of many deposits, and where\r\nbedrock geological conditions are favorable, large bodies may be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australasia.=--In _Australia_, there are deposits of manganese ore in\r\nNew South Wales, in Queensland, in South Australia, and in Victoria.\r\n\r\nIn _New Zealand_, deposits of manganese ore occur in the Thames\r\ndistrict, Auckland.\r\n\r\nDeposits of manganese ore are known in _Borneo_, at Maruda Bay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Annual output of manganese ore in chief\r\nproducing countries.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Percentage of manganese ore produced by chief\r\nproducing countries.]\r\n\r\nIt is reported that large deposits of high-grade ore have recently been\r\ndiscovered in _Java_.\r\n\r\nSome statistics of the production of manganese are shown graphically in\r\nfigures 5 and 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENTS AND CHANGES IN GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE\r\n\r\nThe known manganese resources of Russia, India, and Brazil are so\r\nlarge and readily available for exploitation and marketing that there\r\nis little prospect of their being displaced as the chief sources of\r\nthe world’s supply for many years. Since the war began, in 1914,\r\nseveral important new districts have been discovered and brought to the\r\nproducing stage, notably the Gold Coast of West Africa, western Costa\r\nRica, and Java. Although the Javan deposits are reported to be large\r\nand may become an important factor in the world’s trade, all that is\r\nknown concerning the other deposits does not hold out much hope that\r\nthey can compete with the established sources.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be a fair chance that the equatorial belt as well\r\nas several other parts of the earth may yield additional important\r\nmanganese deposits.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the manganese deposits of the world is shown in\r\nPlate III.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe table of production for 1913 on page 105 shows the part of the\r\ntotal that each country contributed and the known extent of commercial\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with deposits of several other important minerals, most of\r\nthe manganese deposits throughout the world are owned by natives or\r\nresidents of the respective countries in which they are found.\r\n\r\nGerman companies have acquired tracts in the Chiaturi and Nicopol\r\ndistricts, Russia, and Queluz (Lafayette) district, Brazil. It appears\r\nthat although one of these companies produces a little ore, the\r\nmain purpose was to stabilize an unorganized industry by financial\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nIn India it is difficult to distinguish between those companies\r\ncomposed of resident English and native Indians which were formed to\r\nexploit mines for profit and those composed of absentee English who\r\ndesire to secure a supply of ore for English or other consumption.\r\nThere seems to be no English capital in Brazil or Russia.\r\n\r\nOne French company owned two shipping mines in India in 1907, but\r\nthere is no record of operations in 1913.

S. A., owns and works\r\nseveral deposits in India. Although Americans own deposits in the\r\nNazareth district, Brazil, in Panama, and Costa Rica, and some of those\r\nof Cuba, there is no record of American ownership of any of the most\r\nimportant deposits of Brazil, nor of any in Russia.\r\n\r\nFrom 1902 to 1914, about half the ferromanganese used in the United\r\nStates was made in this country from foreign ore and half was imported\r\nfrom England, where it was made from imported ore. This tendency arises\r\nout of the limitations of blast-furnace smelting of the alloy and\r\nthe difference between the cost of labor in the United States and in\r\nEngland, but does not represent definite control, for ferromanganese\r\nmay be made in any modern blast furnace used to make pig iron. In order\r\nto smelt with maximum efficiency in making ferromanganese, however, a\r\nblast furnace should run continuously for long periods, and therefore\r\nmake 20,000 to 35,000 tons of alloy annually. Although it is possible\r\nto pass without interruption from making ferromanganese to spiegeleisen\r\nand then to pig iron, the change causes losses. Small steel works in\r\nthe United States therefore find it more advantageous to purchase\r\nimported ferromanganese than to make what they need.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE IMPORTANT NATIONS WITH REGARD TO MANGANESE SUPPLIES\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--Although from 1885 to 1890, deposits in the United\r\nStates supplied half or more of the needed high-grade manganese ore,\r\nfrom 1890 to 1916 the domestic production rather steadily declined to\r\na negligible minimum, while imports of foreign ore and ferromanganese\r\nsteadily rose in accord with the rate of total steel production. On\r\nthe other hand, during the period ending about 1908, when the rate of\r\nmanufacture of steel by the Bessemer process (in which spiegeleisen\r\nis largely used) exceeded that by the open-hearth process, the annual\r\ndomestic contribution of spiegeleisen largely made from domestic\r\nores greatly exceeded the imports. In advance, therefore, of the\r\nexploitation of the large deposits of low-grade ores of Minnesota,\r\nwhich have been the source of most of the production since 1916,\r\nthe United States demonstrated independence of foreign supplies of\r\nlow-grade ore and alloys.\r\n\r\nThe experience and information gained during the war, largely\r\nduring 1918, show conclusively, first, with respect to metallurgy,\r\nthat 20 to 30 per cent. spiegeleisen, as well as 60 to 70 per\r\ncent. ferromanganese, instead of 80 per cent., may be used to\r\nmake satisfactory grades of open-hearth steel without appreciably\r\nsacrificing rate of production or quality of product; and second, with\r\nrespect to ore production, that known domestic deposits can supply for\r\nat least five and probably ten or more years, much more low-grade ore\r\nthan is needed to make spiegeleisen, and for at least five years and\r\npossibly ten years, about one-third the high-grade ore needed for the\r\nmanufacture of alloy with 60 to 80 per cent. manganese. The reader\r\nshould note, however, that capacity of mines to meet demand is in large\r\nmeasure determined by the prices offered for the product, which during\r\n1918 were about five times those prevailing before the war. Beyond\r\ndoubt, at pre-war prices, the United States can not supply more than\r\nseveral per cent. of the high-grade ore needed to make ferromanganese.\r\n\r\nCitizens of the United States have not shown great interest in\r\npurchasing foreign deposits of manganese ore. With Cubans, they have\r\ncontrolled the mines yielding a large part of the Cuban output, and\r\nabout 1907 one company, the Carnegie Steel Co., purchased several\r\ndeposits in India. That company, however, seems to purchase ore, in\r\naddition to the output of its mines. Not until 1917 did Americans enter\r\nthe Brazilian fields; then the largest deposits of the relatively\r\nunimportant Bahia district were purchased by a Philadelphia group.\r\n\r\n\r\n=England.=--Before the war, England received about 50 per cent.\r\nof her manganese ore from India, 40 per cent. from Russia, 3 per\r\ncent. from Brazil, and small quantities from Spain and Portuguese\r\nIndia. Some low-grade ore also came from Spain, Algeria, and Greece.\r\nDomestic production was scarcely 1 per cent. of imports. Exports of\r\nferromanganese, largely to the United States, however, have been\r\nequivalent to 35 to 45 per cent. of the total imports of ore. Two\r\neffects of the war were to eliminate Russia as a source of ore, the\r\ndeficit being made up from India, and greatly to curtail exports of\r\nferromanganese. In contrast with the United States and Germany, Great\r\nBritain does not seem to contain deposits of low-grade ores capable of\r\nsupplementing the needs of high-grade ore.\r\n\r\nEngland controls fully 90 per cent. of the Indian output, probably\r\nthrough ownership by resident English and native Indians. On the\r\nother hand, England seems to have no control, direct or indirect, of\r\nthe output of Brazil, Russia, or of other important contributions to\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=France.=--Of the needed manganese ore, France imports from 35 to 45\r\nper cent. from India, 40 to 55 per cent. from Russia, about 10 per\r\ncent. from Spain, and several per cent. from Brazil, and produces about\r\n2 per cent. The domestic material, however, contains 30 per cent. or\r\nless manganese. In addition, France imports, as well as exports, a\r\nlittle ferromanganese from time to time.\r\n\r\nSo far as available data indicate, the French have made practically\r\nno foreign investments in manganese deposits, except in the Nicopol\r\ndistrict, Russia. A company with a French name mined about 1,300 tons\r\nin India in 1907, out of a total of 899,055 long tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany.=--Germany’s position with respect to manganese is very\r\nsimilar to that of the United States. For four years prior to 1914,\r\nGermany imported 48 to 68 per cent. of the total receipts from Russia,\r\n25 to 35 from India, 3 to 7 from Brazil, and small quantities from\r\nSpain, Greece, and Sweden. Domestic production of ore with more than\r\n30 per cent. manganese is negligible. Germany probably exports small\r\nquantities of ferromanganese to Sweden and other European countries,\r\nand from time to time has exported alloy to the United States.\r\n\r\nLike the United States, however, Germany possesses extensive deposits\r\nof ferruginous manganese ore with 12 to 30 per cent. manganese; and\r\nfrom 1908 to 1913, produced 260,000 to 330,000 metric tons of such\r\nmaterial, as well as 2,300,000 to 3,000,000 tons with 5 to 7 per cent.\r\nmanganese. There can be little doubt that although Germany, through\r\naccumulated stocks of manganese ore and seizures in Belgium, possessed\r\nin 1914 at least two years’ supply, she was able to maintain a fairly\r\nconstant rate of steel production for four years by adapting processes\r\nto economize high-grade ore and use low-grade.\r\n\r\nGermans appear to have purchased manganese deposits in Russia and\r\nBrazil only, and these have yielded only a small part of the annual\r\nimports. In the Chiaturi district of Russia, however, where most of\r\nthe deposits are owned by natives, a German company, Gelsenkirchen\r\nGesellschaft, reported to be a subsidiary of the Krupp company, was\r\nestablished about 1910, to purchase property as well as trade with and\r\noffer financial assistance to the producers. It is reported that this\r\ncompany alone exported about one-third of the output of the district.\r\nGermans are reported to own a part of one of several companies\r\noperating in the Nicopol district, Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nA review of the manganese ore industry, including features of the\r\ndeposits, their geographic distribution and ownership, indicates\r\nseveral definite conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. The surface outcrops of most manganese deposits give reliable\r\ninformation concerning the size and grade of the deposits, and the most\r\ndesirable ore occurs in a surface zone scarcely 100 feet deep.\r\n\r\n2. Except in Russia and Spain, the most productive mines are open-cuts,\r\nand mining is quickly and easily accomplished at minimum expense.\r\nExtensive operations in advance of production are rarely necessary.\r\n\r\n3. The countries that possess the largest and richest deposits have an\r\nabundant and cheap labor supply.\r\n\r\n4. The productive capacity of the known deposits so much exceeds the\r\nworld’s demand for ore for steel making, that if any single source is\r\ntemporarily eliminated, the demand can be wholly met by the remaining\r\nsources at prices that are only slightly higher than those previously\r\nprevailing.\r\n\r\n5. The value of the material at the sources of production is relatively\r\nlow among raw minerals, and ranges from one-third to one-eighth of the\r\nselling price at the points of consumption. It is evident that the cost\r\nof transportation represents a large part of the final price.\r\n\r\n6. The working of most deposits yields so little profit, and therefore\r\nis so hazardous, that only a few foreigners own deposits in the chief\r\nproducing countries.\r\n\r\n7. The only case of commercial control, that of the Chiaturi district,\r\nRussia, by Germans, who offer the natural market, seems to have been\r\nestablished to counteract local political disorders rather than to\r\neliminate competitive consumers.\r\n\r\n8. No nation that contributes largely to the world’s steel production,\r\nexcept Russia, possesses domestic deposits of manganese ore sufficient\r\nto meet its needs, and all must import ore from rather remote sources.\r\nThe United States and Germany, however, possess domestic deposits of\r\nferruginous manganese ore that under great stress would probably permit\r\nindependence of foreign sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCHROMIUM\r\n\r\nBY E. C. HARDER\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF CHROMIUM\r\n\r\nChromite is the principal ore from which metallic chromium and chromium\r\nproducts are obtained. The theoretical composition of chromite is\r\nrepresented by the formula FeO Cr₂O₃, which represents 32 per cent.\r\nferrous oxide and 68 per cent. chromic oxide. In many ores, however,\r\nthe ferrous oxide is partly replaced by magnesia, up to 30 per cent.,\r\nand the chromic oxide by alumina and ferric oxide, up to 20 per cent.\r\nThus the composition of chromite varies considerably. The percentage\r\nof chromic oxide may be as low as 10 per cent.; that of ferrous oxide\r\nmay range from 10 to 50 per cent. Other common minerals of chromium are\r\npicotite (chrome spinel), uvarovite (chrome garnet), chrome diopside\r\nand crocoite (lead chromate).\r\n\r\nChrome ore is consumed mainly in the manufacture of special steels\r\nand in tanning leather. The special steels comprise chrome steel,\r\nchrome-nickel steel, chrome-tungsten steel, and chrome-vanadium steel.\r\nMetallic chromium is added to such steel in the form of ferrochrome,\r\nan alloy of chromium and iron containing 60 to 70 per cent. metallic\r\nchromium. Chrome steel is tough and hard to break. It hardens rapidly\r\nand has a fine grain and a fibrous fracture; it does not break readily\r\nupon concussion and because of its hardness is difficult or impossible\r\nto cut with ordinary machine tools. Metallic chromium is present in\r\npercentages varying from 1 to 5 per cent. Special steels containing\r\nchromium are used for guns, armor plate, armor-piercing projectiles,\r\nautomobile parts, machine tools, bars for prisons, burglar-proof\r\nsafes, shoes, cutlery, crusher jaws, stampmills, springs and for other\r\narticles in which hardness and toughness are necessary. During the war,\r\nwhen a considerable shortage of chromite threatened, less chromium was\r\nused in chrome steels, and certain other hardening materials were used\r\nin its place. The results are said to have been unsatisfactory, however.\r\n\r\nFerrochrome used in the manufacture of chrome steels is produced in\r\nthe electric furnace by smelting a mixture, in proper proportions, of\r\nchromite, coal or coke, lime, and fluorspar or silica.\r\n\r\nMuch chrome ore is used in the steel industry for refractory materials\r\nin lining open-hearth furnaces. Some of the ore thus used is first\r\nmanufactured into chrome brick and some is utilized in the crude\r\nform. Chrome brick is used in open-hearth furnaces as a lining along\r\nthe slag line between the magnesite bottom of the furnace and the\r\nsilica-brick sides and roof. Chrome brick is used also to cover the\r\nports of gas-fired furnaces. It is desirable for these purposes\r\non account of its neutral reaction, which reduces the wear due to\r\ncorrosion. Lump or crushed chromite is used for patching the bottoms\r\nof open-hearth furnaces, particularly the toe or apex of the bottom,\r\nthe ore being either hammered in place as lump or crushed and mixed\r\nwith a little water or tar and clay and then tamped into place. The use\r\nof lump chrome in repairing such furnaces is desirable on account of\r\nthe rapidity with which the furnaces can be repaired and on account of\r\nthe greater wear that chromite will stand. The amount of chromite used\r\nfor this purpose ranges from 2 pounds to 10 pounds per ton of steel\r\nmanufactured. Magnesite has been used to replace chromite for repairing\r\nfurnaces, but has been found to be more expensive and to stand less\r\nwear.\r\n\r\nChrome brick is used in a minor way in electric furnaces for\r\nmanufacturing steel, in a belt along the slag line and in the\r\narea around the pouring lips. It is also being used in furnaces\r\nmanufacturing steel by the duplex process.\r\n\r\nChrome brick, besides being used in steel-making furnaces, is used in\r\nlining furnaces for making copper, nickel, and other metals. In these\r\nfurnaces it is used in the bottoms and around the tap holes. Magnesite\r\nbrick, as well as bauxite brick, have been used to replace chromite\r\nbrick for this purpose.\r\n\r\nChromium chemicals used for tanning are mainly sodium or potassium\r\nbichromates. About half of the bichromates produced in the United\r\nStates is commonly used for tanning, the remainder being used for\r\npaints, pigments, dry colors, and dyes in the paint, printing and\r\nengraving, and textile industries. Chrome yellow, chrome orange, and\r\nchrome black are used in calico printing and dyeing. Chromic oxide, or\r\nchrome green, is an indelible pigment employed in printing banknotes.\r\nVarious other chrome colors are used for paints and pigments as well as\r\nin the ceramic arts. The minor uses of chrome chemicals are many.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nChromite throughout the world is associated with basic igneous rocks,\r\nsuch as peridotite or pyroxenite, or with the alteration products\r\nof these rocks, such as serpentine, talc schist, and related rocks.\r\nChromite deposits are generally in the form of lenses, pods, or\r\nirregular masses that may occur singly or may be associated in groups.\r\nBesides being found as large bodies, chromite occurs as a minor\r\nconstituent of these rocks, being widely disseminated through them as\r\nsmall specks and particles. Chromite that forms workable deposits is\r\nbelieved to have been separated out of the molten mass of basic igneous\r\nrock by segregation and to have formed separate bodies within the rock\r\nmass during the cooling. Most chromite deposits are found along the\r\nborders of intrusive masses not far from the contact of older rocks\r\ninto which they are intruded. This is probably due to the formation of\r\nperipheral fractures during the cooling of the igneous mass, chromite\r\nbeing forced up into these openings. The action of convection-currents\r\nin the molten magma may also have resulted in localizing chromite\r\nbodies near the borders of the mass. However, bodies of chromite are\r\nquite abundant in other parts of the igneous masses as well, often\r\nbeing found at long distances from bordering rocks.\r\n\r\nBy weathering of chromite-bearing igneous rock, chromite bodies\r\nare freed and occur as loose masses in resultant residual clays.\r\nSuch bodies in clay are of commercial importance in many places.\r\nThe breaking down of chromite-bearing rocks results in setting\r\nfree disseminated specks and particles of chromite, and these may\r\nbe transported and later deposited along streams flowing out of\r\nchromite-bearing areas. In this manner accumulations of chromite sands\r\nare formed. Besides chromite, these sands usually contain considerable\r\nquantities of other heavy minerals such as magnetite, ilmenite, garnet,\r\nand rutile, and the chromite in them is generally not available\r\ncommercially.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION AND COMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe world’s chromite supply has been obtained mainly from the following\r\nsources, named roughly in order of their importance:\r\n\r\nNew Caledonia; southern Rhodesia; western and southern Asia Minor; Ural\r\nMountains, Russia; eastern Greece, adjacent islands, Macedonia, and\r\nSerbia; Baluchistan and Mysore, India; Quebec, Canada; Atlantic and\r\nPacific coast states, United States; State of Bahia, Brazil; Oriente,\r\nCuba; Japan; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Austria-Hungary; and Guatemala.\r\n\r\nThe geographic distribution of the more important deposits of chromite\r\nis shown in Plate IV.\r\n\r\nOther countries in which deposits of chromite are known but in which\r\nlittle or no ore has been produced are: Shetland Islands, Scotland;\r\nNorway; Sweden; Silesia; Portugal; New South Wales, Australia; New\r\nZealand; Transvaal; Togoland; and Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nTable 25 shows the output of chromite in the chief producing countries\r\nfrom 1905 to 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australasia.=--Important quantities of chromite occur on the island\r\nof _New Caledonia_, in the South Pacific, and in smaller amounts in\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, and Tasmania.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.--Geographical distribution of the chromite\r\ndeposits of the world.

Locally, large masses of fairly pure chromite are\r\nfound, generally as lenticular bodies in the serpentine, but locally as\r\nirregular masses in residual clay derived from the decomposition of the\r\nserpentine.\r\n\r\nChromite deposits of three types are known in New Caledonia, as\r\nfollows: Rock chrome, consisting of solid ore bodies in serpentine;\r\nresidual chromite, as irregular bodies or scattered masses, frequently\r\ndisintegrated, in red residual clay derived from the weathering of\r\nthe serpentine; and chrome sand and gravel in surface wash and stream\r\ndeposits. Ores of the first two classes are both important commercially\r\nin New Caledonia and are both present in most mines. Ores of the last\r\nnamed class are not worked.\r\n\r\nOf these New Caledonian deposits, that of Mt. d’Or, in the southern\r\npart of the island, was the first to be discovered and worked, being\r\nfound by Garnier in 1866. Later the deposits of Ngo Bay and others\r\nfurther south were exploited. Production and exportation of New\r\nCaledonian chromite began in the early 80’s and continued in a minor\r\nway until 1902, the production coming mainly from Mt. d’Or and the Ngo\r\nBay deposits.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, L. Bernheim formed the Société le Chrome, in which French\r\ncapital was largely interested. This company operated mines in the\r\nnorthern and southern parts of the island. It developed the Tiebaghi\r\ndeposits near the port of Pagoumene, now among the most important\r\nin New Caledonia. The exportation of chromite soon increased, and\r\ngradually New Caledonian ore replaced Turkish ore in the market. In\r\n1911 the Chrome Co., Ltd., of London, was formed and acquired from\r\nthe Société le Chrome the Tiebaghi and other mines. At the same time\r\nit acquired the right from the Rhodesia Chrome Mines Co., Limited,\r\nto market the Rhodesian ore, thus securing practically a monopoly of\r\nthe world’s chromite trade. The Chrome Co., Ltd., is controlled by\r\nFrench and English interests. Chalas & Sons, Finsbury Pavement House,\r\nLondon, E. C, are the largest stockholders. There were formerly German\r\nstockholders. L. Bernheim does not seem to be associated with the\r\nChrome Co., Ltd., but it is said that he still owns chromite deposits\r\nin New Caledonia. Besides the operations of the Chrome Co., Ltd.,\r\nthere are a number of independent operations in different parts of the\r\nisland. These are mainly under the control of inhabitants of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Africa.=--The important chromite deposits of southern _Rhodesia_\r\nare near the town of Selukwe, which is connected by railroad with\r\nthe shipping port of Beira. They occur scattered through an area of\r\nschist and serpentine. One hundred and twenty chromite bodies have been\r\nmapped out, but the only ones that have been developed are ten closely\r\ngrouped large bodies at Chrome Mine northwest of Selukwe. One of the\r\nlargest bodies is 180 feet wide and 240 feet long. The ores are high\r\ngrade, averaging between 48 and 51 per cent. chromic oxide.\r\n\r\nRecently considerable publicity has been given to the discovery of what\r\nare reported to be among the largest deposits of high-grade chromite\r\nin the world in the Umvukwe Hills in the Lomagundi district 30 miles\r\nfrom Banket Junction, southern Rhodesia. The ore is said to occur over\r\na large area in bodies in serpentine. More than two million tons is\r\nreported to have been uncovered. The deposits were discovered by Albert\r\nPeake, of Umvukwe Ranch, and are owned by Peake Brothers, who are said\r\nto have offered them to the Imperial government on special terms.\r\n\r\nChromite was mined in Rhodesia for the first time in 1905, the ore\r\ncoming from claims near Selukwe held by the Bechuanaland Exploration\r\nCompany, Ltd. Production steadily increased, slowly at first but more\r\nrapidly after 1910, when the Selukwe mines were taken over by the\r\nRhodesia Chrome Mines, Ltd. In 1910 the staking of chromite claims in\r\nthe Hartley district was reported and in 1911 chromite was discovered\r\nat Victoria. Shipments from Selukwe stopped in August, 1914, after the\r\ndeclaration of war, but began in December and increased during 1915\r\nand 1916. In 1917 the discovery of the large and valuable deposits of\r\nchromite in the Lomagundi district (already mentioned) was reported.\r\nPrevious to 1916 the entire production of Rhodesian chromite came from\r\nthe Selukwe mines of the Rhodesia Chrome Mines, Ltd. In 1917, however,\r\nanother company, the Rhodesia Metals Syndicate, Ltd., entered the field\r\nand is producing important amounts of ore.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Asia.=--Before _Turkey_ lost most of her European possessions after\r\nthe Balkan wars, the chromite deposits of the Kossowo, Uskub, and\r\nMonastir district of Serbia and the Saloniki district of Greece were\r\nwithin her borders. Now, however, only the deposits of _Asia Minor_\r\nremain to her.\r\n\r\nChromite deposits are widely scattered through many parts of _Asia\r\nMinor_ and are said to be numbered by the hundreds. The most important\r\ndeposits are grouped into three districts: In the regions of Brussa\r\nand Kutahia south of the Sea of Marmora, where the important Daghardi\r\ndeposits are found; near Macri, Denislu and around the Gulf of\r\nAdalia in the southwestern part of the peninsula, as well as on the\r\nneighboring Island of Rhodes; and near Mersina, Adana, Aleppo, and\r\nelsewhere in the region around the Gulf of Alexandretta northeast of\r\nthe Island of Cyprus. Smaller deposits are reported in the vilayets of\r\nAngora and Kastamuni in the north central part of Asia Minor and near\r\nBeirut and Damascus in Syria. All the ore bodies are found in more\r\nor less schistose and decomposed serpentine in groups of lenslike or\r\nirregular bodies.\r\n\r\nThe chromite mines of Asia Minor have produced important quantities of\r\nore. From about 1870, when Turkey began to supplant the United States\r\nas the world’s principal producer of chromite, to near 1900, Asia Minor\r\nfurnished the bulk of the chromite for the world’s consumption. Most\r\nof the ore mined has come from the mines in the Brussa region on the\r\nsouth and southwest slopes of the Mysian Olympus and from the mines\r\nof the Macri region. The Brussa and Kutahia deposits are said to have\r\nproduced an average of about 20,000 tons annually for many years, of\r\nwhich the Daghardi mine is said to have furnished nearly three-fourths.\r\nThis deposit consists of high-grade ore averaging 51 to 55 per cent.\r\nchromic oxide and has been estimated to contain about 10,000,000 tons\r\nof ore. Probably this is somewhat an exaggeration, although doubtless\r\nthe deposit is large and important.\r\n\r\nThe chromite mines in the Macri region have furnished a considerable\r\npart of the output of Asia Minor, but much of the ore mined in recent\r\nyears has been of low grade, running as low as 40 per cent. chromic\r\noxide. The chromite near Denislu and that near the Gulf of Adalia, on\r\nthe other hand, is said to be very rich, some deposits containing ore\r\naveraging as high as 56 per cent. chromic oxide.\r\n\r\nMost of the chromite mines of Asia Minor are probably now under the\r\ncontrol of the Turkish government, having reverted back ten or fifteen\r\nyears ago when increasing competition of New Caledonia chromite in\r\nforeign markets resulted in the shutting down of many of the mines. The\r\ntaxes on both worked and undeveloped mineral properties are so heavy\r\nin Turkey that unless mines are bringing in continuous and substantial\r\nrevenues, they cannot be held by private individuals.\r\n\r\nIt has been the policy of Turkey not to allow her mineral properties\r\nto fall into the hands of foreigners. Even while the exploitation of\r\nthe chromite deposits was most vigorous, therefore, the mines, although\r\nin many places worked by foreign firms, were largely owned by the\r\nTurkish government or by Turkish subjects who leased them. Thus in\r\n1904 the principal deposits near Brussa were owned by an officer of\r\nthe Porte and were operated by J. W. Whittal & Co., an English firm in\r\nConstantinople, while other deposits in the same district were worked\r\nby Patterson & Canghellari, an English company located in Smyrna. The\r\nfamous Daghardi deposit, in the Kutahia region, at that time was owned\r\nby the Turkish minister of marine and was operated by a Turk named\r\nRaghit Bey.\r\n\r\nIn the Macri district, a number of low-grade deposits were in 1904\r\nunder the control of Patterson & Co., of Smyrna, and the mines near\r\nthe Gulf of Adalia were controlled by a French syndicate. Some large\r\ndeposits near Denislu, in the interior, north of Macri, are said to be\r\nlying undeveloped owing to the refusal of the Turkish government to\r\npermit mining.\r\n\r\nThe chromite deposits in the region surrounding the Gulf of\r\nAlexandretta have been worked in a small way both by Turks and\r\nforeigners. Among operators in the region are mentioned Durian Effendi,\r\na Turk, representing the Ottoman Bank; Husni Herikizadeh Effendi, a\r\nTurk of Adana; Nader Brothers, of Mersina; Alfred Keun & Co. of Smyrna;\r\nProtopazzi Brothers, of Smyrna, and Mavrommati & Sons, of Mersina,\r\nboth probably Greek firms; Loizides, of Mersina; and Hadji Kemal Bey,\r\nof Constantinople. Durian Effendi is mentioned also as having operated\r\nchromite mines near Beirut.\r\n\r\nThe most important chromite deposits of _India_ are in the northern\r\npart of Baluchistan, but the mines of the Madras and Mysore districts\r\nin southern India have also furnished important amounts of ore. A\r\nsmall production has come from Bengal. The deposits of Baluchistan are\r\nlarge and the ore is rich, much of it averaging nearly 55 per cent.\r\nchromic oxide. One deposit is reported to be 440 feet long by 5 feet\r\nwide. The ore bodies are segregations in serpentine. The problem of\r\ntransportation is difficult, as the ores are far from the coast and\r\nland transportation facilities are poor. Nevertheless, those mines\r\nhave made a steady output since they were opened in 1903. The largest\r\nproduction was in 1907, when the yield exceeded 7,000 tons. Since then\r\nthere has been a decrease owing to competition from New Caledonia and\r\nRhodesia.\r\n\r\nChromite ore bodies were exploited in Madras as early as 1861 and small\r\namounts of ore were mined intermittently. The ores are associated\r\nwith magnesite veins in serpentine. Since 1907 a steady production is\r\nrecorded from Madras, which has increased recently. Important deposits\r\nof chromite are found in Mysore. These deposits have produced more than\r\n2,000 tons of ore annually in recent years, which is reported to have\r\nbeen sent to the United States. The chromite deposits of Bengal are\r\nsaid to be small and unimportant. In Bombay a large body of low-grade\r\nchromite is said to measure 1,000 by 300 feet and to average 34 per\r\ncent. chromic oxide.\r\n\r\nBefore 1910 chromite mining in _Japan_ was sporadic and unimportant,\r\nbut since 1910 the output has been steady and increasing. The principal\r\noccurrences of chrome ore are in the southwestern part, the mines\r\nof Wakamatsu, in Hoki, being the most important. The ore is said to\r\naverage about 40 per cent. chromic oxide. Chromite is also reported to\r\noccur in the northern part of Japan. The Japanese chromite deposits are\r\nsmall and soon exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe principal chromite deposits of _Russia_ are in the southern part of\r\nthe Ural Mountains and are associated with serpentine and soapstone.\r\nThe deposits are classed under three heads: Large granular masses in\r\nserpentine, finely disseminated chromite in serpentine, and chromite\r\nsand in platinum- and gold-bearing placers. The characteristic\r\noccurrence of chromite bodies in the Urals is as segregations within\r\nareas of dunite largely altered to serpentine. Platinum in scattered\r\ngrains is associated with chromite in the dunite in several places.\r\nRecently chromite deposits have been reported in the northern part of\r\nthe Caucasus Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Europe.=--The chromite deposits of the _Balkan Peninsula_ may be\r\ngrouped into four main districts: central Serbia; southern Serbia;\r\nSaloniki, in eastern Macedonia; and Magnesia, southern Thessaly, and\r\nthe neighboring islands. The chromite deposits are found in serpentine\r\nderived from the alteration of peridotite.\r\n\r\nThe chromite mines of _Serbia_ and _Macedonia_ for many years furnished\r\na small production, credited to European Turkey, which before the\r\nlast Balkan War embraced all the chromite-bearing areas. Many of the\r\ndeposits of central Serbia are poorly situated with reference to\r\ntransportation, the ore being hauled on carts to the railroad stations\r\nand thence by rail to the coast. In eastern Macedonia some of the\r\nmines are relatively near the coast and the ore is carried on carts\r\nto Saloniki. The mines of Serbia and Macedonia were worked in part by\r\nindividuals and in part by the same firms which mined the chrome ores\r\nof Asia Minor, such as Patterson & Co., Whittal & Co., and others.\r\n\r\nThe chromite mines of Magnesia, Thessaly, and adjacent islands in\r\neastern _Greece_ have furnished a more or less continuous output for\r\nthe last 30 or 40 years. The ore mined, however, has been mainly of low\r\ngrade, most of it averaging between 30 and 40 per cent. chromic oxide.\r\nIt is said to be used largely for refractory purposes. Before 1908 most\r\nof the Grecian production of chromite came from the mines of Magnesia,\r\nbut more recently the mines of southern Thessaly have furnished most of\r\nthe ore. Mines in the Grecian Archipelago have also furnished some ore.\r\nThe annual output of Greece has varied from a few hundred tons to more\r\nthan 15,000 tons. During the past 20 years it has rarely fallen below\r\n5,000 tons.\r\n\r\nChromiferous iron ore in considerable quantity is mined in Greece,\r\nmost of it being exported. In 1913 ten or more mines were worked. The\r\nproduction has averaged more than 100,000 tons annually. The mines are\r\noperated in part by Greek and in part by French and British firms.\r\n\r\nThe chromic iron ores produced in the former _Austrian Empire_ have\r\ncome mainly from the central part of Bosnia, but the chromite mines in\r\nUpper Styria and those on the Roumanian border have also furnished an\r\nappreciable output, the ore being low-grade. The deposits of Bosnia are\r\nin serpentine. The ore is of good quality and has been mined for use\r\nas a furnace lining. On and near the left bank of the Danube River in\r\nthe Banat, Hungary, there is an extensive area of serpentine containing\r\nchromite in bunches. The deposits have been worked to a slight extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=North America.=--In _Canada_ chromite-bearing areas of considerable\r\nextent are found in the southern part of the Province of Quebec, where\r\nnearly all the productive chromite mines of Canada are situated. The\r\nore occurs in serpentine in irregular masses and pockets without\r\ndefinite form, that range in size up to 75 feet along the longer axis,\r\nrarely reaching 100 feet. The amount of high-grade ore in the Quebec\r\nchromite deposits is not large, but low-grade ore bodies which under\r\nnormal market conditions can not be mined at a profit are numerous\r\nand of large size. The low-grade ores range in content of chromic\r\noxide from less than 20 per cent. to 35 or 40 per cent. Nearly all\r\nthe Canadian ore mined has been exported to the United States. From\r\n1910 to 1914 the output of chrome ore from the Quebec mines was\r\ninsignificant, owing to the cost of mining low-grade ores and the lack\r\nof a market for them. When the price of chromite rose late in 1914,\r\nAmerican firms began active developments in the field, and subsequently\r\ntwo concentrators were built by the Mutual Chemical Co. The output of\r\nCanadian chromite, both of crude ore and concentrates, during the war\r\nperiod was noteworthy, the production rising from 121 long tons in\r\n1914, to 47,035 long tons in 1916 and 43,725 long tons in 1917.\r\n\r\nThe principal American firms interested in the development of the\r\nCanadian chromite deposits during the past few years have been the\r\nMutual Chemical Co., the Harbison-Walker Refractories Co., the\r\nElectrometallurgical Co., and the Quebec Asbestos & Chrome Co. The\r\nlast-named company purchased one of the concentrators built by the\r\nMutual Chemical Co., and has furnished a considerable output both\r\nof crude ore and concentrates. Canadian firms have also produced\r\nconsiderable ore.\r\n\r\nWith the close of the war and the drop in the price of chromite, the\r\nCanadian mines have been largely abandoned. It is possible, however,\r\nthat some American firms that mine ore for use in their own plants may\r\ncontinue work on a small scale.\r\n\r\nWhen the _United States_ was the world’s principal chromite-producing\r\ncountry, the output came from the eastern United States and principally\r\nfrom Maryland. The Wood chrome mine and neighboring deposits in\r\nBaltimore and Harford counties furnished most of the production.\r\nSmaller amounts were mined in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe principal chromite deposits of the United States, and those that\r\nhave furnished nearly all the ore produced in recent years, are in\r\nCalifornia and Oregon. Recently deposits of some extent have been\r\nfound in Montana, but these have not reached the producing stage. The\r\nchromite deposits of California are for the most part grouped into\r\nfour principal districts, the Klamath Mountains region of northwestern\r\nCalifornia and southwestern Oregon; the Coast Range of west central\r\nCalifornia; the Sierra Nevada range throughout a considerable part of\r\nits length; and the San Luis Obispo district of southwestern California.\r\n\r\nThe chrome ores of California and Oregon form lenses or irregular\r\nbodies in serpentine and related rocks. Many of the ore bodies are\r\nfound in comparatively fresh peridotite and dunite, and the intimate\r\nrelation between the chromite and the associated pyroxene or olivine is\r\nwell shown. In places, also, chromite masses are found in the mantle of\r\nresidual material derived from the alteration of serpentine and other\r\nrocks. Most of the chrome ores of the Pacific Coast are of low-grade,\r\nfew running more than 45 per cent. chromic oxide. Concentrating plants\r\nhave been built to beneficiate the ore from bodies large enough to\r\nwarrant such expenditure. At some plants the grade of ore was thus\r\nraised to more than 52 per cent. Locally small bodies of high-grade ore\r\nhave been found.\r\n\r\nThe chromite mines of the eastern United States were first worked about\r\n1827 and continued to be operated for about forty years. The California\r\ndeposits began to be developed about 1870, but never furnished a large\r\noutput until the war raised the price of chromite to unprecedented\r\nfigures and ore could be produced at a profit in spite of high costs\r\nand high freight rates to consuming centers. The chromite mines of\r\nthe United States have always been worked and controlled by American\r\ncapital. In California the ore has been mined mainly by private\r\nindividuals working small scattered deposits. A few large firms, such\r\nas the California Chrome Co., the Adams & Maltby Co., L. H. Butcher\r\nCo., and the Union Chrome Co., worked on a larger scale during the war\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nDeposits of chromite have been known in Alaska for a number of years,\r\nbut not until the war brought high prices was it possible to mine\r\nthem at a profit. The deposits of present importance are near the\r\nsouthwestern end of the Kenai Peninsula. About 1,000 tons of ore\r\ncontaining 46 to 49 per cent. chromic oxide was mined in 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n=South America, Central America and Cuba.=--As far as is known, only\r\none chromite-bearing district of importance occurs in South America,\r\nthis being in the State of Bahia, in _Brazil_. One deposit has been\r\nworked at this locality by E. J. Lavino & Co., of Philadelphia, and\r\nthe discovery of several neighboring deposits is reported. The first\r\nshipments of ore were made in February, 1918, and by July 1, 1918,\r\n12,620 tons had been sent to the United States. The deposits are said\r\nto be owned by Newman & Co., a firm of American exporters in Bahia.\r\nThey are leased to E. J. Lavino & Co., of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nSouth America, outside of Brazil, has no known chromite deposits\r\nof importance. In _Colombia_, chrome ore is reported to exist near\r\nAntioquia and chromiferous pig iron is said to have been produced by\r\nthe blast furnace near Medellin. In _Venezuela_, chrome ore is said to\r\noccur on Coro Peninsula.\r\n\r\nImportant chromite deposits lie along the north coast of _Cuba_ in\r\nthe provinces of Camaguey and Oriente. A small deposit is found in\r\nthe northwestern part of the Province of Matanzas. The most important\r\ndeposits in Cuba are those at the Caledonia mine, south of the Bay of\r\nNipe and northeast of the Bethlehem Steel Co.’s Mayari iron mines.\r\nThese deposits are estimated to contain about 40,000 tons of ore in\r\nsight. They are owned and worked by the Bethlehem Steel Co., which\r\nbegan exploitation in the spring of 1918. Shipments during 1918\r\namounted to 8,820 tons. Next in importance to the deposits at the\r\nCaledonia mine are those along the coast, northeast of Baracoa, known\r\nas the Cayoguan and Potosi deposits, where about 35,000 tons of ore\r\nis estimated to be in sight. The deposits are on the north edge of a\r\nrugged mountain range forming the eastern end of Cuba. The Cayoguan\r\nclaims are owned by Brady interests, American, and the Potosi claims by\r\nthe Harbison-Walker Refractories Co., of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Camaguey the deposits are found northeast of the\r\ntown of Camaguey. They consist chiefly of masses of ore in residual\r\nclay and float on the surface. The underlying rock is serpentine. The\r\nCamaguey deposits are owned in part by Lehigh University and in part by\r\nCubans. The estimated reserves are 20,000 tons.\r\n\r\nExploitation of the chromite deposits of Cuba began in the fall of 1917\r\nand continued during the spring and summer of 1918. Only the Caledonia\r\nmine has produced ore. The chromite deposits are all associated with\r\nareas of serpentine.\r\n\r\nChromiferous iron ores that are destined to play an important part in\r\nthe American iron and steel industry are found at Mayari, Camaguey, and\r\nMoa, along the northeastern coast of Cuba. The reserves are measured\r\nin hundreds of millions of tons. Only the Mayari deposits are mined at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nChromite deposits were developed in the interior of _Guatemala_ in\r\n1917 and shipments started in the autumn. The deposits were owned and\r\noperated by the International Railways of Central America, an American\r\ncompany, and are situated in the hills 100 miles inland from Puerto\r\nBarrios. The ore is in serpentine. It is very pure and is especially\r\ndesirable for chemical purposes. The average chromic oxide content\r\nof the shipments during 1918 was 58 per cent., thus making this the\r\nhighest grade ore that came to the American market. The ore was used by\r\nthe Grasselli Chemical Co. Because of the distance from the railroad,\r\nthese ores are very expensive to mine, and it was only on account\r\nof the high prices paid for chromite during the war that they were\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF LEADING COMMERCIAL NATIONS\r\n\r\nThe country that leads in the manufacture of chromium products, such\r\nas ferrochrome and chrome chemicals, is the United States. In normal\r\ntimes the United States consumes more than one-third of the annual\r\nconsumption of chromite by the world. In 1913 the chromite used by\r\nmanufacturers of ferrochrome and chrome chemicals in the United States\r\namounted to 65,000 tons. Owing to the war, the consumption increased\r\nmarkedly until 1917, when it was nearly 130,000 tons. The normal\r\nconsumption of chromite in England is about 25,000 tons and in France\r\napproximately 35,000 tons. These amounts have not greatly increased in\r\nrecent years. Germany is an important producer of chromium products,\r\nnormally consuming 30,000 tons of chromite annually. Russia and the\r\nformer Austrian Empire used perhaps 5,000 tons each annually. Norway\r\nand Sweden use small amounts. Russia’s consumption has been mainly in\r\nthe manufacture of chromium chemicals, and that of the former Austrian\r\nEmpire was principally for refractory purposes. In Norway and Sweden\r\nsmall amounts of ferrochrome are produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--The United States, although the world’s largest\r\nconsumer of chromite, is not an important producer of this mineral\r\nin normal times. During the 30 years preceding the war, the annual\r\nproduction never exceeded 4,000 long tons of crude ore, and during the\r\nlast 15 years preceding the war the largest annual production was 598\r\nlong tons, in 1909. The production in 1913 was less than 1 per cent. of\r\nthe domestic requirements.\r\n\r\nThe chromite supply of the United States has, therefore, come largely\r\nfrom foreign sources, and these sources have been mainly Asia Minor,\r\nRhodesia, and New Caledonia. Before 1905 Turkey in Asia was the\r\nprincipal source of supply. Since then, however, Rhodesia and New\r\nCaledonia have largely replaced Turkey in the American chrome market.\r\n\r\nAlthough numerous deposits of chromite occur in the western United\r\nStates and locally in the eastern states, these deposits are usually\r\nsmall and scattered or of low grade. On account of their physical\r\ncharacter, small size, scattered occurrence, or distance from consuming\r\ncenters, domestic chromite could not be furnished to consumers in\r\nthe required grade or for the price that chromite from rich foreign\r\ndeposits could be furnished. For this reason the American chromite\r\ndeposits remained undeveloped and no ore was mined except small\r\nquantities which were consumed for refractory purposes in neighboring\r\nmetallurgical works.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1914, at the beginning of the war, the price of chromite\r\nincreased, production was immediately stimulated, this being shown by\r\nthe rapid increase in output from 591 long tons of crude ore in 1914 to\r\nabout 82,350 long tons of crude ore in 1918, equivalent to about 66,554\r\ntons of ore on the basis of 50 per cent. chromic oxide. Even this\r\nlargely increased domestic output, however, filled only little more\r\nthan one-half of the American requirements, the total amount of chrome\r\nore consumed in 1918 being about 104,000 long tons on the basis of 50\r\nper cent. chromic oxide. Had the market for chromite kept up, however,\r\nthe domestic mines would have supplied a much larger proportion of\r\nthe requirements in 1919. The consumption of chromite in the United\r\nStates in 1913 amounted to 65,000 tons of ore containing 50 per cent.\r\nchromic oxide. From this it rose to about 127,000 tons in 1917, which\r\nrepresents the maximum annual consumption thus far.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the production and imports of chromite on the\r\nbasis of 50 per cent. chromic oxide, from 1913 to 1918, as well as the\r\ntotal quantity available for consumption for these years. No chromite\r\nis exported from the United States.\r\n\r\nTABLE 26.--PRODUCTION AND IMPORTS OF CHROMITE, UNITED STATES, 1913-1918\r\n\r\n  ----+-----------+-----------+---------------\r\n      |           |           |Total available\r\n      |Production | Imports   |for consumption\r\n      |(long tons)|(long tons)|  (long tons)\r\n  ----+-----------+-----------+---------------\r\n  1913|     230   |   65,180  |     65,410\r\n  1914|     530   |   74,578  |     75,108\r\n  1915|   2,756   |   73,762  |     76,318\r\n  1916|  39,509   |  110,849  |    150,358\r\n  1917|  36,729   |   64,978  |    101,707\r\n  1918|  66,554   |   92,678  |    159,232\r\n  ----+-----------+-----------+---------------\r\n\r\nThe prices paid for domestic chromite in the United States in recent\r\nyears ranged from an average of $11.19 per ton in 1913 to an average of\r\nabout $24.00 per ton in 1917.\r\n\r\nWhen the need of increased shipping was felt in the latter part of\r\n1917, steps were taken to reduce the imports of chromite from distant\r\ncountries, such as Turkey, New Caledonia, and Rhodesia, to increase\r\nthe imports from nearby sources such as Brazil, Cuba, and Canada, and\r\nto urge the maximum production from domestic mines. As a result, the\r\nimports of chromite from Brazil were 17,854 long tons of crude ore\r\nand from Cuba 8,821 long tons of crude ore in 1918. The only previous\r\nproduction in Cuba was 34 long tons in 1916 and 17 long tons in 1917.\r\nBrazil had no production before 1918. The imports from Canada amounted\r\nto 20,949 long tons of crude ore in 1918, as compared to 19,021 long\r\ntons of crude ore in 1917, and 12,220 long tons of crude ore in 1916.\r\nIn order to reduce the importation of chromite from countries far\r\noverseas, various restrictions were put into effect by the War Trade\r\nBoard in the early part of 1918.\r\n\r\nThe development of domestic chromite supplies means the depletion\r\nof limited resources, high cost of production, use of lower-grade\r\nores, and lowered efficiency in consumption. With the free access of\r\nhigh-grade foreign ores, the market for domestic ores, therefore,\r\ndisappears; and the domestic chromite-mining industry can not survive\r\nto any large extent. If world conservation of raw materials or the\r\nbest use of the world’s resources is of chief importance, the domestic\r\nchromite-mining industry should be allowed to decline, and cheaper\r\nand higher-grade foreign ores should be allowed to replace domestic\r\nchromite. Experience during the past few years has shown that the\r\nchromite deposits of the United States, supplemented by imports from\r\nCanada, Brazil, and Cuba, can largely supply the domestic requirements\r\nfor a limited period.\r\n\r\nThe United States controls only a small part of the chromite reserves\r\nof the world. American firms own the principal Cuban deposits and\r\ncontrol the Brazilian deposits through leases. The United States is,\r\ntherefore, dependent to a large extent upon the good will of France\r\nand England for a continuous supply of chrome ore, these two countries\r\njointly being largely in control of the chromite reserves of Rhodesia\r\nand New Caledonia. Turkey controls most, if not all, of the chromite\r\ndeposits of Asia Minor, but because of their enclosed situation on the\r\nMediterranean, these deposits could not be relied upon as a source of\r\nsupply in time of need. The same is true of the deposits of the Ural\r\nregion in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe chief chromite-consuming firms in the United States are the\r\nElectrometallurgical Co., probably the largest producer of ferrochrome\r\nin the world; the Mutual Chemical Co., and the National Electrolytic\r\nCo., large producers of chromium chemicals, and the Harbison-Walker\r\nRefractories Co., American Refractories Co., and various steel-making\r\nplants, users of chromite for refractory purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Great Britain.=--Before the war Great Britain consumed annually about\r\n25,000 tons of chromite, most of it being used by Blackwell & Sons,\r\nLtd., for the manufacture of ferrochrome. The ferrochrome made in\r\nEngland, however, is not sufficient to supply the needs of the British\r\nsteel industry, and much is imported from France.\r\n\r\nExcept for unimportant occurrences in the Shetland Islands there are no\r\nchromite deposits in the British Isles, and Great Britain is therefore\r\ndependent entirely upon overseas sources of supply. British colonies,\r\non the other hand, are rich in chromite deposits, and as long as\r\nBritish ships have freedom of movement on the ocean, they will have\r\naccess to the more important chromite deposits of the world.\r\n\r\nOwing to their richness and large size, the most important of all the\r\nBritish-controlled deposits are those of Rhodesia. Only one of many\r\ndeposits in this area is being operated, and the reserves in untouched\r\nore bodies are undoubtedly large, comparable perhaps with those of New\r\nCaledonia.\r\n\r\nThe production of the Rhodesian chrome mines has in recent years\r\naveraged in the neighborhood of 60,000 tons annually or about 35 per\r\ncent. of the world’s production, and doubtless the output could be very\r\ngreatly increased if other known deposits were developed. However,\r\neven the present production is more than twice the actual chromite\r\nrequirements of Great Britain. These requirements, however, do not\r\nrepresent the needs for metallic chromium or chromium compounds, and if\r\nFrance should cease to supply Great Britain with ferrochrome, a much\r\nlarger amount of the raw material, chromite, would be necessary for the\r\nEnglish steel industry.\r\n\r\nBesides the chromite deposits of South Africa, chromite deposits of\r\nimportance are found in other British colonies, notably in British\r\nIndia and Canada. Amounts of chromite varying from 2,000 tons to 10,000\r\ntons have been produced annually in British India for many years,\r\ncoming mainly from Baluchistan, in the northwestern part, but a small\r\nproduction has come also from Mysore, in the southern part. In early\r\nyears, India furnished a more important part of the world’s supply of\r\nchromite than at present. Transportation is a serious difficulty in the\r\nmining of these deposits and when New Caledonian and Rhodesian ores\r\nbecame developed, the Indian ores dropped in importance.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian deposits, while of considerable extent, and having ready\r\naccessibility to eastern American markets, have not been extensively\r\nor continuously mined, on account of their low-grade character. By\r\nconcentration, a medium high-grade product can be obtained, but\r\nconcentration methods are expensive and bring the cost of the material\r\nup to such an extent that it can not compete with other ores now on the\r\nmarket. Thus, the cost of producing both Indian and Canadian ores is\r\nsuch that under normal conditions it is difficult to find a market for\r\nthem, but in case of necessity, a considerable tonnage can be supplied\r\nfrom these sources.\r\n\r\nOther British colonies in which deposits of chromite exist are New\r\nSouth Wales, Tasmania, and New Zealand. As far as known, the deposits\r\nin these countries are small and only those of the first have furnished\r\na small production.\r\n\r\nBesides controlling chromite deposits in many parts of the world\r\nthrough her colonial possessions, Great Britain controls deposits\r\nthrough British firms with foreign possessions. Thus, the Chrome\r\nCo., Ltd., of mixed British and French interests, controls not only\r\nthe Rhodesian chromite output but also owns and controls most of the\r\nimportant New Caledonian mines.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has in the past received most of her supplies of chromite\r\nfrom Rhodesia, New Caledonia, and Turkey. Although more than enough\r\nchromite is produced in Rhodesia to supply the British needs, England\r\nhas allowed most of the Rhodesian ore to be exported to other countries\r\nand has imported foreign ore for part of her own needs. Probably the\r\nlargest part of the Rhodesian output before the war went to the United\r\nStates. Much of the ore consumed in England has come from Turkey, where\r\nEnglish firms have been interested in chromite mining for many years.\r\nMost of the Indian output probably has been used in Great Britain, but\r\na part has gone to France.\r\n\r\n\r\n=France.=--A few deposits of chromite are known in France, but they\r\nare of no importance commercially. France, therefore, like England,\r\nis entirely dependent upon overseas sources for her chromite supply.\r\nUnlike England, however, France has only one colony, New Caledonia,\r\ncontaining important chromite deposits; but luckily this colony\r\ncontains enough to make it one of the world’s principal sources of\r\nchromite.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Chrome Co., Ltd., which controls the principal New\r\nCaledonian chromite deposits and is the largest shipper, represents\r\nboth English and French capital, France through political means can\r\ncontrol the output of chromite from the island. While in the past\r\nprobably the major part of the chromite used in France has come from\r\nthis source, France has also used Rhodesian and Turkish ores and\r\nprobably Russian ores to a considerable extent, and much New Caledonian\r\nore has gone to Germany, the United States and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe principal French firms manufacturing ferrochrome are the Société\r\nElectrometallurgique Française, at La Praz; Société La New Metallurgie,\r\nat Giffre; Société Anonyme Electrometallurgique, at Albertville;\r\nKeller, Leleux et Cie, at Livet; Société Electrometallurgique de Saint\r\nBeron, at Saint Beron; Ch. Betrolus, at Bellegarde; and Rochette\r\nFrères, at Epierre.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany.=--Except for unimportant low-grade deposits in Silesia,\r\nGermany has no chromite supplies within her borders. As a user of\r\nchromite Germany ranks in importance with France, most of the ore\r\nconsumed being used in the manufacture of ferrochrome, the principal\r\nmanufacturers of which have been the Krupp works. Chrome chemicals are\r\nalso made in abundance, however. None of Germany’s former colonies\r\nis known to have chromite deposits except Togoland, and the Togoland\r\ndeposits are undeveloped and are believed to be unimportant.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Germany has received chromite from New Caledonia,\r\nRhodesia, Turkey, Greece, and probably Russia. Because of the long rail\r\nhaul from Russia and the poor state of development of the industry\r\nin Turkey, the ores from these two countries were, in the years\r\nimmediately preceding the war, being largely replaced by ores from\r\noverseas. The four large chromite-consuming countries have, therefore,\r\nall been looking mainly to New Caledonia and Rhodesia for their sources\r\nof supply.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, when overseas chromite was not available, Germany was\r\nenabled by her relations with Turkey to obtain chromite from Asia\r\nMinor, and probably from chromite mines in Serbia, Hungary, Bosnia, and\r\nHerzegovina. Thus in time of need, when the usual overseas sources of\r\nsupply were cut off, Germany, through her relations with neighboring\r\ncountries, was able to obtain by land sufficient chromite to supply her\r\nordnance requirements. Had the war continued Germany would doubtless\r\nhave developed the chromite resources of the Urals, and those, together\r\nwith the deposits of Asia Minor, even in their present state of\r\ndevelopment, could have kept Germany supplied indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that German control became important in the mines\r\nof Asia Minor during the war. By relatively small improvements in\r\ntransportation facilities, such as building branch railroad lines\r\nto the principal deposits, the chromite mines of Asia Minor might be\r\nrejuvenated to such an extent as to enable the ores to compete with\r\nRhodesian and New Caledonian ore and to place them again among the\r\nworld’s large producers. The deposits are large and the reserves rank\r\nin importance with those of Rhodesia and New Caledonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Russia.=--Russia is independent as far as her requirements of chromite\r\nare concerned. Out of her production of about 20,000 tons annually,\r\nthe domestic industry consumes less than one-fourth and the rest is\r\navailable for export to nations less favored with chromite resources.\r\n\r\nMost of the chromite used in Russia goes into the manufacture of chrome\r\nchemicals. The Russian bichromate works at Elabouga, east of Kazan,\r\nestablished in 1892, have consumed about 2,000 tons of ore annually.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe political and commercial control of the principal chromite deposits\r\nof the world is summarized in the following table:\r\n\r\nTABLE 27.--POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL CONTROL OF CHROMITE DEPOSITS\r\n\r\n                           Political          Predominant\r\n        Country             control        commercial control\r\n\r\n  New Caledonia             French           French-British\r\n  Rhodesia                  British          British\r\n  Asia Minor                Turkish          Turkish\r\n  Ural Mountains, Russia    Russian          Russian-British\r\n  Greece                    Grecian          Uncertain\r\n  Serbia                    Serbian          Uncertain\r\n  India                     British          Probably British\r\n  Canada                    British          United States-Canadian\r\n  United States             United States    United States\r\n  Brazil                    Brazilian        United States\r\n  Cuba                      Cuban            United States\r\n  Japan                     Japanese         Japanese\r\n  Austria-Hungary           Austrian         Uncertain\r\n  Guatemala                 Guatemalan       United States\r\n\r\nGreat Britain and France produce in their colonial possessions chromite\r\nenough for their own needs and for export, but the United States,\r\nthe world’s largest consumer, must depend, except in time of extreme\r\nemergency, upon imports, mainly from New Caledonia and Rhodesia.\r\n\r\nVarious countries have from time to time played important rôles in\r\nsupplying the world’s demand for chromite. One country after another\r\nhas been displaced, as cheaper or better grades of chromite came into\r\nthe market. At times these changes were caused by the finding of larger\r\nbodies of higher-grade ores than had previously been mined, and at\r\nother times they were caused by cheaply transported ores replacing ores\r\ninconveniently situated with reference to centers of consumption.\r\n\r\nThus, at the beginning of the nineteenth century and up to about\r\n1830, the Ural Mountain region of Russia supplied the major part of\r\nthe world’s requirements for chromite, which were small. About 1830,\r\nimportant discoveries of chromite were made in the eastern United\r\nStates, particularly in Maryland, and the United States soon displaced\r\nRussia as the leading producer of chromite. After this, for many years,\r\nthe United States continued to lead in chromite production until about\r\n1870, when the domestic deposits gradually approached exhaustion and\r\nimportant deposits discovered in European Turkey and Asia Minor began\r\nto be extensively developed.\r\n\r\nAsia Minor was the principal chromite-producing country from about\r\n1870 until about the beginning of the twentieth century. The deposits\r\ncontinued to be worked fairly steadily on account of their richness and\r\nlarge size, although they were inconveniently situated with reference\r\nto transportation. Only certain deposits, such as those in the Macri\r\nand Alexandretta regions, were so near to the coast that the ore could\r\nbe carried on muleback or by camel to the shipping ports. From the\r\nlarger deposits, such as Daghardi, the ore had to be transported by\r\nanimals to railroad stations, often a distance of many miles, and then\r\nby rail to the coast. Because of these difficulties, Turkish ore was\r\nlargely replaced by ore from the important New Caledonian and Rhodesian\r\ndeposits as soon as those were developed.\r\n\r\nIn New Caledonia labor is cheap and the deposits are all near the\r\ncoast. By means of sailing vessels and tramp steamers which charge low\r\nrates and often require such heavy materials as chromite for ballast,\r\nthis ore can be delivered to points of consumption at a relatively\r\nsmall cost. The Rhodesian chromite deposits are not as accessible from\r\nthe coast, but they are large and rich and the rail freight rates to\r\nthe shipping port are exceptionally low. For this reason, Rhodesian ore\r\nhas been able to successfully compete in the market with New Caledonian\r\nore, and these two sources have, therefore, in recent years, jointly\r\nsupplied most of the requirements of the principal nations for chromite.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, because of abnormal conditions arising from the\r\nshortage of shipping facilities, there was considerable uncertainty\r\nas to whether it would be possible to supply American consumers of\r\nchromite with imported ores. Under the stimulus of much higher prices,\r\nthe production of chromite in the United States increased from 255 long\r\ntons of crude chromite in 1913, to about 82,350 tons in 1918, mainly\r\nfrom California, Washington and Oregon. This production was larger\r\nthan the annual production of crude ore from any single source (except\r\n82,910 tons from New Caledonia in 1906) since the chromite-mining\r\nindustry began. This production, of course, could not be continued\r\nwithout a rapid depletion of American chromite reserves, and does not\r\nrepresent a normal development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nNICKEL\r\n\r\nBY C. S. CORBETT\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF NICKEL\r\n\r\nNickel is used chiefly in the manufacture of special steels. It is\r\nestimated[65] that about 60 per cent. of the entire nickel production\r\ngoes into steel making in normal times and more under war conditions.\r\nNickel steels are the most important of all the alloy steels and are\r\nthe most used.[66] They are used where unusual tensile strength is\r\nrequired. Nickel-chromium steels are used in the manufacture of armor\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n  [65] Report of the Royal Ontario Nickel Commission, 1917, p. 300.\r\n\r\n  [66] STOUGHTON, BRADLEY: “The Metallurgy of Iron and Steel,” 1911.\r\n\r\nOrdinary nickel steels commonly carry about 3¹⁄₂ per cent. nickel.\r\n“Highly nickeliferous steels carrying up to 40 per cent. nickel are\r\nused for special purposes where non-magnetic qualities, resistance to\r\ncorrosion and, above all, no expansion or contraction, or any desired\r\nexpansion or contraction, with change of temperature, is important.”[67]\r\n\r\n  [67] Report of Royal Ontario Nickel Commission, 1917, p. 301.\r\n\r\nNon-ferrous nickel alloys have found extensive uses, and probably\r\nabout 20 per cent. of the world’s production of nickel goes into them.\r\nBy far the most important are those formed from nickel and copper.\r\nOne, generally known as “cupro-nickel,” contains approximately 80 per\r\ncent. copper and 20 per cent. nickel and is used largely for bullet\r\njackets and other munition purposes. Another, which has become well\r\nknown under the trade name “Monel metal,” contains 29 per cent. copper,\r\n67 per cent. nickel, about 2.5 per cent. iron, and a small amount of\r\nmanganese. It is manufactured direct from the Sudbury matte. Monel\r\nmetal is used chiefly where a strong non-corroding metal is needed, as,\r\nnotably, in ship propellers.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that about 2 per cent. of the nickel production is\r\nused for electro-plating. To a large extent nickel plating prevents\r\ncorrosion of the metal plated.\r\n\r\nNickel is also used for storage batteries; for coinage; as a catalyser\r\nin the hardening of oils or fats (solid fats being used for soap\r\nmaking); for cooking utensils; and as a pigment for coloring ceramic\r\nware. It is doubtful whether these last-named uses would take more than\r\n3 per cent. of the world’s nickel production.\r\n\r\nCopper gives to steel properties somewhat similar to those given by\r\nnickel, notably increasing the tensile strength. Silicon also imparts\r\nsimilar properties to steel, increasing especially the toughness and\r\ntensile strength. A considerable proportion of chromium makes steel\r\nhighly non-corroding. There is, however, nothing known that will take\r\nthe place of nickel in special steels having a zero or a predetermined\r\ncoefficient of expansion, such as “invar” or “platinite.”\r\n\r\nNickel possesses extraordinary power in giving its white color to\r\nalloys of copper; hence its use in coinage. The other white metals\r\nthat might be used in its place are less plentiful and more expensive.\r\nThere is no other abundant metal or alloy having the good color, great\r\nstrength and resistance to corrosion possessed by Monel metal and like\r\nalloys of nickel and copper.\r\n\r\nNickel salts are used as substitutes for metals of the platinum group\r\nas catalysts in hardening oils and fats.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nProduction of nickel on a fairly large scale did not begin until the\r\nmines of New Caledonia were opened in 1875. To handle these ores,\r\nsmelters and refineries were built in England and continental Europe.\r\nAs the ores are of the silicate type and free from copper, they were\r\neasily treated by common processes of smelting with fluxes to get\r\nrid of the gangue and then heating with charcoal for reduction to a\r\nmetallic condition. A pure metal was obtained which found a good market.\r\n\r\nProduction of nickel-copper ores in the Sudbury district began in 1887.\r\nOn account of the copper with the nickel in these ores, new processes\r\nof refining had to be worked out and the trade prejudice against the\r\nproduct had to be overcome. This took persistent effort for several\r\nyears. Only one of the first companies to operate in the Sudbury\r\ndistrict has survived to the present time. This is the Canadian Copper\r\nCo., the producing subsidiary of the International Nickel Co.\r\n\r\nThree new refining processes have been developed to handle\r\nnickel-copper ores. The Orford Copper Co. (subsidiary of the\r\nInternational company) uses the salt cake process. This process is one\r\nof fusion with sodium sulphide, the copper sulphide concentrating on\r\ntop and the nickel sulphides at the bottom of the melt. Repeated fusion\r\nof the “tops” and “bottoms” effects a good separation.\r\n\r\nThe Mond company had a process before it had any mines. This process\r\ndepends upon volatilization of the nickel by passing carbon monoxide\r\nover the matte, which has been previously roasted and leached of its\r\ncopper content. Nickel carbonyl, Ni(CO)₄, is formed and metallic nickel\r\nis thrown down by decomposition of this product, so that the nickel\r\nobtained is pure.\r\n\r\nThe Hybinette process, a process depending on electrolysis, was first\r\nworked out at the plant of the Orford Copper Co. on Sudbury matte.\r\nIt was used for low-grade ores at Fredericktown, Mo., and then later\r\nfor the Norwegian ores at Kristiansand. It is to be used in the new\r\nrefinery of the British-American Co. in Ontario.\r\n\r\nMonel metal is made directly from Sudbury matte with the removal of a\r\nlittle of the copper. It is known as a natural alloy, in contrast to\r\none made by combining the pure metals.\r\n\r\nIncreased use of nickeliferous iron ore for steel making will decrease\r\nthe amount of nickel that will have to be added in making such steel.\r\nThis will probably be overbalanced by the increased use of such steels.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nAnalyses of igneous rocks indicate that nickel is present in the\r\naverage igneous rock to the extent of 0.020[68] per cent. Of its\r\noccurrence, Clarke says:[69] “Very frequently detected in igneous\r\nrocks, probably as a constituent of olivine. * * * The presence of\r\nnickel is especially characteristic of magnesian igneous rocks, and\r\nit is generally associated in them with chromium.” Regarding copper\r\nhe says: “Minute traces of this metal are often detected in igneous\r\nrocks, although they are rarely determined quantitatively.” It is\r\nestimated[70] that copper is present in the average igneous rock to\r\nthe proportion of about 0.010 per cent., or only about half that of\r\nnickel, and that zinc and lead are present in even smaller proportion.\r\nNotwithstanding this greater abundance of nickel, the workable deposits\r\nof copper, lead, and zinc are much more widespread and production\r\nis correspondingly greater. “It can thus be said that nickel is\r\nless amenable to concentration by the agencies that tend to produce\r\nworkable deposits than are the other metals mentioned (copper, lead and\r\nzinc).”[71]\r\n\r\n  [68] F. W. CLARKE, “The Data of Geochemistry,” _Bull. 616_, U. S.\r\n  Geological Survey, 1916, p. 27.\r\n\r\n  [69] _Ibid._, p. 18.\r\n\r\n  [70] Report of Royal Ontario Nickel Commission, 1917, p. 95.\r\n\r\n  [71] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nOne would infer from the above that nickel deposits of consequence\r\nwould most likely occur in connection with igneous rocks, especially\r\nthose that are basic. This is indeed true; in fact, the only known\r\nnickel deposits of commercial or prospective commercial value occur in\r\nassociation with basic igneous rocks. The nickeliferous metallographic\r\nprovinces of the world may be said to lie within petrographic\r\nprovinces. Harker says:[72] “An examination of the rocks belonging to\r\none great period of igneous activity, and of their actual distribution,\r\nenables us to distinguish areas of greater or less extent, within which\r\nthe rocks present a less or greater degree of consanguinity, the law\r\nbeing that more marked specialization goes with narrower localization.”\r\nOn the basis of this law and the fact noted by Clarke and mentioned\r\nabove, nickeliferous metallographic provinces may be limited more\r\nclosely than simply to areas of basic igneous rocks. They may be said\r\nto roughly coincide with areas of basic igneous rock characterized by\r\nminerals of the olivine group, these minerals having formed as a result\r\nof the high magnesium content of the rock magma.\r\n\r\n  [72] HARKER, ALFRED, “The Natural History of Igneous Rocks,” 1909, p.\r\n  89.\r\n\r\nNickel ores occur where there was an unusual segregation of the element\r\nin the igneous rock at the time of solidification. In some places\r\nfurther concentration by weathering has been necessary to make an ore\r\nof the rock. In still other places, the concentration by weathering\r\nhas not been sufficient to make the nickel valuable in itself, but has\r\nraised the iron content of the rock, and with it the nickel content, to\r\nsuch an extent as to make the ore valuable in the first instance as an\r\niron ore and of additional value because of its nickel content.\r\n\r\nNickel is unique among the less rare metals in that a single district\r\ncontains a quantity of accessible, workable ore, far ahead of that in\r\nall other known deposits of the world combined. This is the Sudbury\r\ndistrict of Ontario. The nickel ores there were segregated from an\r\nenormous mass of igneous rock intruded under conditions favorable for\r\nbroad segregation and subsequently so eroded that large ore bodies are\r\naccessible.\r\n\r\nIn those nickel ores and nickeliferous iron ores where weathering\r\nhas been a necessary agent in concentrating the nickel and iron\r\nenough to make them commercially valuable, the original deposits were\r\nnickeliferous igneous rocks--that is, they were similar to the rocks\r\nassociated with the nickel deposits of the sulphide type, but contained\r\nmuch less nickel. The nickel-ore deposits of the New Caledonia region,\r\nwhich rank next in productiveness to those of the Sudbury district, are\r\nof this type. The Cuban nickeliferous iron ores best exemplify iron ore\r\ndeposits of this type.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe nickeliferous ore deposits of the world may be divided into two\r\nmain types--the sulphide type, in which weathering has not been of\r\nprime importance, and the garnierite or lateritic type, in which\r\nweathering has altered and concentrated the nickel as well as the\r\nchromium and iron of the original rock. In addition, nickel occurs\r\nin some places with ores of precious and semi-precious metals in\r\nveins. Nickel may be recovered from such ores as a by-product, but the\r\nores are never mined primarily for their nickel content. The brief\r\ndescriptions of the known deposits, grouped according to type, which\r\nfollow, have been taken from the descriptions of the world’s nickel\r\ndeposits in the report of the Royal Ontario Nickel Commission. A few\r\ndirect quotations from the text of the report are given.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Deposits of the Sulphide Type.=--The Sudbury district is situated\r\nin southeastern Ontario, _Canada_. In its broader outlines the\r\ngeology of this district is relatively simple. An immense mass of\r\nnickeliferous rock was intruded as a “laccolithic sheet” or sill along\r\nan unconformable plane of contact between flat-lying sediments and an\r\nunderlying complex of ancient rocks. During the intrusion and cooling,\r\nor perhaps soon thereafter, the underlying rocks of the central part\r\nof the laccolith, covering the reservoirs from which the magma came,\r\nsubsided. Long periods of erosion then planed down the region until\r\nall that is left of the sill occupies a synclinal basin nearly 40\r\nmiles long and 10 to 15 miles wide. All of the rocks involved are of\r\npre-Cambrian age.\r\n\r\nThe laccolithic sheet is approximately 10,000 feet thick. It\r\ndifferentiated on cooling into two kinds of rock--micropegmatite, a\r\nrock of the granite group, now forming the upper part of the sill, and\r\nnorite, a gabbro rock, the lower part. The gradation between these two\r\nrocks is rather abrupt. At the bottom of the sill, in some places lying\r\nbetween the norite and the underlying rock and at other places entirely\r\nwithin the underlying rock, are bodies of ore consisting of pyrrhotite,\r\npentlandite and chalcopyrite. These are segregated products of the\r\nnorite, which in some places solidified at the base of the sill and in\r\nothers were intruded as dikes in the underlying rocks or in previously\r\nsolidified portions of the norite. They constitute commercial ore\r\nbodies where the sulphides form a preponderant part of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe ore bodies are classified as “marginal” and “offset.” The marginal\r\ndeposits occur along the contact of the norite with the underlying\r\nrock. Frequently they lie entirely within the rocks adjacent to the\r\nnorite. The offset deposits occur where faults cut across the limbs\r\nof the fold, forming zones of weakness into which ore or mineralized\r\nnorite was intruded.\r\n\r\nThe nickel-bearing mineral is pentlandite; the copper-bearing,\r\nchalcopyrite. The other sulphide, pyrrhotite, is a sulphide of iron.\r\nThe ores mined to date average roughly 3.5 per cent. nickel and 2 per\r\ncent. copper.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening of the district in 1887 to the end of 1916 nearly ten\r\nand one-half million tons of Sudbury ore had been mined and smelted;\r\nand, from this, about 285,000 tons of nickel had been produced. It\r\nis estimated that there are probably fully 100,000,000 tons of ore\r\nreserves. Over a million and a half tons of ore were mined and smelted\r\nin 1916.\r\n\r\nThe Alexo Mine is situated 150 miles due north of Sudbury. The ore\r\noccurs at the contact of a large mass of peridotite (now altered to\r\nserpentine), with a pillow-lava which the peridotite intruded. The\r\nore consists of sulphide minerals segregated from the intrusive mass.\r\nIt is of two types, one, a massive, pure sulphide occupying cracks\r\nin dike-like relationship, the other, disseminated sulphide in\r\nperidotite adjacent to the sulphide ore masses. The ore deposit has a\r\nproven length of 700 feet, has been opened to a depth of 120 feet, and\r\ndrilling has shown ore to extend to a depth of 240 feet. The average\r\nwidth may be taken as approximately 10 feet. By the end of 1916, ore\r\nhad been raised to the extent of 34,650 tons and more than that amount\r\nhad been developed. About 12,000 tons of ore were shipped in 1915,\r\naveraging about 4.9 per cent. nickel and 0.6 per cent. copper. Several\r\nhundred thousand tons are probably available in this deposit.\r\n\r\nThe nickel ore deposits of _Norway_ are similar mineralogically to\r\nthose of Sudbury. The deposits are small, their metal content is low,\r\nand compared to the Sudbury and New Caledonia deposits they are of\r\nlittle consequence. Up to 1909 there had been mined and smelted in\r\nNorway about 400,000 tons of nickel ore. The hand-sorted ore carried\r\n1.4 to 1.7 per cent. of nickel.\r\n\r\nDeposits like those of Norway have been found in _Sweden_, but\r\nthey have not been worked in recent years. There is evidently a\r\nnickeliferous metallographic province in the Scandinavian countries and\r\nimportant ore deposits may yet be found there.\r\n\r\nIn the _United States_, near Gap, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania,\r\nis a deposit of nickel ore of the sulphide type, which occurs as\r\na segregation from a 300-ft. dike of amphibolite. It was worked\r\nspasmodically for copper throughout the 18th century. Nickel was\r\ndiscovered in the ore in 1852 and 4,000,000 pounds of nickel are\r\nestimated to have been produced up to 1882. The advent of New Caledonia\r\nand Sudbury ores caused the closing of the mine. The ore as mined\r\ncarried 1 to 3 per cent. nickel and about one-third as much copper.\r\n\r\nNear Julian, San Diego County, California, is a sulphide nickel deposit\r\nthat has never been commercially productive. Assays show the ore to\r\ncontain nearly 3 per cent. nickel or more.\r\n\r\nA small deposit in _Tasmania_ has produced a few thousand tons of rich\r\nore. Diamond drilling has shown that little ore remains.\r\n\r\nNickel-copper sulphides have been found in connection with a large\r\nintrusive of basic igneous rock in the Insizwa Range, _South Africa_.\r\nNo payable ore has been found.\r\n\r\nNickel sulphide deposits of unknown importance occur in _India_ and in\r\n_Southwestern China_. Small deposits which were worked when nickel was\r\nscarce occur in _Italy_, _Scotland_, _Germany_ and _Austria_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Deposits of the Garnierite and Lateritic Types.=--About one-third of\r\nthe surface of the island of _New Caledonia_ is occupied by serpentine,\r\nthis being the weathered product of basic igneous rock. “The ore,\r\nnoumeaite or garnierite, occurs as a hydrated silicate of nickel and\r\nmagnesia and may best be described as an alteration product of the\r\nserpentine in which the magnesia and iron have been replaced by nickel.\r\n* * * The workable deposits always occur on the saddle of spurs from\r\nthe main mountain ridge, at elevations of 400 to 2,500 feet, the\r\nlatter elevation being the more common. * * * The replacement of the\r\nserpentine by nickel follows the joints and fractures in the serpentine\r\nand the undecomposed blocks and boulders of serpentine are as a rule\r\ncovered by a shell of ore which has to be picked off.” The ores are\r\nhand picked to bring them up to a grade profitable to treat. In the\r\npast it has not been considered economical to smelt ore of lower grade\r\nthan 4.5 per cent. nickel nor to ship ore much below 6.5 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe ore bodies usually contain under 250,000 tons of ore. The largest\r\nmine yet worked produced less than 600,000 metric tons (2,204 lb.) of\r\nore. Probably there still remains as much undeveloped ore as has been\r\nmined in the forty years of production,--equivalent to 160,000 tons of\r\nnickel. This would be equal to about four years’ output of the Sudbury\r\ndistrict at the 1916 rate of production. “There are large bodies of\r\nlower-grade ores which it has not yet been found feasible to treat.”\r\n\r\nThree large blanket deposits of nickeliferous iron ore occur on\r\nelevated plateaus in _Cuba_. These are typical lateritic (residual)\r\ndeposits. The average depth of the ore is 15 feet and the combined\r\ntonnage of the three deposits is placed at one and one-half to three\r\nbillion tons. The nickel content ranges from about 0.6 per cent. to\r\n2.1 per cent. and shows progressive enrichment from the top downward.\r\nChromium is also present and shows similar enrichment. The presence of\r\nnickel and chromium in the iron ores greatly enhances their value for\r\nmaking special steels.\r\n\r\nIron ore on the island of Seboekoe, lying off the southeast coast of\r\n_Borneo_, contains appreciable amounts of nickel and chromium. At least\r\n300,000,000 tons of ore are contained in the deposit, which is a porous\r\nlimonite, about 15 feet thick, overlying serpentine.\r\n\r\nIn the _United States_, nickel deposits of the garnierite type occur in\r\n_North Carolina_ and _Oregon_. Attempts to mine these ores have never\r\nbeen successful.\r\n\r\nSmall nickel deposits of the garnierite type occur in _Egypt_,\r\n_Germany_ (Prussian Silesia), _Greece_, _Madagascar_, _Russia_ and\r\n_Spain_. Nickeliferous iron ores occur in Greece, and it is thought\r\nthat chromiferous iron ores on Mindao Island, in the _Philippines_,\r\nmay, on further exploration, prove to be nickeliferous.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nickel in Veins.=--Nickel occurs with other metals, precious or\r\nsemi-precious, in some vein deposits and is recovered as a by-product\r\nin the treatment of ores from them. It is notably present in the\r\ndeposits at Cobalt, Ontario, and has been found in vein deposits in\r\nthe United States, France, Germany, Austria, Mexico and South America.\r\nSeveral hundred tons are recovered annually in the refining of copper\r\nproduced in the United States.\r\n\r\nRelated to the vein deposit type of nickel-bearing ore are the galena\r\ndeposits disseminated through dolomite in southeastern Missouri. Iron,\r\ncopper, nickel, and cobalt sulphides occur with the galena. Years ago\r\nnickel was recovered electrolytically from matte from these ores.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENTS AND CHANGES IN KNOWN GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nIn 1900 New Caledonia supplied 65 per cent. of the world’s production\r\nand Ontario 35 per cent. Since then the world’s production has\r\nincreased six-fold, and Ontario, by the end of 1916, was producing 80\r\nper cent. of the whole. This shows the trend of the industry. Recent\r\ndiscoveries of ore in the Sudbury district and construction of new\r\nsmelters and refineries in Ontario to treat the ores indicate an\r\nincreasing dominance of the industry by that district. New Caledonia\r\nhas not the large ore bodies and is too far away to compete favorably\r\nwith Ontario, though work will continue there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Refined nickel produced from the ores of New\r\nCaledonia and Ontario, for five-year periods; the amounts are for the\r\ncalendar year indicated.]\r\n\r\nStatistics of production and ore reserves in Ontario and New Caledonia\r\nare shown graphically in figures 7 and 8.\r\n\r\nIsolated nickel ore bodies of the sulphide type--that is, segregations\r\nfrom basic igneous rocks, as at Sudbury--have been found in a number of\r\nwidely separated places. There is a distinct probability that others\r\nexist and may be discovered. Such undiscovered deposits might even\r\ncontain more accessible ore, in the aggregate, than the total of the\r\nmined and unmined ores of the Sudbury district, but in the light of\r\npresent knowledge this seems a remote possibility.\r\n\r\nOther deposits of the New Caledonian and Cuban types will probably be\r\ndiscovered, but it is doubtful if as large deposits of those types\r\nremain to be found. In these the nickel has remained in the material\r\nleft as residuum from the partial or complete weathering by solution of\r\nthe original nickeliferous rock. This material lies at the surface and\r\ncovers relatively broad areas. Bodies of it are therefore not usually\r\ndifficult of discovery. They seem to be found most abundantly in warm\r\nlatitudes, where solution weathering has most easily gone on under\r\nconditions favorable for preservation of the residuum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Nickel production, and nickel content of\r\nreserves, in Ontario, New Caledonia, and Norway.]\r\n\r\nThe present known nickel and nickeliferous iron-ore deposits indicate\r\nroughly the locations of perhaps all or nearly all of the nickeliferous\r\nmetallographic provinces of the world. It is in these provinces that\r\nnew deposits are most likely to be found. The wide-spread distribution\r\nof these provinces is indicated by the following statement in the\r\nReport of the Ontario Nickel Commission:\r\n\r\n  While competition is not to be feared (that is, for Ontario), it\r\n  would be futile to try to shut off the supply of nickel from almost\r\n  any of the great nations. * * * Nearly every important country has\r\n  supplies of nickel ore which can be worked if the demand is great,\r\n  thus ensuring a high price.\r\n\r\nIt is thought probable that the nickeliferous metallographic province\r\nof eastern Canada, which includes the Sudbury district, contains the\r\ngreatest unknown nickel deposits, just as it contains the greatest\r\nknown one, and this for three reasons. The first and most obvious\r\nreason is that the great nickel-ore bodies of the Sudbury district,\r\nthe isolated Alexo ore body, 150 miles north of the district, and the\r\nappreciable content of nickel in the veins of the Cobalt and other\r\ndistricts near by, indicate an unusually large nickel content in the\r\noriginal magma from which the basic igneous rocks were derived. The\r\nsecond reason is that the mantle of glacial drift effectively conceals\r\nlarge areas of underlying rock and prevents easy discovery. The third\r\nis that the wild and unsettled nature of the country inhibits the human\r\nactivities whereby accidental or other discoveries would be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe Sudbury nickel deposits and the Alexo ore body in eastern Ontario\r\nare under the political control of the British Empire; the New\r\nCaledonian nickel deposits are controlled politically by France, New\r\nCaledonia being a French colony; and the nickel deposits of Norway and\r\nCuba are under the political control of those governments. The other\r\ndeposits of the world, as has been noted, are commercially unimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nOwnership of mines and undeveloped ore bodies in the Sudbury district\r\nis divided between British and American interests. There are two\r\ncompanies producing ore at the present time and a third is expected to\r\nbegin producing soon.\r\n\r\nThe first large company in the field was the Canadian Copper Co. This\r\nis a subsidiary of the International Nickel Co., over 90 per cent. of\r\nthe stock of which is held in the United States. The Canadian Copper\r\nCo. owns the following mines: Copper Cliff, Evans, Stobie, Crean Hill,\r\nVermilion, Creighton, No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6.\r\nFour of these were being worked in 1917--the Crean Hill, Vermilion,\r\nCreighton and No. 2. In December, 1916, the president of the Canadian\r\nCopper Co. gave the following estimates of reserves of payable ore in\r\nthree properties of that company: 10,000,000 tons in the Creighton;\r\n2,000,000 tons in Crean Hill; and 45,000,000 tons in No. 3.\r\n\r\nThe Mond Nickel Co. is controlled by British interests. It owns the\r\nfollowing mines: Garson, Worthington, Levack, Victoria and Kirkwood.\r\nThe Levack has proven reserves of good ore amounting to 4,500,000 tons.\r\nThe reserves of the other mines are not given.\r\n\r\nThe British-America Nickel Corporation, Ltd., has $20,000,000 of common\r\nstock, of which $14,500,000 is held by the British government in the\r\nname of Alan Anderson, trustee. By the end of 1916, this company had\r\n11,000,000 tons of workable ore blocked out. Its mines are the Murray,\r\nGertrude, Elsie, Blue Lake and Frood Extension. The reserves of the\r\nMurray alone are put at 9,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIn the southeastern part of the district an ore body 7,500 feet long,\r\n10 to 120 feet thick, and extending to a depth of 1,020 feet in one\r\nplace at least, has been found recently in diamond drilling operations\r\nby the E. J. Longyear Co., of Minneapolis. This company and its\r\nassociates, all American, control the ore body. The ore tonnage of\r\nthis deposit is estimated at 6,000,000 tons above the 500-ft. level. A\r\nfew drill holes have gone to greater depths and found ore. It is not\r\npossible to estimate the reserves of this deposit below the 500-ft.\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nThe Alexo Mining Co. Ltd., which is mining the Alexo ore deposit north\r\nof the Sudbury district, is a Canadian concern. An estimate of the\r\nquantity of ore in this deposit is not available, but the deposit\r\nis small compared to that of the Sudbury district. The total may be\r\nseveral hundred thousand tons.\r\n\r\n  The largest and most important owners of nickel-holding lands in _New\r\n  Caledonia_, in relative order of the importance of their holdings,\r\n  are: (1) La Société le Nickel, a company which has been mining in the\r\n  island for many years. (2) The International Nickel Co., represented\r\n  in New Caledonia by its two subsidiary companies, The Nickel\r\n  Corporation and La Société Minière Caledonienne. The International\r\n  does not mine in the island, but some of its lands are worked on\r\n  lease by persons associated with La Société le Nickel. (3) Les\r\n  Hauts-Fourneaux de Noumea.[73]\r\n\r\n  [73] Report of Ontario Nickel Commission, 1917, p. 253.\r\n\r\nLa Société le Nickel was under control of the Rothschilds of France at\r\nthe time of the discovery of the Sudbury deposits. Mr. F. E. Merry, an\r\nEnglish metallurgist, in testifying to the Ontario Nickel Commission,\r\nreported that Germans were in control of the company at the outbreak\r\nof the war. The German firm of Krupp had also acquired some nickel\r\nproperty in New Caledonia.\r\n\r\nThe International Nickel Co., the second largest holder of New\r\nCaledonian nickel lands, is the same American firm which owns the\r\nCanadian Copper Co.\r\n\r\nLes Hauts-Fourneaux de Noumea is owned, at least since the outbreak of\r\nthe war, by French interests.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Merry, the nickel mines and smelters of _Norway_ were\r\nalso mainly in control of the same German group that had gotten control\r\nof Le Nickel. It worked under the name “Metallgesellschaft.” One mine\r\nand smelter reopened recently were under English control.\r\n\r\nThe nickeliferous iron ores of _Cuba_ are owned entirely by American\r\ncompanies, principally by steel manufacturing companies, notably the\r\nBethlehem Steel Co.\r\n\r\nAll three companies producing or about to produce nickel in the Sudbury\r\ndistrict own their own smelting and refining plants. The International\r\nhas been smelting its ore in Canada and refining it in the United\r\nStates. It has a new refinery at Port Colborne, Ontario. The Mond\r\nNickel Co. which smelts in Canada and refines in England, has started a\r\nrefinery in Canada. The British-American Nickel Corporation has built\r\nboth a smelter and a refinery in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe United States Nickel Co. operates a refinery at New Brunswick, New\r\nJersey. Les Hauts-Fourneaux de Noumea and this company belong to the\r\nsame interests. They have a smelter at Noumea, New Caledonia; also a\r\nrefinery at Havre, France.\r\n\r\nLa Société le Nickel has a smelter at Thio, New Caledonia, and\r\nrefineries at Havre, France, and Erdington and Kirkintilloch, British\r\nIsles.\r\n\r\nNo one refining process dominates the nickel industry of the world. The\r\ntwo companies producing nickel from Sudbury ores are using entirely\r\ndifferent refining processes, which they individually control; and\r\nthe British-America concern, soon to begin producing, will use a\r\nthird process, the Hybinette, an electrolytic process on which it has\r\nexclusive rights for North America. The Orford Copper Co., subsidiary\r\nof the International, uses what is known as the “salt-cake” process,\r\nbut it also produces some nickel electrolytically.\r\n\r\nThe process of the United States Nickel Co. at New Brunswick, New\r\nJersey, being one of fluxing and reducing from matte produced at the\r\nNoumea smelter, is not adaptable to copper-bearing sulphide ores.\r\n\r\nThe ores produced in Norway are smelted and refined in Norway by the\r\nHybinette process.\r\n\r\nObviously the nickel resources of the world are controlled by a few\r\ncompanies. The chief one is the International Nickel Co., which has\r\nthe largest holdings at Sudbury, and the second largest holdings in\r\nNew Caledonia. The Mond and the British-America are the next most\r\nimportant, and La Société le Nickel is fourth in importance. E. J.\r\nLongyear Co. and associates do not aspire to become producers of nickel\r\nand are in the market to sell their properties. For a new concern to\r\nsucceed it would have to develop a refining process of its own. The\r\nalternative would be for it to sell out to or merge itself with a firm\r\nthat controls a refining process. There are no custom smelters or\r\nrefineries in America. The Mond company buys the Alexo ore because its\r\nhigh magnesium content makes it a good fluxing material in smelting\r\nSudbury ores.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE LEADING COMMERCIAL NATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--Though the United States has insignificant deposits\r\nof nickel ore and therefore exerts little or no political control over\r\nnickel mining, American capital plays an important if not the leading\r\nrôle in the industry. Of the four companies holding the deposits of\r\nthe Sudbury district two are American, and these two possess what are\r\ndoubtless the largest reserves there. One of these, the International\r\nNickel Co., has the next to the largest holdings in New Caledonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Great Britain.=--Of all nations Great Britain is in the strongest\r\nposition politically with respect to the nickel industry, because of\r\nthe Sudbury district being in Canada. It has used this control in an\r\nendeavor to localize the business of refining Ontario nickel ores\r\nin Canada, with the result that the International Nickel Co. is to\r\ntransfer its refining operations from New Jersey to its new refinery in\r\nOntario.\r\n\r\nCommercially, British capital controls the two other companies having\r\nholdings at Sudbury. In one of these,--the British-America Nickel\r\nCorporation,--the government itself has a controlling interest.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the British government with relation to the Sudbury\r\nnickel ores, which give the British an overwhelmingly dominant\r\npolitical control over the world’s nickel, is highly significant as\r\nshowing that the government is aware of the necessity for commercial\r\nas well as political control, in order to reap all the commercial and\r\nstrategic advantages of its good fortune. During the war, and before\r\nthe United States entered, great feeling was roused in Canada and\r\nEngland by the German submarine, _Deutschland_, loading at New York a\r\ncargo that consisted partly of metallic nickel, it being assumed that\r\nthis was originally Canadian nickel. The direct participation of the\r\nBritish government in the Sudbury industry in such a way as to make the\r\ngovernment practically the dominant factor, and the transfer of the\r\nrefinery operations of the American-owned International Nickel Co. from\r\nNew Jersey to Ontario, mark a vigorous and aggressive nationalistic\r\npolicy which has attained its object without much delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n=France.=--France owns the island of New Caledonia and has political\r\ncontrol of the nickel deposits there. Two of the three principal\r\ncompanies holding New Caledonian ore deposits are presumably held by\r\nFrench interests. The larger one, La Société le Nickel, was for a long\r\ntime controlled by the Rothschilds of France. It was reported later to\r\nhave gotten into German hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany.=--Germany exercises political control over no important\r\nnickel deposits. Before the war the German firm of Krupp had\r\nobtained some New Caledonian nickel properties. A German group, the\r\nMetallgesellschaft, is reported to have had control of La Société le\r\nNickel at the outbreak of the war, and also the mines and smelters of\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTUNGSTEN\r\n\r\nBY FRANK L. HESS\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF TUNGSTEN[74]\r\n\r\n  [74] Unless otherwise noted, the short ton of 2,000 pounds is used\r\n  throughout this chapter and “tungsten ore” means materials carrying\r\n  60 per cent. WO₃.\r\n\r\nThe essential uses of tungsten are as an alloy in high-speed tool\r\nsteel, for the making of filaments for incandescent lamps, for targets\r\nand cathodes of Roentgen (“X”) ray tubes, and for electric contacts\r\nfor explosion engines or wherever an intermittent electric contact is\r\nneeded. Other uses are in saw and some other steels, as a constituent\r\nof stellite, in a tungsten-iron alloy for valves in automobile\r\nand airplane engines, for kenotrons and similar instruments, in a\r\nmanganese-chromium-tungsten-iron alloy for wire-drawing dies, in wire\r\ncloth, luminescent screens for Roentgen (“X”) rays, mordants and minor\r\nchemicals.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Substitutes.=--The use of tungsten in high-speed steels is as standard\r\nas the use of yeast in bread, and, though assiduously sought, no\r\nsubstitute is known that satisfactorily takes its place. According\r\nto report, in England and France molybdenum has been used to replace\r\nabout half of the tungsten in some high-speed tool steels, but this is\r\nseemingly not a preferred method, being used only when the obtaining of\r\ntungsten is difficult. In the United States the practice has had few\r\nsponsors. The following quotation from the _Mining Journal_ (London)\r\nfor May 25, 1918, p. 318, shows that this sentiment is not unknown\r\nabroad:\r\n\r\n  The manufacture of ferromolybdenum is stated to have been commenced\r\n  in Sweden, where the lack of ferrotungsten has forced the employment\r\n  of this substitute.\r\n\r\nDuring 1917, 104 (metric?) tons of molybdenite was shipped from\r\nNorway to Germany, where it probably was used as in Sweden. Henry E.\r\nWood reported finding molybdenum in the steel of a German helmet.\r\nWhen tungsten was at the excessively high price of early 1916, many\r\nexperiments were made to find a substitute, but apparently without\r\nfull success, although lately several substitute steels containing\r\ncobalt and chromium and especially intended for cast milling-cutters\r\nand other multiple-edged tools have been placed on the market and\r\na cobalt-chromium-molybdenum steel and a uranium steel have been\r\noffered for lathe tools. Stellite, the cobalt-chromium-tungsten alloy,\r\nin which there is only one-third to one-half as much tungsten as\r\nis used in high-speed steel, has grown in favor, and cooperite, a\r\nnickel-zirconium alloy, is also a competitor, but the trade in the\r\ncombined list has made no appreciable impression on the demand for\r\ntungsten steels.\r\n\r\nA change in the manner of using tungsten steel, by which a thin plate\r\nof high-speed steel is cemented to a more ordinary steel bar so as to\r\nform the cutting edge of a lathe tool, has made the demand for tungsten\r\nless than it would have been had the old practice been followed of\r\nmaking the whole tool of high-speed steel.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nNo startling changes of practice in the metallurgy of tungsten are\r\nknown to have taken place, but there has been a steady betterment\r\nof the art, improvement in the quality of ferrotungsten, a shifting\r\nin localities of reduction, and a considerable change in the manner\r\nof use. The wasteful, lazy demand for ores of high concentration\r\nand of great purity common before the war has given way before more\r\nenlightened and intelligent practice, until firms both in this country\r\nand in England make a specialty of using low-grade or impure ores,\r\nthough seemingly much more advance has been made here than abroad.\r\nOne firm, the Chemical Products Co. (Washington, D. C.) was organized\r\nspecifically to buy ores carrying less than the 60 per cent. tungsten\r\ntrioxide (WO₃) demanded by other American firms, and ores containing\r\nsulphur, copper, arsenic, bismuth, tin, antimony, phosphorus, or\r\nother impurities to which most users objected. Two firms, the Black\r\nMetal Reduction Co., and the Tungsten Products Co., both of Boulder,\r\nColorado, were organized to handle materials such as tailings carrying\r\nas little as 1 per cent. tungsten trioxide, and they said that they\r\nwere able to pay for gold and silver in the ore.\r\n\r\nSeveral firms make tungsten trioxide or tungstic acid (H₂WO₄) for\r\nferrotungsten makers. Firms have also made artificial scheelite (CaWO₄)\r\nfor the same trade, using off-color ores in the process. Powdered\r\nferrotungsten made by chemically precipitating an iron tungsten salt\r\nfrom solution and reducing it to a metallic powder carrying 4 to 11\r\nper cent. iron has been produced by several firms and seems to have\r\nstarted a demand for powdered ferrotungsten, so that firms are now\r\nfinely grinding the massive ferrotungsten. Claims for better furnace\r\npractice which greatly cuts down the consumption of current and makes a\r\nsaving of 90 to 96 per cent. instead of the usual 80 per cent. are also\r\nmade. Several firms are making ferrotungsten powder and tungsten powder\r\nin iron tubes or other iron containers instead of in the graphite\r\ncrucibles used before the war.\r\n\r\nIn the milling of tungsten ores, the tendency in this country is to\r\nget away from the uneconomic method of making concentrates very\r\nhigh in tungsten trioxide (carrying more than 60 per cent. WO₃).\r\nFew operators really know what the heads run, and the determination\r\nof losses is mere guesswork. Some of the most careful operators in\r\nthe Boulder field before closing down at the beginning of 1919 were\r\nmaking a high-grade product carrying nearer 50 per cent. than 60 per\r\ncent. tungsten trioxide, and a lower grade product carrying about 20\r\nper cent. tungsten trioxide, not attempting to raise its tenor. This\r\npractice cuts down the losses largely. When the great shortage of\r\ntungsten ore came in 1916, users were compelled to take lower grade\r\nconcentrates, and some improved their metallurgy accordingly. This\r\nchange has made the sale of 50 per cent. concentrates easier. Even in\r\nEngland, 60 to 65 per cent. ores were accepted where formerly a content\r\nof 67.5 per cent. or 70 per cent. WO₃ was demanded.\r\n\r\nFormerly scheelite sold 50 cents per unit below other tungsten\r\nminerals, even though freer from bothersome impurities, but with the\r\ngraduation from rule-of-thumb methods to more thoughtful, careful and\r\nscientific practice, it came to command a premium. Huebnerite seems to\r\nbe still sold with and as “wolfram” in England, but in this country it\r\nmust be sold according to its composition, for to most metallurgists\r\nthe manganese is undesirable, though at least one firm now makes\r\nferrotungsten from huebnerite without prejudice or difficulty. This\r\ngrowth in knowledge and technique has caused the price of the tungsten\r\nminerals to rank about as follows in the order named: Scheelite,\r\nferberite, wolframite and huebnerite. This applies to tungsten used\r\nin the manufacture of tungsten and ferrotungsten for steel making.\r\nScheelite is not wanted in this country for making filaments.\r\n\r\nBefore the war the United States imported considerable quantities of\r\nGerman ferrotungsten, but metallurgists claim that the ferrotungsten\r\nnow made in this country is superior to any from Germany. For the\r\npresent, of course, the German export trade is dead. England, formerly\r\na small producer, is now making large quantities of ferrotungsten\r\nand tungsten powder at a number of plants. One of the producers, the\r\nHigh Speed Steel Alloys, Ltd., Widnes, near Liverpool, “is under\r\ngovernment assistance and is owned by 31 of the leading consumers\r\nof Sheffield.”[75] The article quoted stated that the output was at\r\nthe rate of 500 tons of tungsten per annum. The Thermo-Electric Ore\r\nReduction Corporation,[76] Luton, was at the same time producing 140\r\ntons of tungsten per month. The ferro produced carried 80 per cent.\r\nand the powder 98 per cent. of metallic tungsten. Only one company in\r\nthe United States was producing as much as 60 tons of tungsten per\r\nmonth during the same war period. The Thermo Electric Ore Reduction\r\nCorporation owned mines from which it expected to produce each year\r\n4,000 long tons of concentrates carrying 65 per cent. tungstic\r\noxide. There are at least seven other manufacturers of tungsten or\r\nferrotungsten in England.\r\n\r\n  [75] _Mining Journal_, London. “High Speed Steel Alloys, Ltd., Visit\r\n  of Inspection to the Works,” vol. 115, Nov. 25, 1916, p. 779.\r\n\r\n  JULIUS L. F. VOGEL has since written an article (_Min. Jour._,\r\n  London, vol. 20, p. 16, Jan., 1919) in which he says that government\r\n  aid, though proffered, was not accepted. This statement confirms the\r\n  government policy.\r\n\r\n  [76] _Mining Journal._ “Thermo-Electric Ore Reduction Corporation,\r\n  Ltd., Visit to the Luton Works,” vol. 115, p. 797, Dec. 2, 1916.\r\n\r\nFrance had a number of ferrotungsten plants before the war, and these\r\nare thought to be still in operation.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war about half of the tungsten used in the\r\nUnited States was introduced into steel in the form of ferrotungsten\r\nand about half in the form of tungsten powder. This practice has\r\nchanged, so that now more than three-fourths of the tungsten used is\r\nintroduced as ferrotungsten, largely, it seems, because of the ferro\r\nbeing now manufactured in purer form and partly because tungsten powder\r\ncould not be obtained for a while. At one time tungsten ores were put\r\nin the charge and the tungsten alloyed directly with the steel; in\r\nfact, tungsten steels were first made in this way, although the process\r\nwas patented in this country as new. The practice seems to have been\r\ndropped because of the introduction into the steel of impurities that\r\nmay be eliminated when tungsten or ferrotungsten is made first.\r\n\r\nIn the making of tungsten steels a considerable change has taken place\r\nthrough the increased use of the electric furnace. One considerable\r\nproducer, the Latrobe Electric Steel Co., makes all of its high-speed\r\ntool steel in this way. The Vanadium Alloys Steel Co., one of the\r\nlarger producers, makes a large part of its steel in the electric\r\nfurnace, and the Crucible Steel Co. and some other steel companies are\r\nunderstood to make a part or all of their steels thus.\r\n\r\nThe removal of tin, copper and other impurities from ferrotungsten by\r\ngrinding and chemical treatment has made possible the use of impure\r\nores in the production of high-grade ferrotungsten in the electric\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nTungsten, even more than tin, is found almost exclusively with granitic\r\nrocks. In a few places tungsten ores are found in volcanic, sedimentary\r\nor metamorphic rocks, but as is postulated with certain tin deposits,\r\nmany of these deposits may be explained on the supposition that they\r\nare not far vertically above underlying granite.\r\n\r\nAmong the deposits themselves there is a considerable variety of types,\r\nand they may be classed as follows: Segregation deposits, pegmatite\r\ndikes, veins, replacement deposits, contact metamorphic deposits and\r\nplacers.\r\n\r\nSegregation deposits are few and of little importance and constitute\r\nthose deposits in which wolframite is segregated in granite, like\r\nbiotite or hornblende. A closely related type is the occurrence of\r\ntungsten minerals in aplitic granite, and this grades almost insensibly\r\ninto the second type, the pegmatites.\r\n\r\nThe pegmatites are also of comparatively small importance, but do yield\r\ncertain quantities of tungsten minerals. The pegmatites also grade\r\ninto the next type, the veins, which have heretofore furnished the\r\ngreater part of the tungsten minerals of the world. Closely connected\r\nwith the veins are the fourth type, replacement deposits, in which the\r\ncountry rocks alongside the veins, though the veins may be very small,\r\nare replaced by various minerals, including those of tungsten. The\r\nonly known large examples are the wolframite deposits near Lead, South\r\nDakota, which were considerable producers under the high prices of the\r\nGreat War.\r\n\r\nAmong the replacement deposits are to be noted also such deposits as\r\nthose in the Deep Creek Mountains, Utah, in which solutions following\r\ncracks in monzonite have replaced the rock with a mass of feldspar,\r\nquartz, tourmaline, apatite, scheelite, wolframite (very little),\r\nbismuth, copper, and molybdenum minerals, which under other conditions\r\nwould be unhesitatingly called pegmatite.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the replacement deposits are the contact metamorphic\r\ndeposits, the fifth type. These only recently have begun to be of\r\ncommercial importance, but promise to be among the greatest, if not the\r\ngreatest, producers of this country and possibly of other countries.\r\nThey are of the familiar kind--limestones or limey rocks which have\r\nbeen invaded by granites bringing large quantities of watery or gaseous\r\nsolutions of silicon, iron, aluminum and magnesium, with less chlorine,\r\nfluorine, potash and sulphur, and, in this case, tungsten. In the\r\nGreat Basin broad areas of limestone, extending from northwestern Utah\r\nto the Sierra Nevadas and around their southern extremity, have been\r\nthus intruded and metamorphosed. Some large deposits of scheelite have\r\nalready been exploited in the region and others remain to be worked.\r\nSimilar deposits occur in Korea, Japan and Tasmania, and probably\r\nexist, though as yet undiscovered, in China, the Malay Peninsula and\r\nother countries. The tungsten mineral in such deposits is invariably\r\nscheelite.\r\n\r\nPlacers, the sixth type, are formed from all grades of deposits, but\r\ntheir value depends largely on local conditions. They are both residual\r\nand fluviatile deposits and have been large producers of tungsten\r\nminerals, especially of wolframite. A very large proportion of the\r\nBurmese output has been from semi-residual and stream placers, and the\r\nChinese output in 1918, the largest ever made by any country in one\r\nyear, was almost wholly from placers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe distribution of tungsten ores is far from being as wide as the\r\ndistribution of the granitic rocks, and some regions with large areas\r\nof granite have almost no tungsten minerals. Among such regions are\r\nthe Scandinavian peninsula, large stretches of Canada, the eastern\r\nUnited States, and Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe world’s known large tungsten fields are grouped along the shores\r\nof the Pacific Ocean--not always close to it, but somewhere in the\r\ngreat mountain masses paralleling its margin, and the western shore\r\nis much richer than the eastern shore. In 1918, fully 92 per cent. of\r\nthe world’s tungsten came from the shores of the Pacific, 61 per cent.\r\ncoming from Asia, Australia, and Oceania, and 31 per cent. from North\r\nAmerica and South America. Eastern Asia alone furnished 56 per cent.\r\nThere is only one considerable tungsten-bearing area not situated close\r\nto the Pacific, that of the Iberian Peninsula, mostly in Portugal but\r\npartly in Spain. Of the less than 8 per cent. not produced around the\r\nPacific, that area yielded nearly 5 per cent. There are, of course,\r\nsmall deposits in England, Germany and other places near the Atlantic,\r\nbut together they produce less than 3 per cent. of the world’s tungsten\r\nores. The huge continent of Africa has only negligible known deposits;\r\nnone of consequence are found on the borders of the Arctic, Antarctic\r\nor Indian oceans except along the narrow Malay Peninsula dividing the\r\nIndian and Pacific oceans, and only minor deposits are known in Siberia.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a single metallogenic province, the region making by\r\nfar the greatest production is in southeastern Asia; it includes the\r\nMalay Peninsula, Burma, the Shan States, Siam, Tonkin, and southeastern\r\nChina. The second largest producing metallogenic province is the\r\nCordilleran, including Bolivia and the adjacent closely related areas\r\nof Peru, Argentina and Chile, to which the United States and Mexico\r\nwould be a close third.[77] Portugal, Spain and Italy form the fourth\r\nprovince, to which are closely related the Cornish-French producing\r\nareas. Australia, including Tasmania, is next in importance and is a\r\ndistinct province, practically all the ores being found in the ranges\r\nof the eastern side of the continent. Japan and Korea also form a\r\nrather distinct province which may continue into Manchuria. Mexico,\r\nas has been indicated, should be included in the same province as the\r\nwestern United States. There are numerous small more or less isolated\r\nareas, like Connecticut, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, etc., that are at\r\npresent of little importance and give no promise of future greatness.\r\n\r\n  [77] It may be quite justly objected that the idea of a metallogenic\r\n  province is considerably stretched to include the Boulder and Black\r\n  Hills deposits with those of the southwestern states and Mexico, but\r\n  for convenience they are here so grouped--with a frank confession of\r\n  the license taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION BY COUNTRIES\r\n\r\nThe world’s production of tungsten ores by metallogenic provinces and\r\npolitical areas is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\nTABLE 28.--THE WORLD’S PRODUCTION OF TUNGSTEN ORE, 1913 TO 1918, BY\r\nMETALLOGENIC PROVINCES AND POLITICAL

As\r\nelsewhere, production must decrease until the accumulated stocks in\r\nthe reducing centers are used, then production will again proceed. The\r\nalluvial deposits of _China_ are by no means exhausted, the veins are\r\nscarcely touched, the tungsten-bearing area is large and only partly\r\nprospected, and such prospecting as has been done has been almost\r\nwholly for placers; labor is cheap, and a large future output is sure.\r\nMore liberal ideas of trade and government are slowly taking root in\r\nChina and ultimately educated Chinese or trained foreigners will work\r\nthe deposits; the output for a long time will be large, though it may\r\nnever again be as large as it was in 1918.\r\n\r\nSo far as can be learned, the easily worked placers and the upper parts\r\nof the veins in _Burma_ are becoming exhausted rather rapidly,[84] and\r\nrecourse must therefore be had more and more to the mining of those\r\nparts of the veins below water level and in harder rock, and this\r\nwill probably mean a diminution rather than an increase in output.\r\n_Siam_ seemingly should give an increased production, as the mines\r\nare comparatively new, and there still should be opportunity for\r\ndiscoveries. The _Federated Malay States_ and the unfederated states\r\n(_Johore_, _Kedah_ and _Trengganu_) should produce at least as much\r\nin the immediate future as in the past--given the demand and an equal\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n  [84] Burma Chamber of Commerce and Tavoy Chamber of Mines, “Memorial\r\n  to Sir George Barnes,” _Mining Jour._, London, vol. 121, 1918, May 4,\r\n  p. 261.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australasia.=--Like other British possessions, _Australia_ labored\r\nunder the handicap of a comparatively low fixed price for tungsten\r\nores during the war. This price, at first 55 shillings per long ton\r\nunit c.i.f. London, was later raised to 60 shillings. During the\r\nearlier part of the war the price paid in Australia averaged less than\r\none-half the price paid in the United States, and only a little more\r\nthan half that paid in regions other than the British provinces. In\r\nconsequence the Australian tungsten production did not increase during\r\nthe war as it might have done had prices been higher. The cream of the\r\nknown deposits is gone except in Tasmania, where contact metamorphic\r\ndeposits on King Island have quadrupled the Tasmanian output. The\r\ntungsten minerals mined in Australia are largely wolframite with\r\nsmaller quantities of huebnerite and scheelite. The huebnerite seems to\r\nbe rarely recognized as such in the British market, but is all sold as\r\nwolframite. Except for the contact metamorphic deposits on King Island,\r\nTasmania, the deposits worked are mostly veins, with some pegmatites.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, the production is wholly scheelite; it increased\r\nconsiderably during the war until the last year--1918--when, apparently\r\nfrom a lack of efficient labor, it fell to the lowest point since 1909.\r\nThe probabilities are that there will be a stoppage of output for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=South America.=--In _Bolivia_ the increase of production has been\r\ngreat. The deposits seem to be wholly veins and derived placers.\r\nThe veins are closely connected with the tin deposits, and in many\r\nveins tin and tungsten are associated, but many tungsten deposits\r\ncontain little or no tin. The tungsten minerals mined are ferberite,\r\nwolframite, scheelite and some huebnerite. In some veins the minerals\r\nare mixed and in others wholly separate. The mines are in and on both\r\nsides of the eastern Cordillera of the Andes through a distance of\r\nnearly 400 miles from a point near Puerta Acosta, on the northwest, to\r\nChorolque, on the southeast. Mining costs during the war rose greatly\r\nin sympathy with the rise in other parts of the world. Wages did not\r\nrise to great heights, but the cost of materials advanced decidedly.\r\nTransportation conditions are always bad in most of Bolivia, and\r\nheavily increase expenses. Because of circumstances the output is\r\nextremely sensitive to a decrease in demand or prices, and hence it\r\nfell quickly after the armistice, but should high prices come again, it\r\nwill probably again increase quickly. Some modern plants were placed at\r\nmines before or just as the armistice was signed, and when world stocks\r\nof tungsten are used and when there is again a demand, some ore will be\r\nproduced even at less than $10 a unit, though the average cost seems to\r\nbe about $12 a unit, at the mine.[85]\r\n\r\n  [85] HAZELTINE, ROSS, United States consul, La Paz. Report dated May\r\n  14, 1919.\r\n\r\nThe output of _Peru_, as now produced, seems to depend upon high prices\r\nand with such prices could probably remain at the level of 1916 for\r\nseveral years. The Huaura deposits are reported to be large, though of\r\nlow grade, and may under proper management yield much ore even at lower\r\nprices. They were under the control of German firms during the war and\r\nprobably still are.\r\n\r\n\r\n=North America.=--Until 1911 the _United States_ was the leading\r\ntungsten-producing country, but in that year it was passed by Burma,\r\nwhich kept the lead until 1916, when the United States again became the\r\nprincipal miner of tungsten ore. In 1918 China entered the excessively\r\nhigh-priced market with an output that exceeded by nearly 1,000 tons\r\nthe world’s production of any year before 1915. North America increased\r\nits output from 1,549 tons in 1913 to 6,512 tons in 1917, but dropped\r\nback nearly 1,000 tons (to 5,406 tons) in 1918. In the United States\r\nthe decrease of production was due almost wholly to the fall in price,\r\nand only partly to exhaustion of deposits. In the Boulder, Colo.,\r\ntungsten field some of its best ore bodies are worked out and the cost\r\nof production has risen greatly owing to the impoverishment of others,\r\nand the same thing is true in some other places, but it seems possible\r\nthat in the country as a whole the production can be made about equal\r\nto what it has been before, _provided prices are equally high_, through\r\nthe discovery of the contact-metamorphic deposits of the Great Basin.\r\n\r\nIn _Mexico_ the tungsten deposits are seemingly a continuation of those\r\nof southern Arizona. So far as known, all the Mexican deposits carry\r\nscheelite, in places partly replaced by cuprotungstite. The known\r\nworked deposits in the Sahuaripa district of Sonora are described as\r\nveins containing scheelite with copper minerals and a pegmatite dike in\r\nwhich are large masses of scheelite and molybdenite.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Europe.=--European production increased about 50 per cent. between\r\n1913 and 1918, mostly in _Portugal_, and the output of tungsten ores in\r\nPortugal apparently did not reach its maximum. Both placers and veins\r\nhave been exploited and there seems to be placer material still to be\r\nworked as well as veins that are said to be far from exhausted. The\r\nofficial statistics of production given by Portugal during the greater\r\npart of the war are declared by engineers conversant with the situation\r\nto have been too low, because of ore being smuggled into Spain and\r\non board ships bound for England. On the other hand, in 1918 England\r\nand France objected to the shipment of Portuguese ore to the United\r\nStates, but would not pay equivalent prices. The Portuguese government\r\ntherefore issued an order preventing the export of tungsten ore except\r\nat fixed prices approaching the current American prices. American\r\nowners could not work their mines successfully under the British-French\r\nembargo, with the result that the output was probably much smaller than\r\nin 1917. In spite of the uncertainties the official estimates have been\r\nused as far as they are available, for no better figures are at hand.\r\n\r\nAs to the Spanish output, prophecy is difficult because the data\r\nconcerning the mines are meager. It seems probable that under similar\r\nprices about the same output as in the past may be expected from the\r\nEnglish and French deposits. The English output decreased in 1917 and\r\nincreased only a little in 1918. No accurate data are available from\r\nFrance. The German and Austrian deposits were probably worked so hard\r\nduring the World War that less is to be expected from them than they\r\nhave heretofore produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Summary.=--The principal changes in the distribution of production\r\nduring the next few years would seem to be: Further development in\r\nKorea; possible development in Manchuria; development of deposits in\r\nsouthern China and Siam; further development in Bolivia; a tendency\r\nin the United States to largely increased production from deposits in\r\nthe Great Basin; and development of both veins and contact-metamorphic\r\ndeposits in Mexico. Production will possibly decrease in the Atolia and\r\nBoulder fields of the United States; and in Australia, Japan, Germany\r\nand Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe actual control of the world’s tungsten deposits differs\r\nconsiderably from that indicated by the production within political\r\nareas. Actual control is justly obtained through ordinary competitive\r\nbuying, ownership by nationals (sometimes by governments) of deposits,\r\nand through commercial alliance. Control through ownership of banks\r\nand transportation lines may be just or it may be by coercion\r\nand commercial brigandage, seizing ports for coaling and repair\r\nstations--methods that are merely refinements evolved since the days\r\nwhen “They sought their fortunes as they pleased abroad, the crown\r\nannoying them with no inquiry to embarrass their search for Spanish\r\ntreasure ships, or their trade in pirated linens and silks.”[86]\r\n\r\n  [86] WILSON, WOODROW. “A History of the American People,” vol. 1, p.\r\n  25.\r\n\r\nTABLE 29.--ACTUAL CONTROL OF THE WORLD’S TUNGSTEN OUTPUT IN 1917 AND\r\n1918.\r\n\r\nIN SHORT TONS OF 2,000 POUNDS\r\n\r\n  --------------------------+-------------------+--------------------\r\n                            |       1917        |       1918\r\n  --------------------------+--------+----------+--------+----------\r\n                            |        |Percentage|        |Percentage\r\n                            |Quantity|of world’s|Quantity|of world’s\r\n                            |        |  output  |        |  output\r\n  --------------------------+--------+----------+--------+----------\r\n  British:                  |        |          |        |\r\n    _Possessions_           |        |          |        |\r\n      Burma and Shan States |  4,600 |          |  4,870 |\r\n      Federated Malay States|    853 |          |    920 |\r\n      Trengganu             |    350 |          |    350 |\r\n      Johore and Kedah      |    200 |          |    582 |\r\n      India                 |     75 |          |     46 |\r\n      Australia             |  1,404 |          |  1,662 |\r\n      New Zealand           |    241 |          |    146 |\r\n      England               |    265 |          |    330 |\r\n      South Africa          |     24 |          |     37 |\r\n                            +--------+          +--------+\r\n                            |  8,012 |   28.4   |  8,943 |   24.9\r\n                            |        |          |        |\r\n    _Obtained through trade |        |          |        |\r\n    and political pressure_ |        |          |        |\r\n      Japan and Korea       |        |          |        |\r\n      (including ores for   |        |          |        |\r\n      France)               |    790 |          |   None |\r\n      China and Hongkong    |        |          |        |\r\n      (including ores for   |        |          |        |\r\n      France)               |  1,105 |          |    900 |\r\n      Siam                  |    600 |          |    600 |\r\n      Billiton and Singkep  |     60 |          |     60 |\r\n      Argentina } (including|        |          |        |\r\n      Bolivia   } ores for  |  2,035 |          |    950 |\r\n      Peru      } France)   |        |          |        |\r\n      Portugal              |    960 |          |    800 |\r\n      Spain (including ores |        |          |        |\r\n      for France)           |    446 |          |    425 |\r\n                            +--------+          +--------+\r\n                            |  5,996 |   21.3   |  3,735 |   10.4\r\n        Total ores under    |        |          |        |\r\n        British control     | 14,008 |   49.7   | 12,678 |   35.3\r\n                            |        |          |        |\r\n  French:                   |        |          |        |\r\n      France                |    182 |          |   180  |\r\n      Tonkin                |    422 |          |   450  |\r\n      Siam                  |    170 |          |   190  |\r\n      Portugal              |    650 |          |   440  |\r\n      Bolivia (See Great    |        |          |        |\r\n      Britain)              |      ?

In countries with weak governments, the deposits\r\nowned by British subjects are to all intents and purposes British; but\r\nforeign deposits owned by Americans are not necessarily under American\r\ncontrol; in fact, instead of helping and encouraging our pioneers in\r\nforeign trade we are apt to harass them and destroy their business with\r\ndrastic tariff laws.\r\n\r\nIn effect, the preceding table merely shows where the ores of different\r\ncountries go for treatment; it is, of course, only a generalization,\r\nfor trade conditions constantly change. For instance, Japanese\r\nelectric furnaces are beginning to smelt tungsten ores, though at\r\npresent to the extent of only 10 to 15 tons of contained tungsten per\r\nmonth, but it is conceivable that the output may be increased greatly.\r\nAlthough Japan could control the disposition of its ore, it is given\r\ncredit for control only of its smelted ores. The exact distribution of\r\nores from Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Portugal and Spain can not be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n=British Control.=--During the war the British government demanded\r\nand obtained all of the tungsten ores produced in its colonies and\r\npossessions. This restriction was later lifted as regards to Canada,\r\nand a new rule allowed Canada to ship tungsten ores to other Entente\r\nnations, but as Canada was not a producer the license granted amounted\r\nto nothing except as it eased the feelings of the Canadians. Scheelite\r\ndeposits had been discovered in Manitoba, however, that for a time\r\nseemed to be potential producers. Nominally Siam has remained free\r\nfrom British control because more or less under the zone of influence\r\nof the French, but diplomatic pressure seems to have been exercised\r\nat Bangkok. The Siamese ores mostly contain some tin and have gone to\r\nSingapore for separation; and when once within the British possessions,\r\nof course they could not be exported. The English control of Siamese\r\nshipments, however, seems as complete as if the ores came from an\r\nEnglish province. Mr. Nassuer, of the Siamese American Trading Co.,\r\ntestified before the Tariff Commission at San Francisco, June 28,\r\n1918, that his company wished to ship ore to the United States but the\r\nBritish minister to Siam would give no permit. The company took the\r\nmatter up with our State Department and finally got permission to ship\r\n10 tons.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1918, the Chemical Products Co., of Washington, D. C.,\r\nprotested to the Department of State at Washington with reference to\r\nBritish interference with exportation of tungsten ore from Siam to the\r\nUnited States, stating that the company was working under conditions\r\npeculiar to itself in that it employed an expensive process developed\r\nto handle low-grade ores obtainable at a much lower price than the\r\nregular grades on the market; that it entered into an agreement with\r\nan American working tungsten mines in Siam for the purchase of his\r\ntungsten ore, only to find that through control of port privileges at\r\nSingapore and Hongkong the British effectually prohibited it or any\r\nother American firm from obtaining the material. Of course, this, like\r\nother incidents mentioned, took place under the shadow of a desperate\r\nwar when strictness was to be expected, but the shipments asked were\r\nto an ally from a country not openly under control of Great Britain.\r\nDoubtless no such objections would be offered now, but the incidents\r\nshow the efficiency of these methods of controlling commerce.\r\n\r\nIn southern China, Hongkong being the port for Kwangtung and\r\nKwangsi, and parts of southern Kiangsi and Hunan, the British for a\r\nwhile exercised control over the export of ores produced in those\r\ndistricts,[87] refusing to allow the reshipment of ores unless they\r\nwere sent to England.\r\n\r\n  [87] ANDERSON, GEORGE E.: American Consul General, Hongkong, China.\r\n  “Tungsten from South China.” Commerce Reports, Nov. 9, 1917, p. 546.\r\n\r\nForeigners, including Americans of course, are not allowed to own\r\nmining property in Burma, the Federated and Unfederated Malay States,\r\nor Australia, territory producing nearly all the tungsten ores of the\r\nBritish Empire.\r\n\r\nIn Argentina small tungsten mines are owned by English companies.[88]\r\n\r\n  [88] SHARP, RALSTON C.: “Wolfram Deposits in the Argentine.” _Mining\r\n  Magazine_, London, vol. 18, May, 1918, pp. 230-233.\r\n\r\nIn Bolivia the English and French governments during the war leased\r\nmines directly, and came into direct competition with American business\r\nmen engaged in buying or producing tungsten ores.\r\n\r\nBritish traders are constantly striving to increase their control of\r\nBolivian tungsten ores. At present the English seemingly have complete\r\ncontrol of the financial system of Bolivia, so far as foreign exchange\r\nis concerned. An American interested in a tungsten mine in Bolivia\r\nhas informed the writer that it is almost impossible to do business\r\nwith English banks, because they insist that if they extend commercial\r\ncourtesies, even for pay, the recipient must buy only English mining\r\nmachinery. The buddle, which for dressing tungsten ore is obsolete\r\nin other countries, is said to be still used in Bolivian mills under\r\nEnglish control. If miners do not wish to deal through English banks,\r\nthey are compelled to cable money to and from New York at considerable\r\nexpense. The American banking interests represented in Bolivia seem\r\nconservative in advancing money on ore shipments, whereas German\r\nand English representatives are said to advance up to 80 per cent.\r\nof the market value of ores shipped. Mining corporations controlled\r\nby English firms ship to England, and Americans can not compete for\r\nthe production. Such a firm is Aramayo Francke Mines, Ltd., which\r\nproduced 2,050 long tons of tin concentrates, 226 tons of wolframite\r\nconcentrates, and a considerable output of bismuth in the year ending\r\nMay 31, 1916. Control of the Bolivian mines by the English is not yet\r\ndangerous to American interests, except through the banking system, but\r\nentire control may be passed to them, to the Germans or the French,\r\nthrough American tariff legislation.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal, English companies control a number of the mines, and\r\nit has been alleged by at least two Americans[89] that the English\r\ngovernment, through its representations at Lisbon, for a period of more\r\nthan two years, prevented title passing to American companies. The\r\nThermo Electric Ore Reduction Corporation, Ltd., seems to be the chief\r\nEnglish owner of Portuguese tungsten mines.\r\n\r\n  [89] Personal communications.\r\n\r\nIn the Dutch East Indies, the British are understood to control the\r\npresent wolframite production of about 5 tons a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n=French Control.=--French control of tungsten deposits is not large.\r\nIt includes the production of France and of Tonkin, a part of that\r\nfrom Portugal, and a comparatively small interest in Bolivia. During\r\nthe war, control in Portugal was attempted by England and France. The\r\nprices offered by the English and French were much below the market\r\nprices at New York, and the Portuguese government stepped in and raised\r\nprices to a point somewhat lower than those of the United States, but\r\n20 per cent. higher than the prices offered by England and France.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Japanese Control.=--Japan has within her own borders a considerable\r\nnumber of tungsten deposits in the southern part of the islands, but\r\nall are small. In Korea important deposits have been discovered and\r\nactively worked, especially within the last two years. Deposits in\r\nManchuria are said to be controlled by the Japanese; little is known\r\nof them, and if they exist they are probably small. Japanese ores have\r\nlargely come to the United States for several years. As has been said,\r\nJapanese firms have erected electric furnaces in which a part of the\r\ntungsten ores are reduced, probably the equivalent of 25 to 35 tons per\r\nmonth of concentrates carrying 60 per cent. WO₃.\r\n\r\n\r\n=American Control.=--The United States controls entirely the tungsten\r\ndeposits within its own borders and Alaska. Americans operating in\r\nMexico have produced 200 to 300 short tons of scheelite concentrates\r\nper year, from deposits in the Sahuaripa district, Sonora. Wolframite\r\nis said to have been shipped from Sinaloa to the United States, but its\r\nreal origin is unknown. Contact metamorphic deposits about 60 miles\r\nsouthwest of Nacozari carry 0.7 per cent. WO₃ and 1 to 2 per cent.\r\ncopper. They are owned by Americans but are not now productive.\r\n\r\nIn Bolivia, Americans own some of the more important tungsten mines.\r\nThe American firms known to own tungsten properties there are W. R.\r\nGrace & Co., local address, La Paz; Stewart, Wilson & Hepburn, Oruro;\r\nEasley Inslee, La Paz; and C. Dillon, Oruro. Their total output is\r\nestimated to amount to about 1,600 tons, out of a total output of more\r\nthan 4,000 tons for the country.\r\n\r\nIn southern China, American firms have largely developed the tungsten\r\ntrade, so that through this source the United States (or rather\r\nAmerican capital) controls, unless hindered, a yearly output of perhaps\r\n9,000 short tons of tungsten concentrates.\r\n\r\nIn Siam one or two United States companies have attempted to produce\r\ntungsten, but English influence during the war made difficult the\r\nshipment of even small lots of ores to this country.\r\n\r\nBecause it offered higher prices than other countries, and because\r\nthe more direct and shorter trade route made trade with this country\r\nadvantageous to the Japanese, the United States largely controlled the\r\nJapanese output of tungsten ore in 1918. This trade probably has been\r\nsomewhat curtailed and will be further diminished through the erection\r\nof electric furnaces in Japan. The table following shows the tungsten\r\nores imported for consumption into the United States in 1918, but gives\r\na poor idea of the ores shipped from the countries of origin; Chinese\r\nores lag three months and South American ores about two months. The\r\ntable gives only the ores actually received during the year. Table 29\r\nshows more nearly the ores shipped to the United States during the year.\r\n\r\nChinese ores are treated as averaging 67.5 per cent. WO₃ and other ores\r\n65 per cent. WO₃.\r\n\r\nTABLE 30.--TUNGSTEN-BEARING ORES IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES\r\nIN 1918, BY COUNTRIES AS LISTED AT PORTS OF ENTRY, AND BY PROBABLE\r\nCOUNTRIES OF ORIGIN\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------++------------------------------------\r\n                                 ||   Probable origin and equivalent\r\n        As listed at ports       ||       in 60 per cent.

Owing to the lag in shipments from South America and China\r\nthe South American ores received in January and February were from\r\nthe output of 1917, as were the Chinese ores arriving up to the end\r\nof March. Subtracting the ores arriving from the two regions during\r\nthe first two and three months, respectively, of 1918, and adding\r\nthe ores arriving during a like period in 1919, make the quantity\r\nof ore controlled by the United States in 1918 (as shown on page\r\n153) equivalent to 21,131 tons of concentrates carrying 60 percent.\r\nWO₃, or 59 per cent. of the world’s production. These ores were all\r\ncontrolled through the private initiative of American firms who\r\noffered better prices and better terms than could be obtained abroad.\r\nProbably a larger proportion could be handled in the future, should\r\ninterference not come from within our own borders. It is now proposed\r\nto put a tariff of $10 a unit on tungsten ores without regard to\r\npurity or quality, with a correspondingly high tariff of $1 a pound,\r\nplus the 15 per cent. ad valorem duties now in force, on metal in any\r\nform--element, alloy or salt; and such a bill has passed the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Its advocates believe that the price, now about $7 a\r\nunit in New York, will be raised to $17 a unit.\r\n\r\nHereafter the quantities of tungsten ore handled will be much smaller\r\nthan during 1916, 1917 and 1918; and will be confined to peace-time\r\nneeds unless some unforeseen war arises. England, according to\r\ngovernment estimates about January, 1920, had two years’ supply, and\r\nFrance is probably as well supplied. The United States probably had on\r\nhand an equivalent of quite 8,000 tons of ore carrying 60 per cent.\r\nWO₃. Makers of tool steel figured on a consumption of 7,500 tons during\r\n1919, but because of the lack of market for ore this was much too high;\r\nand probably 4,000 tons is large enough, so that there will likely be\r\nlittle market for new supplies for nearly two years, except as ore may\r\nbe bought speculatively. During this time, mines everywhere must remain\r\nidle until a demand again arises, except for those mines required to\r\nfurnish tungsten for Germany, Austria and Russia and the small quantity\r\nrequired by Sweden, Norway and Italy. If industries in Germany, Austria\r\nand Russia recover so that they can buy and use tungsten, Germany will\r\nhave regained in the ores that will be eagerly offered by producing\r\nnations needing a market, a part of the trade she has lost. Traders of\r\nEngland, France and the United States will be glad to sell tungsten and\r\nferrotungsten, but Germany will undoubtedly reach out for raw material\r\nin order that she may make as much use as possible of her abundant\r\nunemployed labor. Should a tariff law like that now proposed be passed,\r\nthe United States will have cut off its foreign supplies and will have\r\nended its control of any considerable part of them. However, should a\r\nhigh price be maintained, artificially or otherwise, the development of\r\nother alloy steels for use in multiple-edged tools may have reached a\r\npoint where not so much tungsten will be needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=German Control.=--Germany had no considerable tungsten deposits at\r\nhome, and none in the foreign territory she held, but in 1913 her\r\ncontrol through business alliances covered about two-thirds of the\r\nworld’s output of tungsten ore. In that year, according to the German\r\nofficial figures, 5,295 short tons of tungsten ores were imported. Most\r\nof this probably carried 65 per cent. or more WO₃, equivalent to, say,\r\n5,736 tons of concentrates carrying 60 per cent. WO₃. Adding the 106\r\ntons of Saxon concentrates produced in that year shows that Germany\r\ntreated a total of approximately 5,840 tons out of a world’s output\r\nof 8,864 tons, or about 66 per cent. of the total. The United States\r\nin the same year produced 1,537 tons and imported 449 tons of unknown\r\ncontent, but the whole was probably equivalent to more than 2,000 tons\r\nof ore carrying 60 per cent. WO₃, leaving only about 1,000 tons for\r\nother countries, most of which seems to have been treated in France.\r\nThis trade Germany lost when with Austria she started the World War.\r\nWith the cutting off of all shipments by ocean to Germany, most of the\r\nforeign ores were denied her, but undoubtedly small quantities leaked\r\nin through Sweden and Norway for some time after the war began. The\r\nsmall output of Austria was always available, and it is said that a\r\nconsiderable quantity of ore was smuggled across the border of Portugal\r\ninto Spain, thence by water to the western frontier of Italy, into\r\nSwitzerland, and from there shipped direct to Germany. A considerable\r\npart of the Spanish production is said to have reached Germany in this\r\nway also, and the “crippled” submarines that ran into Spanish ports\r\nare reported to have carried out cargoes of tungsten for Germany.\r\nFrom available data it is impossible to confirm or to disprove these\r\nreports, and, in giving them, their doubtfulness is fully recognized,\r\nbut such possibilities must be acknowledged.\r\n\r\nIn the Allied countries and the United States, the German interests\r\nwere taken over by the governments, but in South America the German\r\nfirms still hold some control of tungsten-bearing properties. In\r\nBolivia four German firms are said to have an output of about 600\r\nmetric tons of ore a year. In Peru what is said to be the larger part\r\nof the tungsten deposits has been controlled by firms thought to be\r\nGerman, E. y W. Hardt and Carlos W. Weiss y Cia. In Argentina the Hansa\r\nMining Co., a German concern, is the principal producer. Its output\r\nis said to be about 500 tons of concentrates a year, but even this\r\noutput is said to have come to the United States during the war. If the\r\nUnited States is placed under a prohibitive tariff, Germany may easily\r\nrecover a large part of her control of the world’s tungsten trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PLANTS AND PROCESSES\r\n\r\nThe spread of knowledge, particularly that regarding electric furnaces,\r\nmakes the control of the tungsten trade through secret processes or\r\nsuperior skill extremely difficult, and so far as the United States,\r\nGreat Britain and France are concerned, gives little advantage to any\r\none. Japan is perhaps somewhat less advantageously placed. Smelting\r\nplants are so easily, quickly and cheaply erected that they do not\r\noffer any great chance for monopoly. Cheap power, high technical skill\r\nand knowledge, originality and boldness in experiment, excellence\r\nof organization, generous dealing with producers, an honest product\r\nhonestly sold, good transportation facilities, and broad sane laws are\r\nthe elements that will give control. The United States may have this\r\ncontrol through reasonable effort, but selfish laws may still more\r\neasily wreck control of the larger part of the world’s trade, reduce\r\nour tungsten business to a provincial scope, and make the product high\r\npriced for all time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT CONTROL MEANS IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nIn years of good business before the World War, the United States\r\nused an equivalent of 3,000 to 4,000 short tons of concentrates,\r\ncarrying 60 per cent. WO₃ per annum. When the war began there was a\r\nlull while the attacked countries caught their breath and prepared\r\nfor a long struggle. After plans had been made, and the manufacture\r\nof munitions had begun on a grand scale, the demand for tungsten rose\r\nenormously. All kinds of ores were taken at fabulous prices. Ores\r\ncarrying tin, phosphorus, sulphur and bismuth, that before would not\r\nhave been considered by steel makers, were taken with avidity, and\r\nthere was a great scramble for deposits. In October, 1918, the United\r\nStates was using tungsten ores at the rate of 20,000 tons per annum.\r\nMeanwhile prospecting had uncovered so many new deposits and they were\r\nso actively exploited that great stocks of ores were accumulated in\r\nthe Entente countries. On the other hand, in this country many of the\r\nknown deposits showed signs of impoverishment, a number after being\r\nworked profitably for a short time became wholly inoperative, and it\r\nis likely that some of the deposits that have seemed to be the richest\r\nwill never again produce largely. Among the new discoveries were the\r\ncontact metamorphic deposits of the Great Basin, in California, Nevada\r\nand northeastern Utah. They were partly developed, and several promise\r\nwell, but the irregularity of contact metamorphic ore deposits is\r\nnotorious.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 with prices ranging from $15 to $93.50 per unit, the United\r\nStates produced 5,969 tons of concentrates; in 1917 while still under\r\nthe impetus of the 1916 boom, with prices ranging around $25 per unit,\r\n6,144 tons; and in 1918, with prices still averaging about $25 per\r\nunit, 5,041 tons, although little was produced in December. Under a\r\nprice of $17 per unit, which tariff advocates think can be reached\r\nby means of a tariff of $10 per unit, it seems improbable that the\r\nUnited States can depend on a production of more than 3,000 tons per\r\nannum for the next three years. There are, of course, possibilities of\r\na larger production and there are equal possibilities of a smaller.\r\nShould another great war take place, an event that is not beyond the\r\nrange of imagination, the United States would probably begin by using\r\ntungsten at the rate of 20,000 tons of concentrates per annum. Unless\r\nthe price were even more extravagant than the highest price in 1916,\r\n$93.50 per unit, the United States could not produce half of its needed\r\nconcentrates, and the time required to reach even that output would be\r\nfar too long for safety. Of course, such a production would be much\r\nbetter than none, but the United States should, for safety, have within\r\nreach at least a year’s supply.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific, around the borders of which are the largest tungsten\r\ndeposits, is by many looked upon as the next large theatre of war, and\r\nhowever vitally they were needed, the obtaining of supplies of tungsten\r\nores might become impossible though the blocking of trade routes.\r\nIt would, therefore, seem vastly better that, instead of putting a\r\npremium on the quick depletion of our own supplies, which are already\r\ntoo meager, we should use the rich low-priced ores now being mined in\r\nthe Orient. These cheap ores we may have in trade for the asking, and\r\nit would be one of the best forms of national life insurance for the\r\ngovernment to store 10,000 tons of these ores while they may be had.\r\n\r\nThe argument is often made that by putting a high tariff on tungsten\r\nores we would have our own deposits so developed that quick production\r\ncould be made when needed; also that with the need we would find more\r\nores. Both arguments are specious. What is meant is not development but\r\nremoval. No one will open a tungsten mine to let the ores stand against\r\nthe country’s day of need. The finding of new ores is a probability,\r\nbut the quantity is wholly a question. Few tungsten mines of the United\r\nStates can be profitably worked at the present price of about $7 per\r\nunit, and the mines are now closed. The number of persons dependent on\r\nthe mining of American tungsten ores is small, probably less than 900\r\nin peace times. At present most tungsten miners have already obtained\r\nother employment, and practically all could obtain employment fully\r\nas profitably in other mines, many of which are short handed, so that\r\nno great hardship would be worked. As a matter of national economy,\r\nthe United States can not afford to throw away its chance to buy cheap\r\ntungsten ores while they are available. Aside from the question of\r\ninsurance and even of existence during another war, not to buy South\r\nAmerican ores is to throw away South American trade. In a degree this\r\nis also true of Chinese and Japanese ores.\r\n\r\nThe metallurgy of tungsten, like that of other metals, is being\r\nimproved constantly, and should our ores remain in the ground for a\r\ntime they will be of greater absolute value when mined, for there\r\nwill be less waste in conversion. If our ores are mined now under an\r\nartificially high price, we will always pay a high price for tungsten\r\nores, for when ours are used the ores in other countries will have\r\ndiminished in quantity and increased in cost; prices would be higher\r\nand we would have to buy at the advanced rate. On the other hand, by\r\nholding our markets open to cheap ores from any quarter, we will stand\r\non an equal footing with other countries and will always have a reserve\r\nof high-priced ores available in an emergency.\r\n\r\nThere is but one crop of ore. Deliberately to turn over all the cheap\r\ntungsten ores of the world to our competitors, allowing them this\r\nadvantage in making high-speed steels with which to compete in foreign\r\ntrade with our steels and with all products on and in which they are\r\nused; to put a premium on the early depletion of our own deposits of\r\nthis indispensable metal; and to compel our use always of high-priced\r\nores--these would be economic crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nVANADIUM\r\n\r\nBY R. B. MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF VANADIUM\r\n\r\nThe main use of vanadium is in steel. It is used where great toughness\r\nand torsional strength are required, as in automobile parts, gears,\r\npiston rods, tubes, boiler plates, transmission shafts, bolts, gun\r\nbarrels, gun shields and forgings of any kind which have to withstand\r\nheavy wear and tear. The vanadium content of such steels varies from\r\n0.1 to 0.4 per cent. Vanadium is occasionally used in certain tungsten\r\nalloys for making high-speed tool steel, the introduction of a small\r\nproportion of vanadium decidedly reducing the proportion of tungsten\r\nrequired to give such alloys the desired hardness and toughness.\r\n\r\nArnold has given some illustrations of the effect of vanadium on steels\r\nof different types:\r\n\r\n  One plain carbon steel containing about 1 per cent. of carbon had a\r\n  yield point of 35 tons per square inch, a maximum stress of 60 tons\r\n  per square inch, an elongation of 10 per cent. on 2 inches, and a\r\n  reduction of area of 10 per cent. The addition to this steel of about\r\n  0.6 per cent. of vanadium raised the yield point from 35 to 65 tons,\r\n  the maximum stress from 60 to 86 tons per square inch, still leaving\r\n  an elongation of 7 per cent. and a reduction of area of 8 per cent.\r\n\r\n  A steel containing 0.25 per cent. of carbon and 3.3 per cent. of\r\n  nickel gave a yield point of 33 tons, a maximum stress of 42 tons\r\n  per square inch, an elongation of 26 per cent. on 2 inches, and a\r\n  reduction of area of 53 per cent. A practically identical steel,\r\n  containing in addition about 0.25 per cent. of vanadium, gave a yield\r\n  point of 50 tons instead of 33, and a maximum stress of 68 instead of\r\n  42 tons per square inch. The elongation was 17 per cent. on 2 inches\r\n  and the reduction of area 36 per cent.\r\n\r\n  A steel containing 0.25 per cent. of carbon and about 1 per cent. of\r\n  chromium registered a yield point of 27 tons and a maximum stress\r\n  of 41 tons per square inch, with an elongation of 36 per cent. on 2\r\n  inches and a reduction of area of 55 per cent. The addition of 0.25\r\n  per cent. of vanadium raised the yield point from 27 to 40 and the\r\n  maximum stress from 41 to 55 tons per square inch. The elongation was\r\n  lowered from 36 to 26 per cent., and the reduction of area from 55 to\r\n  53 per cent.\r\n\r\nVanadium, therefore, differs from tungsten in having an extremely\r\nbeneficial effect, not only on tool but also on structural steel.\r\nArnold has shown that vanadium seemingly does not form a double carbide\r\nwith iron, but gradually takes the carbon from the carbide of iron\r\nuntil, if about 5 per cent. of vanadium is present, Fe₃C can not exist,\r\nand only a vanadium carbide, V₄C₃, containing 15 per cent. of carbon,\r\nis present; and this constituent is constant, at least in tool steels\r\ncontaining 5 to 14 per cent. of vanadium. The micrographic analysis of\r\nsuch alloys has resulted in the discovery of three new constituents,\r\nnamely, vanadium pearlite, vanadium hardenite, and vanadium cementite.\r\n\r\nChromium-vanadium steels are the latest development in structural alloy\r\nsteels that have gained an extensive market. Almost all these steels\r\nare made in the open-hearth furnace; the chromium and vanadium alloys\r\nbeing added shortly before casting. In their physical properties these\r\nsteels are much like chrome-nickel steels, but they have a greater\r\ncontraction of area for a given elastic limit than the latter. The\r\ngreater part of the chrome-vanadium steels made goes into automobiles.\r\nSome manufacturers prefer such steels because of their greater freedom\r\nfrom surface imperfections, notably seams, which steels containing\r\nnickel are prone to have if the ingots are at all unsound. These steels\r\nare almost always used in the heat-treated condition, but even in\r\nautomobiles some frames, forgings and shafts are made of the steel in\r\nits natural state.\r\n\r\nSome chrome-vanadium steel is said to be used in armor plate of medium\r\nthickness, which is not face-hardened but has high resistance imparted\r\nby heat treatment.\r\n\r\nVanadium is also used to some extent in making bronzes, in medicine and\r\nin dyeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Substitutes.=--Several substitutes, chiefly titanium and molybdenum,\r\nhave been claimed to give the properties of vanadium in steel. Both\r\nof those metals give to steel some of the properties that are usually\r\nassociated with vanadium, but neither one takes the place of vanadium\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nThe Primos Chemical Co. (see later) has its own patented method for\r\ntreating roscoelite, the ore found at Newmire, Colorado. This method\r\nconsists in roasting the ore with salt containing a little pyrite, and\r\nis a method that is applicable to some extent to most vanadium ores\r\nthat do not carry lead. The American Vanadium Co. has a secret process\r\nfor the treatment of its Peruvian ores. This method has not been\r\npublished. The treatment of vanadinite, cuprodescloizite and carnotite\r\nores has been studied by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, at Golden,\r\nColorado. Whatever change in practice takes place is likely to be\r\nmainly in the concentration of vanadinite and in the treatment of this\r\nmineral and cuprodescloizite.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n=Peruvian Deposits.=--The largest deposits of vanadium in the world,\r\nand the most important, were until recently controlled by the American\r\nVanadium Co. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which in 1919 was absorbed\r\nby the Vanadium Products Corporation, allied to the Bethlehem Steel\r\nCorporation. These deposits are at Minasragra, Peru, 20 miles from\r\nCerro de Pasco. The area lies along the western limit of a broad\r\nanticline in Juratrias and Cretaceous rocks. A section shows the\r\nseries in this locality to be composed of green shales, thin beds of\r\nlimestone, and red shales. Vanadium is found only in the red shales.\r\nThe deposit proper appears to be a lens-shaped mass, 28 feet wide and\r\n350 feet long. The ore contains several minerals. The mineral that\r\nconstitutes the large portion of the deposit is called “quisqueite”;\r\nit is a black carbonaceous substance containing sulphur. There is also\r\na lesser quantity of a coke-like material. Neither of these contains\r\nvanadium. The vanadium is mostly at the southern end of the ore body,\r\nand to a depth of 20 feet is largely in the form of red calcium\r\nvanadate, which is brighter colored then the calcium vanadate in\r\nColorado and Utah, and carries as much as 50 per cent. vanadium oxide.\r\nIt occurs in small pockets and fills the cracks and fissures in a fine\r\nshale. Below this shale is the “mother lode,” which is 9 to 30 feet\r\nthick, extends along the greater length of the deposit, and carries as\r\nhigh as 10 per cent. vanadium oxide and nearly as much sulphur. On the\r\neast and south sides, below the “mother lode,” is a hard blue-black\r\nvanadium shale, carrying as much as 13 per cent. vanadium oxide and\r\n4 to 5 per cent. sulphur. Patronite, the main vanadium mineral, is\r\ngreenish black and contains 19 to 24.8 per cent. vanadium oxide and\r\nin places 50 to 55 per cent. of combined sulphur. The patronite\r\noriginally almost reached the surface and is most abundant in the north\r\nhalf of the lens. The whole ore body is almost completely inclosed by\r\nporphyry dikes and contains two or three intrusions. These deposits\r\nare controlled by the American Vanadium Co., and its successor, the\r\nVanadium Products Corporation, through a concession from the Peruvian\r\ngovernment. They are large, but are by no means inexhaustible, and\r\nas they are entirely local they are not likely to be duplicated. No\r\nsimilar deposits are known, either in Peru or in any other part of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 the American Vanadium Co. treated 5,236 gross tons of ore, from\r\nwhich it extracted 2,122,005 pounds of vanadic acid. From this vanadic\r\nacid the company manufactured 4,925,014 pounds of ferrovanadium. The\r\ncompany did not buy any ore in this country, but relied entirely upon\r\nits Peruvian production.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Foreign Deposits.=--The deposits in Peru are the only deposits\r\nof any commercial importance outside of the United States. Vanadium\r\nis found in South Australia, associated with carnotite and other\r\nuranium minerals. Small quantities of vanadic oxide are obtained as a\r\nby-product in the treatment of these ores.\r\n\r\nVanadium is also associated with uranium minerals in the Andijan\r\ndistrict, Central Asiatic Russia. The vanadium is usually found as\r\nturanite, or copper vanadate; ferganite, an ortho-vanadate of uranium;\r\nand as several other new minerals. The amount of ore seems to be\r\nreasonably large, and this district may ultimately become a source of\r\nboth uranium and vanadium.\r\n\r\nThe lead ores of Mexico contain some vanadium, the best known deposits\r\nbeing in the northeastern part of the State of Chihuahua. Other\r\ndeposits are reported in Zacatecas, Guanajuato, San Luis Potosi, and\r\nHidalgo.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Deposits in the United States.=--The principal vanadium deposits of\r\nthe United States occur in a metallographic province covering southern\r\nand southwestern Colorado, southeastern Utah, and parts of Arizona and\r\nNew Mexico. Uranium and radium characterize the same province.\r\n\r\nProbably the largest deposits of vanadium yet discovered in the\r\nUnited States are in southwestern _Colorado_ in San Miguel County.\r\nThese deposits were visited by Ransome and Spencer in 1899 and\r\ntheir description, together with notes on the chemical analyses and\r\ncomposition of roscoelite by Hillebrand, was published in 1900. Fleck\r\nand French have also described the deposits. Fleck and Haldane later\r\npublished additional descriptions, with notes on mining operations.\r\nHess, in 1912, published an excellent description of these deposits\r\nwith notes on the possible origin, etc.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cross and Purington, the country rock is composed of\r\nJurassic and Triassic sediments, divisible into three formations, the\r\nDolores below, La Plata above and McElmo above La Plata. The latter\r\nis composed of two heavy beds of light-colored sandstone, separated\r\nby a thin bed of limestone. The vanadium-bearing rock is the lower\r\nsandstone. It is a light to dull green, and fine-grained. Occasionally\r\nsplotches of carnotite are found in the cracks and fissures, but the\r\nuranium content is too small to be worth saving.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hillebrand, the green vanadium mineral to which the\r\nsandstone owes its color is not a chlorite, but is closely related to\r\nthe mica, roscoelite. The ore mined has an average content of 1¹⁄₂\r\nper cent. V₂O₅. These low-grade roscoelite deposits can be mined at a\r\nprofit, because they are large and easily worked.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly these deposits have been feeling the effects of the rather\r\nlarge production of the last few years, and the average grade of the\r\nore is now probably at least half of a per cent. lower in V₂O₅ than it\r\nwas a few years ago. There is still considerable ore untouched that\r\nwill average 1 per cent., or a little less. The British government for\r\nseveral years, according to reports, has been interested in obtaining\r\ncontrol of vanadium deposits.\r\n\r\nThe Primos Chemical Co., with works at Newmire, Colorado, and Primos,\r\nPennsylvania, is mining these deposits, and in 1917 made this\r\nproduction:\r\n\r\nTreated 60,907,000 pounds of ore; from this was produced 496,731 pounds\r\nof vanadium in the form of iron vanadate running about 34 per cent.\r\nmetallic vanadium. From this was produced 417,770 pounds of contained\r\nvanadium in the form of regular 40 per cent. ferrovanadium. In 1918,\r\nup to and including July, this company mined 17,449,000 pounds of ore,\r\nfrom which was produced 149,343 pounds of contained vanadium in the\r\nform of vanadate of iron and 133,666 pounds of contained vanadium made\r\nin the form of 40 per cent. ferrovanadium.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 the Primos Chemical Co., was absorbed by the newly organized\r\nVanadium Products Corporation.\r\n\r\nVanadium ore has been discovered in Huerfano County, Colorado, near the\r\nSangre de Cristo Range. The vein is said to be well defined and 1 to 4\r\nfeet in width. A number of assays show 2 to 7 per cent. V₂O₅ content,\r\nand others 2 to 4 per cent. copper. The ore is heavy, black and banded;\r\nit contains small quantities of uranium oxide, but should be classed as\r\na vanadium, rather than a uranium mineral. There has been no commercial\r\nproduction up to date.\r\n\r\nIn Eagle County, 7 miles southeast of the town of Eagle, a silver\r\nore has been found that carries vanadium. This was located mostly in\r\nthe Lady Bell mine. The ore, a dark-greenish sandstone similar in\r\nappearance to the darker types of roscoelite ore found in San Miguel\r\nCounty, assayed from 25 to 1,000 ounces of silver to the ton. The mine\r\nhas been largely worked out for silver, the vanadium being lost during\r\nthe smelting process. There is still, however, an appreciable amount of\r\nvanadium ore left, as the low-grade silver ore was not mined or treated.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of vanadium is obtained as a by-product from\r\nthe treatment of carnotite (uranium and radium) ore. It is difficult\r\nto say just what the yield from this ore is, but it is probable that\r\nit averages about 200,000 pounds of vanadic oxide per annum. This is\r\nproduced by five or six operating radium companies. These deposits\r\nare found in southwestern Colorado, around the Paradox Valley, and in\r\nsoutheastern Utah, extending as far as the San Rafael Swell, southwest\r\nof Green River, Utah.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable ore running one-half to 1 per cent. uranium oxide\r\nwhich carries from 4 to 10 per cent. vanadic oxide. In the past this\r\nore has not been mined, because the extraction of radium from it would\r\nnot pay. With a strong demand and a high price for vanadium, at least\r\nthe higher grades of this ore could be mined at a profit. There is\r\nconsiderable of such ore at certain localities north of the Paradox\r\nValley; unfortunately, these deposits are somewhat scattered and some\r\nwould involve not only long wagon hauls, but also transportation by\r\nburro to wagon roads. Only the higher-grade ore could be handled in\r\nthis way at a profit, and the difficulty is to get enough to justify\r\nbuilding a treatment plant.\r\n\r\nThe writer has been told that there are deposits of this same type of\r\nore at Temple Mountain, 40 miles south of Green River, Utah.\r\n\r\nA small vanadinite deposit, containing traces of wulfenite, has\r\nbeen found near Klinefelter Station, on the main line of the Santa\r\nFe Railroad, near the eastern border of San Bernardino County,\r\n_California_. The ore is largely calcite and is low grade, averaging\r\nprobably from 1 to 2 per cent. vanadic oxide.\r\n\r\nA deposit of vanadinite in Sierra County, _New Mexico_, on the\r\nAtchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad, was mined for a short period in\r\n1912 and 1913. Besides vanadium, the veins contain galenite, copper\r\ncarbonates, barite, fluorite and other minerals. The ore was treated at\r\na mill close to the mine, but the whole undertaking was unsuccessful,\r\nprobably because the ore was so low grade, and because of metallurgical\r\ndifficulties. There are a number of other deposits of vanadinite in New\r\nMexico, but none of them have been commercially developed in any way.\r\n\r\nVanadinite is found in a considerable number of places in _Arizona_,\r\nfrequently associated with wulfenite, or lead molybdate. Indeed,\r\none of the difficulties of producing both vanadium and molybdenum\r\nfrom vanadinite and wulfenite is the fact that the two minerals are\r\nfrequently so closely associated that, because of the slight difference\r\nin specific gravity, it is not easy to separate them by mechanical\r\nmethods. At the Mammoth mine, in Arizona, the upper levels are richer\r\nin vanadinite than in wulfenite, but at the lower levels, the reverse\r\nis true. Undoubtedly a considerable amount of vanadinite could be\r\nproduced from this mine and others in the vicinity, but it is doubtful\r\nwhether it could be done at a profit, even at a high price for vanadium.\r\n\r\nThe United States Vanadium Co. has a mine 4 miles from Ray Junction,\r\nArizona, and at the mine a small mill to concentrate the ore, which\r\nis low grade, and produces vanadium from the concentrates. The amount\r\nof ore that can be obtained from this mine is somewhat doubtful. This\r\nis the trouble with vanadinite as a whole; it exists over a wide\r\nterritory, but the deposits are all low grade and apparently are not\r\nextensive in any one locality.\r\n\r\nOne of the most promising deposits, as regards increased production of\r\nvanadium, is at the Shattuck mine, Bisbee, Arizona, where a large vug,\r\nor cavity, is lined with a vanadium mineral, probably cuprodescloizite.\r\nThe ore carries about 8 to 10 per cent. vanadic oxide, in addition to\r\ncopper and lead. This seems to be one of the best opportunities for an\r\nincreased production of vanadium in this country. The Golden, Colo.,\r\nstation of the United States Bureau of Mines made a metallurgical study\r\nof the treatment of this ore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.--Geographical distribution of the vanadium\r\ndeposits of the world.]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the vanadium deposits of the world is shown in\r\nPlate V.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF LEADING COMMERCIAL NATIONS\r\n\r\nThe United States is peculiarly fortunate as regards vanadium products,\r\nfor it is practically the only producer of vanadium in the world, the\r\nPeruvian deposits being under the control of an American company.\r\nTherefore, England, France, Germany, Japan and other nations are forced\r\nto buy of American companies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENTS AND CHANGES IN KNOWN GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE NEAR\r\nFUTURE\r\n\r\nThe larger part of the vanadium that has been used in this country\r\nhas come from the mines of the American Vanadium Co. in Peru, but the\r\nPrimos Chemical Co. produced an amount of vanadium from its claims at\r\nNewmire, San Miguel County, Colorado, that at least tended to give some\r\nreal competition to the American Vanadium Co. As already stated, these\r\nclaims are not nearly as rich or productive as they were, but they are\r\nprobably good for several years more. The ore from Peru can be counted\r\non probably for several years at something like the present output.\r\nThe same statement applies to carnotite ore, and it is likely that the\r\nproduction of vanadium from carnotite may increase to some extent, as\r\nthe demand for radium is strong, and there may be a consequent increase\r\nin the treatment of lower-grade carnotite. As this low-grade material\r\nusually carries more vanadium, the production of vanadium from this\r\nsource may increase.\r\n\r\nVanadinite may prove to be a source of vanadium, although it is\r\ndoubtful whether any large quantity can be produced from this mineral.\r\nAs already stated, cuprodescloizite is probably the best source for an\r\nimmediate increase in production.\r\n\r\nAs regards foreign countries other than Peru, Russia is the only\r\none likely to produce any appreciable amount of vanadium ores, and\r\nundoubtedly no such production will be obtained until industrial\r\nconditions are more settled.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe American Vanadium Co. holds its mines in Peru through a concession\r\nfrom the Peruvian government. Thus at least two-thirds of the vanadium\r\nproduction of the world is practically in the hands of the Peruvian\r\ngovernment, although the company operating is American.\r\n\r\nFormerly the American Vanadium Co. was the only producer of vanadium\r\nproducts and ferrovanadium in the world. The price of vanadium was then\r\nsomewhere around $5.00 per pound for the metallic vanadium content\r\nof the ferrovanadium. Later the Primos Chemical Co. came into the\r\nfield, and the American Vanadium Co. cut the price. On account of the\r\nlarge deposits of ore that the Primos Chemical Co. had in Colorado,\r\nthe result was simply a lowering of the price of ferrovanadium.\r\nUndoubtedly, if it were not for this competition the price of vanadium\r\nduring that period would have been higher than it was, and if it were\r\nnot for the Primos Chemical Co., the American Vanadium Co. would\r\nhave had practically a monopoly of the whole vanadium production, as\r\nthe output from carnotite was not large enough to affect the market\r\nseriously. As it was, these two companies controlled more than 90 per\r\ncent. of the ore supply, and thus the recent change of ownership to\r\nthe Vanadium Products Corporation will enable the latter to fix the\r\nprice, as well as to regulate the consumption and thus prolong the\r\navailability of a useful metal which otherwise would be likely to soon\r\nbecome exhausted. The principal vanadium deposits of Chihuahua, Mexico,\r\nare controlled by the Madero estate (Mexican).\r\n\r\nThis dominance of control of sources of supply has made control through\r\nownership of reduction plants, patents and secret processes of less\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nANTIMONY\r\n\r\nBY H. G. FERGUSON AND D. A. HALL\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF ANTIMONY\r\n\r\nThe following summary of the _uses of antimony_ is taken from _Mineral\r\nResources of United States_, 1918.[90]\r\n\r\n  [90] BASTIN, E. S.: “Antimony in 1918,” _Mineral Resources of the\r\n  United States_, 1918. U. S. Geol. Survey, 1919.\r\n\r\n  Peace uses.--Metallic antimony unalloyed has few industrial uses.\r\n  In the form of fine powder, known as “iron black,” it is used for\r\n  producing the appearance of polished steel on articles made of\r\n  papier-maché or pottery. For these purposes it is precipitated by\r\n  the action of metallic zinc in an acid solution of antimony salts.\r\n  Antimony alloys readily with most heavy metals and the alloy is\r\n  harder than the two pure metals. Most of these alloys possess the\r\n  property of slight expansion on solidifying. Type metal is an alloy\r\n  of antimony, lead, and tin; babbitt, anti-friction, or bearing\r\n  metal is usually an alloy of antimony, tin, and copper. Britannia\r\n  metal, also known as “white metal,” is an alloy of antimony, tin,\r\n  and copper, with some zinc, and, rarely, small quantities of other\r\n  metals. It is used in making cheap domestic tableware, teapots, and\r\n  spoons. Antimony alloys find minor utilization in battery plates,\r\n  toys, cable coverings, and siphon tops. Lead-antimony alloy or hard\r\n  lead is used in making acid-resisting valves.\r\n\r\n  White antimony oxide, mainly the tetraoxide (Sb₂O₄), is used for\r\n  making opaque white enamel and other sanitary ware. In this use\r\n  antimony oxides compete with tin oxide. Antimony oxide, mainly\r\n  trioxide, is used as a coloring agent in the manufacture of glass,\r\n  as it is more readily fusible than tetraoxide and does not impart\r\n  opacity to the glass. Antimony oxides are further used as paint\r\n  pigments.\r\n\r\n  The red sulphides of antimony are used in vulcanizing and coloring\r\n  red rubber and also as paint pigments. The natural antimony\r\n  trisulphide, stibnite, enters into the composition of safety matches\r\n  or of the compound that is put on the match box.\r\n\r\n  Antimonate of lead containing an excess of lead oxide, known as\r\n  “Naples yellow,” is used in oil paints and in the glass and ceramic\r\n  industries. The antimony salt, tartar emetic (double tartrate of\r\n  antimony and potassium), and antimony fluoride are employed as\r\n  mordants in dyeing. Tartar emetic and antimony trioxide are employed\r\n  medicinally.\r\n\r\n  War uses.--Antimonial lead carrying 12 to 13 per cent. of antimony is\r\n  employed in the manufacture of shrapnel bullets. Smaller quantities\r\n  of liquated antimony sulphide are used in the primers of shells. For\r\n  this last purpose it is claimed the material must carry less than 2\r\n  per cent. of impurities insoluble in hydrochloric acid. Antimony\r\n  sulphide as a powder is used in the charge of some shells to produce\r\n  on explosion a white smoke which is of service in range finding.\r\n\r\nDuring the war Germany used antimony to some extent as a substitute for\r\nmore important metals in the manufacture of currency, but shortage of\r\nantimony itself did not allow this use to become important.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe geological distribution of commercial antimony depends, with a\r\nfew exceptions, upon the distribution of the principal ore mineral,\r\nstibnite (antimony sulphide). Cervantite, sernarmontite and valentinite\r\nare antimony oxides resulting directly from the decomposition of\r\nstibnite near the surface, and with other oxidized products form the\r\nchief ores of certain districts. Metallic antimony, also a result of\r\noxidation of the sulphides, is rarely found, and still more rarely is\r\nit an ore mineral. Jamesonite, the sulphide of antimony and lead, is of\r\nfrequent occurrence and is the principal ore of one important deposit\r\nin Mexico. Antimony is also recovered from the refining of antimonial\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nStibnite occurs in quartz veins and related deposits. Many of the\r\nimportant antimony deposits of the world occur in more or less close\r\ngenetic relationship with eruptives of Tertiary age. The ore often\r\ngives way to pyrite with depth. A few important deposits occur in\r\nconnection with intrusive rocks formed at considerable depth and are\r\nprobably of contact metamorphic origin.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a wide diversity in the forms of the deposits and\r\nthe nature of enclosing rocks, stibnite shows a distinct tendency to\r\nform replacements in limestone. The chief gangue minerals are quartz\r\nand calcite. Of other sulphides pyrite is the commonest, but cinnabar,\r\nrealgar, chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite are often present as\r\naccessories. A characteristic feature of stibnite deposits is the\r\nrelative scarcity of other sulphides; and it is equally true that\r\nimportant sulphide deposits of other metals rarely contain stibnite.\r\nAn exception to the general rule is cinnabar, the sulphide of mercury,\r\nwhich is a characteristic mineral of certain stibnite veins. Likewise\r\nstibnite is one of the minerals most frequently associated with\r\ncinnabar deposits.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the most important antimony districts owe their production\r\nof that metal to the presence of recoverable amounts of gold. This\r\nis true of certain French, Hungarian, Australian, and South African\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION, AND POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nAlthough antimony has been produced at times from a great many\r\nlocalities in the world, in only a few countries have deposits been\r\ndeveloped to an important extent commercially. Under normal conditions\r\nof consumption the potential supply of antimony ore is far in excess\r\nof the demand. Consequently only those deposits that can be cheaply\r\nworked and are favorably situated with regard to markets, or contain\r\nappreciable amounts of other minerals, principally gold, have been\r\nextensively exploited.\r\n\r\nThe antimony-producing countries of the world may be divided into three\r\ngroups as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Chief producing countries in order of importance: China, France and\r\nAlgeria, and Mexico.\r\n\r\n2. Countries in which production is irregular in normal times but in\r\nwhich potential reserves are considerable, and production becomes\r\nimportant at high-price levels: The former Austrian Empire, Bolivia,\r\nAustralia (Victoria), Burma, South Africa, Italy, Spain, and Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n3. Countries in which normal production is small and in which known\r\nreserves are probably less important: United States and Alaska,\r\nCanada, Peru, Germany, Turkey (Asia Minor), Serbia, Portugal, Borneo,\r\nIndo-China, and Japan.\r\n\r\nPlate VI shows the geographical distribution of the chief antimony\r\ndeposits of the world.\r\n\r\nThe production statistics of the various countries are so little in\r\naccord that it is impossible to give more than a rough comparison\r\nbetween the important producers. As nearly as can be estimated\r\nthe output of antimony ore in 1913, the last year for which even\r\napproximately complete statistics are available, amounted to about\r\n20,000 metric tons of recoverable antimony. The consumption is even\r\nmore difficult to estimate, as customs figures for different countries\r\nvary widely. The following table shows the relative importance of the\r\nprincipal producing and consuming countries in terms of percentage of\r\nthe world’s output in 1913:\r\n\r\nTABLE 31.--PERCENTAGE OF ANTIMONY PRODUCED AND CONSUMED\r\n\r\n  --------------------+----------+-----------\r\n                      |Percentage|Percentage\r\n                      |    of    |    of\r\n  Country             |production|consumption\r\n  --------------------+----------+-----------\r\n  Austria-Hungary     |    4     |    4\r\n  France              |   24     |   20\r\n  Germany             | (small)  |   20\r\n  Italy               |    2     |    2\r\n  United Kingdom      |    0     |   12\r\n  Serbia              |    1     |    0\r\n  Asia Minor          |    1     |    0\r\n  Japan               |    0 }   |   10\r\n  China               |   51 }   |\r\n  Algiers             |    1     |    0\r\n  United States       |    0     |   32\r\n  Mexico              |   11     |    0\r\n  Australia (Victoria)|    4     | (small)\r\n  All other           |    1     | (small)\r\n                      |  ---     |  ---\r\n                      |  100     |  100\r\n  --------------------+----------+-----------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.--Geographical distribution of the antimony\r\ndeposits of the world. By H. G. Ferguson and D. A. Hall.]\r\n\r\nIn the following discussion of the world’s antimony resources,\r\npolitical control is largely indicated by the country headings, under\r\nwhich are summarized the essential features of the commercial control\r\nof production, by ownership of mines and reduction plants, and by\r\ntrading interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth America.\r\n\r\n\r\n_United States._--Antimony deposits occur in many places in the United\r\nStates, but during peace times the comparatively high costs of mining\r\nin this country do not permit competition with the Chinese and Mexican\r\nmines. A small production of antimonial lead from domestic ores was\r\nmade prior to the war and a small amount of antimony recovered as\r\na by-product of lead refining, but except for this the country was\r\nentirely dependent upon imported antimony.\r\n\r\nHigh prices following the outbreak of the war brought a quick response\r\nin the production of antimony ores. The mine production of antimony\r\nore in 1915 was about 5,000 short tons containing 2,100 short tons of\r\nmetal, and in 1916 was 4,500 short tons containing about 1,770 short\r\ntons of metal. The lower prices of 1917 were reflected in the decreased\r\noutput for that year, amounting to 1,060 short tons of ore containing\r\n390 tons of metal. The 1918 production was 190 tons, containing about\r\n50 tons of metal.\r\n\r\nThe chief producing states in order of importance were Nevada,\r\nCalifornia, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Arkansas. Utah and\r\nArizona yielded insignificant amounts. In Nevada the Sutherland mine,\r\nin Humboldt County, was the principal producer. In California, the\r\ngreater part of the output was from two mines in Inyo and Kern counties\r\noperated by the Western Metals Co., of Los Angeles, the ore being\r\nshipped to San Pedro, near Los Angeles, for smelting. In Washington the\r\nantimony was produced at the property of the Gold Creek Antimony Mining\r\n& Smelting Co., in Okanogan County. In Oregon the Jim Dandy mine, near\r\nBaker City, was the principal producer. In Arkansas one property in\r\nSevier County yielded a noteworthy output of ore in 1916 and also a\r\nsmall quantity of metallic antimony at a local reduction plant. In\r\nAlaska the production was mainly from the Fairbanks district, the ore\r\nbeing shipped to Los Angeles and Seattle for smelting.\r\n\r\nThe ownership of mines within the United States does not play an\r\nimportant part in the present control of the world’s resources,\r\ninasmuch as production under normal conditions is insignificant. It\r\nis possible that with the development of new uses for antimony, and a\r\ngreater demand for that metal, the reserves in this country may become\r\nof commercial importance.\r\n\r\nAbout 40 per cent. of the Mexican antimony output is controlled in the\r\nUnited States. An American-owned smelter was built during the war at\r\nSan Luis Potosi. Ores from mines in this region have also been shipped\r\nto the Western Metals Co. at Los Angeles. An American concern, the\r\nAntimony Corporation, owns a large deposit of jamesonite, antimony-lead\r\nsulphide, in Mexico, which constitutes an important reserve that has\r\nnot yet been developed. Antimony deposits in northern Mexico were\r\nworked by American capital during the war. Prior to the year 1914\r\nonly one company in the United States had attempted the smelting of\r\nantimony. During the war considerable activity prevailed, however, and\r\nseveral companies undertook the smelting of foreign and domestic ores.\r\nChina, Bolivia, and Mexico were the principal sources of supply. The\r\nsuccess of all these enterprises has been only temporary, as under\r\nnormal conditions the high cost of production in this country prevents\r\nsuccessful competition with Chinese and Japanese metal. American\r\nsmelting interests exert little control on the antimony of the world at\r\npresent, and can not be expected to do so in the immediate future. The\r\nsmelter capacity of the country is estimated at 6,000 to 7,000 tons of\r\nmetal per annum, all of which is now idle. One company, the Antimony &\r\nCompounds Co. of America, is closely connected with a French company,\r\nLa Lucette.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canada._--Antimony production in Canada has been extremely irregular.\r\nDuring periods of high prices a considerable output was obtained, the\r\nyears of maximum production being 1898, with shipments of 1,344 short\r\ntons of ore, and 1907, with 2,016 short tons. Mining ceased in 1910 and\r\nwas not resumed until 1915. In 1915, 1,341 tons of 40 per cent. (metal\r\ncontent) ore were produced; in 1916, 885 tons of 42 per cent. ore; and\r\n361 tons in 1917.\r\n\r\nThe principal producing district is at West Gore, Nova Scotia, where\r\nthe ore in addition to its antimony content has a tenor of 2 to 4\r\nounces of gold per ton. Other regions that have produced antimony ore\r\nare New Brunswick (York County), British Columbia, Quebec, and Yukon\r\nTerritory. In British Columbia (Slocan District) and Yukon Territory\r\n(Chieftain Hills) antimonial lead ores are also worked. The Nova Scotia\r\nores, which furnished the bulk of the production, have been exported to\r\nEngland since 1915; the earlier production went to Germany. The small\r\nproduction of refined antimony came chiefly as a by-product of lead\r\nrefining at the smelter of the Consolidated Mining & Smelting Co., at\r\nTrail, B. C.; a small amount of antimony was also smelted from antimony\r\nores by the New Brunswick Metals, Ltd. (formerly the Canadian Antimony\r\nCo.) at Lake George, N. B. Canada appears to be in about the same\r\nposition as the United States with reference to antimony mining. High\r\nprices, continued over a long period, will bring out a considerable\r\nproduction, but no output is to be expected at peace-time prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mexico._--Antimony deposits exist in many parts of Mexico and there\r\nhas been a considerable production for many years. As in other\r\ncountries, the output increased largely during 1915 and 1916. The\r\nproduction of metallic antimony for 1917 is reported as 2,141 metric\r\ntons. In 1914 there were exported to England 1,543 long tons of crude\r\nantimony and regulus; there were no exports to England in 1918, but\r\n1,449 short tons of ore and 2,660 of metal were shipped to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe principal mines are in the Sierra Catorce, in the states of San\r\nLuis Potosi and Queretaro. The ores are mixed sulphides and oxides and\r\ncarry 5 to 50 per cent. antimony.\r\n\r\nA smelter with an annual capacity of 6,000 tons of metal was built at\r\nWadley in 1900, and most of the production formerly went to England,\r\nbut since 1915 has been marketed in the United States. The smelter and\r\nmost important mines are owned by Cookson’s, of England, through a\r\nsubsidiary, the Republican Mining & Metal Co. American interests own\r\nother properties in the same region, and during the war a smelter was\r\nconstructed at San Luis Potosi by the International Mining & Metal Co.\r\nIn western Sonora, near the Gulf of California, there are deposits of\r\noxidized ores that furnished a considerable part of the ore imported\r\ninto the United States. These are owned by American capital.\r\n\r\nA large deposit of lead-antimony ore (jamesonite) at Zimapan, Hidalgo,\r\nowned by The Antimony Corporation, an American firm, has not yet\r\nreached the producing stage. Other deposits of possible importance\r\nare known in the states of Guerrero, Durango, Sonora, Mexico, Baja\r\nCalifornia, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nPolitical disturbances during the last few years have prevented an\r\noutput of antimony commensurate with the probable capacity of the\r\ndeposits. Production will probably be maintained in the future, even\r\nduring periods of low prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bolivia._--The output of Bolivia was negligible before the war, but\r\nunder the stimulus of high prices large amounts of high-grade ore were\r\nproduced in 1915 and 1916. This ore was shipped principally to England,\r\nuntil an embargo was placed on Bolivian ore in 1918. The ore is high\r\ngrade, that shipped averaging over 50 per cent. antimony, but the veins\r\nare small and become unproductive at shallow depth. It is possible that\r\nthe known deposits have been largely exhausted; and although demand as\r\nstrong as that of 1916 might result in new discoveries of importance,\r\nit is not likely that Bolivia can be an important producer when prices\r\nare under normal conditions.\r\n\r\nExports of ore amounted to 17,923 metric tons in 1915 (as against 186\r\nin 1914); to 22,748 tons in 1916; and to 18,340 tons in 1917; but in\r\n1918, for reasons given above, shipments dropped to 3,070 tons. From 75\r\nto 90 per cent. of the ore went to England, and most of the remainder\r\nto the United States, except for about a thousand tons a year to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peru._--During the antimony boom of 1906-1907 a small amount of\r\nantimony was produced in Peru. No further production was made until\r\n1915, when 522 tons of high-grade ore was mined. In 1916 the production\r\nrose to 1,876 tons of 60 per cent. ore. The 1917 production was 902\r\ntons. Although deposits are known in many parts of the republic, over\r\n90 per cent. of the production has come from the department of Puno, in\r\nsouthern Peru. Up to the present, profitable mining has been possible\r\nonly during periods of high prices, but the deposits are said to be\r\nextensive, and it is possible that improved transportation facilities\r\nwould result in some production under normal conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Austria-Hungary._--The most important antimony deposits of the old\r\nAustrian Empire are those of Hungary and Bohemia. Others of minor\r\nimportance are in Carniola, in Austria. The Hungarian deposits in\r\n1913 furnished 11,017 tons of ore containing 1,038 tons of metal; for\r\nthe rest of Austria the output was 1,270 tons of ore, but only 89\r\ntons of metal. The low antimony content of the Hungarian deposits is\r\ncompensated by the gold content, and these deposits have produced much\r\nmore regularly than those of the other parts of the empire. So far\r\nas known the reserves are fairly large, but production can hardly be\r\nexpected to increase greatly.\r\n\r\nThe productive capacity of both the Hungarian and Bohemian deposits\r\nis probably enough to supply local needs in normal times, and allow a\r\nsurplus for export when economic conditions are favorable. Prior to\r\nthe war, exports of regulus went to Germany and small amounts of ore\r\nwere exported to France and England. During the war the Central Empires\r\nprobably depended largely on the Austro-Hungarian deposits for their\r\nantimony supplies. All mines were worked by the government. It is known\r\nthat certain mines that had been abandoned resumed operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_France._--France is the most important antimony-producing country in\r\nEurope and also controls important productive deposits in Algiers and\r\nIndo-China.\r\n\r\nThe French deposits are numerous but for the most part small. The most\r\nimportant of these is La Lucette, in Mayenne, where stibnite associated\r\nwith auriferous pyrite has been mined for many years. This deposit was\r\nconsidered to be approaching exhaustion, but recent work is reported\r\nto have developed new ore bodies. The La Lucette company has recently\r\nextended its holdings in other parts of France, has bought properties\r\nin Algiers and the Transvaal, and in 1911 leased a smelter at Barcelona\r\nfor the treatment of ores purchased abroad. The La Lucette company\r\nis also to some degree associated with the American firm of Antimony\r\n& Compounds Co. of America. Undeveloped deposits are known in Tunis,\r\nMorocco, French Guinea, and Madagascar.\r\n\r\nFrench control of foreign supplies is not of great importance. In\r\naddition to its holdings in the Transvaal, the La Lucette company\r\npurchases some foreign ores. In 1913, 4,440 tons of antimony ore was\r\nimported from China, and 205 tons from Turkey. Foreign control of\r\nFrench deposits is limited to a few companies. An Italian company,\r\nMinière Fonderie d’Antimonio, owns concessions in France and Corsica,\r\nfrom which the production before the war was about 3,500 tons of ore\r\nper year. The great Belgian smelting company, Société de la Vieille\r\nMontagne, owns the most productive Algerian deposit--the Hamman N’\r\nBails mine; and an unimportant Algerian mine was, prior to the war,\r\nowned by Beer, Sondheimer & Co., a German firm.\r\n\r\nIn 1913, France produced 20,872 metric tons of ore carrying about 32\r\nper cent. metal content. The smelter output in 1913 was 6,390 tons of\r\nregulus and oxide. France is normally an exporter of metallic antimony,\r\nthe average annual exports during the period of 1910-1914 amounting\r\nto about 2,000 metric tons. The principal purchasers were United\r\nStates, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and Russia. According to recent\r\ninformation, the surplus production of antimony in France is now so\r\nlarge that the industry can hardly continue to exist on a paying basis\r\nunless the producers come to an understanding among themselves. It\r\nis clear, however, that to be effective, any agreement among French\r\nproducers must be either backed by a high protective tariff or must be\r\nextended to include their principal foreign competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Germany._--In Germany the antimony output is too small to affect\r\nappreciably the world’s market, but a few localities have possibilities\r\nof production when the price of antimony is sufficiently high. One\r\nplant in the Eifel district in 1915 was producing 25 to 30 tons of\r\nregulus and 60 to 70 tons of oxide a month. There was, however, a\r\nproduction of antimonial lead from the smelters that may amount to\r\n1,000 tons or more of antimony a year. This is derived in part from\r\nGerman ores, especially the lead-zinc ores, and in part from ores of\r\nforeign origin.\r\n\r\nGermany’s interest in the antimony market is chiefly that of the\r\nsmelter and middle man. Average annual imports, 1910-1913, were as\r\nfollows: Ore, 3,668 tons; metal, 3,398; salts, 668. The exports\r\naveraged, ore, 566 tons; metal, 331; salts, 1,226. The principal\r\npurchasers of metal were the United States and Russia; and of salts\r\nRussia and England.\r\n\r\nGerman interest in foreign deposits was not extensive. The\r\nMetallgesellschaft seems to have had some connection with an Italian\r\ncompany, the Minière Fonderie d’Antimonio, owning mines in Italy and\r\nFrance, and Beer, Sondheimer & Co. was recorded as the owner of one\r\nAlgerian mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great Britain._--Although deposits were formerly worked in Cornwall,\r\nDevon, and elsewhere, no antimony has been mined in England since\r\n1892, but before the war England was the chief smelting center of\r\nthe world, and several brands of British antimony, such as Cookson’s\r\nand Hallett’s, had a world-wide reputation. Deposits of considerable\r\nimportance exist in many of the British possessions.\r\n\r\nCookson & Co., of Newcastle, control mines in the Catorce district, San\r\nLuis Potosi, Mexico, and operate a smelter, the output from which was\r\nshipped to England for further refining until 1915, when the supply was\r\nin large part diverted to the United States.\r\n\r\nEngland, through her smelting interests, has played an important\r\npart in the antimony trade of the world. Seven smelters in England\r\nrefine ore and crude metals that come chiefly from China, but also\r\nfrom Mexico, Australia, and Hungary, and, during the war, in large\r\nquantities from Bolivia and Spain. The better British brands have been\r\nconsidered more pure than other grades, and before the war virtually\r\nmonopolized American markets.\r\n\r\nBritish trading interests have exerted important control both in\r\nsecuring raw material for British smelters and in obtaining markets\r\nfor British metal. Until 1914 the Chinese Eastern Antimony Co., a\r\nsubsidiary of Cookson & Co., held contracts for the production of the\r\nWah Chang Mining & Smelting Co., the most important antimony producers\r\nin China. In 1914, the Wah Chang Co. established an independent selling\r\nagency in the United States. During the great demand for antimony in\r\n1915 and 1916, British interests secured the greater proportion of the\r\noutput of Bolivian mines and completely controlled the industry of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Italy._--Italy is the third important antimony producer of Europe.\r\nThe principal deposits are those in the southern part of the island of\r\nSardinia. During the war, however, the Tuscan deposits were reopened\r\nand there has been also a small production from Sicily. The grade of\r\nthe ore is low, probably on the average less than 25 per cent., and the\r\nproduction, which was 7,609 tons of ore in 1900, had fallen in 1913 to\r\n1,822 tons. War conditions stimulated the industry, and in 1915, 1916,\r\nand 1917 the production averaged over 5,000 tons annually, although the\r\nimports of metallic antimony also increased, being as follows: 191 tons\r\nin 1914; 825 in 1915; 155 in 1916; and 1,247 in 1917.\r\n\r\nThe low metallic content of the ore, together with the fact that in the\r\nSardinia deposits the calcite gangue makes recovery more difficult,\r\nrenders it probable that under peace-time conditions and prices, Italy\r\nwill not become an important factor in the world’s antimony production.\r\n\r\nThe chief producing company, Minière Fonderie d’Antimonio, was, prior\r\nto the war, closely connected with the German Metallgesellschaft, and\r\nthe richest Sardinian ore went to Germany for smelting. Besides mines\r\nin Italy, this company owned several productive deposits in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Portugal._--A small amount of antimony ore, 100 tons in 1912 and 19\r\ntons in 1913, is produced in Portugal. Exports in 1916 exceeded 4,000\r\ntons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russia._--Antimony and argentiferous lead-antimony deposits are known\r\nin the Urals and were under development in 1912. Antimony deposits also\r\noccur in the Amur province and in many localities in Siberia. In 1915,\r\n67 tons of regulus was imported into England from Russia. Possibly,\r\nhowever, this represents an overland shipment of Chinese material.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Serbia._--Serbia contains several antimony deposits of considerable\r\npromise. The production, however, has been small. No data are available\r\nsince 1912. The output of regulus and oxide, which amounted to 4,725\r\nmetric tons in 1904, had decreased to 297 metric tons in 1912. The\r\ngreater part of the product was formerly shipped to the United States.\r\nPlants at two of the mines are capable of a considerable output should\r\nconditions warrant it. It seems unlikely, however, that the Serbian\r\ndeposits will play an important part in determining the control of the\r\nworld’s production.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spain._--Antimony deposits are known in many localities in Spain. Most\r\nof these are irregular and have been repeatedly worked and abandoned.\r\nA few, however, offer some promise of a continued output. The annual\r\nproduction has scarcely exceeded 500 metric tons of ore, even under the\r\nstimulus of war conditions (516 tons in 1916, and 502 tons in 1917).\r\nThe smelter production in 1916 was 425 tons. Shortly after the outbreak\r\nof the war there were three smelters, the most important being operated\r\nby the French company, La Lucette.\r\n\r\nBefore the war Spain imported annually 800 tons of antimony ore from\r\nFrance, and over 100 tons of salts of antimony was exported annually to\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Borneo._--British Borneo was formerly a producer of considerable\r\nimportance, and much ore was exported between 1859 and 1894, mainly\r\nto England. The deposits then remained idle until 1914, when 870 tons\r\nof ore was exported; in 1915 the exports amounted to about 360 tons.\r\nIt is probable that no important output at peace-time prices is to\r\nbe expected, although the country is largely unexplored. The Borneo\r\ncompany (British) seems to have been the principal if not the only\r\nproducer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_China._--With all her vast mineral resources China has been able to\r\nobtain an important position in the world’s markets with regard to but\r\nfew metals. Of these antimony is the most striking example, for since\r\n1908 over 50 per cent. of the world’s total antimony production has\r\ncome from China. In 1913 the output was estimated to be the equivalent\r\nof 10,800 tons of metallic antimony, that of the whole world being\r\nabout 20,000 tons. The Chinese industry being well-established, it\r\nwas able to respond rapidly to the great demand of the war. Exports\r\nincreased from 14,361 short tons of regulus and crude antimony,\r\nand 4,795 tons of ore, in 1913, to 38,142 tons and 8,667 tons,\r\nrespectively, in 1917.\r\n\r\nAntimony is found over widely scattered areas in the central and\r\nsouthern provinces, but chiefly in the provinces of Hunan, Yunnan,\r\nKweichow and Kwangsi. In Hunan the deposits have been most extensively\r\nexploited, probably 90 per cent. of the total production of China\r\ncoming from the region about Changsha, the center of the smelting\r\nindustry. Here, in the Hai-Keng-Shan district, in 1915 about 70\r\ncompanies mined antimony along the outcrop of the deposits. The ore,\r\nremarkable for its purity, occurs as pockets and bunches, mainly of\r\nstibnite, in a flat bed of dolomitic limestone. Several local smelters\r\nproduce liquated sulphide, and the output of the district is about\r\n1,000 tons monthly of crude antimony averaging about 70 per cent.\r\nmetallic antimony. All regulus manufacture is controlled by the Wah\r\nChang Co. In the Panshi district the ore occurs as fissure veins in\r\nslates, shales, and quartzites. The output consists of about 400 tons\r\nmonthly of 30 per cent. ore, all of which is shipped to Wah Chang Co.\r\nat Changsha for treatment.\r\n\r\nThe only district in Yunnan where antimony is dealt with commercially\r\nis near Chihtsun on the Tongking-Yunnan Railroad. The Pao Hua Co.,\r\nconnected with the Wah Chang Co., owns a French-constructed plant and\r\nproduces high-grade regulus.\r\n\r\nThe Wah Chang Mining & Smelting Co. virtually controls the production\r\nof antimony ore, regulus, and crude in the Province of Hunan. This\r\ncompany operates smelters in Changsha and owns low-grade mines. It\r\npossesses a complete monopoly, granted by the Peking government, for\r\nthe manufacture of regulus in Hunan and owns the patent rights in China\r\nfor the Herrenschmidt furnace, the most successful means of reducing\r\nlow-grade antimony ores. The mines themselves are mostly native-owned,\r\nand worked in a small way.\r\n\r\nPrior to the war, exports of Chinese antimony were chiefly in the hands\r\nof English, French, and a few German firms. The New Chinese Antimony\r\nCo. (also known as the Chinese Eastern Antimony Co.) a subsidiary of\r\nCookson & Co., of England, held a contract for the entire output of the\r\nWah Chang Co. This contract was broken shortly after the war began,\r\nalthough the Wah Chang Co. paid a percentage on all sales to the New\r\nChinese Antimony Co. for a year thereafter. The Wah Chang Trading\r\nCo. was organized as a direct selling agency in New York, and has\r\nestablished a large business in this country.\r\n\r\nWith present high scale of wages for labor, and prices for material,\r\nit is difficult to see how this country can compete with China in the\r\nproduction of antimony. Adverse exchange conditions due to the high\r\nprice of silver have probably nearly doubled the cost of production\r\nin China and wages in that country have advanced. In spite of this,\r\nhowever, China can manufacture antimony far more cheaply than is\r\npossible in Europe or America; and probably, also, more cheaply than in\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nChinese antimony suffered from lack of advertising before the war,\r\nbeing largely excluded from this country by the British metal, but\r\nhas now become firmly established in our markets, and its quality has\r\nproved equal to the best English grades.\r\n\r\n\r\n_India._--Since the war, small amounts of antimony have been produced\r\nin Burma and Mysore. The total Indian ore production was 1,040 tons in\r\n1916 and 130 tons in 1917. The most productive region was the Amherst\r\ndistrict of Burma. Here the ore reserves are said to be considerable,\r\nbut the inaccessibility of the district has made production impossible\r\nexcept at high prices. The production from Mysore was only 26 tons in\r\n1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Indo-China._--There are productive deposits of possible future\r\nimportance in French Indo-China. In 1916 these produced 1,437 tons\r\nof antimony ore with a metal content of 642 tons. Smelters were\r\noperated by the firm of Schön & Rhay, and both native and Chinese ore\r\nwas treated. In 1914 and 1915, 883 and 630 tons of antimony ore were\r\nexported to France.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Japan._--Very little antimony ore has been produced in Japan since\r\nthe development of the Chinese deposits, although, as in most other\r\ncountries, there was a renewed development during the war. The smelting\r\nof Chinese ores in Japan has become extremely important; and the\r\nsmelter production, which was only 32 tons in 1914, rose to 8,189 tons\r\nin 1915, and to 10,633 tons in 1916. It was 6,562 tons in 1917. The\r\nproduction of metal and crude from domestic ores was only 186 tons in\r\n1915 and 286 tons in 1916. It is probable that as long as cheap ore is\r\navailable in China little production from Japanese deposits is to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nJapanese ownership in Chinese mines is probably small, as practically\r\nall Chinese antimony bought by Japan has been purchased in the open\r\nmarket in the form of crude and ore. Since 1914 Japan has played an\r\nimportant part in the smelting of Chinese ore and matte, and in this\r\nregard has ranked second only to China. Prior to that time, however,\r\nproduction was insignificant. China is now in a position to supply\r\ndirect the major part of the world’s requirement of metal, having\r\nlargely extended her facilities for treating antimony ores, and it\r\nis doubtful whether Japanese smelters will long be able to compete\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Turkey._--The antimony production of the Turkish Empire comes from\r\nEastern Asia Minor in the vilayets of Brussa and Smyrna. The productive\r\ndistrict of Allchar, formerly in European Turkey, passed to Serbia\r\nafter the last Balkan War. The deposits seem to be rich and capable\r\nof greater development. Bad government, lack of transportation\r\nfacilities, and excessive export duties seem to have retarded\r\nproduction. Some mines were the property of the Sultan, and development\r\nwas hindered by excessive royalties. Most of the mines seem to be\r\nowned or leased by Greeks. Deposits of antimony ores associated with\r\nargentiferous lead ores are reported in the vicinity of Karahissar, in\r\nArmenia. In 1914 the concession for these was held by the Asia Minor\r\nMining Co., presumably a British corporation. Undeveloped deposits of\r\npossible importance occur in the islands of Mytelene and Chios, now in\r\nGreek ownership.\r\n\r\nLittle information is available as regards production. In 1911 the\r\nDjinli Kaya mine produced 1,500 tons of 50 per cent. ore. The 1912\r\nproduction of Asia Minor is reported as 677 tons of ore. Exports of\r\nantimony ore from Turkey to Great Britain were as follows: 1910, 303\r\n(metric) tons; 1911, 773 tons; 1912, 1,108 tons; and in 1913, 408 tons.\r\nSome ore was also shipped to Austria, and, in 1913, 205 tons went to\r\nFrance. It seems probable that, given good government and improved\r\ntransportation facilities, an increased production could be obtained\r\nfrom the region even at peace-time prices, for according to the best\r\navailable information the deposits are large and much of the ore is\r\nhigh grade.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Algiers._--The Algerian deposits are probably capable of considerable\r\ndevelopment, as is shown by the response to the increased demand in\r\n1915 and 1916. The ores are nearly all oxidized and contain various\r\nrare antimony minerals. Prior to the war the chief production consisted\r\nof antimonate of iron, mined together with lead and zinc ores at Hamman\r\nN’ Bails. During the war large deposits of oxides were developed and\r\nwere supplying antimony at the rate of 300 tons per month during the\r\nearly part of 1918. In 1912, there was produced 4,661 tons of ore; in\r\n1913, 582 tons; in 1914, 1,100 tons; in 1915, 9,022 tons, and in 1916,\r\n28,473 tons. Apparently the ore produced carries around 40 per cent.\r\nantimony (metallic content).\r\n\r\nThe mine of Hamman N’ Bails is owned by the great Belgian smelting\r\ncompany, the Société de la Vieille Montagne; and the La Lucette company\r\n(French) owns the productive Ain Kerma oxide deposits. Prior to the\r\nwar, the German firm of Beer, Sondheimer & Co. was listed as the owner\r\nof one of the less important mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_British South Africa._--Several antimony deposits are known in British\r\nSouth Africa, seemingly the most promising being those of the Murchison\r\nRange in the northern Transvaal. Here auriferous stibnite occurs as\r\nveins and replacements in limestone over a considerable area. The ore\r\nas mined carries 3 to 6 dwt. gold and 7 to 10 per cent. antimony. Sales\r\nand shipments of concentrated and crude antimony were as follows: 1913,\r\n48 tons; 1914, nothing; 1915, 91 tons; 1916, 722 tons; and 1917, 617\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nThe principal mine of the range, the United Jack, was purchased\r\nin 1917 by the La Lucette company (French). In 1916 there were\r\nfour producing mines in the district. The antimony deposits of the\r\nSteynsdorp district, near the Swaziland border, were under development\r\nin 1916, and antimony deposits are known in the Forbes Reef district in\r\nSwaziland. Antimony ores are found over a considerable part of southern\r\nRhodesia, and this district would probably be capable of a considerable\r\noutput with better transportation facilities and continued high prices.\r\nOre production in 1916 and 1917 was 38 and 15 tons. Some of the mines,\r\nsuch as the Hope Fountain, near Bulawayo, are chiefly gold producers,\r\nantimony being a by-product.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australia.=--The only antimony-producing district of any importance\r\nin Australia is the Costerfield district of Victoria. Here stibnite\r\nand antimony oxides occur in quartz veins cutting Ordovician slates.\r\nThe antimony concentrates, which average about 48 per cent. antimony,\r\nand also contain about 2¹⁄₂ ounces of gold per ton, are shipped to\r\nEngland. The annual production is rather regularly 2,500 to 3,000 tons\r\nof concentrates.\r\n\r\nTABLE 32.--WORLD’S PRODUCTION OF ANTIMONY (1912-1917)\r\n\r\nApproximate recoverable metal content of ore produced, metric tons;\r\nantimonial lead ores not included\r\n\r\n  -----------------+------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n                   |      |          |          |          |\r\n                   |      |          |          |          |\r\n                   | 1912 |   1913   |   1914   |   1915   |\r\n  -----------------+------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  United States    |     0|     0    |     0    | 1,760    |\r\n  Canada           |     0|     0    |     0    |   420    |\r\n  Mexico           | 3,500| 2,340    | 1,570    |   200[91]|\r\n                   |      |          |          |          |\r\n  Bolivia          |    40|    30    |    70    | 7,170    |\r\n  Peru             |     0|     0    |     0    |   260    |\r\n                   |      |          |          |          |\r\n  Austria-Hungary  | 1,350|   840    |      [92]|      [92]|\r\n  Germany          |     0|     0    |      [92]|   700    |\r\n                   |      |          |          |      [91]|\r\n  France           | 2,290| 5,170    |      [92]|      [92]|\r\n  Italy            |   310|   360    |   110    |   720    |\r\n  Spain            |   170|     0    |     0    |   100    |\r\n  Portugal         |    40|    10    |      [92]|      [92]|\r\n                   |      |          |          |          |\r\n  Serbia           |   300|   250[91]|      [92]|      [92]|\r\n                   |      |          |          |          |\r\n  Algiers          |   940|   180    |   320    | 2,740    |\r\n  British S.

Recent production has been slight, and although a very\r\nlarge increase took place with the stimulus of war prices, the 1917\r\nproduction was valued at only about 5 per cent. of that of Victoria.\r\nInsignificant amounts of antimony ore have recently been produced in\r\nQueensland and Western Australia. New Zealand yielded a small amount\r\nduring the boom of 1906 and 1907, but no production is recorded since\r\n1910.\r\n\r\nImports of antimony ore into Great Britain from Australia in 1915\r\namounted to 3,854 tons.\r\n\r\nStatistics of production (1912-1917) are given in the table preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE LEADING COMMERCIAL NATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n=The United States.=--The United States is the largest consumer of\r\nantimony in the world, requiring under normal conditions between 7,000\r\nand 8,000 tons of new metal, most of which, before the war, came from\r\nEngland. The consumption during the war was about double this amount,\r\nand was derived chiefly from the Orient, South America, and Mexico.\r\nThe United States must remain dependent upon foreign sources for its\r\nsupply, unless a much higher tariff is placed upon imports. Even under\r\nsuch conditions it is doubtful whether domestic mines would prove\r\nadequate to supply more than a small part of the country’s needs.\r\n\r\nChinese and Japanese antimony has largely replaced the British product\r\nsince 1914 and has become so well established that it will probably\r\ncontinue to hold American markets. Chinese antimony in particular has\r\nshown itself equal in every way to the best British grades. With a\r\nsomewhat higher level of prices the importation of ore from Mexico and\r\nSouth America may be undertaken by reducing plants in this country,\r\nas the experience gained by several companies during the war has made\r\npossible the production of high-grade metal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=England.=--No figures as to the actual consumption of antimony in\r\nEngland are available. Judged from a balance of imports and exports,\r\nthe normal consumption is about 4,500 tons annually. During the war\r\nconsumption was enormously increased for the manufacture of munitions.\r\nEnglish smelters are entirely dependent on foreign ores, most of which\r\nin the past have come from China, with smaller amounts from Mexico and\r\nAustralia. The position of the industry, at least in so far as export\r\ntrade is concerned, is threatened by the strong position of the Chinese\r\nindustry acquired during the war, as represented particularly by the\r\nactivities of the Wah Chang Mining & Smelting Co. Two-thirds of the\r\nEnglish antimony exports went to the United States before 1914. It\r\ndoes not seem probable that England will be able to fully recover this\r\nmarket, now dominated completely by Chinese and Japanese antimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n=France.=--France is the only world power that possesses important\r\nresources of antimony within her boundaries. Including her Algerian\r\nmines, she is entirely independent of outside supply. Inasmuch as\r\ncertain of the French deposits contain important amounts of gold, and\r\nthe principal Algerian mine contains lead and zinc, the production of\r\nantimony in France will probably continue to be of some importance, and\r\nit is probable that she will continue to export antimony as before the\r\nwar, though probably to a less extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany.=--Germany, prior to 1914, consumed about 20 per cent. of\r\nthe world’s annual output of antimony. Her own resources of antimony\r\nare insignificant, and German interests in foreign deposits have not\r\nbeen widely extended but were rather those of smelter and middleman,\r\nraw material being drawn chiefly from China, and metal and salts being\r\nexported to the United States, Russia and Great Britain. During the war\r\nGermany drew largely upon Hungary for antimony supply, but it is known\r\nthat this source could not adequately meet the demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Japan.=--Japan’s actual consumption of antimony has never been large\r\nand before the war was confined largely to the production of “white\r\nmetal” boxes, trays, and other articles. During the war her importance\r\nin the antimony trade rested upon her ability to supply a large\r\npart of the needs of the Allies, principally Russia, and later the\r\nUnited States and Canada. How long after the war she will be able to\r\nretain her position is uncertain. Favorable freight rates to Japanese\r\nshippers, and the fact that the present high price of silver and the\r\nconsequent exchange conditions affect adversely Chinese production may\r\nenable Japan to continue a factor in the antimony trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT CONDITIONS IN THE INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nOwing to the very high prices prevailing for antimony during 1915\r\nand 1916, caused by a greatly increased demand for antimony for the\r\nmanufacture of munitions, several countries became large producers.\r\nThe most important among these were Bolivia, Mexico, and Algeria, but\r\nVictoria and the United States, Peru, Burma, and Spain all contributed\r\nsubstantial amounts. With the possible exception of Algeria--whose\r\nprincipal mines yield considerable lead and zinc and are situated near\r\nto French reduction plants--and of Mexico, none of these countries will\r\nbe important factors in the production of antimony at the usual low\r\nprices prevailing for that metal.\r\n\r\nThe sudden ending of the war found the belligerents with large stocks\r\nof antimony on hand, the English holding, according to figures\r\npublished by the British Ministry of Munitions on March 1, 1919,\r\n4,325 long tons of regulus. There is reason to believe that the other\r\nAllies had stocks of the same order of magnitude, and if so there\r\nmust have been about a year’s supply available on April 1, 1919, as\r\nthe 1913 consumption of antimony amounted to only about 20,000 tons.\r\nIn addition there were large supplies of alloys and antimonial lead\r\navailable and more will undoubtedly be obtained by salvage operations.\r\nIt may be expected, therefore, that until these are absorbed the\r\nproduction of antimony will be even less than that of pre-war years.\r\nAt present there is little inducement for mining. Costs of mining have\r\nincreased everywhere. China, the largest producer, faces a particularly\r\ndifficult situation, for the higher price of silver has resulted in\r\ndoubling costs of labor and local supplies. If silver prices remain\r\nhigh after the demand for primary antimony has recovered, the other\r\nantimony-producing countries, not on a silver basis, will have a\r\ncorresponding advantage over China in the matter of production.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe peace-time consumption of antimony is limited rather by the\r\nrelatively restricted uses to which antimony is put than by any lack\r\nof potential supply. As a consequence, steady production has been\r\nmaintained only from those districts in which working expenses are low\r\nand markets readily available, or in which the deposits contain other\r\nmetals of value. Modern warfare, however, creates a special use for\r\nantimony--in the manufacture of shrapnel--which requires many times\r\nthe amount of antimony necessary for ordinary peace uses. In the case\r\nof each of the three important wars of the last twenty years, the Boer\r\nWar, the Russo-Japanese War and the Great War, the curves of antimony\r\nprices and production have risen sharply in accordance with the demand,\r\nand have fallen as rapidly after the need for munitions was past.\r\n\r\nChina has for long been the most important source of antimony and will\r\ndoubtless retain that position for many years. Steady though less\r\nimportant production has been maintained in France, Austria-Hungary and\r\nMexico, while several other countries produced important amounts as a\r\nresult of the largely increased demands of the war. Chief among these\r\nwere Bolivia, Algeria, and Australia.\r\n\r\nEngland dominated the antimony market prior to 1914 through her large\r\nsmelting interest, trade agreements in the Orient, and selling agencies\r\nin America--the principal consuming country. Since that time, however,\r\nChinese interests have become independent, and Japan has become of\r\nimportance in the antimony smelting and trading field.\r\n\r\nThe United States possesses limited antimony resources which can be\r\nexploited only at very high prices, and is dependent almost entirely\r\nupon outside sources of supply. In the past this supply has been drawn\r\nlargely from England, but more recently from the Orient and Mexico.\r\n\r\nGermany has insignificant antimony resources of her own, and depended\r\nfor her supply during the war upon the Hungarian deposits, which were\r\napparently inadequate to meet the demands. Her interests prior to the\r\nwar were chiefly those of the smelter and middleman, and did not extend\r\nvery largely to foreign deposits.\r\n\r\nThe United States, France, Germany and Great Britain normally consume\r\n85 per cent. of the antimony of the world, and of these France alone is\r\nindependent of foreign sources of supply.\r\n\r\nThe antimony trade of the world is largely controlled by a few\r\ncompanies, of which the most important are: Cookson’s (British), Wah\r\nChang Co. (Chinese), and Société de La Lucette (French). The Mitsui\r\nCo. (Japanese), largely through shipping interests, has a considerable\r\nshare in the Chinese and Japanese antimony trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMOLYBDENUM\r\n\r\nBY R. B. MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF MOLYBDENUM\r\n\r\nMolybdenum is used in the manufacture of ferro-alloys for making\r\nsteel. As wire, it is used for supporting the filament in incandescent\r\nelectric lamps. The wire is also employed for winding electric\r\nresistance furnaces and for this use has proved cheaper and better\r\nthan platinum because of the quicker heating and higher temperatures\r\nattainable. The metal has been successfully substituted for platinum\r\nand for platinum-iridium in electric contact-making devices. Molybdenum\r\ncompounds are used in chemistry, particularly ammonium molybdate for\r\nthe determination of phosphorus. Fast colors in a variety of shades may\r\nbe produced on leather by employing molybdenum tannate in conjunction\r\nwith logwood extracts. It has been employed for color glazes in\r\nporcelain and in coloring silks and rubber.\r\n\r\nThe addition of molybdenum to steel increases the elastic limit without\r\ndiminishing the ductility. Molybdenum can be substituted for a certain\r\npercentage of tungsten in high-speed steel, as a rule one part of\r\nmolybdenum taking the place of two to three parts of tungsten.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nUp to about 1916, practically all of the molybdenite concentrates\r\nproduced came from Queensland, New South Wales, and Norway. Shortly\r\nafter the opening of the war, interest was shown in the production\r\nof molybdenite in Canada, principally in the provinces of Ontario\r\nand British Columbia. During 1917 and 1918 there was a great deal of\r\ninterest in the United States in molybdenum ores, and at the present\r\ntime this country can probably produce molybdenite concentrates in\r\nquantity equaling if not exceeding the rest of the world put together.\r\nSome molybdenum is produced by Spain and Peru.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australia and Norway.=--The first official record of a production of\r\nmolybdenite in _Queensland_ was in 1900, when the output amounted to\r\n12.3 short tons of high-grade material. The production gradually rose\r\nto 119 tons in 1906, and has not varied materially since that date,\r\nalthough the selling prices for concentrates increased considerably.\r\nThe bulk of the material was mined at Wolfram Camp, in the Chillagoe\r\nfield, 120 miles southwest of Cairns, in Northern Queensland. The mines\r\nat Bamford, in the same field, are credited with a small output. With\r\nthe molybdenite ores are bismuth-tungsten ores, so that all three\r\nmetals are produced.\r\n\r\nThe production of molybdenite was first reported in _New South Wales_\r\nin 1902; in that year the output was 17 short tons. The total output\r\nto the end of 1914 was 498 short tons, valued at $264,000. The chief\r\nproducing molybdenite mines are at Whipstick, in the Pambula division,\r\nat Kingsgate, in the Glenn Innes division, and near Deepwater, in\r\nthe Deepwater division. Molybdenite is also being produced at Rocky\r\nRiver, in the Tantafield division, and in the Bathhurst division. The\r\nproduction at all of these localities has not been large--in no one\r\nyear exceeding 100 tons of concentrates.\r\n\r\nIn _Norway_, the production of high-grade molybdenite concentrates has\r\naveraged about 30 tons per annum since 1902. In 1906, an output of\r\n1,129 short tons was reported. This probably refers to ore mined and\r\nnot to concentrates produced.\r\n\r\nThe chief molybdenite districts in Norway are the provinces of Lister,\r\nMandal, and Nedenes, on the extreme southern end of the peninsula. The\r\ndistrict of Fjotland, in the former province, is probably richer in\r\nmolybdenite than any yet discovered in Norway. A mine at Knaben, in\r\nthis district, has been the largest and probably the only successful\r\nproducer in Norway. This mine, owned by George G. Blackwell & Sons, of\r\nLiverpool, England,[94] has made an average output of about 25 short\r\ntons per annum.\r\n\r\n  [94] Reported taken over by a Norwegian company. U. S.

In 1917 the output in Norway was three times the 1916\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\n\r\n=North America.=--As already stated, the chief molybdenite deposits in\r\n_Canada_ are in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia. They are\r\nlow grade and of course need concentration. The Canadian and British\r\ngovernments have been much interested in the concentration of these\r\nores and the Canadian government has a mill engaged in experimental\r\nwork and in commercial concentration. The Department of Mines has spent\r\na good deal of time in experimentation, believing that molybdenite has\r\nan important future in metallurgy.\r\n\r\nThe production in 1917 was about 80 short tons of high-grade\r\nconcentrates and was undoubtedly larger in 1918.\r\n\r\nCanada when properly prospected may produce a good deal more\r\nmolybdenite than now.\r\n\r\nIn the _United States_ are a very large number of small molybdenum\r\ndeposits, scattered over the western states from Washington to\r\nArizona and from Colorado to California. There are two common\r\nminerals--molybdenite, or molybdenum sulphide, and wulfenite, or lead\r\nmolybdate. Generally speaking, molybdenite is found in the northern\r\nstates, and wulfenite in the southern states, but this rule is not\r\nwithout exception. In Arizona and New Mexico, the principal mineral is\r\nwulfenite, but there are some fairly large deposits of molybdenite,\r\nprobably the best being at the Leviathan mines, in Copper Canyon,\r\nMohave County, Arizona. This is the only molybdenite deposit that is\r\nbeing worked in New Mexico or Arizona. It is in the Cedar Valley mining\r\ndistrict about three miles southeast of Copperville and about 25 miles\r\neast of Yucca. This ore carries a good deal of copper, as well as small\r\ntraces of gold and silver. Some analyses have shown 2 or 3 per cent.\r\nMoS₂ and 1¹⁄₂ to 2 per cent. copper with 0.02 ounce of gold and 1 to 4\r\nounces of silver per ton. The percentage of molybdenite is undoubtedly\r\nabove the average, which does not exceed 1 per cent. The country\r\nrock is medium-grained gray granite, consisting of quartz, feldspar,\r\nbiotite, muscovite and small amounts of other accessory minerals, such\r\nas zircon and apatite. The company has erected a mill and has succeeded\r\nin making a satisfactory separation of the copper from the molybdenite.\r\n\r\nThe largest possibilities in Arizona and New Mexico are in mining\r\nwulfenite. This mineral is widely scattered over these two states,\r\nespecially Arizona, and is, to a great extent, associated with\r\nvanadinite. One of the greatest difficulties in concentrating wulfenite\r\nhas been the separation from vanadinite. The Bureau of Mines has\r\nworked on this problem for some time with partial success.\r\n\r\nThe most important deposit of wulfenite is at the Mammoth and Collins\r\nmines, in Pinal County. They were originally gold mines, and when the\r\nvalue of molybdenum became evident, Colonel Randolph, owner of the\r\nMammoth mine, decided that it would be worth while to run the tailings\r\ndump for wulfenite. He converted his mill to this purpose, and not only\r\nran the Mammoth dump but also the dump at the old Yuma mine, in Pima\r\ncounty. The total amount of concentrates produced by Colonel Randolph\r\nand others in the vicinity during the three years 1916 to 1918 are\r\nprobably represented by 1,000 to 1,200 tons of wulfenite concentrates.\r\nWhile these operations were going on, they represented practically\r\nthe only production of molybdenum concentrates in this country except\r\non a very small scale. One other operating company is the Rowley\r\nCopper Mines Co., Gila Bend, Arizona, the ore being wulfenite and\r\nthe principal impurity barite. The company has succeeded in making\r\nsatisfactory concentrates, which carry, however, a considerable amount\r\nof barite. The Golden, Colo., station of the Bureau of Mines has run\r\nsome tests on this concentrate and has made a partial separation of the\r\nbarite and wulfenite.\r\n\r\nMolybdenite is found in a considerable number of places in Colorado,\r\nMontana, Washington, Nevada, Utah, Texas and other western and\r\nnorthwestern states, but the largest occurrence is in Colorado.\r\nGenerally speaking, the individual deposits in the West are not large\r\nenough to warrant the building of a mill for any one of them, and as\r\nthe deposits are widely scattered, it is difficult to find a place\r\nwhere a custom mill could obtain a sufficient amount of ore. This\r\nis one of the chief difficulties in producing a large tonnage of\r\nmolybdenite concentrates, outside of Colorado.\r\n\r\nProbably the largest deposits of molybdenite in the world are at\r\nClimax, Colorado. These deposits are on the southwestern slope of\r\nBartlett Mountain, Summit County, about 15 miles from Leadville.\r\nOutcrops are practically continuous across the whole length of the\r\nmountain and at places are one hundred to two hundred feet thick. The\r\nore is rather granular and not flaky molybdenite, the average grade\r\nrunning about 8 per cent. MoS₂.\r\n\r\nThere are two operating companies, the Climax Molybdenum Co., a\r\nsubsidiary of the American Metal Co., of New York and Denver, and\r\nthe Molybdenum Products Co., of Denver. Both of these companies have\r\nerected mills having daily capacities of 200 tons. The mill of the\r\nAmerican Metal Co. started continuous operation about March, 1918,\r\nand that of the other company was completed shortly afterwards. Both\r\ncompanies claim that they can enlarge the capacity at short notice.\r\nThe writer was in the mine of the American Metal Co. Evidently a\r\nconsiderable part of the mountain is molybdenite, and without doubt,\r\na very large tonnage can be produced. The Jackling interests recently\r\nacquired the adjoining properties owned by the Pingree Mines Co., but\r\nin 1918 had not built a mill or carried out any serious development\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAnother very large group of deposits of molybdenite lies near Empire,\r\nClear Creek County, Colorado, on the eastern slope of Red Mountain,\r\nat an altitude of about 11,000 to 12,000 feet. The deposits are 14\r\nmiles from the Empire station of the Colorado & Southern Railroad and\r\nare owned by the Primos Chemical Co., of Primos, Pennsylvania. The\r\nore-bearing bodies consist of three veins of low-grade ore. The ore\r\nzone, that is, the ground included between the footwall of Vein No. 1\r\nand the hanging wall of Vein No. 3 where cut by the tunnel, is about\r\n200 feet wide. The veins vary greatly in width and are not particularly\r\nwell defined, thin veinlets and stringers of ore running into the\r\nwalls. The Primos Chemical Co. has worked these mines off and on for\r\nseveral years. About three years ago it built a mill near the mine, but\r\nproduction has been rather intermittent. This company has probably used\r\nall of its concentrates for making ferromolybdenum at its own works in\r\nPrimos, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nA small mill has been erected at Pitkin, Colorado, in connection with\r\nthe mine at that place owned by the Pennsylvania Molybdenum Mines Co.,\r\nof Johnstown, Pennsylvania. A number of other deposits of considerable\r\ninterest are found in Colorado, especially around Breckenridge,\r\nSummit County. Here the pegmatite veins consist largely of muscovite\r\nand quartz, with some feldspar, and carry biotite, chalcopyrite and\r\naccessory minerals. The difficulty here is to separate the molybdenum\r\nfrom the copper minerals and also from the mica, most of which floats\r\nwith the molybdenite.\r\n\r\nMost of the developed molybdenum deposits of _Mexico_ are in the State\r\nof Sonora. In the Sahuaripa district of eastern Sonora, the mineral\r\noccurs with scheelite in rich pockets containing very large pieces of\r\npure mineral. Some molybdenum ore has been shipped from the Montezuma\r\ncopper district to the Empire Smelting & Refining Co., of Deming, New\r\nMexico. Molybdenum is reported in several other Sonora localities. Near\r\nCoyame and Marquez, northeastern Chihuahua, the mines of the Compañia\r\nMinera Aurora y Anexas produce molybdenum ore. Wulfenite is found\r\nabundantly with the lead ore of the Cuchillo Parado mine in the same\r\ndistrict. The Jibosa copper mine of the American Smelters Securities\r\nCo., near Jimenez, Chihuahua, seems to carry considerable oxide of\r\nmolybdenum, molybdite. It is not commercial at present.\r\n\r\nMolybdenite deposits are also reported in the states of Sinaloa,\r\nOaxaca, Hidalgo, and Jalisco.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESERVES\r\n\r\nAs the production of molybdenum ores in the past in all countries has\r\nbeen relatively small, probably none of the deposits have been worked\r\nout and an increased output can be obtained. This applies particularly\r\nto the United States. All of the work that has been done so far has\r\nbeen on an experimental basis, and possibly the only mine whose tonnage\r\nwill be decreased by past production is the Mammoth mine, near Mammoth,\r\nArizona, and there is no certainty that this mine can not continue\r\nto produce as much for some time in the future as it did during its\r\nperiod of operation. Just what production can be obtained in the United\r\nStates is somewhat uncertain, but it is probable that the deposits at\r\nClimax, Colorado, will yield at least one thousand tons of ore a day\r\nfor several years and possibly for a good many years. The deposits\r\nof the Primos Chemical Co. near Empire, Colorado, are also extensive\r\nand should give a large output for some time to come. The rest of the\r\ndeposits mentioned are small compared with these two, but the total\r\nproduction of all of them might be large, were a steady market assured\r\nand custom mills erected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF ORES\r\n\r\nIn concentrating wulfenite ores some form of table concentration, with\r\nthe addition of slimers, is generally used. The metallurgical treatment\r\nof the concentrates varies and is still very much in the experimental\r\nstage. There is opportunity for the development of a process that will\r\ngive the patentee a considerable advantage over competitors. The Bureau\r\nof Mines has been working on this problem and has recently devised a\r\nmethod that seems to be as efficient as any other and possibly has some\r\nadditional advantages.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of molybdenite the same methods are almost universally\r\nused. First the ore is crushed to the required fineness and the\r\nmolybdenite is separated by flotation, largely oil flotation. The\r\nmetallurgy of the concentrate, now more or less standardized, involves\r\nroasting the concentrate to the oxide and treating this oxide in an\r\nelectric furnace for the production of ferromolybdenum. With small\r\nimprovements, this practice is likely to be maintained for some time to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe political control of the molybdenum deposits of the world is\r\ndetermined by the geographical location. At present most of the known\r\ndeposits are controlled by the United States and Great Britain, the\r\nlatter controlling those in Canada and Australia. The British and\r\nCanadian governments actually have a government mill in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe Knaben mines, in Fjotland, the most famous and probably the only\r\nsuccessful molybdenum mines in Norway, were acquired in 1905 by an\r\nEnglish company, the Blackwell Developing Corporation. Later a newly\r\norganized Norwegian company, with head office in Christiania, took over\r\nthe mines at a price of 2,500,000 crowns.\r\n\r\nIn _Mexico_ the large molybdenum deposit in the Sahuaripa district of\r\neastern Sonora is owned by George Fast, of Douglas, Arizona. The Lucky\r\nTiger-Combination Gold Mining Co., of Kansas City, Mo., (American)\r\nowns the deposits in the Montezuma district. Another American company\r\nhas acquired deposits near Poza, Sonora, about 20 miles north of\r\nHermosillo. A deposit located 35 miles from the port of Topolabampo,\r\nnorthwestern Sinaloa, is owned by an American. The Compañia Minera\r\nAurora y Anexas, operating molybdenum mines near Coyame and Marquez,\r\nnortheastern Chihuahua, is owned by the Madero estate. The ore has been\r\nshipped to Leonard Worcester, El Paso, Texas, agent for the estate and\r\nalso purchaser for L. Vogelstein & Co., New York, formerly a branch of\r\nthe German metals combine.\r\n\r\nIn the _United States_, during the war the claim was made a number of\r\ntimes, both privately and in the press, that German interests were\r\ntrying to obtain control of the molybdenum deposits of the country.\r\nThis was due to the fact that the American Metal Co., which operates\r\nat Climax, Colorado, as the Climax Molybdenum Co., and which has some\r\nother molybdenum deposits, was formerly controlled by German interests.\r\nIt is true that the majority of the stock of the American Metal Co.\r\nwas owned in Germany, but Mr. Palmer, the Alien Property Custodian,\r\ntook charge of this stock, and the affairs of the American Metal Co.\r\nwere readjusted to changed conditions. The principal stockholders of\r\nthe Primos Chemical Co. were four brothers by the name of Boericke.\r\nBefore the war they had strong German connections, but outside of their\r\ndeposits at Empire they made no special effort to get large molybdenum\r\nholdings in this country and did not seek to get a combination of any\r\nof the operating companies. The Primos Chemical Co. has since 1919\r\nbeen taken over by the Vanadium Products Corporation, affiliated with\r\nthe Bethlehem Steel Corporation. The Molybdenum Products Co., Denver,\r\nColorado, which owns a part of the molybdenum deposit on the slope\r\nof Bartlett Mountain, near Climax, and operates a 200-ton mill, is a\r\nsubsidiary of E. J. Longyear Co., exploring engineers, of Minneapolis,\r\nMinnesota. Both companies are owned by American stockholders.\r\n\r\nIn _Canada_ and _Australia_ it is certain that no one large interest\r\nhas control, as the ore comes from a number of more or less independent\r\nsmall mines.\r\n\r\nA large number of patents have been issued in connection with the\r\nconcentration and metallurgy of molybdenum. None of these is vital to\r\nproduction; most are valueless, and even those that have a distinct\r\nvalue do not necessarily give control to the owner of the patents or\r\nsecret processes.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure a steady demand for molybdenum, the prime requisite\r\nis a definite knowledge of the properties and uses of molybdenum steel.\r\nIn the past this has been lacking, and at present it is not possessed\r\nby the majority of operators and steel makers. Europe should assist\r\nmaterially in supplying this deficiency. Molybdenum steel at the\r\npresent time is in the same position as vanadium steel was a number of\r\nyears ago--it is on trial. This uncertainty caused a very decided slump\r\nin the demand for molybdenum concentrates in the spring of 1918. A\r\ncontrol of molybdenum is more likely to come through the manufacture of\r\nmolybdenum steel than through processes connected with the production\r\nof concentrates or ferromolybdenum.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF LEADING COMMERCIAL NATIONS\r\n\r\nAt present the _United States_ has the largest potential supply of\r\nmolybdenum ores of any country in the world. In addition it has three\r\nof the largest and most modern mills that are handling ore from any\r\nmolybdenum deposit. It is in a favorable position to equal or surpass,\r\nfor some time, any other country, in output of molybdenum concentrates.\r\n\r\nBefore the war _Great Britain_, through political control of the\r\nAustralian and Canadian deposits, was the world’s leading producer.\r\nSome molybdenum came from _Norway_, but the amount was small as\r\ncompared to the output of Australia, Norway producing in 1913 only\r\n13 short tons and Australia 162.6. In both Canada and Australia the\r\nknown deposits have not been worked to capacity and new deposits will\r\nprobably be discovered with proper prospecting, so that the future\r\nmolybdenum production under British control promises to increase. The\r\nCanadian and British governments are much interested in the development\r\nof the molybdenum resources of the dominion.\r\n\r\n_France_ is entirely dependent upon England and the United States,\r\nalthough it might be able to get a small amount of concentrates direct\r\nfrom Norway.\r\n\r\n_Germany_ was much interested in molybdenum before the war. During the\r\nwar it probably did not import any molybdenum concentrates at all, and\r\nas the world production before that time was small it is not likely\r\nthat there was any reserve on hand in the empire in 1919.\r\n\r\n_Japan_ has no molybdenum deposits as far as is known, and probably is\r\nnot specially interested at present in the use of this metal.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the chief molybdenum deposits of the world is shown\r\nin Plate VII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.--Geographical distribution of the molybdenum\r\ndeposits of the world. By R. B. Moore.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nMolybdenum commands attention because of its growing importance as a\r\nsteel alloy metal. Although the metallurgy and properties of molybdenum\r\nsteels are not thoroughly understood and their use is not widespread,\r\nespecially in this country, accumulating evidence indicates that\r\nmolybdenum will eventually become one of the common alloy metals.\r\nIt is used in the form of wire as supports for incandescent light\r\nfilaments and in electrical apparatus, and may become essential in\r\nthe manufacture of special steels. It cannot be easily replaced in\r\nchemistry, and for its other applications it is better and cheaper than\r\nother materials.\r\n\r\nUp to 1915 practically all of the molybdenum produced came from\r\nQueensland, New South Wales, and Norway. At present more important\r\ndeposits are being developed in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia,\r\nCanada, and in Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and other western\r\nstates. The mineral is widely distributed and the discovery of\r\nadditional deposits is likely if the demand is sufficient to encourage\r\nprospecting. The United States has deposits large enough to meet\r\nall domestic needs and also to produce a surplus for export. Some\r\nmolybdenum is obtained from Mexico, Peru, and Spain, but the United\r\nStates, Great Britain (Canada and Australia), and Norway control the\r\nimportant deposits.\r\n\r\nThe largest molybdenum deposit in the United States, located at Climax,\r\nColorado, is owned by the Climax Molybdenum Co., a subsidiary of the\r\nAmerican Metal Co. (formerly German), and by the Molybdenum Products\r\nCo., of Denver, an American company. Other deposits in Colorado are\r\nowned by the Primos Chemical Co., a company that had strong German\r\nconnections before the war, but has been taken over by the Vanadium\r\nProducts Corporation, an American company. Other producing deposits of\r\nthe United States are owned by American citizens.\r\n\r\nThe Knaben mines, the most important in Norway, have been owned since\r\n1905 by an English company, but, according to a report, they have\r\nbeen acquired by a Norwegian company. A number of the deposits of\r\nnorthern Mexico are owned by Americans. Others are owned by the Madero\r\nestate (Mexican). The Canadian and Australian deposits are controlled\r\nby small, independent operators. Both the United States and Great\r\nBritain have ample supplies of molybdenum; France produces none and is\r\ndependent upon other countries; Germany, which was much interested in\r\nmolybdenum before the war, probably has no large stocks on hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nRADIUM AND URANIUM\r\n\r\nBY R. A. F. PENROSE, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\nRadium is a metal and is a product of the disintegration in nature of\r\nthe metal uranium. Both radium and uranium are elements. Radium has\r\nbeen isolated in its metallic state, but is not used in that form and\r\nis known better in the form of its salts, among the most important of\r\nwhich, so far as their uses are concerned, are the bromide, chloride\r\nand sulphate.\r\n\r\nWherever uranium occurs in nature, radium is associated with it in\r\ncertain definable quantities. Uranium can contain, however, only a\r\ncertain maximum amount of radium at a time, and when it has reached\r\nthis stage, the radium and uranium ratio is said to be in equilibrium.\r\nIn this condition the amount of radium per gram of uranium has been\r\ncalculated by Rutherford to be 3.4 × 10⁻⁷ gram. This corresponds to 1\r\ngram of radium element to about 3,000 kilograms of uranium element, or\r\n1 part of radium element to about 3,000,000 parts of uranium element.\r\nUranium minerals as mined are usually impure and carry only a small\r\npercentage of uranium elements, so that the ratio between radium and\r\nthe crude uranium ore may be 1 to several or many times 3,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe production of radium from uranium is usually stated in milligrams\r\nor grams, and even in the richest ores there is usually only a small\r\nfraction of a gram to a ton, while in the ordinary lower-grade ore\r\nthere are only a few milligrams to a ton, corresponding to a small\r\nfraction of a grain to a ton. Less than twenty years ago it was\r\nestimated that probably not one gram of radium element in the form of\r\nits refined salts had been extracted in the world. Today a great many\r\ntimes, perhaps a hundred times or more, this amount has been extracted\r\nand is in use. The annual production of radium today in the world is\r\nprobably several grams. The annual production of uranium in the world\r\nis probably several hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThe unique position of uranium as the source of radium in nature makes\r\nit necessary to discuss both materials together.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Uses of Radium.=--Radium is a heavy white metal which is very\r\nunstable, and alters rapidly in the air. It is not used in its metallic\r\nstage but only in the form of its salts. A few years ago these salts\r\nwere supposed to have a general beneficial effect in the treatment of\r\ncancer and other malignant growths, but more recent investigations\r\nseem to confine their influence to only certain forms of these\r\nafflictions. Their influence in other diseased conditions is often very\r\nmarked, but the full extent of the field of usefulness of radium for\r\nmedical purposes has not yet been very clearly defined.\r\n\r\nIn recent years radium has been applied to other important purposes,\r\nespecially in luminous paint for watches, clocks, compasses and other\r\ninstruments; and this use has so greatly increased in recent years,\r\nespecially for military purposes, that it now consumes more radium\r\nthan is used in medicine. Radium salts are more or less luminous\r\nwhen seen in a darkened room, and this quality is often increased\r\nby the admixture of certain other materials, notably zinc sulphide.\r\nHence their value in luminous paints. Radium salts also cause certain\r\nminerals to fluoresce, notably the zinc minerals willemite and\r\nsphalerite. In Germany, where radium during the war became scarce\r\non account of the shortage of the ores from which it is extracted,\r\nradium salts are said to have been preserved for medical purposes, and\r\nmesothorium and other radioactive substances used in making luminous\r\npaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Uses of Uranium.=--Uranium is a heavy white metal, which slowly\r\ntarnishes on exposure to the air. The chief use of uranium today is\r\nas a source of radium. For many years before the discovery of radium,\r\nhowever, uranium compounds were used in a small way in coloring glass\r\nand porcelain, in photography, in reagents for chemical analysis, in\r\nmordants for dyeing and for other minor purposes. The use of uranium\r\nmetal in small quantities in steel manufacture has been tried with some\r\ndegree of success.\r\n\r\n\r\nORES OF RADIUM AND URANIUM\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Statement.=--The principal uranium minerals at present known\r\nin nature, which are therefore the principal sources of both uranium\r\nand radium, are carnotite and uraninite, with the impure amorphous form\r\nof uraninite known as pitchblende. Torbernite, autunite and some of the\r\nrarer uranium minerals have produced a little radium and uranium.\r\n\r\nCarnotite and uraninite or pitchblende as mined for ores are generally\r\nmore or less mixed with other materials and are rarely found pure. The\r\nuranium in the ores is usually stated commercially, for convenience,\r\nin the form of the uranium oxides represented by the formula UO₂ +\r\n2UO₃, briefly expressed as U₃O₈. Most carnotite ore varies from 1 per\r\ncent. to 3 per cent. of U₃O₈; a 5 to 10 per cent. ore is considered\r\nhigh grade; a 20 to 40 per cent. ore is remarkably rich. Uraninite and\r\npitchblende ordinarily contain more uranium than carnotite contains,\r\nand even in the impure forms in which they are mined as ores, they\r\noften show this greater uranium content. The ordinary uraninite and\r\npitchblende ores carry from 2 to 3 per cent. to 8 or 10 per cent.\r\nU₃O₈, and a 20 per cent. ore is very high grade, though some ore runs\r\n60 or 70 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Carnotite.=--Carnotite is an amorphous, soft, powdery material,\r\nsometimes more or less coherent and of a talcose or waxy character,\r\ngenerally of a brilliant canary yellow color, though sometimes\r\ndiscolored by iron, organic matter and other substances. It is\r\nessentially a hydrous potassium uranium vanadate. Some authorities\r\nbelieve that carnotite is not a distinct mineral, but a mixture of\r\ndifferent minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Uraninite and Pitchblende.=--The terms uraninite and pitchblende\r\nare often used synonymously to designate the same mineral, but more\r\nproperly the term uraninite is a general name for all forms of the\r\nmineral and especially for the purer and distinctly crystalline\r\nvariety, and the term pitchblende is applicable to the impure amorphous\r\nform. It is black or grayish black in color, opaque, and often has a\r\nsubmetallic glossy or pitchlike luster. Uraninite is often remarkably\r\nlacking in distinctive characteristics, so that its presence might\r\nfrequently be overlooked. For this reason it seems possible that this\r\nmineral, now known in only comparatively small quantities, may some\r\ntime in the future be found more abundantly.\r\n\r\nUraninite, like carnotite, has a somewhat indefinite formula, but\r\nis essentially a combination of the two uranium oxides UO₂ and UO₃,\r\nin which UO₂ seems to act as a base and UO₃ as an acid. A number\r\nof both the rarer and commoner elements are often associated with\r\nthem. The relative amounts of the two oxides vary considerably in\r\ndifferent specimens, especially in the impure form of pitchblende,\r\nand no definite formula can at present be given. In pitchblende a\r\nnotable amount of water, perhaps sometimes in chemical combination,\r\nis often present. Several other minerals much rarer than uraninite\r\nor pitchblende are related to them in composition, among them being\r\ncleveite, bröggerite and nivenite.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Ores.=--Though carnotite, uraninite and pitchblende are the\r\nmost abundant of all the radium and uranium materials in nature,\r\nand produce almost all the radium and uranium of commerce, yet many\r\nother minerals contain both metals, and though as yet known only\r\nin such limited quantities as to be of small commercial value, may\r\nin the future be found in quantities of importance. Among them may\r\nbe mentioned tyuyamunite, a hydrous calcium uranium vanadate often\r\nassociated with the hydrous potassium uranium vanadate described above\r\nas carnotite; autunite, a hydrous calcium uranium phosphate; torbernite\r\nor chalcolite, a hydrous copper uranium phosphate.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL AND GEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF RADIUM AND URANIUM\r\n\r\nThe only regions of the world that have as yet produced any large\r\namounts of radium and uranium minerals on a commercial scale are\r\nColorado, Utah and Austria. Cornwall, Australia and Germany have\r\nproduced a small quantity of these minerals. They are known in small\r\nquantities in France and Portugal, and have been reported in India\r\nand German East Africa, but in these regions they have not yet become\r\ncommercially important. They occur sparingly, so far as yet known, and\r\npractically as only mineralogical curiosities, in Connecticut, North\r\nCarolina, Canada, Norway and many other regions, but may in the future\r\nbe found in larger quantities.\r\n\r\nMinute quantities of radium or its products of disintegration occur in\r\nalmost all rocks and in the atmosphere, and in the waters of the sea\r\nand land, but in such small amounts as to be unavailable as a source of\r\nthese substances. The source of all radium of commerce at the present\r\ntime is in the certain few uranium minerals already mentioned. They are\r\nfound in formations of various geologic ages, from recent superficial\r\ndeposits to the older crystalline rocks, but show a tendency toward\r\ncertain modes of occurrence, such as in southwestern Colorado and\r\nsoutheastern Utah as an impregnation in sandstone; in eastern Colorado,\r\nCornwall, Austria and South Australia as one of the gangue minerals\r\nin veins of other ores; in North Carolina, Canada, Norway and West\r\nAustralia in pegmatite or other feldspathic dikes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIUM AND URANIUM RESOURCES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Statement.=--The commercially important deposits of ores of\r\nradium and uranium in the United States are, so far as yet known,\r\nconfined to the carnotite regions of southwestern Colorado and\r\nsoutheastern Utah, and the pitchblende deposits of Gilpin County,\r\nin eastern Colorado. In Connecticut, North Carolina and elsewhere,\r\nuraninite, pitchblende and other uranium minerals have been found;\r\nand near Mauch Chunk, in Pennsylvania, small quantities of carnotite\r\nhave been discovered, but these occurrences are, so far as known, in\r\nquantities too small to be of commercial value.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Colorado and Utah.=--The carnotite deposits of southwestern Colorado\r\nand southeastern Utah are the most important sources of radium and\r\nuranium in the world. In Colorado the largest quantities of ore have\r\ncome from many mines in Montrose County, especially in Paradox Valley,\r\nwhile Mesa, San Miguel, Dolores, Rio Blanco, Routt and other counties\r\nhave been producers. In southeastern Utah the ores are carnotite, as\r\nin southwestern Colorado, and occur especially in Grand, Emery and\r\nSan Juan counties, but have not been worked to the same extent as in\r\nColorado.\r\n\r\nThe carnotite of Colorado and Utah occurs as an impregnation in\r\nsandstones and shaly sandstones, mostly in the McElmo and the La\r\nPlata formations, lying at the top of the Jurassic beds and below the\r\nCretaceous sandstones and conglomerates of the region. The deposits\r\nseem to have been formed by the precipitation of carnotite from\r\nsolution along certain strata of these formations, and the material\r\noccurs along bedding planes, in fissures and small cavities, in layers\r\nor irregular masses from a fraction of an inch to several inches in\r\nwidth, and sometimes as a general impregnation of the sandstone for\r\nseveral feet in thickness. It seems to be especially abundant in strata\r\nimpregnated strongly with vegetable or animal matter, and is often in\r\nunusual quantities in lignitized or petrified trunks of trees. This\r\nphenomenon suggests the influence of organic matter in precipitating\r\nand segregating the carnotite.\r\n\r\nThe rocks carrying the carnotite lie horizontally or dip at low angles\r\nin most parts of the Colorado region; in Utah they lie often in the\r\nsame way, but occasionally dip at steep angles. Where they appear on\r\nthe surface, the carnotite sometimes impregnates certain strata for\r\nseveral hundred feet or more along the outcrops, but more generally\r\nit occurs in spots along them, with little or no carnotite in the\r\nintervening spaces. As these outcrops are followed into the hillsides,\r\nthe ore appears to be even more irregular in its distribution than on\r\nthe surface, and in many or most cases it becomes much scarcer the\r\nfurther it is explored underground, until within 10 to 40 or 50 feet\r\nfrom the surface it often mostly or entirely disappears. There are\r\nexceptions to this feature, but the gradual and often rapid decrease\r\nin quantity and grade of the carnotite ore as it is followed into a\r\nhill is generally recognized. This fact suggests that the carnotite\r\nmay have been redissolved in the sandstone and carried to the surface\r\nby capillary action in this arid climate, forming rich, superficial\r\nefflorescences.\r\n\r\nIn many of the carnotite deposits, vanadium minerals occur\r\nindependently of the vanadium in the carnotite, but this association\r\nis not always observed. They occur in sandstone and often give it a\r\ndark-gray or blackish color.\r\n\r\nIn eastern Colorado several mines near Central City, Gilpin County,\r\nhave produced limited quantities of pitchblende. Among these are the\r\nKirk, the Wood, the Belcher, the Alps, the German and the Calhoun\r\nmines. The pitchblende occurs as a subordinate constituent in the\r\ngold-bearing veins of that country. The veins intersect old metamorphic\r\nrocks intruded by igneous rocks. The mines of Gilpin County are today\r\nproducing little if any pitchblende, and the total production has\r\nbeen small, amounting in all probably to only a few tons. Much more\r\npitchblende, however, was let go to waste in former days when the mines\r\nwere worked for other ores and the value of uranium was not recognized.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Production.=--The United States is today by far the largest producer\r\nof radium and uranium ores in the world, and is also the largest\r\nproducer of manufactured radium and uranium compounds. Before the\r\nwar, England, France and Germany, especially Germany, imported large\r\nquantities of American ores and extracted the radium in a refined state\r\nas its different salts, much of which was returned to the United States\r\nfor sale. Now, however, American ores are almost entirely treated in\r\nthe United States, with the exception of a little shipped to England\r\nand possibly to France. The Standard Chemical Co., of Pittsburgh, was\r\na pioneer in this work, and others quickly followed, among them the\r\nNational Radium Institute, of Denver; the Schlesinger Radium Co., of\r\nDenver; the Chemical Products Co., of Denver; the Cummings Chemical\r\nCo., of Lansdowne, Pa.; the Radium Luminous Materials Corporation, of\r\nNew York, and others.\r\n\r\nBefore the discovery of radium in 1898, but little attention was given\r\nto uranium ores in America, though some little pitchblende was shipped\r\nfrom the Central City, Colorado, region for use in making uranium\r\ncompounds. Shortly after the discovery of radium, however, mining was\r\nbegun on the carnotite of southwestern Colorado, and from 1900 to 1910\r\nseveral companies were formed to work these ores both in Colorado and\r\nUtah. The pitchblende of Central City also began to attract renewed\r\nattention. For a few years active work was done in prospecting for\r\nit, but the quantities have so far proved to be small. A few tons\r\nprobably represent the total amount derived from these mines since the\r\nsearch began. In the meantime, however, the production of carnotite\r\nincreased rapidly until 1915, when it greatly decreased on account of\r\nthe curtailment of shipments to Europe. In the latter part of 1916,\r\nhowever, the production increased again, on account of the increased\r\nconsumption of ore in this country, and in 1918 the production was very\r\nactive, largely on account of the increased use of radium not only in\r\nmedicine but especially in luminous paints.\r\n\r\nThe amount of radium and uranium ores produced in the United States, or\r\nin fact anywhere, during a given period, is difficult to determine, on\r\naccount of the different bases on which reports are made, but it may be\r\nsaid that the tonnage is small compared with that of ores of commoner\r\nmetals, a few thousand tons being a large amount of carnotite, and\r\nsimply a few tons or pounds being a large amount of pitchblende. Though\r\nthe mining of radium and uranium ores in the United States began about\r\n1900 or shortly before, no very large quantities were produced until\r\n1912, when about 1,100 tons were mined, consisting chiefly of Colorado\r\ncarnotite. The production gradually increased to several thousand tons\r\nyearly, practically all of which is carnotite from Colorado and Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIUM AND URANIUM RESOURCES OF EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Austria.=--The most important radium and uranium ore in Europe\r\nat present is the uraninite or pitchblende found in the mines of\r\nJoachimsthal, in _Bohemia_. It occurs as a subordinate gangue mineral\r\nin certain silver veins of that region which intersect metamorphic and\r\nigneous rocks, and has been actively worked ever since the discovery of\r\nradium by M. and Mme. Curie in 1898. Before that time the mineral had a\r\ncertain value as a source of uranium compounds.\r\n\r\nThese Austrian mines are second to those of the United States as a\r\nsource of radium and uranium, but their production equals only a very\r\nsmall part of that of this country. Until the Great War this production\r\nwas controlled largely, if not wholly, by the Austrian government,\r\nand as the production is said still to continue, it is probably still\r\ncontrolled in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n=England.=--Next in importance in Europe to the uraninite or\r\npitchblende ore of Joachimsthal as a source of radium and uranium,\r\nis the similar ore in some of the mines of _Cornwall_, England. It\r\noccurs as a subordinate mineral in the gangue of some of the old\r\ntin and copper mines, in veins intersecting metamorphic and igneous\r\nrocks, especially at St. Just, St. Ives, Grampound Road, St. Austell\r\nand elsewhere. The production and treatment of the ore has been under\r\nprivate or corporate auspices and the amount produced has not been\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany.=--In Germany the production of radium and uranium ores has\r\nalways been insignificant. A small quantity of such ores has been\r\nproduced at Schneeberg, Johanngeorgenstadt, Annaberg and elsewhere.\r\nBefore the war, Germany was a large producer of manufactured radium and\r\nuranium compounds, but they were derived mostly from imported American\r\nores.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Localities.=--With the exception of Joachimsthal and Cornwall,\r\nEurope has produced but small quantities of radium and uranium\r\nminerals. A little uraninite or pitchblende has been found in other\r\nlocalities in Austria, such as Przibram and elsewhere, and sparingly\r\nin _Norway_. Autunite and other uranium minerals have been found in\r\nsmall quantities near Autun, _France_, and near Sabugal and Guarda, in\r\n_Portugal_, but no important quantities have been produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIUM AND URANIUM RESOURCES OF AUSTRALIA, INDIA AND AFRICA\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australia.=--In _South Australia_ carnotite, autunite, torbernite and\r\nother rare uranium minerals occur in regions of metamorphic and igneous\r\nrocks at Radium Hill, near Olary, and at Mount Painter, in the Flinders\r\nrange. A few hundred tons of ore containing these minerals have been\r\nmined by private or corporation interests. Most of this has been sent\r\nto Woolwich, near Sydney, _New South Wales_, or to England, for the\r\nextraction of the radium. Since the war started no very active mining\r\noperations in such ores have been carried on in the South Australian\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nAt Cooglegong, in _Western Australia_, the uranium mineral fergusonite\r\nand to a less extent the uranium mineral euxenite occur in the surface\r\ndetrital material of the region. At Wodgina the minerals mackintoshite,\r\nthorogummite and pilbarite, all hydrous silicates of uranium, thorium\r\nand lead, occur in an albite pegmatite dike. No important quantities of\r\nthese Western Australia ores have yet been produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n=India and Africa.=--Radium and uranium minerals have been reported in\r\n_India_ and _German East Africa_, but no important quantities have yet\r\nbeen produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPECT OF FUTURE DISCOVERIES OF RADIUM AND URANIUM ORES\r\n\r\nThe prospect for increased discoveries of radium and uranium minerals\r\nat the present time seems best in the carnotite regions of Colorado and\r\nUtah. The workable deposits seem to be more or less superficial, and\r\nperhaps no large quantity of ore may be found in any one spot, yet the\r\ngreat extent of the region in which the formations carrying carnotite\r\noccur, will supply an immense aggregate amount of ore.\r\n\r\nIncreased discoveries of uraninite, pitchblende and other uranium\r\nminerals in Europe seem possible, even though that continent has\r\nalready been well explored for them. Moreover, new discoveries of\r\ndifferent radium and uranium minerals may very likely be made in\r\nstill other parts of the United States than those mentioned, and in\r\nless explored parts of the world, especially certain regions of South\r\nAmerica, Australia, Asia and Africa. Many of these minerals, especially\r\npitchblende, have no very distinctive features when first observed, and\r\nmight readily be overlooked many times before their true nature was\r\ndiscovered. Hence the possibilities of future discoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nZIRCONIUM\r\n\r\nBY H. C. MORRIS\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF ZIRCONIUM\r\n\r\nAs early as 1830 an attempt was made to use zirconia buttons, heated\r\nto incandescence, for lighting the streets of Paris. In 1885 an\r\nincandescent gas mantle of zirconium oxide was patented, but was\r\nreplaced in a few years by thorium. About 1900 zirconia was used in the\r\nNernst glower, and it has also been used in place of lime and magnesia\r\nas the incandescing material in the Drummond light. It is also said to\r\nbe used in the Bleriot light, and its use in flares has been suggested.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years Dr. C. M. Johnson has succeeded in\r\nmanufacturing laboratory ware made from zirconium minerals mixed with\r\nother refractories. Filtering crucibles, muffles, combustion tubes\r\nand boats, pyrometer protection tubes, and Kipp generators are now\r\non the market, competing in price with German porcelain and fused\r\nsilica. Zirconia crucibles are made from the fused material ground\r\nin a suitable mill. The powder is pressed or molded into shape with\r\nan organic binder, such as starch, or perhaps, better still, with a\r\nplastic cement made by grinding the fused material to 20 mesh, when\r\nit becomes colloidal in the presence of water. After drying, the\r\narticles are burned at a very high temperature (2300 to 2400°C.) until\r\ncontraction ceases.\r\n\r\nFused zirconia has a high thermal endurance; is not affected when\r\nheated to redness and plunged into cold water, its coefficient of\r\nexpansion being as low as 0.00000084; and its resistance to crushing\r\nis many times that of quartz glass. Its hardness is between that of\r\ncorundum and quartz; its specific gravity 5.89, and porosity below\r\n1 per cent. Its melting point is 2950°C, but 0.5 per cent. impurity\r\nreduces that by 100°C. Platinum, with a melting point of about 1750°C.,\r\ncan be melted to a mobile liquid in zirconia crucibles, and it is\r\nclaimed that the boiling point of pure iron has been determined in\r\nsimilar crucibles.\r\n\r\nChemically, zirconia is very inert, being highly resistant to acids,\r\nfused alkalies, fused quartz, or molten glass. Possibly no other\r\nmaterial known to chemists possesses such a combination of desirable\r\nrefractory properties. Its one undesirable characteristic is its\r\ntendency under certain conditions at high temperatures, in the presence\r\nof nitrogen or carbon, to become converted into nitride or carbide.\r\n\r\nAn instructive paper entitled “Zirconia as a Refractory,” by E. H.\r\nRodd, was published in the Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry,\r\nJune 15, 1918.\r\n\r\nZirconium oxide as an opacifier has been thoroughly investigated by\r\nHartman[95] and by Grunwald[96] with promising results; and a number\r\nof foreign patents have been granted on the use of the oxide in white\r\nceramic enamels. Zirconia seems to be especially suitable for the\r\nmanufacture of refractory bricks, or it can be applied as a lining or\r\nsurfacing to other less desirable refractories. Continental practice\r\nalong this line is said to have been much more highly developed than\r\npractice in this country, one example quoted being actual practice\r\ntests of a Martin Siemens furnace with a zirconia-lined hearth. After\r\nfour months of continuous operation at high temperatures the hearth was\r\nstill in good condition and gave promise of lasting at least an equal\r\nlength of time without renewal. Statistics compiled from these tests\r\nshowed a saving of about 50 per cent. in actual maintenance costs in\r\nfavor of zirconia over the other refractories ordinarily used for such\r\npurposes. Bradford[97] quoted Podszus[98] as claiming to have made\r\na furnace with the pure oxide which had first been fused in an arc\r\nfurnace and then ground; and in which temperatures of 2400° to 2500°C.\r\nwere obtained by firing with gas and oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [95] HARTMAN, AUGUSTUS, Zirconemail: Dissertations Arbeit: Techn.\r\n  Hochschule, Munich, 1910.\r\n\r\n  [96] Ueber Zirkonoxyd in der Emailindustrie: Sprechsaal, No. 5, 1911.\r\n\r\n  [97] BRADFORD, LEOPOLD, Birmingham Metallurgical Society (British).\r\n\r\n  [98] Podszus, Zeitsch. angew. Chem., Jahrg. 30, 1917, 1, pp. 17-19.\r\n\r\nThe most important question regarding zirconium at the present time\r\nhas to do with the remarkable properties that some of its advocates\r\nclaim it imparts to steel. That the Germans have had this use in mind\r\nfor some time is evidenced by the numerous patents they have obtained\r\ncovering the use of zirconium and its alloys.\r\n\r\nZirconium has been obtained in the amorphous and the graphitic state;\r\nand Wedekind has produced a metal of 99.8 per cent. purity resembling\r\nwhite cast iron in appearance, with a hardness of 7.8 (Mohs); specific\r\ngravity 6.40; specific heat, 0.0804; heat of combination, 1958\r\ncalories; and melting point, 1530°C.\r\n\r\nNumerous alloys of zirconium have been made and a number of foreign and\r\ndomestic patents have been issued covering various alloys, both ferrous\r\nand non-ferrous. It is stated that ferrozirconium is finding a limited\r\napplication in the steel industry as a scavenger for removing nitrogen\r\nand oxides. An English patent, No. 29,376, covers the use of zirconium\r\nas a scavenger, the alloy containing 20 per cent. of the element and\r\nbeing used in an amount equal to about 1 per cent. of the weight of\r\nsteel treated.\r\n\r\nAnother alloy containing 40 to 90 per cent. zirconium, the rest being\r\nmainly iron, is said to be free from metalloids and oxides, and\r\nmalleable and ductile. Alloys covered by United States Patent No.\r\n1,151,160 are claimed to be highly resistant to oxidation and chemical\r\nreagents. They have a metallic lustre and take a high polish, are\r\nreadily malleable and ductile, and it is suggested that they may find\r\nan important application in filaments for electric lamps, as they are\r\nsaid to have the property of selective radiation. A typical analysis\r\nof some of the alloys claimed to have been produced under this patent\r\nshows Zr. 0.65 per cent., Fe 26 per cent., Ti 0.12 per cent. and Al 7.7\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nA widely circulated statement to the effect that zirconium has been\r\nused in Germany in the production of steel for armor plates and\r\narmor-piercing projectiles has not been substantiated, so far as the\r\nwriter knows, by any records of analyses.\r\n\r\nThe use of zirconium for alloying in steel is so new that, pending\r\ndefinite determination by disinterested competent authorities of the\r\nexact properties, if any, which zirconium imparts to steel, judgment as\r\nto its value for this purpose should be withheld.\r\n\r\nZirconium carbide has been patented for filaments for incandescent\r\nelectric lamps and it has also been used as an abrasive. Tried as\r\na pigment, zirconia has been found to have good covering power and\r\nshould be considered where protection from acids, alkalies, or gases\r\nis particularly desired. The basic acetate has been used for weighting\r\nsilk, and the pure oxide is used as a substitute for bismuth subnitrate\r\nin X-ray work.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nZirconium occurs in nature in commercial quantities as a mixed oxide\r\nand silicate known as baddeleyite, sometimes called brazilite, and\r\nas the silicate, zircon. Baddeleyite, as supplied to the trade,\r\nusually carries 80 to 85 per cent. ZrO₂. The silicate, zircon, carries\r\nabout 65 per cent. ZrO₂. The oxide deposits, containing as they do a\r\nhigher percentage of zirconium and the ore being more pure and easier\r\nto reduce, will in all probability become the principal source of\r\nzirconium.\r\n\r\nThe principal known deposits of zirconium ores are in Brazil, India and\r\nthe United States, the countries being named in the relative order of\r\ntheir commercial importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Natural Oxide.=--The natural oxide, baddeleyite, or brazilite,\r\noccurs only in _Brazil_ in commercial quantities and is described in\r\n_Mineral Foote-Notes_ by Meyer,[99] who writes as follows:\r\n\r\n  [99] MEYER, H. C., _Mineral Foote-Notes_, November, 1916, p. 29.\r\n\r\n  There are but few commercial deposits of the unusual ores which\r\n  present more interesting geologic as well as economic features than\r\n  do the deposits of natural zirconium oxide in Brazil. The Caldas\r\n  region (visited in 1915 by the writer) in which these zirconia\r\n  deposits occur, is situated partly in the State of Minas Geraes and\r\n  partly in the State of Sao Paulo, approximately 130 miles north\r\n  of the city of Sao Paulo. It is a mountainous plateau, the main\r\n  elevation of which is about 3,600 feet. The surface is undulating,\r\n  presenting differences in level of from 300 to 600 feet.\r\n\r\n  The whole area is bounded on all sides by ridges rising abruptly\r\n  from 600 to 1,200 feet above the general level and forming a roughly\r\n  elliptical enclosure with a major axis of approximately 20 miles\r\n  in length and a minor axis of 15 miles. This peculiar arrangement\r\n  of the higher ridges is very significant when coupled with the\r\n  fact that the predominant rock of the plateau is a phonolite and\r\n  the presence of highly mineralized thermal water of considerable\r\n  medicinal value.[100] No thorough geological survey has been made of\r\n  this area with a view to determining the origin of the zirconia. The\r\n  character of the ore, however, and the formation, seems to point to\r\n  pneumatolitic agencies. A careful study of the relationship of the\r\n  large masses of coarsely crystalline nephelite-syenite in this area,\r\n  with pronounced segregations of eudialyte, might throw some light\r\n  upon this subject.\r\n\r\n  [100] DERBY, O. A., “Nepheline-rock in Brazil:” _Quart. Jour. Geol.\r\n  Soc._, August, 1887.\r\n\r\n  Zirconia ore can be roughly divided into two classes:\r\n\r\n  First, alluvial pebbles ranging in size from one-half inch to three\r\n  inches in diameter, generally carrying about 90 per cent. to 93 per\r\n  cent. zirconium oxide. These pebbles, known as favas and having a\r\n  specific gravity ranging from 4.8 to 5.2, are found along small\r\n  stream beds and on the talus slopes of low ridges.\r\n\r\n  Second, zirconia ore proper, or zirkite (a trade name), which ranges\r\n  in shade from a light gray to a blue black, the lighter colored\r\n  material carrying a higher percentage of zirconium silicate, as\r\n  evidenced by analyses, which in some cases show a minimum of 73 per\r\n  cent. zirconium oxide. The blue-black ore generally carries from\r\n  80 per cent. to 85 per cent. zirconium oxide. By careful sorting,\r\n  however, a uniform grade carrying about 80 per cent. is produced.\r\n\r\n  Prior to the investigations of Derby and Lee, this ore was considered\r\n  identical with baddeleyite. It has now been shown, however, that\r\n  it is a mechanical mixture of three minerals; namely, brazilite,\r\n  zircon, and a new and unnamed zirconium silicate carrying about 75\r\n  per cent. zirconium oxide. This new mineral has the same crystal form\r\n  as zircon (67 per cent. ZrO₂) but is readily soluble in hydrofluoric\r\n  acid, while zircon is not affected, this being a characteristic\r\n  differential test. The finely powdered mineral, on being treated\r\n  with a weak solution of hydrofluoric acid, leaves a residue of\r\n  minute, perfect, pyramidal crystals of zircon, the brazilite and new\r\n  zirconium silicate going into solution. Several large outcrops of the\r\n  ore occur on the extreme westerly edge of the plateau, one or two\r\n  isolated boulders weighing as much as thirty tons. This very cursory\r\n  examination of the zirconia deposits makes it unsafe to venture any\r\n  conjecture as to the quantity of ore available. Suffice it to say,\r\n  however, that the deposits have been traced for a distance of fifteen\r\n  miles between Gascata and Caldas, and if surface indications are of\r\n  any significance, are of vast extent.\r\n\r\nThe oxides have also been found in the State of _Montana_, and in\r\n_Ceylon_, _Sweden_, and _Italy_, but none of these occurrences are of\r\ncommercial importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Silicate.=--The simple silicate, zircon, is found in seashore\r\nand river concentrations of monazite sands, associated with ilmenite,\r\ngarnet, rutile, and various other heavy minerals usually found in such\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nAn important concentration of zircon occurs along the coast of\r\n_Brazil_, in the states of Bahia, Espirito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro,\r\nwhere cusps of the beaches are protected on the north by granite\r\nheadlands and bordered by Tertiary bluffs, which are cut by various\r\nstreams and lagoons that constantly furnish fresh material for the\r\nconcentrating action of the tides and waves.\r\n\r\nProbably the next most important occurrence of zircon is in _India_, in\r\nthe beach sands of the province or state of Travancore at the extreme\r\nsouthwestern end of the Hindustan peninsula.\r\n\r\nNext in importance is an occurrence in the _United States_ at Pablo\r\nBeach, Florida, where not only the beach sands, but the dunes bordering\r\nthem, contain appreciable quantities of the following minerals in their\r\nrelative order of abundance: ilmenite, garnet, epidote, zircon, rutile,\r\nand other heavy minerals including monazite.[101]\r\n\r\n  [101] HESS, FRANK L., Letter of May 1, 1918.\r\n\r\nOther occurrences in this country, most of which are of academic\r\ninterest only, are in Colorado, at St. Peter’s Dome, near Pike’s Peak;\r\nin Idaho, in the Clearwater region and elsewhere in black sands and in\r\ncertain granitic rocks; in Sussex County, New Jersey, at the Williams\r\nmine, where zircon occurs abundantly in magnetite; in New York at Lyon\r\nMountain, Clinton County; at a few places near Crown Point; abundantly\r\nin pegmatite at Old Red Mines, Mineville, Essex County, and in numerous\r\nplaces in Orange County on the south, and St Lawrence County on the\r\nnorth. In North Carolina, in Burke, McDowell, and Rutherford counties,\r\nzircon occurs in monazite sands, and also in Henderson County near\r\nZirconia and in Fredell County near Sterling.\r\n\r\nLarge crystals of zircon occur in a small pegmatite area in Comanche\r\nCounty, Oklahoma, in the southwestern portion of the Wichita National\r\nForest. Oregon has many localities in which the presence of zircon has\r\nbeen noted, chiefly in black sands, old and present beaches, placer\r\ngravels, etc., and the same is true of Washington. In Virginia, zircon\r\nis found in pegmatite in Aurelia County, and in sandstone near Ashland,\r\nnot far from Richmond.\r\n\r\nZircon is also found in _Norway_, the _Ural Mountains_, _Ceylon_,\r\n_Australia_, and _British South Africa_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe important zirconium resources of the world are controlled\r\npolitically, in the order of their commercial importance, by Brazil,\r\nGreat Britain, and the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Brazil.=--A number of years ago John Gordon, an American mining\r\nengineer, became interested in deposits of monazite sand on the coast\r\nof Brazil in the vicinity of Prado, Bahia. A thorough investigation\r\nof all the known monazite deposits of the world showed that those in\r\nBrazil were by far the most desirable, and that those in Travancore,\r\nIndia, were second in commercial importance.[102]\r\n\r\n  [102] See Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\nOther firms exporting zirconium minerals from Brazil, in addition to\r\nGordon & Rogers, of 141 Broadway, New York, are Suffern & Co., of\r\n135 Broadway, New York; S. R. Scott & Co., 39 Broadway, New York;\r\nFoote & Co., Philadelphia, Pa.; P. S. Nicholson & Co., Caixa 91, Rio\r\nde Janeiro; E. J. Lavino & Co., Bullitt Building, Philadelphia, Pa.;\r\nLuiz de Rezende & Co., Rua Ouidor, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Chas.\r\nSpitz, also of Rio de Janeiro, who is agent for the Société Minière, a\r\nFrench company in which Rezende & Co. are said to have a considerable\r\ninterest. Sometime ago the firm of A. C. de Freitas & Co. of Hamburg,\r\nGermany, had a contract from the Brazilian government on monazite sands\r\nand agreed to export at least 1,200 tons annually. How much zircon that\r\ncompany exported is not known. The de Freitas properties are now being\r\nworked by the Société Minière (French).[103]\r\n\r\n  [103] Production figures 1902-1916 for the United States and Brazil\r\n  are given in Table 34.\r\n\r\nUntil very recently, zirconium has been of minor interest in this\r\ncountry, the monazite sands having been exploited for their thorium\r\ncontents only, not for zirconium. However, Germany and Austria seem to\r\nhave placed considerable value upon zirconium-bearing sands, and, as\r\nshown by the attached table, more was produced in 1913 than in all the\r\ntime prior, and practically all the material produced during that year\r\nwent to Germany. This is in accord with the efforts of Germany, just\r\nbefore the war, to obtain tungsten and molybdenum, and is an evidence\r\nof preparations long before hostilities began.\r\n\r\n\r\n=India.=--Before the war, the German users of monazite were in control\r\nof the Travancore, _India_, deposits. That control of course ceased and\r\nthe contracts were cancelled. The India Office decided that, in the\r\nfuture, all directors of the company must be British born, and that the\r\ncompany must be ready at all times to sell monazite sand to British\r\nfirms, direct, at a fair price.\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--It is hardly probable that the deposits in the\r\n_United States_ will be able to compete, on a commercial basis, with\r\nthe Brazilian ores; but, if the necessity should arise, this country\r\ncan produce, within its own borders, enough zirconium to manufacture\r\nmany thousand tons of zirconium steel. The cordial commercial relations\r\nbetween the United States and Brazil will probably protect this country\r\nfrom any undue restraint on exports from South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n=General.=--All of the large countries interested have facilities for\r\nmaking the ferro-alloy. Numerous alloys of zirconium have been made,\r\nand a number of patents, both foreign and domestic, have been issued\r\ncovering various alloys, both ferrous and non-ferrous. No secret\r\nprocesses, as such, are known to the writer.\r\n\r\nTABLE 34.--PRODUCTION OF ZIRCONIUM MINERALS IN THE UNITED STATES AND\r\nBRAZIL, 1902-1916[104]\r\n\r\n  ----+------------------+--------------------\r\n      |   United States  |       Brazil\r\n      +------------+-----+------------+-------\r\n      |  Quantity  |Value|  Quantity  | Value\r\n  Year|(short tons)|     |(short tons)|\r\n  ----+------------+-----+------------+-------\r\n  1902|     ...    |  ...|      12    |$ 3,947\r\n  1903|     1¹⁄₂   |$ 570|       7    |  1,947\r\n  1904|      ¹⁄₂   |  200|       9    |  3,935\r\n  1905|     4      | 1600|      18    |  5,506\r\n  1906|      ¹⁄₂   |  248|      26    |  5,041\r\n  1907|            |   46|      38    |  8,756\r\n  1908|     0      |    0|     275    | 15,151\r\n  1909|     1      |  250|     117    | 11,838\r\n  1910|     0      |    0|     128    | 23,271\r\n  1911|     1¹⁄₂   |  802|      45    | 16,169\r\n  1912|     0      |    0|      43    | 14,772\r\n  1913|     0      |    0|   1,119    | 54,767\r\n  1914|     0      |    0|     237    | 14,903\r\n  1915|     0      |    0|       8    |  2,915\r\n  1916|     0      |    0|     104    | 16,647\r\n  ----+------------+-----+------------+-------\r\n\r\n  [104] Adapted from _Mineral Resources_, U.

Survey, 1917, pp. 377-386.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe principal use for zirconium ores at present is determined by the\r\nrefractory properties of the oxide, zirconia. Refractory bricks and\r\nshapes for furnace linings, chemical ware, and other heat, acid, and\r\nalkali resisting articles are made of zirconia, and are finding a\r\nlimited market.\r\n\r\nThe recent interest in zirconium is due to the remarkable properties\r\nwhich it is said to impart to steel. Its real worth, or function, in\r\nthat direction is yet to be definitely determined, and tests conducted\r\nby the Bureau of Mines, Bureau of Standards and others are being made\r\nto ascertain the facts.\r\n\r\nThe best and most available source of supply at present is Brazil,\r\nwhere the natural oxide, baddeleyite, occurs in considerable quantities\r\nin the states of Minas Geraes and Sao Paulo. The deposits have not\r\nbeen explored sufficiently to make any reliable estimate of tonnage\r\npossible, but, judged from their surface showing, they are of vast\r\nextent. The silicate, zircon, is found in Brazil, India and in the\r\nUnited States in commercial quantities.\r\n\r\nThe important deposits of zirconium minerals are controlled by Brazil,\r\nGreat Britain and the United States, but the actual ownership of many\r\nof the deposits is unknown. This is particularly true of the oxide\r\nores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMONAZITE, THORIUM, AND MESOTHORIUM\r\n\r\nBY R. B. MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF MONAZITE\r\n\r\nPractically the only use of monazite has been as a source of thorium\r\nsalts. In extracting these, by-products are recovered, such as cerium,\r\nlanthanum, and other rare earths. Thorium salts are used almost\r\nexclusively for the manufacture of Welsbach mantles, which consist of\r\n99 per cent. thorium oxide and 1 per cent. cerium oxide. For this use\r\nthere is no known substitute. The one other use of thorium salts is\r\nin ordinary chemical laboratories, but this use is very limited. The\r\nfluoride and other salts of cerium are used in connection with the\r\nflaming arc, their presence giving increased luminosity.\r\n\r\nMesothorium is a radio-active element always found in thorium minerals.\r\nUntil quite recently it has been thrown away in the manufacture of\r\nthorium nitrate; but it is now being produced as a by-product, and\r\nis useful as a substitute for radium in luminous paints, and for\r\ntherapeutic purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe principal sources of monazite are Brazil and India, although it\r\nhas been mined successfully in the United States in the Carolinas and\r\nin Idaho. It has been found in Swaziland, Africa, and in Australia,\r\nand also, to a limited extent, in native rock and in placers in\r\nEkaterinburg, Russia.\r\n\r\nMonazite is usually found in the gravels of small streams or bottom\r\nlands, although it is sometimes found in the soil of hillsides. In\r\nBrazil and India it occurs mainly in the beach sands of the sea\r\ncoast. In places it is found in small crystals in gneiss, granite and\r\npegmatite rocks. As these rocks become disintegrated, the crystals\r\nare washed into streams and with other heavy sands are deposited in\r\nthe stream beds. On the coast of Brazil, the monazite grains from the\r\ncrystalline rocks of the coastal mountains are concentrated by the\r\nwaves of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--The deposits of the Carolinas cover an area of\r\nseveral hundred square miles east of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\r\nIn North Carolina, the counties of Cleveland, Burke, Alexander,\r\nRutherford and Lincoln furnish the richest deposits. In South Carolina\r\nthe only deposits of value are in the counties of Cherokee and\r\nGreenville. Practically all of the monazite mined in the Carolinas is\r\nderived from gravels in streams and bottom lands, the miners usually\r\nfollowing the stream courses. The gravels vary greatly in thickness,\r\nand it is therefore difficult to make a true estimate of the average,\r\nbut in general the monazite-bearing gravels are between 1¹⁄₂ and 2¹⁄₂\r\nfeet thick. The top soil in the bottom lands averages 3 to 6 feet thick\r\nand may be 7 feet or more.\r\n\r\nThe deposits in the State of Idaho are near Centerville and Idaho\r\nCity. In the future, under more favorable conditions of price,\r\ntransportation, etc., these deposits may possibly become a commercial\r\nsource of monazite. Almost all of them contain small quantities of\r\ngold. The gravel beds are considerably thicker than those in the\r\nCarolinas, and with the gold content might be more profitable were it\r\nnot for labor being higher priced.\r\n\r\nMonazite has been found in Colorado, in the Newland Gulch district,\r\n20 miles south of Denver, where it occurs in gravels that carry\r\nconsiderable gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Brazil.=--There are three kinds of monazite sand deposits in Brazil;\r\nthe deposits within the government lands along the coast; deposits\r\nlying behind the government coastal lands, which are private state\r\npossessions or belong to private parties; and inland deposits. The bulk\r\nof the monazite is derived from coast sands in the states of Espirito\r\nSanto and Bahia, the sand being washed by means of oscillating tables\r\nor sluice boxes. The coast lands are the property of the federal\r\ngovernment for 33 meters inland, measuring from the point where the\r\nsea waves wash the beach at mean high tide. This uncertain method of\r\nmarking property has of course given rise to disputes when boundaries\r\nare established.\r\n\r\nAt a few places along the coast strips of monazite-bearing sands lie\r\ndirectly behind the government land, and some of these might be worked\r\nprofitably were it not for the fact that it has been difficult to prove\r\nto the federal government that these sands were not taken from the\r\nnearby government land. One French concern has exploited such lands\r\nin the State of Rio de Janeiro. Along the banks of the large rivers,\r\nsuch as Parahyba, there are great quantities of black sands with traces\r\nof monazite. Near Sapucaia such deposits have been worked by a French\r\nconcern. Many of the inland deposits can not be exploited on account of\r\nthe expense of transportation of the products, as the deposits are many\r\nmiles from a railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n=India.=--India is the newest source of monazite sands, the deposits\r\nlying on the sea beach like those in Brazil. The deposits are in\r\nthe Travancore district near the southwestern end of the Hindustan\r\npeninsula. Very little information is available concerning these\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN TREATMENT PRACTICE\r\n\r\nThe general method of treatment employed until quite recently has\r\ninvolved leaching the concentrate with concentrated sulphuric acid,\r\nthus getting the thorium, cerium, and other rare earths in solution and\r\nseparating them from the silica, zircon, ilmenite and other insoluble\r\nproducts. From this stage different companies used slight variations in\r\npractice, such variations being kept strictly secret, although they all\r\ninvolved the precipitation of the thorium as oxalate by means of oxalic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the war the price of sulphuric acid went to four or\r\nfive times the original cost, and the increased price of oxalic acid\r\nwas practically prohibitive. Consequently the manufacturing companies\r\nhad to change their entire procedure and to use chemicals that they\r\ncould obtain at a reasonable price. In this difficult undertaking the\r\ncompanies were successful, and at least one company devised a process\r\nthat was considerably more efficient than the old one.\r\n\r\nAt present mesothorium is being produced as a by-product by the Lindsay\r\nLight Co. and the Welsbach Co., the process used by the latter company\r\nhaving been originated by the Colorado Station of the United States\r\nBureau of Mines. This process is cheap and extremely efficient, and\r\nwill no doubt enable the Welsbach Co. to compete commercially with\r\nany other manufacturer of mesothorium. Of course as the process was\r\ndeveloped by the Bureau of Mines it will ultimately be made available\r\nfor anyone, but as mesothorium can only be made at a profit as a\r\nby-product of thorium nitrate, anyone who manufacturers mesothorium\r\nmust first establish a thorium industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe important monazite resources of the world are controlled\r\npolitically by three nations: the United States, Great Britain (India)\r\nand Brazil. The deposits of the United States, in normal times,\r\nprobably can not be worked successfully in competition with the foreign\r\ndeposits without the protection of a high tariff.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--The widely scattered monazite deposits of the United\r\nStates are of importance only during a period of abnormally high prices\r\nor during the restriction of imports from Brazil and India. The known\r\nreserves are small and the deposits will probably never be an important\r\nfactor in the world monazite market. As far as the writer knows, all of\r\nthe American deposits are controlled by American capital.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of thorium nitrate in this country is closely\r\ncontrolled by two large companies, the Welsbach Co. and the Lindsay\r\nLight Co.; they own the only two commercial plants of any size in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nAll of the manufacturers of mantles in the United States, with one\r\nexception, must obtain their thorium nitrate from one of these two\r\ncompanies. As these companies supply practically all the thorium\r\nnitrate requirements of England and France, they control the thorium\r\nindustry. The only other manufacturer of thorium nitrate in this\r\ncountry is the Block Co., of Chicago, which uses about 15 tons of\r\nmonazite a year, making sufficient thorium nitrate for its own\r\nproduction of mantles. The Welsbach Co. uses about 1,200 tons of\r\nmonazite annually and the Lindsay Light Co. about half that amount.\r\nThe Welsbach Co. has contracts for the delivery of monazite, up to its\r\nrequirements, from Brazil; the Lindsay Light Co. has obtained all of\r\nits monazite from India.\r\n\r\nMost of the processes used, including those used by the Welsbach Co.\r\nand the Lindsay Light Co., are secret. As thorium can be extracted from\r\nmonazite in more ways than one, a secret process does not necessarily\r\nmean commercial control unless such a process is in every way efficient\r\nand the company owning it is willing to get into a commercial war.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Brazil.=--As the Brazilian deposits have for so many years been the\r\nchief source of the supply of monazite, the history of their commercial\r\ncontrol is practically a history of the commercial control of the\r\nmonazite industry. About 27 years ago, John Gordon, an American now\r\nresiding in New York, found monazite on the coast of Brazil. He brought\r\nlarge quantities to Hamburg, Germany, and was able to obtain a monoply\r\nof the monazite sand.\r\n\r\nAt that time the manufacture of thorium nitrate, the principal\r\nproduct of the monazite sand, was confined in Europe to a few large\r\nchemical firms in Germany and the Welsbach Co. in Vienna. They not\r\nonly supplied the European market with thorium nitrate, but also sent\r\nlarge quantities to the United States. The American Welsbach Co. early\r\nmanufactured thorium nitrates from sands mined in the Carolinas, a\r\nprotective duty of 6 per cent. making this possible.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 Mr. Gordon agreed to supply the four large German manufacturers\r\nand the Austrian manufacturers with monazite at a price of $150 a ton\r\nand a profit on the manufactured nitrates. A close combination thus\r\nformed, known as the German Thorium Convention, prevented other thorium\r\nmanufacturers from acquiring any of the mineral mined by Mr. Gordon,\r\nand raised the price of thorium nitrate 100 per cent.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable period Mr. Gordon exported the sand from the coast\r\nlands of Bahia, near Prado, Brazil, without interference. Finally the\r\nBrazilian government became acquainted with the value of the resources\r\nand decided that no private individual or state government had the\r\nright to mine, sell, lease, or remove any monazite on so-called state\r\nlands without the consent of the federal authorities. In 1908 the\r\ngovernment advertised that coast lands in the State of Espirito Santo\r\nwould be leased to the highest bidder for the exploitation of the\r\nsands. A contract was thus obtained for the firm of A. C. de Freitas\r\n& Co., of Hamburg, Germany. By the contract the firm agreed to pay to\r\nthe Brazilian government a rental equal to 50 per cent. of the selling\r\nprice of the monazite sands and to export at least 1,200 tons annually.\r\n\r\nTo avoid trouble the German Thorium Convention arranged later that\r\nhalf of its supply should be furnished by Mr. Gordon and half by the\r\nde Freitas company. A new convention was formed by the four German\r\nchemical manufacturers with Mr. Gordon and the de Freitas company,\r\npreventing firms in other countries that had started to manufacture\r\nthorium nitrate from getting raw material. Consequently great efforts\r\nwere made to find and develop new deposits of monazite. The high\r\nprice for thorium nitrate made possible the mining of monazite in\r\nthe Carolinas and its export to Germany, especially to one German\r\nmanufacturer who was not in the German Thorium Convention.\r\n\r\nUltimately there was an overproduction of thorium and in 1906 the price\r\ndropped 50 per cent. Monazite mining declined in all localities where\r\nthe cost of mining was high, and production in the Carolinas and the\r\ninterior of Brazil practically stopped.\r\n\r\nDuring the four or five years antedating the war the German\r\nIncandescent Gas Light Co., of Berlin, succeeded in controlling the\r\nlargest manufacturers of thorium nitrate in Europe, except those in\r\nFrance. It controlled both the English and Australian companies and\r\nbecame the active competitor of the so-called Thorium Convention, which\r\nat that time had lost much of its power. Mr. Gordon still has extensive\r\ninterests in Brazil, but he does not have a monoply. The exportation\r\nrights from Brazil are in the hands of Luis de Rezende & Co. (Rio de\r\nJaniero), Mr. Gordon, and others. Luis de Rezende & Co. is mainly a\r\nFrench concern, but has Brazilian and Portuguese stockholders. The\r\ncompany controls the French company, Société Minière, associated with\r\nthe Welsbach Co.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, one French company has exploited monazite deposits in\r\nthe territory immediately behind the government lands in the State of\r\nRio de Janeiro. Another French company has worked the black sands along\r\nthe Parahyba River, near Sapucaica, which contain traces of monazite.\r\n\r\n\r\n=India.=--Before the war, the German manufacturers of thorium nitrate\r\nexercised as close control over the monazite deposits of Travancore,\r\nIndia, as over those of Brazil. Only a limited quantity of the sand\r\nwas sold to gas-mantle manufacturers and other consumers in the United\r\nKingdom, and then at a price nine times the price paid by the German\r\nconsumers. Such a monoply of the supplies of raw material made the\r\nGerman monoply of the thorium nitrate industry almost complete.\r\n\r\nAccording to S. J. Johnstone, in an address at the annual meeting of\r\nthe Society of Chemical Industry in July, 1916, the Germans obtained\r\npractical control of the Travancore monazite deposits in the following\r\nmanner: A lease for working these deposits was granted some years ago\r\nby the Travancore Durbar, with the approval of the Government of India,\r\nto the London Cosmopolitan Tin Mining Co., which contracted to sell the\r\nwhole of its output to a German firm. Soon after the outbreak of war\r\nit was found that the whole of the preference shares and 11,000 of the\r\nordinary shares of the Travancore Minerals Co. were held in trust for\r\nthe Auer company, of Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe India Office decided that in the future all directors of the\r\ncompany working the concession must be British-born and that the\r\ncompany, must be ready at all times to sell monazite sand direct, and\r\nat a fair price, to British firms. German contracts were canceled. A\r\nsecond company, Thorium, Ltd., obtained a 20-year lease to work 150\r\nacres in Travancore for monazite sand, and is exporting the sand and\r\nmanufacturing thorium nitrate from it at works in England. A great deal\r\nof Travancore monazite has been imported by American companies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nAs outlined above, it can be readily seen that the United States is\r\ndependent upon Brazil and India for its raw materials, as domestic\r\ndeposits are not large enough to furnish the required supply and cannot\r\nbe worked in competition with the more cheaply mined foreign deposits.\r\n\r\nThe average concentrate obtained in the Carolinas runs about 3¹⁄₂ to\r\n4 per cent. thorium oxide; that obtained in Brazil averages somewhat\r\nover 8 per cent. Under such conditions it is difficult for the Carolina\r\nmonazite to compete with that from Brazil or from India. In addition,\r\na very considerable amount of the Carolina monazite available has been\r\nremoved. The old workings are more or less covered up and the whole\r\nindustry has become completely disorganized.\r\n\r\nWhilst these deposits were being mined and operated farmers were in\r\nthe habit of making their own concentrate in crude sluice boxes.\r\nThe product thus obtained averaged about 35 per cent. monazite. The\r\nconcentrates were then sold to a refinery, where it was best treated by\r\nelectromagnetic separators, such as the Wetherill machine. The final\r\nproduct obtained from these machines was ready for chemical treatment\r\nfor the extraction of the thorium.\r\n\r\nPractically the same treatment is given to the monazite from Brazil\r\nand India. As the concentrate obtained is of much higher grade, the\r\nadditional charges for freight and duty, which are not borne by the\r\nCarolinas product, are more than offset. Undoubtedly, unless a very\r\nhigh tariff is placed on the monazite from Brazil and India, our\r\nfuture supplies will come from these two sources, at least for some\r\ntime. It is very doubtful whether with a high tariff the Carolina\r\ndeposits could furnish the monazite required in this country, even for\r\na few years, and under the most favorable conditions it would take some\r\ntime, possibly six months to a year, to revive the industry.\r\n\r\nThe Allies and practically the whole world are dependent upon the\r\nUnited States for the manufactured products, thorium nitrate and gas\r\nmantles. Whether this monoply will continue is doubtful, as there is\r\na movement in England to encourage both the thorium nitrate and the\r\ngas-mantle industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCOPPER\r\n\r\nBY F. W. PAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nOne country stands pre-eminent as the world’s great producer of copper,\r\nand that is the United States, whose production was 60 per cent. of the\r\ntotal world output in 1917. Iron, coal, oil and copper are fundamental\r\nraw materials of which the United States produces more than any other\r\ncountry, but only in copper and in oil is the output greater than that\r\nof all other countries together. In copper this has been true since the\r\nearly nineties. American copper, English gold, Russian platinum and\r\nChilean nitrate are common phrases in world markets; as common as the\r\ncommodities themselves.\r\n\r\nNo other country produces or has for many years ever produced one-sixth\r\nas much copper as the United States. While the world output of copper\r\nhas been increasing, at the average rate of 5 per cent. annually for 10\r\nyears up to 1914 and three times as rapidly since then, the relative\r\nimportance of the United States has not declined. On the contrary it\r\nhas increased at a greater rate than the total world output. Certain\r\nindividual countries, it is true, have since 1914 increased their\r\noutput faster than the United States, but there is no indication that\r\nthe United States will lose its present dominating leadership.\r\n\r\nBecause of the magnitude of the copper industry of the United States,\r\ngreat refining plants have been built up here. American capital also\r\nhas gone largely into Canadian, Mexican and South American copper\r\nproperties. As a result the United States now imports nearly one-third\r\nas much copper as is produced (18 per cent. of the total world output\r\nin 1917). Thus American capital controls, through refining in addition\r\nto ownership of mines, 78 per cent. of the world’s copper production.\r\nThis control should also be equally strong as regards selling.\r\nObviously, a large part of our domestic, and, as regards statistics,\r\nall the imported copper, is exported in finished form--copper ingots\r\nand bars, brass, electrical machinery, etc. But as regards selling and\r\neven mine ownership in Mexico and South America, there is considerable\r\nGerman control; although the important mines of Canada, Mexico\r\nand South America are owned by either American, British or French\r\ninterests, except those owned by local foreign capital.\r\n\r\nTABLE 35.--GEOGRAPHICAL AND FINANCIAL CONTROL OF THE WORLD’S COPPER\r\nMINES\r\n\r\n(Production in Metric Tons)\r\n\r\n  -----+---------+------------------+---------+-----+---------+\r\n   Per-|         |                  |         | Per-|         |\r\n  cent-|         |                  |         |cent-|         |\r\n   age | Average |                  |Estimated| age |         |\r\n   of  |1916-1917|                  | capacity|  of | Owned by|\r\n  World|output of|                  |output of|world|  U.

Total full future value over long number of years\r\n  is greatly reduced when expressed in terms of present value on normal\r\n  interest discount. All countries with reserves good for ten or more\r\n  years may be considered as being on an equal footing so far as copper\r\n  resources are concerned. But, large reserves may mean expanding\r\n  production (as in Chile and Africa) and be important on that account\r\n  and only on that account.\r\n\r\n  To weigh ore reserves they have been taken in toto, but Spain would\r\n  be no worse off as compared to the United States if her reserves\r\n  were put at 10 years instead of at 50 (as calculated above). Her\r\n  reserves happen to be of a kind easily blocked out, but her output is\r\n  stationary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.--Geographical distribution of the principal\r\ncopper-producing districts of the world. By F. W. Paine.]\r\n\r\nTable 35 shows the different copper-producing countries of the world\r\nand the chief features of financial control of the producing mines.\r\nTable 36 shows the chief features of business control (refining and\r\nselling control) as distinct from control by mine ownership. In both\r\ntables a forecast for future conditions is made by using estimates\r\nof 1918 and 1919 production. These figures are followed out to the\r\ndifferent forms of control. The actual outputs of 1916-17 are given\r\nas a reference and check. Table 37 shows reserves, largely those of\r\nproducing mines. Plate VIII shows the location of the principal copper\r\ndeposits of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\n=Production.=--The maximum output of copper from mines within the\r\nborders of the United States was in 1916, and amounted to 1,927,850,548\r\npounds. In 1917 the output was less, because of labor troubles, but\r\nsix leading states showed an increase, and if Montana had equaled the\r\noutput of 1916, the 1917 output would have been 1,962,034,512 pounds.\r\nWithout good markets and favorable labor conditions, the United States\r\nproduction cannot reach anything like 2,000,000,000 pounds a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercial Control\r\n\r\n\r\n_Control Through Ownership of Mines._--All the productive bodies of\r\ncopper in the United States are owned by Americans, except a small\r\nnumber controlled by English capital. Before the war, there was\r\nevidence of German affiliation and potential control in the copper\r\nindustry, but this centered in refining and selling the metal.\r\nAccordingly, the German grip on the industry was highly centralized,\r\nand direct and effective measures were used in breaking it.\r\n\r\nFive leading groups are in control of copper production in the United\r\nStates. Certain of these have additional important ownerships in South\r\nAmerica and Mexico, which will be discussed under those countries.\r\n\r\nTABLE 38.--LEADING FINANCIAL GROUPS IN CONTROL OF COPPER PRODUCTION IN\r\nUNITED STATES\r\n\r\n                                                                  Pounds\r\n  _Group 1.

In ownership, however, this property should be placed in\r\ngroup 7, (output 10,547,704 pounds).\r\n\r\nIn group 3 are two English-owned mines: Arizona Copper Co. (Scotch) and\r\nMountain Copper Co., (English). Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron in the\r\nlast group (uncertain and unclassifiable) is also English-owned. The\r\ncombined output of these three English-owned properties is 48,000,000\r\npounds. This comprises all properties not owned by American capital.\r\nDucktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Co., Ltd. is English-owned, but all its\r\nproduction (copper matte) is sold to the American Metal Co. The others\r\nin the group designated above as uncertain, or unclassifiable, are\r\nentirely American owned, although their production has been marketed by\r\nthe American Metal Co. or L. Vogelstein, as discussed later.\r\n\r\nNone of these groups actually own the mines outright, the mines being\r\nowned by hosts of stockholders scattered all over the country. Of many\r\ncompanies the president and directors own a very small percentage of\r\nthe stock. As regards group 6 and to a less extent group 4, however,\r\nthe actual ownership is in very few hands; but this is exceptional. The\r\ncopper mines of the United States, like the railroads and the largest\r\nindustrial enterprises, such as the United States Steel Corporation,\r\netc., are, in the last analysis, controlled by their stockholders.\r\n\r\nSummarized on the basis of the 1917 output, one finds that the\r\nownership of American copper mines is as follows: American 97¹⁄₂ per\r\ncent., English and Scotch, 2¹⁄₂ per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Control Through Ownership of Smelters and Refineries._--Ownership\r\nof smelters that treat domestic ore is substantially identical to\r\nthe mine ownership given above. Interests owning active smelters are\r\nless numerous than interests owning mines, because efficient smelting\r\nrequires large-scale operations.\r\n\r\nThe electrolytic refineries are all American owned. Large-scale\r\nunits, representing heavy capital investments, are essential in\r\nelectrolytic refining. A small refinery cannot compete successfully\r\nwith large ones. The average important copper mine produces enough ore\r\nto make about 25,000,000 pounds a year, whereas the average smelter\r\nproduces three or four times as much blister or casting copper, and\r\nthe average electrolytic refinery can produce over 250,000,000 pounds\r\nannually. Consequently, there are only six groups (Hayden-Jackling,\r\nMorgan-Guggenheim, Rockefeller-Ryan, Phelps-Dodge, Calumet & Hecla,\r\nand U. S. Smelting, Refining & Mining Co.) interested in refinery\r\nownership. No small producer has the capital or the size to be able to\r\nenter this field.

A\r\ncopper producer must obtain electrolytic refining in order to market\r\nhis product. Lake copper and casting copper do not require electrolytic\r\nrefining, although producers of casting are often at a disadvantage\r\nwhen there is a big premium on electrolytic copper and casting can only\r\nbe sold at a large discount.\r\n\r\nThe smelters do not control the situation in the same way. In the\r\nUnited States are a large number of custom smelters--32--that actively\r\ncompete for ores; some have many branches. Moreover, a mine of any\r\nsize will have its own smelter, as the capital investment is far less\r\nthan that required for an electrolytic refinery. As the table shows,\r\nthere are only seven groups (the six above enumerated and the Balbach\r\nSmelting & Refining Co.) interested in electrolytic refining, and one\r\nof these (the smallest) is to a considerable degree interested in the\r\ntreatment of secondary or scrap copper.\r\n\r\nThe electrolytic refinery control of the copper production of the\r\nUnited States is shown by the 1917 figures. In that year the production\r\nof electrolytic copper was 1,452,744,593 pounds; of Lake copper, 238,\r\n508,091 pounds; and of casting copper, 152,293,487 pounds. Electrolytic\r\ncopper thus constituted 77¹⁄₂ per cent. of the total.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Control Through Selling and Distribution of Copper in Finished\r\nForm._--Groups owning mines, smelters, and refineries invariably also\r\ncontrol or own the selling agencies that distribute the product to\r\nthe consumer. In these cases, control through selling is the same as\r\ncontrol through mine ownership, but is increased by the copper in ores\r\nreceived at custom smelters.\r\n\r\nControl through selling, then, is identical to the control shown in\r\nTable 38, so far as groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 are concerned, if certain\r\nadditions at the expense of the other groups are made. But every\r\nproducer of Lake copper controls the sale of its product, because Lake\r\ncopper needs no electrolytic refining. Hence in groups 5 and 9 mine\r\nownership and control through selling are identical. This is a fact of\r\nconsiderable interest and confirms the fact of control through refinery\r\nownership. Groups 6 and 7 (Table 38) are large producers, and although\r\nthey do not own refineries they are able to control the sales of their\r\nproduct. The refineries are willing to refine their copper on toll and\r\nreturn the marketable copper to the mine owners, who make sale to the\r\ntrade. Groups 2, 3, and 7 now control copper even further, as they own\r\nbrass mills, wire and rod mills, etc. They manufacture a part of their\r\nproduction and sell it as copper wire, finished brass, etc., instead of\r\nmaking sales to the brass and wire mills of ingots, bars, cakes, etc.,\r\nwhich is and has been always the general practice.\r\n\r\nThere remains to consider the control, through selling, of the six\r\nuncertain groups (total production 63,820,173 pounds) and some of the\r\n134,458,614 pounds of copper produced from custom ore. A large part of\r\nthis, as noted, is lodged in groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8.\r\n\r\nFor many years three concerns affiliated with the German metal combines\r\n(Merton Co. and Metallgesellschaft, of Frankfort-on-the-Main, and\r\nAaron Hirsch, of Halberstadt) have been active in the copper business\r\nof the United States. Their activity has been confined to selling\r\nof copper produced in this country, and to ownership and selling of\r\ncopper produced in foreign countries but brought to the United States\r\nfor smelting and refining. One small refinery is or was owned by this\r\ngroup in the United States, and two smelters, treating mainly foreign\r\nores. It also owns smelters in Mexico and South America, and had close\r\nconnections with two large refineries in New Jersey, so that it sold\r\nall the electrolytic copper produced by one plant and an important part\r\nof the production of the other plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_German Control of American Copper._--The exact German ownership of\r\nthese concerns was disclosed during the war by the work of the Alien\r\nProperty Custodian, and was as follows: (1) American Metal Co., with an\r\nissued capital of $7,000,000, of which the German holdings amounted to\r\n$3,336,000, or close to 50 per cent.; these holdings were taken over\r\nby the United States authorities; (2) L. Vogelstein & Co., of which 80\r\nper cent. of the stock was held by Germans (A. Hirsch & Sohn) and 15\r\nper cent. by L. Vogelstein, a naturalized American citizen; (3) Beer,\r\nSondheimer & Co., entirely German owned. The government seized the two\r\nlast-named concerns.\r\n\r\nThe _American Metal Co._ markets the copper of the Old Dominion, East\r\nButte, Shannon, Penn. Mining Co. and Ducktown Sulphur, Coal & Iron\r\ncompanies. Blister copper 99 per cent. pure is purchased on contract\r\nfrom the first-named four companies by the American Metal Co. This\r\ncopper is refined for the American Metal Co. by the Nichols Copper Co.,\r\nand the finished product sold to the trade by the American Metal Co.\r\nThe Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Co. sells all of its production,\r\nas copper matte, to the American Metal Co., which has it treated and\r\nsells the finished product. In this manner 58,820,173 pounds was\r\ncontrolled through sale by the American Metal Co. in 1917. In addition,\r\nconsiderable domestic custom ore and a large amount of copper imported\r\nfrom Canada (Granby), South America and Mexico is handled by the\r\nAmerican Metal Co. in the same way. Such imported copper totals up to\r\nthree times as much as the domestic copper so controlled.\r\n\r\nSo far as domestic copper is concerned this situation will be\r\ncorrected. The Nichols Copper Co. is free to refine this copper and\r\nsell it or turn it back to the producers for sale; it does this latter\r\nfor Phelps-Dodge and Miami. It can be assumed that control through\r\nselling will cease as regards the 58,820,173 pounds cited above and\r\nalso as regards Granby’s production--about 50,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe American Metal Co. may be sold to American interests,[115] thus\r\nclearing up the situation in imported copper to some extent. Certain\r\nMexican and Chilean properties owned by the American Metal Co. will\r\nperhaps not be sold, and such properties can be considered as likely\r\nalways to be German owned.\r\n\r\n  [115] The German holdings in the American Metal Co. are reported sold\r\n  to an American syndicate in which L. Vogelstein participated.\r\n\r\nThe American Metal Co. owns the Balbach electrolytic refinery, and from\r\ntreatment of scrap and imported copper (Chilean and Japanese blister\r\nand copper) at that plant obtains and sells about 50,000,000 pounds of\r\nrefined copper per annum.\r\n\r\nThe concern of _L. Vogelstein & Co._ lost its chief hold on American\r\ncopper production in 1915. Up to that time L. Vogelstein & Co. worked\r\nvery closely with group 8 (United States Smelting, Refining & Mining\r\nCo.). The output of the United States Smelting Refining & Mining Co.\r\nmines and smelters was sold by Vogelstein as well as the output of its\r\nelectrolytic refinery. But since 1915 this American-owned enterprise\r\nitself sells all the copper produced by its own mines and smelters.\r\n\r\nBut Vogelstein still controls the sale of the copper treated at the\r\nplant of the United States Metals Refining Co.,[116] over and above\r\nwhat is produced by the United States Smelting, Refining & Mining Co.\r\nfrom its own mines and smelters. This remaining copper consists in\r\npart of imported copper, and in part of the output of the Consolidated\r\nArizona Smelting Co., which is an American-owned enterprise. The output\r\nwas large in 1917 (about 20,000,000 pounds) but three-fourths of it was\r\nore from the United Verde Extension mine. The United Verde Extension\r\nhas since completed its own smelter and no longer turns over a part\r\nof its copper output to Vogelstein through the Consolidated Arizona\r\nSmelting Co. The output of United Verde (group 6) also was formerly\r\nsold by Vogelstein, but now is sold by the owner of the mine.\r\n\r\n  [116] The United States Metals Refining Co. was a subsidiary of the\r\n  United States Smelting, Refining & Mining Co., sold, 1920, to the\r\n  American Metal Co.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the only copper controlled in 1918 by Vogelstein through\r\nselling was about 50,000,000 pounds a year, the output of mines owned\r\nby Consolidated Arizona Smelting Co. (about 5,000,000 pounds) and\r\nthe imported copper, of which about 45,000,000 pounds was treated in\r\n1917. The latter is controlled by Vogelstein not only by selling of\r\nthe product but in part by smelting contracts and in part probably, as\r\nregards South America, by ownership of mines.[117]\r\n\r\n  [117] L. Vogelstein is reported to have sold his interests to the\r\n  American Metal Co. and subsequently, early in 1920, to have acquired\r\n  a fifth interest in that company.\r\n\r\n_Beer, Sondheimer & Co._ has never been a large factor in the United\r\nStates copper industry, although much interested in zinc. But the firm\r\ndoes control the sale of some copper and owns a smelter at Norfolk.\r\nThis smelter treats imported ores for the most part, but also obtains\r\nsome copper from pyrites (sulphur ores) coming from the United States\r\nand Canada. Perhaps as much as 10,000,000 pounds of domestic copper was\r\nsold by Beer, Sondheimer & Co. in 1917. The company owns an important\r\nCuban mine.\r\n\r\nAs American capital owns American copper mines, smelters and\r\nrefineries, German interests were able to obtain a foothold only\r\nthrough selling organizations (trading in metals), which later they\r\nextended to close working arrangements with electrolytic refineries,\r\nwhich were naturally interested in finding a good cash market for their\r\noutput. The fact that Germany prior to 1914 was the biggest foreign\r\nbuyer of United States copper, made easy the successful development of\r\nthe carefully laid German plans.\r\n\r\nIn the future such plans can be guarded against by encouraging copper\r\nproducers to sell their own output. All the large producers already\r\ndo this, a change in this respect having developed since 1914. Sales\r\nin foreign markets can now be properly managed under the provisions\r\nof recent legislation permitting copper producers to enter into a\r\ncombination in the sale of export copper. This counteracts the old\r\nGerman system of a buyers’ combine against the sellers of copper,\r\nwhich was an important factor in forcing American producers to have\r\nGerman concerns sell their product. But it will be necessary for the\r\nelectrolytic refineries to co-operate in this policy of American\r\nselling control of American copper. Producers whose output is only\r\na few million pounds per annum probably cannot afford to establish\r\ntheir own selling agencies; such producers will include all who have\r\nno smelter but ship to custom smelting plants. The production can be\r\nsold by the large custom smelting plants, which are American owned,\r\nor these small producers could establish a common sales agency. Other\r\nlarger producers, as those whose copper is now sold by the American\r\nMetal Co., should be enabled to do their own selling. In this they have\r\nbeen blocked by the lack of refining facilities, except on a basis that\r\ntook away from them selling control of their product. This situation\r\ncan be corrected by regulations that put electrolytic refineries on a\r\nrecognized toll basis for all American customers. All refineries have\r\nabout the same costs and their combined capacity is ample to treat all\r\nthe blister copper that will be produced. They should receive good\r\nprofits on the business, but it should be unlawful for refineries to\r\nrefuse to treat blister copper on toll and insist that copper must be\r\nsold to them outright. The toll system is already in use at several\r\nrefineries and has proved satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAs shown above, there are in the United States a few very large\r\nrefineries whose ownership is in few hands. If these refineries control\r\nthe sale of all the production of copper several objectionable features\r\ndevelop. The few sales agencies handle so much copper that there is a\r\ntendency to co-operate with representatives of foreign consumers who\r\ncan buy in large quantities, and it is not difficult to manipulate the\r\nmarket temporarily, in disregard of actual conditions of demand and\r\nsupply. Thus the entire output of copper, one of our great natural\r\nresources, is placed in the hands of groups who, while interested\r\nin mining, are more interested in refining. The best interests of\r\nthe industry are more nearly those of the miner than of the refiner.\r\nTherefore, the most positive dislodgment of former German control of\r\ncopper through selling will come from the breaking up of the former\r\nsystem and transferring each unit of that system to other hands; rather\r\nthan transferring the old units in block to non-German hands. Sales\r\nof American copper should be handled by a large number of separate\r\nagencies actively competing for the domestic market; this is essential\r\nin the interests of the consumer and of the country. But export\r\ncopper business should be handled through one agency or association\r\nrepresenting all the sales agencies, as is now legal, and this should\r\nbe done in the interests of the producer and of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Reserves of United States Copper Mines.=--The developed reserves of\r\nUnited States copper deposits are fully equal, in proportion to output,\r\nto such reserves in foreign copper deposits. This insures the fact that\r\nfor the next ten years, at least, the copper production of the United\r\nStates will maintain its present relative dominance over all foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of all copper deposits are of such a deep-seated\r\ncharacter that at no time can large reserves be positively developed,\r\neven when they exist. On the other hand, all over the world the mines\r\nwith large known reserves are horizontal deposits, lying near the\r\nsurface, because only in such occurrences is it possible to block out\r\neasily and cheaply big tonnages of ore. There are in the United States\r\nsix very important deposits of this type, the so-called “porphyries.”\r\nThese are:\r\n\r\nTABLE 40.--“PORPHYRY” COPPER MINES IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------+-----------+----------\r\n                             |           | Years of\r\n                             |           | life at\r\n                             |   Reserves| present\r\n               Mine          |    (tons) |production\r\n  ---------------------------+-----------+----------\r\n  Utah Copper Co.            |200,000,000|    31\r\n  Ray Consolidated Copper Co.| 90,000,000|    30\r\n  Chino Copper Co.           | 80,000,000|    27\r\n  Inspiration Consolidated   |120,000,000|    20\r\n  Nevada Consolidated        | 80,000,000|    20\r\n  Miami Copper Co.           | 50,000,000|    20\r\n                             +-----------+----------\r\n      Total                  |620,000,000|    26\r\n  ---------------------------+-----------+----------\r\n\r\nThese mines in 1917 produced 31.5 per cent. of the total United States\r\noutput.\r\n\r\nThe New Cornelia mine is of similar type and has already developed\r\n75,000,000 tons, but as it is new its 1917 output was small. The\r\nArizona Copper Co., Ltd., is also of this type, as are certain new\r\ndevelopments in the Phelps-Dodge properties.\r\n\r\nThese “porphyry” deposits occur in or near intrusive igneous rocks of\r\nvarious ages. Fully one-third of the United States production is now\r\nand will continue to be obtained from such deposits. On the average,\r\nabout 1 per cent. copper is recovered from the ore.\r\n\r\nDistinct from the shallow and horizontal-lying disseminated ores\r\nor “porphyry coppers,” are the deep mines. The two oldest and most\r\nimportant deep-mine districts in the United States are Butte, Montana,\r\nand the Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan. The mines of Butte work steeply\r\ndipping veins. It cannot be considered that over five years of ore\r\nreserves are known, and probably not over 2¹⁄₂ years of reserves are\r\nactually blocked out on three sides. However, there are no indications\r\nof early exhaustion, as the veins are profitable at more than 3,000\r\nfeet, the greatest depth to which mining has yet progressed. The\r\ndeposits of northern Michigan are in pre-Cambrian rocks. They have been\r\nimportant producers of copper for over 50 years, and several mines\r\nhave reached a vertical depth of more than 5,000 feet. Certainly not\r\nover five years of ore reserves are fully developed, but there are no\r\nsigns of early exhaustion. These two districts, Butte and Michigan, now\r\nproduce about 30 per cent. of the total United States output, a smaller\r\nproportion than before the development of the “porphyries.” The average\r\ncopper content of the Michigan deposits ranges from 0.5 per cent. to 2\r\nper cent. and of the Butte deposits 2.5 to 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nCertain ore deposits (usually massive but irregular) which are situated\r\nmainly in Arizona constitute the third important general class. These\r\ndeposits produce about one-quarter of the total United States output.\r\nBisbee, Jerome and Globe (Arizona), and Kennecott (Alaska), are the\r\nmain localities. Owing to the irregular nature of the deposits and the\r\ndistance from the surface at which the ore is found, large developed\r\nreserves cannot be blocked out in advance. Such reserves are assumed to\r\nbe five years.\r\n\r\nApart from the three classes of deposits described above are many\r\nsmaller deposits, of which the most distinct class are the pyritic\r\nbodies, notably those of Tennessee and California. Such deposits are\r\noften profitable even when of low grade, because the sulphur as well as\r\nthe copper is recovered. Reserves in such deposits are large: equal,\r\nsay, to ten years’ life. Deposits of this class are important in Spain,\r\nNorway and in part in Japan. Mines producing copper as a by-product\r\nshould also be grouped here.\r\n\r\nFrom the above outline the table below has been compiled:\r\n\r\nTABLE 41.--DEVELOPED RESERVES OF UNITED STATES COPPER MINES\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------+----------+--------+-----------\r\n                                      |Percentage|        |\r\n                                      |    of    |        |\r\n                                      |   total  |Years of|Extension\r\n           General group              |  output  |  life  |  [118]\r\n  ------------------------------------+----------+--------+-----------\r\n  The “porphyries”                    |    35    |  26    |  9.10\r\n  Deep mines                          |    30    |   5    |  1.50\r\n  Rich ore bodies (Arizona and Alaska)|    25    |   5    |  1.25\r\n  Pyritic ore bodies                  |     5    |  10    |  0.50\r\n  Others                              |     5    |   2    |  0.10\r\n                                      +----------+--------+-----------\r\n    Average                           |   100    |  12.4  | 12.45\r\n  ------------------------------------+----------+--------+-----------\r\n\r\n  [118] “Extension” is the Percentage of Total Output multiplied by the\r\n  Years of Life, giving the relative importance of each group.\r\n\r\nThe known ore reserves serve as a basis for the assumption that the\r\nproduction of copper in the United States will continue at the present\r\nfigures for at least ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADA\r\n\r\nCanadian copper-producing properties are entirely controlled by\r\nAmerican and British capital in about equal proportion, changes\r\ninvolving construction of new refineries and a shift in selling\r\ncontrol being assumed to be already effective. Up to the present time\r\nthe natural development has been for Canada to depend largely on the\r\nUnited States for refining facilities. It is likely that in the future\r\nlocal or English control in this field will be closer than heretofore,\r\nalthough the Canadian copper industry will always be closely identified\r\nwith that of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere are three chief copper properties in Canada which are controlled\r\nby United States capital, all in British Columbia, as well as several\r\nsmall mines in this province and in others. By far the largest is the\r\nGranby Consolidated Mining, Smelting & Power Co. This company has\r\nmines in two districts. One of these properties is nearly exhausted;\r\nthe other is a new and vigorous producer. Smelters are operated at\r\neach place. The Granby company is controlled by the same interests\r\nthat own the Nichols Copper Co. (electrolytic refinery). Considerable\r\ncustom ore is treated by Granby, a large amount coming from Alaska.\r\nThe other two mines are those of the Canada Copper Co. and the Howe\r\nSound Co. Their production is refined and sold in the United States by\r\nAmerican concerns. The developed reserves at these three mines are all\r\nlarge, being fully adequate for fifteen years at the present rate of\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nThe only property in Canada which has established facilities for\r\nproducing copper ready for the consumer is the Consolidated Mining &\r\nSmelting Co., of Trial, B. C. This Canadian company owns and operates\r\nits own mines, smelter and electrolytic refinery. The capacity of the\r\nrefinery is now 14,000,000 pounds refined copper annually. The ores\r\nare massive pyritic bodies without great developed reserves, but the\r\nprobable reserves are large.\r\n\r\nThe English and American properties at Sudbury yield nearly as much\r\ncopper as the Granby company, although their main business is nickel\r\nproduction. A small part of the output is refined in Wales, producing\r\ncopper sulphate; but the largest part has been refined in New Jersey.\r\nA refinery is being completed in Canada that will treat these\r\ncopper-nickel mattes and produce refined copper. These copper-nickel\r\ndeposits occur in pre-Cambrian rocks, and the known or potential\r\nreserves are very large. They are described in more detail in Chapter\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nIn Ontario and Quebec there are a number of pyrite mines where some of\r\nthe pyrite contains considerable copper. Most of the pyrite is shipped\r\nto the United States, where the copper is recovered, refined and sold.\r\n\r\nThe production of Canada is growing, and the country will become\r\nof increasing importance as a source of copper. Known reserves are\r\nlarger in proportion to output than in the United States and there\r\nwill probably be important developments of new districts. The northern\r\nBritish Columbia region is of exceptional promise.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUBA AND THE CARIBBEAN\r\n\r\nThe copper output of Cuba has increased in an extraordinary degree\r\nduring the past few years, but there are no indications that this\r\nincrease will continue. Two mines are responsible for nearly all the\r\nproduction. One is an old mine near Santiago, the El Cobre, which\r\nyielded about one-quarter of the total output. It is owned by the\r\nGerman metal combine, which ships the ore and concentrates to Norfolk,\r\nwhere they are treated by the smelter owned by Beer, Sondheimer &\r\nCo., who have always marketed the production. The Matahambre mine,\r\nin Pinar del Rio Province, yields nearly the entire remaining Cuban\r\noutput; it is owned by Cubans. Ore is shipped to the United States\r\nSmelting, Refining & Mining Co., of New York, and is believed to be\r\nsold by L. Vogelstein & Co. The reserves of copper ore in Cuba can\r\nnot be considered large. Statistics of Cuban output are conflicting:\r\nproducers’ reports, statistical authorities and United States commerce\r\nreports not being in agreement. All production is shipped in crude form\r\nto the United States for refining.\r\n\r\nThere are copper deposits in Central America,[119] and at one or two\r\npoints in the West Indies outside of Cuba. To date production has been\r\ninsignificant, although future possibilities are considerable.\r\n\r\n  [119] The Rosita mine, in Nicaragua, has 1,500,000 tons of ore\r\n  blocked out, running over 5 per cent. copper. It has not been\r\n  equipped.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEXICO\r\n\r\nThe future importance of Mexico as a producer of copper or of other\r\nmetals will be determined not only by the character of her natural\r\ndeposits but by political conditions. The latter have materially\r\ndecreased the output during the past few years, so that in 1917\r\nproduction was about 100,000,000 pounds, probably not much over half\r\nwhat it would have been had normal conditions been continuous since\r\n1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Commercial Control.=--Three companies now produce about three-fourths\r\nof the total copper. Two of these are owned by _American capital_\r\nand their product is refined and sold in the United States. Situated\r\nnear the Arizona border, they have not suffered from the revolution\r\nas much as the properties farther south. These two companies are the\r\nGreene Cananea Copper Co. (Ryan-Rockefeller, group 3 of Table 38) and\r\nMontezuma Copper Co. (Phelps-Dodge, etc.; group 4 of Table 38). The\r\ndeveloped reserves at the Montezuma Copper Co. are equivalent to five\r\nyears at present production and those at Cananea can be considered\r\nabout the same. Both districts have important possibilities. Near\r\nGreene Cananea is another American property, Democrata Cananea, which\r\nis a producer of moderate size. The Cananea district is now producing\r\nat the rate of over 50,000,000 pounds per annum. Another American\r\nproperty of note is the Teziutlan Copper Co., Puebla, now idle due to\r\nrevolutions. It has a smelter which normally ships 12,000,000 pounds of\r\nblister copper annually to the Anaconda company’s electrolytic plant.\r\nConsiderable copper is produced at the plants of the American Smelting\r\n& Refining Co., which has three copper smelters, one at Matehuala, San\r\nLuis Potosi; one at Asarco and another at Aguascalientes, Durango.\r\n\r\n_French capital_ controls the third important property (among the\r\nthree most important in Mexico), which is on the peninsula of Lower\r\nCalifornia. This is the Boleo, owned by the Rothschilds; as it is far\r\nremoved from the heart of Mexico, operations have not been greatly\r\ndisturbed. The mine is an old producer with large potential reserves,\r\nand the actual developed reserves will maintain present output for\r\nsix years. The Boleo ore deposits, which are of an uncommon type, are\r\nTertiary sediments that contain 3.5 per cent. copper ore, usually as\r\noxides. Smelters near the mine produce blister copper and matte, which\r\nnormally is shipped to France. During the war a large part of the\r\nblister and matte came to the United States and passed into the hands\r\nof the American Smelting & Refining Co. French interests also own the\r\nCompagnie d’Inguaran, near Ario, Michoacan. There are large developed\r\nreserves, but the property is idle because of political conditions and\r\nabsence of equipment or rail connections. French capital also controls\r\nthe Magistral Ameca Co., in Jalisco, where large ore reserves have been\r\ndeveloped. This property is also idle due to political conditions.\r\n\r\n_English capital_ controls the Mazapil Copper Co., which has large\r\nplants, including smelters, in Zacatecas and Coahuila. This is one of\r\nthe largest copper companies in Mexico as well as one of the oldest\r\nimportant mines. It was idle for some time because of the Mexican\r\nrevolutions, but has been reopened recently.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the production in Mexico at present is three-quarters\r\nAmerican controlled (of which one-half may be assigned to group 3 and\r\none-quarter to groups 2 and 4), while the remaining one-quarter is\r\nFrench controlled. But present output and known reserves give no true\r\npicture of future possibilities. Mexico can become of first importance\r\nas a copper producer, ranking possibly second only to the United States\r\nor equaling Chile and Japan among the world’s producers. The natural\r\nresources are there and in the future will surely be developed much\r\nmore extensively than ever before.\r\n\r\n_German capital_ must be taken into consideration, and especially the\r\nactivities of the American Metal Co. in Mexico, notably more vigorous\r\nsince 1914 than before. It is believed that the company has made\r\nsubstantial profits from Mexican mining investments in this period\r\nand has obtained a very strong foothold. The Compañia Metallurgica de\r\nTorreon is one of the American Metal Co. subsidiaries, owning promising\r\nmines, chiefly in the development state, and smelters already equipped\r\nto produce 20,000,000 pounds of copper yearly. The Mapimi smelter is\r\nalso owned by the American Metal Co., as are many other companies. What\r\nis the future Mexican political situation to be and what part will the\r\nAmerican Metal Co. or the German metal combine play in the Mexican\r\ncopper industry? There is no more pertinent question in the entire\r\nfield of the political and commercial control of the copper resources\r\nof the world, particularly as American capital is largely interested\r\nin Mexican copper mines and has made enormous investments there. Also\r\nthe natural tendency is for most of the Mexican copper to be shipped\r\nto the United States for refining and marketing. American refineries,\r\nwith cheap fuel and efficient methods, are the natural destination for\r\nMexican raw copper.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICA\r\n\r\nSouth America is the second largest copper-producing continent of\r\nthe world, but at present stands far behind North America. The\r\ncopper-producing countries of South America, in the order of their\r\nimportance, are Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela and Argentina.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILE\r\n\r\nChile is a copper producer of rapidly increasing importance, as\r\nindicated by production records of recent years.[120]\r\n\r\n  [120] According to Chilean statistics, and estimate for 1917.\r\n\r\n                1914    1915    1916    1917\r\n  Metric tons  44,665  52,341  71,288  95,000\r\n\r\nThe largest mines of Chile are controlled by _American capital_. Group\r\n2 of Table 38 (the Morgan-Guggenheim interests) controls the Chile\r\nCopper Co., Braden Copper Co. and the Caldera and Carrizal custom\r\nsmelters. The developed ore reserves of the Chile Copper Co. are the\r\nlargest in any known copper deposits in the world and the reserves\r\nof Braden are among the largest known. Group 3 of Table 38 (Anaconda\r\nCopper Co.) has a property with large developed ore reserves--the Andes\r\nCopper Co. This mine is not yet (1918) producing.\r\n\r\nTable 43 (p. 243) gives data concerning these American-owned mines.\r\n\r\nThese three mines are allied to the “porphyries” of the United States\r\nin character, but they are less profitable because the external\r\nconditions make operation more difficult.\r\n\r\nTABLE 42.--CHIEF COPPER PRODUCERS OF CHILE.

The\r\nCarrizal plant has been closed. Two chief properties are tributary to\r\nthis plant,--the Carrizal Alto and the Astilla mines. A large number of\r\nproperties are tributary to the Caldera plant, among them: Dulcinea,\r\nFlamenco, Morado, San Juan, El Gallo, etc. Throughout northern Chile\r\nthere are a great many small copper mines. From the Braden property\r\neast of Valparaiso to the Chili Copper Co., southeast of Iquique, the\r\nentire country seems to be unusually rich in copper.\r\n\r\nThere are five important Chilean mines controlled by _French or British\r\ncapital_. See Table 42. All are vein mines with no considerable tonnage\r\nof developed ore reserves, and the combined output is nearly 50,000,000\r\npounds of copper a year (a considerable part being from custom\r\nore shipped by small mines) in the form of blister or matte. This\r\nproduction is normally shipped to France or England.\r\n\r\nThe American Metal Co. and L. Vogelstein, representing _German\r\ncapital_, are believed to control, through selling and refining, much\r\nof the output of the French, British and Belgian mines. These concerns\r\nalso own custom smelters in Chile and probably have interests in many\r\nmining properties there. The big business in Chilean ores shipped into\r\nthe United States is done by these concerns, although the American\r\nSmelting, Refining & Mining Co. is also an important factor. These\r\nores come from many small mines, although there are a few important\r\nore shippers, one of which is British owned. Most of the mines are\r\nostensibly Chilean owned, but much of the financing, marketing of\r\nproducts, etc., is done by American houses with German affiliations.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Chile may soon become the second largest copper producer\r\nof the world. American capital has led in the development of the\r\nChilean deposits, as American interests have discovered and furnished\r\nfunds for the equipment of the two leading producers, and the third\r\nmost important ore body is American owned. This is the more remarkable\r\nin light of the fact that American capital has so far been conspicuous\r\nby its absence in the development of the other important industries of\r\nChile. Were it not for the present difficulties of building up plant\r\nfacilities, due to shipping shortage, high cost of equipment, etc.,\r\nthe American-owned copper mines would today be still larger producers\r\nthan they are. However, American capital now completely controls\r\nabout seven-eighths of the total output. Substantially all the copper\r\nproduced in Chile is shipped to the United States. The Chili Copper Co.\r\nproduces in Chile a refined electrolytic copper, and this is the only\r\nfinished refined copper produced in South America. Braden can produce a\r\ngrade of copper that does not compete with electrolytic but is refined\r\nenough to go directly to the consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERU\r\n\r\nPeru is one of the important copper-producing countries of the world.\r\nThe chief mines are at extreme altitudes, however, and their character\r\nand location is such as to indicate that production will probably\r\nremain stationary or at least not show any important increases in the\r\nnext few years. There are two important districts: Cerro de Pasco\r\n(elevation, 14,300 feet) and Morococha (elevation 13,700 feet).\r\n\r\nThe chief mines of these districts are now controlled by American\r\ncapital and may be classed with group 2 of Table 38. The Morococha\r\ndistrict was formerly English controlled, but the majority interests\r\nhave lately been acquired by the Cerro de Pasco Copper Co. (American).\r\nThe ores in both districts are exceedingly rich and the properties\r\nare well fortified with reserves. Developed reserves are adequate\r\nto insure four years’ production, and everything indicates that the\r\nmines are working extensive and persistent ore deposits. Blister\r\ncopper is shipped to the American Smelting & Refining Co. in New York\r\nfor treatment and marketing. Both mines have fully equipped plants,\r\nincluding smelters.\r\n\r\nAt the plant of Backus & Johnson Co., Morococha, some custom ore and\r\nmatte from locally owned mines is treated. Among these mines are those\r\nof J. Galliver, producing 600 tons matte a year. Backus & Johnson also\r\nhave a smelter and mines in the Casapalca district. The Sayapullo\r\nSyndicate (English) is working the Sayapullo mine under option from\r\nthe Peruvian owners. Some of this matte is shipped to the Casapalca\r\nsmelter, and the rest is exported to the United States. The output so\r\nfar is small; at present 800 tons per year.\r\n\r\nCertain small companies ship ores to the United States: from these the\r\ncopper content amounted to about 4,000,000 pounds in 1917. This goes\r\n(1919) chiefly to the American Metal Co. and L. Vogelstein for refining\r\nand selling. This ore comes from Salaverry and Trujillo (Casapalca\r\ndistrict), Mollendo (southern district, including Ferrobamba, see\r\nbelow), and Callao. All the blister copper is shipped from Callao\r\nexcept small amounts shipped by Backus & Johnson from the Casapalca\r\ndistrict. An American company has developed a large body of low-grade\r\nore at Ferrobamba (Cotobamba Province), southern Peru. The property is\r\ninaccessible and no work is now being done.\r\n\r\nThe following résumé gives some of the salient facts concerning the\r\nPeruvian copper producers:\r\n\r\nTABLE 44.--PRODUCTION OF COPPER IN PERU IN 1918\r\n\r\n  ----------------+--------------+---------+--------------+-------------\r\n                  |              |Developed|              |\r\n                  |    Output    | Reserves|    Product   |  Control\r\n  ----------------+--------------+---------+--------------+-------------\r\n  Cerro de Pasco  | 72,000,000(-)| 4 years |Blister Copper|United States\r\n  Backus & Johnson| 28,000,000(-)| 4 years |     Do       |     Do\r\n  Huaron (new)    |  5,000,000(?)| 4 years |     Do       |French\r\n  Ore shippers    |  5,000,000   |    ?    |Ore           |Local\r\n                  +--------------+         |              |\r\n                  |110,000,000   |         |              |\r\n  ----------------+--------------+---------+--------------+-------------\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLIVIA\r\n\r\nThere is one important copper producing locality in Bolivia--Coro Coro,\r\ncentral Bolivia (elevation 12,000 feet). Beds of sandstone carry native\r\ncopper and veins of sulphides. The mines are owned by French capital.\r\nThere is no smelter, but concentrates running up to 85 per cent. copper\r\nare exported to France for treatment. Production is about 12,000,000\r\npounds annually. Reserves are large, but the almost inaccessible\r\nlocation of the mines has retarded development. Recently, there has\r\nbeen more activity, a flotation concentrator having been installed.\r\n\r\nSome of the Bolivian tin and silver mines produce small amounts\r\nof copper, but outside of Coro Coro total copper production is\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENEZUELA\r\n\r\nThe Aroa Mines, an English syndicate, owns a copper mine and smelter\r\nproducing low-grade matte. The property is located along the railroad\r\nwhich terminates at the port of Tucacas. In 1917 the output was\r\n3,500,000 pounds. The product was shipped to the United States and\r\nrefined and sold there by L. Vogelstein & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGENTINA\r\n\r\nThere are some copper prospects in the extreme western portion of the\r\ncountry, which are really extensions from the Chilean copper-producing\r\nareas. One company, Famatina, Ltd., is an English concern which has had\r\nan unfortunate career. The company operates the only copper smelter\r\nin Argentina, a small affair that mines irregularly. At last accounts\r\na few hundred tons of blister copper was the annual output; this has\r\nalways been shipped to England, but recently attempts have been made\r\nto ship to New York. This blister is exceedingly rich in silver (6 per\r\ncent. silver).\r\n\r\n\r\nAFRICA\r\n\r\nAfrica is a copper producer of growing importance, almost entirely\r\nbecause of the development of one group of deposits (Katanga), which\r\novershadows all others to such an extent that the African situation\r\nis almost completely described by a discussion of the properties of\r\nthe Tanganyika Concession, Ltd. The mines of this company yield now\r\nthree-quarters of the copper production of Africa, and their importance\r\nin the future will be still greater.\r\n\r\nThe copper production of Africa comes from south of the Equator and\r\nfrom six general districts, as follows:\r\n\r\nTABLE 45.--COPPER PRODUCTION OF AFRICA\r\n\r\n(Production, pounds of fine copper)\r\n\r\n  -----+---------------------+------------+------------+\r\n       |                     |            |            |\r\n       |                     |            | 1918-1919, |\r\n   Dis-| Province and chief  |            | estimated  |\r\n  trict|       mines         | 1917 output|   output   |\r\n  -----+---------------------+------------+------------+\r\n    1. |_Congo_: Katanga[121]| 60,000,000 | 80,000,000 |\r\n       |Bwan M’Kubwa         |  4,000,000?|  3,000,000 |\r\n    2. |_Transvaal_: Messina | 14,000,000 | 12,000,000 |\r\n    3. |_Rhodesia_: Falcon   |  7,000,000 |  7,000,000 |\r\n    4. |_Cape Colony_:       |            |            |\r\n       |Cape Copper-Namaqua  |  7,000,000 |  6,000,000 |\r\n    5. |Former _German       |            |            |\r\n       |Southwest-Africa_:   |            |            |\r\n       |Tsumeb (Otavi)       | 10,000,000?| 15,000,000?|\r\n       |                     |    [122]   |            |\r\n       |                     |            |            |\r\n       |                     |            |            |\r\n       |Khan, etc.           |  2,000,000 |  4,000,000?|\r\n    6. |_Miscellaneous       |            |            |\r\n       |northern Africa_     |            |            |\r\n       |not specified        |  1,000,000?|  1,000,000?|\r\n       |                     +------------+------------+\r\n       |Total                |105,000,000 |128,000,000 |\r\n       |                     |            |            |\r\n  -----+---------------------+------------+------------+\r\n\r\n  -----+---------------------+------------------+---------------\r\n       |                     |                  |Reserves, years\r\n       |                     |     Control      |  of life at\r\n   Dis-| Province and chief  |                  |  this rate\r\n  trict|       mines         |                  |  of output\r\n  -----+---------------------+------------------+---------------\r\n    1. |_Congo_: Katanga[121]|English-Belgian   |      100\r\n       |Bwan M’Kubwa         |English           |     large\r\n    2. |_Transvaal_: Messina |English           |     1¹⁄₂\r\n    3. |_Rhodesia_: Falcon   |English           |       4\r\n    4. |_Cape Colony_:       |                  |\r\n       |Cape Copper-Namaqua  |English           |       2\r\n    5. |Former _German       |                  |\r\n       |Southwest-Africa_:   |                  |\r\n       |Tsumeb (Otavi)       |(English since    |       4\r\n       |                     |conquest of German|\r\n       |                     |Southwest         |\r\n       |                     |Africa)           |\r\n       |Khan, etc.           |                  |       4\r\n    6. |_Miscellaneous       |                  |\r\n       |northern Africa_     |                  |\r\n       |not specified        |French            |       ?\r\n       |                     +------------------+---------------\r\n       |Total                |Almost entirely   |\r\n       |                     |English           |\r\n  -----+---------------------+------------------+---------------\r\n\r\n  [121] Kanshanshi included in Katanga.\r\n\r\n  [122] Basis 1914. Present political conditions govern extent of work.\r\n  Shipped 1,000,000 pounds copper in ore to United States in 1917.\r\n\r\nIn District 1, the _Katanga_ district, which includes the Belgian Congo\r\nand adjacent territory, the Union Minière du Haut Katanga has acquired\r\nfrom the Belgian Special Committee the ownership of all of the Katanga\r\ncopper belt but not the Kanshanshi deposit in Rhodesia. Equal, but not\r\nthe entire, share interests of this company are owned by the Tanganyika\r\nConcessions, Ltd., and the Katanga (Belgian) Special Committee. The\r\nLubumbashi smelter of U. M. du Haut Katanga, at Elisabethville, close\r\nto the Rhodesian boundary, has seven blast furnaces with a daily\r\ncapacity of 2,000 tons. The ore treated runs 15 per cent. copper, and\r\nyields 96 per cent. blister copper. The past production is as follows:\r\n1911, 996 tons blister copper; 1912, 2,492 tons; 1913, 7,407 tons;\r\n1914, 10,722 tons; 1915, 14,190 tons; 1916, 22,165 tons; 1917, 30,000\r\ntons. This copper is shipped to England, and is consumed there and in\r\nFrance after further refining. There is very little gold and silver in\r\nthe copper, so it goes to market largely as refined, best selected and\r\ntough copper.\r\n\r\nTanganyika Concessions, Ltd., owns concessions in northern Rhodesia\r\ncontaining the Kanshanshi mine (a deposit similar to those in Katanga)\r\nowned by a subsidiary railroad company, 70 per cent. of which is\r\nowned by Tanganyika Concessions, Ltd. A small blast furnace there is\r\nproducing. The actual railroad connection with Katanga is north from\r\nRhodesia and thence to the eastern coast of Africa. An uncompleted line\r\nfrom the West Coast is planned to connect these mineral deposits with\r\nLobito Bay (Benguella By. Co.). The Portuguese government has a small\r\ninterest in certain railway lines in its territory. It seems that the\r\nEnglish group, (R. Williams, who was an associate of Cecil Rhodes,\r\nT. White and others) with the Belgian Special Committee, control the\r\nentire group; but a considerable interest has been sold to the public,\r\nmainly British and Belgian investors.\r\n\r\nThe Bwan M’Kubwa mine farther south on the Rhodesia railroad is a\r\ndeposit of the same general character. This is owned by British\r\ncapital, two of the Rhodesian development companies holding a large\r\nblock of the stock.\r\n\r\nOre bodies are found in Katanga over a district extending 250 miles\r\neast-west and 50 miles north-south, and also at scattered localities in\r\nRhodesia. Malachite chiefly and other oxidized ores impregnate certain\r\nsediments and constitute the ore bodies, which are very rich (10 to\r\n15 per cent. copper). At Luushia sulphides (3 per cent. copper as\r\nchalcopyrite) occur beneath the oxidized ore. Cobalt is common; there\r\nis some nickel but not much gold and silver. The developed reserves\r\nof the mines of Katanga are estimated at 40,000,000 tons of 8 per\r\ncent. copper ore above water level, equal to 100 years’ production at\r\nthe present rate of output; of the Bwan M’Kubwa mine in Rhodesia at\r\n3,000,000 tons of 4 per cent. ore, besides ore of lesser grade. The\r\nreserves of the Kanshanshi mine, in Rhodesia, are not included in the\r\nestimates.\r\n\r\nIn District 2, near the Rhodesian boundary, is the Messina mine, the\r\nonly copper producer of the _Transvaal_. Along veins in very old\r\ngneissic rocks occur shoots and lenses of chalcocite and enargite with\r\nsome oxide. A little matte is made at the mine but the chief product is\r\nconcentrates (45 to 50 per cent. copper), all of which were shipped to\r\nEngland. Lately they have been in part sent to the United States. The\r\nproduction was about 14,000,000 pounds in 1915 and the same in 1916.\r\nReserves of 208,000 tons of 5 per cent. ore are reported developed, or\r\nnot much over one year’s supply. The company is strictly English.\r\n\r\nIn District 3, the Falcon mines in _Central Rhodesia_ belong to an\r\nEnglish company which is treating copper-gold ore occurring in old\r\nschists. The production was about 7,000,000 pounds in 1916. The ore\r\ncarries 2 per cent. copper, $5 in gold, and the reserves are stated at\r\n862,000 tons of this grade, or about four years’ supply.\r\n\r\nIn the _French Congo_, just north of the mouth of Congo River, is a\r\nbelt of copper deposits 60 miles long, which have been worked for\r\ncenturies by the natives. Diabase rocks occur in this vicinity. The\r\noutput is very small.\r\n\r\nDistrict 4, _Cape Colony_, is the oldest important copper producer of\r\nmodern Africa, but its chief deposits, worked since 1852, are nearly\r\nexhausted. The Cape Copper Co. and Namaqua Copper Co. are south of the\r\nOrange River in a district 90 miles by rail from a port on the West\r\nCoast. The ore is bornite and chalcopyrite, in irregular lenses; the\r\nreserves are equivalent to only two years of production. Each mine\r\nhas a mill and smelter. Further refining is done at the Briton Ferry\r\nsmelter of the Cape Copper Co. in Wales, which has a capacity of 12,000\r\ntons per year of refined copper and electrolytic copper. All these\r\ncompanies, including the railroad, are entirely British. Cape Colony\r\ncopper production is dependent on this one district, from which the\r\n1917 output was 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nIn District 5, the former colony of _German Southwest Africa_, copper\r\ndeposits are numerous, and next to diamond mining the production\r\nof copper is the most important industry of the province. The main\r\ndeposit is the Tsumeb in the northeast part of the country, where solid\r\nsulphides of lead and copper occur in dolomite. Fifty thousand tons\r\nof ore carrying 13 per cent. copper and 40 per cent. lead was shipped\r\nin 1917. There is a smelter here and the mine has rail connection.\r\nThe company working these deposits was the Otavi Minen und Eisenbahn,\r\nbut through the Southwest Africa Co. the English had an interest in\r\nthe property. The English now have control. The Khan mine, second\r\nin importance to Tsumeb, is working a pegmatite vein in schist. In\r\n1914 a mill treating 50 tons a day was shipping 60 to 70 per cent.\r\nconcentrates to Europe. The ores are chalcopyrite and chalcocite.\r\n\r\nIn District 6, _northern Africa_, there are some deposits of copper in\r\nAlgeria, Egypt, and Morocco. They are not of importance at present.\r\nDe Launay describes them as chiefly veins in rocks of much younger age\r\nthan the important deposits of Africa which lie south of the Equator.\r\n\r\nMatte and blister produced in Africa are normally treated at small\r\nEnglish plants or at the Briton Ferry smelter, Wales, which is a plant\r\nof some size.\r\n\r\nThe general economic situation as regards African copper ores in 1917\r\nis shown in the table.\r\n\r\nTABLE 46.--PRODUCTION AND SHIPMENTS OF COPPER FROM AFRICA IN 1917\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-----------+--------------------+--------------\r\n                     |Production,|   Chief product    | Shipped to--\r\n          Mine       | (pounds)  |     shipped        |\r\n  -------------------+-----------+--------------------+--------------\r\n  Katanga            | 60,000,000|matte and blister   |England\r\n  Cape Copper-Namaqua|  7,000,000|matte               |England\r\n  Messina            | 14,000,000|concentrates, matte,|\r\n                     |           |  hand-picked ore   |England\r\n  Falcon             |  7,000,000|concentrates or ore |England\r\n  Bwan M’Kubwa       |  4,000,000|                    |Katanga plants\r\n  German Southwest   |           |                    |\r\n  Africa, Otavi,     |           |                    |\r\n  Khan               | 12,000,000|ore                 |England or\r\n                     |           |                    |Germany\r\n  North Africa       |  1,000,000|ore                 |France\r\n                     +-----------+                    |\r\n                     |105,000,000|                    |\r\n  -------------------+-----------+--------------------+--------------\r\n\r\nConsiderable of this copper goes to the United States.

In recent years\r\nthe production (metric tons) has been as follows:\r\n\r\n   1912      1913      1914      1915      1916      1917\r\n  16,600    22,900    37,592    32,512    35,000    38,100\r\n\r\nFormerly German metal buying and refining companies controlled\r\nthe Australian copper output (as that of lead and zinc) by virtue\r\nof refining and selling contracts. Hence the year 1914 brought\r\ndisorganization to Australian mining. War-profits taxation on\r\nAustralian mines has been severe; and government aid, formerly granted,\r\nhas been largely withdrawn. Lack of labor, inability of new properties\r\nto obtain railroad connections, and absence of government encouragement\r\nto prospecting, have retarded the copper industry since August,\r\n1914. Aside from former German control based on selling and refining\r\ncontracts, all Australian copper mining is and has been under British\r\ncontrol. The properties are owned by British and Australian capital and\r\npresent refining and selling arrangements will prevent the German metal\r\ncompanies from again getting any foothold in the field. All former\r\ncontracts with German agencies were abrogated. The government took this\r\nphase of the matter in hand, and one step was to purchase the entire\r\nproduction of Australia for the first half of 1918 at £106 to £108 per\r\nton.\r\n\r\nThe Australian copper situation in 1917 is exhibited in the table\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nTABLE 48.--PRODUCTION OF COPPER AND REFINING PLANTS IN AUSTRALIA IN 1917\r\n\r\n  --------------------------+-----------+-------------------------------\r\n                            |Production,|\r\n                            |   1917,   |          Refineries\r\n      Chief mines           |(long tons)|\r\n  --------------------------+-----------+-------------------------------\r\n  Queensland:               |           |\r\n    Mount Morgan            | 8,000[123]|Port Kembla plant, Electrolyte\r\n                            |           |Refining & Smelting Co., Ltd.\r\n    Hampden Cloncurry       | 8,000[123]|Capacity, 29,000 tons\r\n                            |           |electrolyte copper per annum;\r\n                            |           |12,000 tons fire-refined copper\r\n                            |           |per annum.\r\n    Other Cloncurry district|           |\r\n    mines                   | 4,000[123]|Mount Elliott completed\r\n                            |           |refinery at Bowen, Queensland,\r\n                            |           |in 1917; capacity 10,000 tons\r\n                            |           |refined copper.\r\n                            |           |\r\n  South Australia:          |           |\r\n    Wallaroo & Moonta       | 7,000     |Wallaroo & Moonta smelter,\r\n                            |           |Bowen, Queensland; capacity\r\n                            |           |increased from 7,000 to 10,000\r\n                            |           |tons per annum.\r\n                            |           |\r\n  Tasmania:                 |           |\r\n    Mount Lyell             | 5,000     |Ships to Port Kembla.\r\n  New South Wales:          |           |\r\n    Great Cobar             | 2,500[123]|\r\n    C.

Secondarily enriched ores near the surface have been\r\n  entirely mined out.\r\n\r\nAs stated, the ownership of these mines is strictly British, and at\r\npresent the refining and marketing is now British instead of German.\r\nTwo refineries, both recently enlarged and improved, now have a\r\ncapacity of over 60,000 tons a year, which is well in excess of the\r\npresent output of the country. Towards the end of 1917, the Copper\r\nProducers’ Association Proprietary, Ltd., was formed in Australia for\r\nthe purpose of selling and shipping copper on a co-operative basis. All\r\ncopper producers were invited to join. Wallaroo & Moonta, Mount Morgan,\r\nMount Lyell and the Cloncurry mines are members of this association,\r\nas is the Electrolytic Refining & Smelting Co., which treats the\r\nores of these mines. The company markets its products in England and\r\nAustralia. Its chief brands are E. S. A. (electrolytic) and E. S.A.F.R.\r\n(fire refined). These brands are also sold by Elder Smith & Co.,\r\nLtd., of London and Australia, which has had a financial interest in\r\nthe Wallaroo & Moonta Co. since the early days, and has financed and\r\nmarketed the copper production of this company since 1915.\r\n\r\nMetals Products, Ltd., has recently been formed, with works at Port\r\nKembla producing copper wire, brass goods, etc. Importation of copper\r\nand brass products into Australia should entirely disappear if the\r\nplans of the Australian government and copper producers do not miscarry.\r\n\r\nThe oldest mine and one of the two leading mines in Australasia is\r\nthe Wallaroo & Moonta, in _South Australia_. This deposit occurs in a\r\npre-Cambrian complex, intersected by pegmatitic dikes. Ore reserves\r\nare believed to be ample: say five years’ supply of developed ore. In\r\nrecent years, production has been very steady at about 7,000 tons per\r\nyear of refined copper. This is the only important copper deposit of\r\npre-Cambrian age in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe other leading mine in Australia is Mount Morgan, in _Queensland_,\r\nwhich until 1910 was one of the largest gold mines in the world. The\r\ngold was in the oxidized top of a large low-grade copper deposit, which\r\nis now being mined from open cuts. Primary chalcocite, chalcopyrite and\r\npyrite with quartz constitutes the ore deposit. The ore runs 2¹⁄₂ per\r\ncent. copper and is concentrated up to 7 per cent. The reserves exceed\r\n4,000,000 tons of 2¹⁄₂ per cent. copper, or 10 years’ supply.\r\n\r\nThe Cloncurry district is a large area, 200 by 40 miles in extent,\r\ncontaining several copper deposits, which occur in schist and are\r\nmainly small bonanzas. The future of this district seems very\r\npromising. The chief mines are Hampden Cloncurry, Mount Elliott, Mount\r\nCuthbert; and the developed ore reserves insure five years’ production.\r\nThe Hampden Cloncurry mine has 300,000 tons of 7 per cent. ore in\r\nreserve, a smelter producing blister copper, and railroad connections.\r\nThe district is hampered by bad climate, etc., and especially by labor\r\nconditions. Recent government rulings (1918), as to very short hours of\r\nlabor and higher wages, are reducing outputs. The Mount Elliott mine,\r\nwhich has a 300,000-ton deposit of 10 per cent. ore, is now (1919) idle\r\nbecause of labor conditions. The Mount Cuthbert mine, which completed\r\na new smelter in 1917, has reserves of 150,000 tons of 6¹⁄₂ per cent.\r\ncopper, and railroad connections.\r\n\r\nThe Mount Lyell mine, in _Tasmania_, is an old and steady producer. One\r\nclass of ore runs 0.5 per cent. of copper and 1.25 ounces silver; the\r\nother contains 6 per cent. copper ore, with the same amount of silver.\r\nThis is a disseminated deposit in schist, near a conglomerate contact.\r\nNo igneous rocks are known in the vicinity. The reserves are 2,000,000\r\ntons of low-grade ore and 1,000,000 tons of high grade; insuring the\r\npresent output for 15 years. Considerable of the ore is mined open cut,\r\nand this is one of the lowest grade profitable mines in the world. Ores\r\nare smelted direct after being mixed, so that the product going to the\r\nfurnace runs 2¹⁄₂ per cent. copper.\r\n\r\nThe Great Cobar mine, in _New South Wales_, works cupriferous pyrite\r\ncarrying 2 to 2¹⁄₂ per cent. copper. Cobar used to produce 4,000 to\r\n5,000 tons of copper a year. After erecting a 1,200-ton smelter in\r\n1912, the company was placed in the hands of a receiver, April, 1914.\r\nThe reserves are believed to be large. The other chief mines in New\r\nSouth Wales (the C. S. A., Mount Hope, Nymagee, etc.) produce together\r\nabout as much as Great Cobar. These mines have smelters, and for the\r\nmost part were formerly of much greater importance than they are today.\r\nSeveral have no railway connections, and this is an important handicap\r\nto New South Wales mines, which once produced twice the present output.\r\n\r\nIn _West Australia_, there have been developed recently a number of\r\npromising deposits of pyritic copper ores. There are no important\r\nproducers, there being no railways.\r\n\r\nThe present conditions in Australia, in which labor conditions are most\r\nimportant, and the absence of new railroad construction, have seriously\r\naffected the development of the copper industry, but the future seems\r\npromising. Several important deposits have proved large and the ore\r\nbodies persistent. Much of the country has not been explored and\r\nmany good showings could be worked and some probably developed into\r\nprofitable mines if conditions were favorable to new ventures. Just\r\nthe reverse is the case, however. The Mount Lyell company has been\r\nexploring northern Tasmania, and recently found in the mine of the\r\nTasmania Copper Co. about 1,000,000 tons of ore carrying copper, zinc,\r\ngold and silver and worth $20 to $30 per ton, gross.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that Australia will continue to be an important copper\r\nproducer; probably its importance will increase. Weighted reserves,\r\nin terms of ore supply to maintain present output, insure copper\r\nproduction continuing undiminished for 7.2 years. These reserves are\r\nwell distributed among the various producers.\r\n\r\n\r\nASIA\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPAN\r\n\r\nCopper deposits are found over a large part of central Japan. The ores,\r\nwhich occur in Tertiary volcanics, consist of chalcopyrite and pyrite\r\nrunning 2¹⁄₂ to 3¹⁄₂ per cent. copper, and are commonly concentrated\r\nbefore smelting. The gangue is usually quartzose. Lenticular deposits\r\nof cupriferous pyrite in Paleozoic schists and sediments occur on\r\nthe west and the south side of Japan. These mines yield smelting ore\r\ncarrying about 3¹⁄₂ to 4 per cent., but contain very little silica.\r\nPyritic smelting is extensively practiced. Over one-half the copper\r\nproduction comes from four chief mines: Ashio and Kosaka of the\r\nTertiary type; and Hitachi and Beshi of the Paleozoic schist type.\r\n\r\nThe state reserves to itself the right of original ownership in\r\nall ores, including copper. The right to work them is granted to\r\nindividuals or companies of Japanese nationality. Copper mining,\r\nsmelting and refining companies seem to be entirely Japanese in\r\nownership and policy. The number of mines is considerable, but their\r\nownership is concentrated into a few hands and the smelting and\r\nrefining industry is still more concentrated. Japanese producers sell\r\ntheir own copper, all foreign selling agencies being strictly Japanese.\r\nThe mines in Japan are not generally worked as joint-stock enterprises,\r\nbut are mostly family properties inherited by the present owners. A\r\ntable showing the 1917 copper production of Japan indicates these\r\nfacts. (See Table 49.)\r\n\r\nBecause of labor conditions, abundant fuel near the mines and water\r\ntransportation, Japanese copper production has increased rapidly in\r\nrecent years. High prices and the adoption of modern methods of mining\r\nand smelting have been important contributing factors. There seems no\r\nreason to expect that Japan’s production will decrease, but not enough\r\nis known of geological conditions to enable one to discuss the future\r\noutlook. The only mine whose reserves are known is the Beshi, which\r\nhas reserves adequate for 100 years of production at the present rate,\r\nwhich is 10 per cent. of the Japanese output. The reserves at other\r\nmines are not developed far ahead, but must insure several years of\r\ncontinued production at the present rate.\r\n\r\nThe production and exports of Japanese copper in recent years are as\r\nfollows (in terms of metric tons):\r\n\r\n  ----------+------+------+------+------+-------+-------\r\n     Year   | 1912 | 1913 | 1914 | 1915 |  1916 |  1917\r\n  ----------+------+------+------+------+-------+-------\r\n  Production|63,893|67,697|71,046|76,039|101,467|124,306\r\n  Exports   |30,000|42,000|45,500|59,500| 62,000| 72,000\r\n  ----------+------+------+------+------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nTABLE 49.--JAPANESE COPPER PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nProducing companies and brands of copper marketed.

Evidently not reached in 1917.\r\n\r\nSince the high copper prices of 1916 there was a heavy importation\r\nof Chinese copper coins into Japan. In 1917 one concern alone had\r\ncontracted for 200,000 tons of such coins, which contain about 85 per\r\ncent. copper, and the rate of importation at that time would mean\r\n60,000 tons refined copper a year from this secondary source. This\r\ndevelopment has enabled Japan to make heavy exports of copper.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Russia removed one of Japan’s big copper markets. Japan\r\nwill probably not be able profitably to produce a large exportable\r\nsurplus of copper unless the price obtained is fairly high compared to\r\nquotations ruling in 1912 to 1914. Under normal conditions Japan will\r\nsupply her own needs for copper with little or nothing to spare.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOREA (CHOSEN)\r\n\r\nThe Seoul Mining Co. (Collbran and Bostwick) is producing from contact\r\ndeposits, one 50 miles and the other 100 miles from a harbor. This\r\nAmerican concern is a dominant trading and banking house in Korea and\r\nis working mines formerly operated by Koreans. The copper ores are\r\nsulphides between limestone and granite. Five hundred tons of 60 per\r\ncent. concentrates were shipped from Chosen to the United States in\r\n1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINA\r\n\r\nThe present production of China is 2,000 tons a year, and the chief\r\ndeposits are in Yunnan Province. A great many localities are reported\r\nto show copper ores, mainly cupriferous pyrite in very old schists,\r\nor in Permian basalt. The latter deposits are too small for modern\r\nmethods. In the last hundred years, lack of wood to make charcoal has\r\nrestricted output to a nominal amount. Small seams of native copper are\r\nhighly esteemed by the natives. The ores are carefully hand-picked, and\r\nthe small-scale methods are wasteful.\r\n\r\nThe Tungschuanfu mine, Yunnan, the chief mine in China, has a yearly\r\noutput of about 1,000 tons of copper. The district has been worked\r\nfor hundreds of and probably is very rich. The ores, replacements in\r\nlimestone and veins in shale, are 8 per cent. copper and the reserves\r\nare large. The Yaoki Kansu government smelter is a modern plant with a\r\ncapacity of four tons of copper a day.\r\n\r\nThere are several other mines, all controlled by the government.\r\nOutside engineers have reported favorably on some of them, but the\r\ngovernment closely regulates copper mining in China because it affects\r\ncurrency and government profits on coinage of copper. There are also\r\nsome copper mines worked with the contact iron deposits of China\r\n(formed by contact action of diorite); and deposits of malachite in\r\nTriassic sandstone are worked at several points.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIA\r\n\r\nIndia is not a copper producer. The Rakha Hills mine of the Cape Copper\r\nCo. (see Cape Colony) has 400,000 tons of 4 per cent. copper ore\r\ndeveloped and a smelter is being built. India is an enormous copper\r\nconsumer, and it is surprising she has never been a producer.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPE\r\n\r\nPolitical and commercial control of much of the copper production of\r\nEurope is obviously uncertain in the extreme, as are any figures of\r\nproduction for the Central Powers and Russia. (See Table 49.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAIN, PORTUGAL, NORWAY AND SWEDEN\r\n\r\nSpain is the oldest and steadiest producer of copper in the world. The\r\nchief deposits are controlled by English capital and their developed\r\nreserves insure present production for 30 to 60 years. The copper is\r\nlargely refined to finished form in England and enters the market there\r\nunder various brands.

Production for 1919 in Germany probably smaller than estimate.\r\n\r\nThe copper deposits, chiefly massive cupriferous pyrite, in Norway\r\nand Sweden, are similar to those of Spain geologically as well as\r\neconomically. Their commercial value depends not only on their copper\r\ncontent, but on the sulphur and iron recovered. In many cases the\r\nsulphur used in sulphuric acid manufacture is of greater money value\r\nthan the recovered copper. Hence the exported copper from Spain,\r\nPortugal and Norway is in several forms: pyrite, matte, ingot copper\r\nfrom Norway and considerable cement copper or precipitates from Spain\r\nand Portugal. Pyrite is exported to England, the United States, and\r\nperhaps a little to France; the matte, ingot, etc., to various European\r\ncountries. Sweden imports as well as produces pyrite. France, Italy and\r\nRussia produce considerable pyrite and before the war France exported\r\npyrite. Under normal conditions, the copper in all this pyrite is\r\nshipped back and forth over Europe and can hardly be traced. The table\r\nshows the location of raw materials but not the place where marketable\r\ncopper is produced. The chief imports and exports of pyrite are\r\nnormally as follows:\r\n\r\nTABLE 51.--NORMAL EXPORTS AND IMPORTS OF PYRITE FOR CERTAIN EUROPEAN\r\nCOUNTRIES\r\n\r\n  -----------------+-------------+-------------+-------------\r\n   Exports from--  |Amount (tons)|Imports to-- |Amount (tons)\r\n  -----------------+-------------+-------------+-------------\r\n  Spain            |  1,500,000  |England      |  1,050,000\r\n  Norway           |    500,000  |Sweden       |    100,000\r\n  Portugal         |    250,000  |United States|  1,000,000\r\n                   |             |France       |    100,000\r\n                   +-------------+             +-------------\r\n    Estimated total|  2,250,000  |             |  2,250,000\r\n  -----------------+-------------+-------------+-------------\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY\r\n\r\nUnder existing conditions the present output of Germany can not be\r\nclosely estimated. The figures in Table 49 are guesses based on the\r\ninformation available. The Mansfeld deposits are clearly the most\r\nimportant, and as they are in shales that extend over a large area, the\r\nreserves must be considered large. The Mitterberg mine, owned by the\r\nKrupps, had a pre-war output of only 1,000 tons yearly. Several copper\r\ndeposits in the Austrian Tyrol had a pre-war output of 1,000 tons\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThe chief source of copper in Germany during the war, however, must\r\nhave been from conversion of articles containing copper which were in\r\nuse before the war. It is doubtful if 10 per cent. of the yearly copper\r\nproduction of peace times was destroyed in use. Consequently, in all\r\ncountries there is normally a big store of copper in the form of wire,\r\nbrass, machine parts, etc. This is what Germany used during the war,\r\nand its replacement is essential to her industrial success in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA\r\n\r\nThe copper production of Russia was rapidly increasing before the\r\nwar and reached a maximum in 1913. The ownership of the mines and\r\nrefineries was largely English but in part French. Enough development\r\nhad been done to indicate that Russia will probably be a large producer\r\nof copper when consistent industrial progress is possible. In 1918 the\r\nmines had been seized by workmen and operations were nearly or entirely\r\nsuspended. The copper districts are all in the Urals, the Caucasus\r\nor Siberia. The Russian copper production (in long tons) has been as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n   1905   1910    1913    1914    1915    1916    1917\r\n  8,700  22,310  33,794  31,435  25,472  20,557  15,700\r\n

and\r\nthere was a tariff premium on domestic production. It is likely that\r\nultimately Russia may more nearly be self-supporting as regards copper\r\nrequirements, even if consumption increases greatly. Table 52 shows the\r\nimportant developed properties, their production in 1913 (maximum) and\r\nin 1915 (estimated), their developed ore reserves, and the nationality\r\nof original capital that made the developments possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nCopper, the red metal, is surpassed only by gold and silver in\r\nmalleability and by silver alone in electrical conductivity. Next to\r\niron it is industrially the most important of all metals, as its value\r\nper pound is much greater than that of lead or zinc, and the world\r\nrequires and consumes much greater quantities of copper, lead, and zinc\r\nthan of any other non-ferrous metals.\r\n\r\nThe uses of copper are many, but the electrical industry is the\r\nlargest consumer. Brass, bronze, and other copper alloys are second\r\nin importance. A considerable quantity of copper sheets, tubes and\r\nother wares are used outside of the electrical industry. Copper is\r\nused in coinage, and in China it is the money standard of the working\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe United States, producing a major part of the world’s copper, has\r\nalso been responsible for financing and developing more successful\r\ncopper mines abroad than any other country. Success has been\r\nfacilitated by the presence in the Western Hemisphere of the world’s\r\nchief copper deposits and also by the advances in mining, milling and\r\nmetallurgy that have been in great measure the work of United States\r\nengineers. England and Japan control considerable copper production,\r\nbut it is small compared to that controlled by the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the consumption of copper Germany is a big factor. Because of this\r\nfact, German interests and international metal houses have in the past\r\nsecured a considerable control over copper supplies through refining\r\nand selling contracts with mining companies. Such control is based\r\nentirely on refining and selling companies and does not extend to\r\nownership of producing mines, and only to a small degree to ownership\r\nof smelters.\r\n\r\nChile, Mexico, Canada, and the Belgian Congo should become of\r\nincreasing importance as copper producers not only because of known\r\nreserves but, in the case of Canada and Mexico particularly, because of\r\nthe likelihood of new and important discoveries. The position of the\r\nUnited States, including Alaska, should be maintained as at present,\r\nneither gaining nor losing as compared to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLEAD\r\n\r\nBY FREDERICK B. HYDER\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF LEAD\r\n\r\nLead is used in the form of the metal, of alloys with other metals, and\r\nof various chemical compounds. As metal its chief uses are as pipe for\r\nwater and corrosive solutions; for protective covering of electrical\r\ncables; as sheet lead for lining chambers for the manufacture of\r\nsulphuric acid and vats for chemical manufacturing processes. In\r\nsmelting, lead is used as a collector of other metals, particularly of\r\ngold and silver, from which it is later separated, now most generally\r\nby the use of zinc by the Parkes process of desilverization.\r\n\r\nLead alloys readily with nearly all other metals in all proportions.\r\nIts alloys of industrial importance comprise type metal, bearing or\r\nbabbitt metals, shot, solders, casting metals, some brasses, and the\r\nfusible alloys used for the protection of electrical apparatus and in\r\nautomatic sprinklers for the protection of buildings against fire.\r\nType metal, originally composed of 83 per cent. lead and 17 per cent.\r\nantimony, now often contains bismuth and sometimes a little copper\r\nand iron. An alloy of 9 parts lead, 2 antimony and 2 bismuth is used\r\nfor stereotype plates. Less than 2 per cent. of arsenic is added to\r\nlead used to make shot to increase the hardness and sphericity of the\r\nproduct. Antimony also imparts the hardness essential to shrapnel,\r\netc. Bearing metals comprise alloys of lead and antimony or these\r\nwith copper, tin, and zinc. Antimony imparts to lead the property\r\nof expansion on solidification, essential to type metal and casting\r\nmaterials generally. Lead makes a brass that is soft and machines\r\neasily. Solder is commonly an alloy of lead and tin. The melting point\r\nvaries with the proportions of these constituents and others, sometimes\r\nadded for special purposes. The cheapest solder in general use is\r\n30 per cent. tin and 70 per cent. lead. Solders seldom contain more\r\nthan 50 per cent. tin. The addition of bismuth, cadmium, or mercury\r\nlowers the melting below the boiling point of water. Fuses can thus be\r\nobtained which interrupt electric circuits at any desired temperature.\r\n\r\nThe largest uses of lead compounds are as pigments. White lead or basic\r\ncarbonate, 2(PbCO₃)Pb(OH)₂, is the most extensively consumed, being\r\nused alone or mixed with zinc oxide and barytes. Red lead (Pb₃O₄) is\r\nused for painting structural steel, as a pipe-joint cement, and in the\r\nmanufacture of glass. Litharge, another oxide, is used in assaying\r\nas a flux, in rubber manufacture, and in making glass. The acetate,\r\ncarbonate and other chemical compounds are used in medicine.\r\n\r\nThe relative amounts of lead consumed in the various uses in 1913 were:\r\nIn pigment, comprising white lead, red lead, litharge, and orange\r\nmineral, 38.0 per cent.; in alloys such as type metal, bearing metals,\r\nand solders, 29.7 per cent.; in pipe, 15.2 per cent.; in shot, 10.4 per\r\ncent.; and in sheets, 6.7 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nThe most revolutionary advance in ore dressing of recent years has been\r\nthe development of oil-flotation, electromagnetic, and electrostatic\r\nprocesses for the concentration of lead-zinc ores. These processes\r\npermit the elimination of the objectionable zinc content of many\r\nores and render it an additional credit of great importance in the\r\nexploitation of low-grade complex ores.\r\n\r\nThe Murex process applied to the treatment of complex ores consists\r\nof coating the metallic sulphide minerals with oil and particles of\r\nmagnetite and pyrite roasted to magnetic sulphide, then separating them\r\nfrom the gangue by an electromagnetic machine. The Lyster preferential\r\nflotation of galena depends on the presence of various salts in the\r\nwater used. In the Broken Hill mines these salts are present in the\r\nmine waters. After removal of galena the blende may be preferentially\r\nfloated by the Bradford copper salt or Bradford hyposulphite or\r\nsulphurous acid processes.\r\n\r\nIn the reduction of lead ores, there are improvements constantly\r\nbeing made. These are chiefly in the mechanical appliances, such as\r\nmechanical ore hearths and continuous roasting machinery, such as the\r\nDwight-Lloyd, and in details of furnace construction and the handling\r\nof materials, rather than in processes or recognized principles.\r\nVarious new processes have been proposed, most of which are intended\r\nto make available the ores now of too low grade, or the complex\r\nores of lead and zinc whose separation is difficult or commercially\r\nimpracticable. These processes are now the subject of experiment,\r\nwith some indications that successful applications may be found. One\r\nprocess involves the volatilization by chloridizing roast of sulphide\r\nores, the precipitation of the lead chloride fume by Cottrell electric\r\nprecipitation, and smelting the fume with lime. At least 50 per\r\ncent. of the chlorine is recovered as calcium chloride, which can be\r\nsubstituted for salt in the further operations. With oxidized ores\r\nit is proposed to dissolve the lead by means of brine acidified with\r\nsulphuric acid and to precipitate metal sponge by electrolysis.\r\n\r\nGillies’s process consists in roasting the complex sulphides to a low\r\nsulphur content, mixing with carbonaceous matter, distilling in excess\r\nof air, and volatilizing the lead, zinc, bismuth, cadmium, arsenic,\r\netc., as oxides and sulphates, the lead in form of sulphate, the zinc\r\nchiefly as oxide. The fume is caught and digested with a solution of\r\nZnSO₄ and free H₂SO₄ from the electrolytic vats; PbSO₄ remains, which\r\ncan be used as pigment or smelted. The ZnSO₄ solution is electrolyzed,\r\nin the presence of gum arabic in the electrolyte, rendering the zinc\r\ndeposit more dense.\r\n\r\nThe Ganlin process, reported successful on Burma zinc-lead middlings,\r\nconsists in feeding the dry pulverized ore into a molten bath of Zn and\r\nNaCl in equal parts. Zinc replaces lead and silver, which are dissolved\r\nas chlorides, ZnS being precipitated. When this reaction is complete\r\nthe lead and silver are precipitated as metals by granulated spelter\r\nadded to the amount of 35 per cent. of their weight, the dissolved\r\nspelter forming ZnCl₂. The silver-bearing lead is tapped off, the\r\nresidue granulated, the salts leached with water, and the zinc-bearing\r\ngangue freed from lead shot by tabling, leaving a zinc ore free from\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nElectrolytic refining has been one of the greatest advances in the\r\nindustry; it makes possible the preparation of pure lead from any\r\nsource and the recovery of numerous by-product metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL OCCURRENCE\r\n\r\nZinc and lead are commonly associated in mineral deposits, sometimes\r\nintimately mixed, sometimes segregated enough so that one metal\r\npredominates, but seldom free entirely one from the other. The\r\ngeological and geographical distribution of the two metals is,\r\ntherefore, nearly identical. Galena is the most common and important\r\nof the lead minerals. Cerussite, anglesite and pyromorphite usually\r\nresult from the oxidation of galena, the sulphate being usually an\r\nintermediate state in the oxidation to the carbonate. Pyromorphite\r\nand wulfenite are of minor importance. Jamesonite is more an ore of\r\nantimony than of lead. Sphalerite (zinc blende) weathers more readily\r\nthan galena, and therefore zinc in many places is carried below water\r\nlevel more rapidly and completely than lead. For this reason some mines\r\nchange from predominantly lead mines to zinc mines with greater depth.\r\nApart from the effect of such secondary enrichment, this change is\r\noften encountered in primary ores with increase in depth.\r\n\r\nLead ores occur in deposits of several distinct genetic types. Many\r\ndeposits lie at shallow depth in sedimentary rocks, without apparent\r\nconnection with igneous rocks, occurring as tabular replacements of\r\nreceptive beds. In regions of slightly disturbed strata the ore shoots\r\ntend to follow pitching troughs. Ores of this type usually contain\r\nlead (galena), zinc (sphalerite), and iron (pyrite) minerals; many\r\ncontain manganese and cadmium; some contain cobalt and nickel; but few\r\ncarry gold, silver, copper, or antimony. Deposits of this type are\r\nof world-wide distribution, and many are extensive and commercially\r\nimportant. The greater purity of the ore and the simplicity of\r\ntreatment (particularly for the ores in the oxidized zones), caused\r\nthem to be exploited first and most extensively, and to dominate\r\nformerly the world production of lead. To this type belong, with many\r\nothers, the deposits of the Mississippi Valley and Silesia, that\r\ntogether yielded 15 per cent. of the world’s production in 1913.\r\n\r\nOther important deposits are closely associated with igneous\r\nrocks, and are characterized by complex ores. They comprise vein\r\ndeposits, disseminated replacements of igneous rocks, and silver-lead\r\nreplacements in limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe chief lead-ore deposits of the world are situated in the countries\r\nthat are listed below in the order of their importance in 1913.\r\n\r\nRECOVERABLE LEAD CONTENT OF THE LEAD ORES OF THE WORLD PRODUCED IN\r\n1913[129]\r\n\r\n  ----+-------------------+----------+-----------+-------------\r\n      |                   |          |           |Percentage of\r\n      |                   |          |           |world’s total\r\n  Rank|     Country       |Short tons|Metric tons|  production\r\n  ----+-------------------+----------+-----------+-------------\r\n   1. |United States      |  484,880 |   440,000 |     36.0\r\n   2. |Australia          |  267,169 |   242,440 |     19.8\r\n   3. |Spain              |  209,193 |   189,830 |     16.4\r\n   4. |Germany            |   79,344 |    72,000 |      5.9\r\n   5. |Mexico             |   68,343 |    62,000 |      5.1\r\n   6. |Tunis              |   31,076 |    28,200 |      2.3\r\n   7. |Italy              |   24,905 |    22,600 |      1.8\r\n   8. |Canada             |   24,244 |    22,000 |      1.8\r\n   9. |Austria            |   22,591 |    20,500 |      1.7\r\n  10. |Great Britain      |   20,277 |    18,400 |      1.5\r\n  11. |Greece             |   19,836 |    18,000 |      1.5\r\n  12. |Turkey-in-Asia     |   15,428 |    14,000 |      1.1\r\n  13. |China              |   13,995 |    12,700 |      1.0\r\n  14. |German S.

S.\r\n  Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nThe four districts now of pre-eminent importance are, in order, Broken\r\nHill in New South Wales, Australia; southeastern Spain; southeastern\r\nMissouri and Coeur d’Alene, in Idaho: which are credited respectively\r\nwith about 19, 16, 12 and 10 per cent. of the world’s production in\r\n1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--The chief producing regions and their percentage of\r\nthe domestic lead production in 1915 are as follows:\r\n\r\n                                            Percentage of total\r\n          Region                            domestic production\r\n  Southeastern Missouri                             33\r\n  Coeur d’Alene, Idaho                              27\r\n  Utah                                              18\r\n  Joplin (in Mo., Kans., Ark., and Okla.)            6\r\n  Colorado                                           5\r\n\r\nAs regards the types of ores and the character of the lead produced,\r\nthere are two metallographic provinces: the Mississippi Valley,\r\nincluding southeastern Missouri and Joplin, and the minor district\r\nof Wisconsin, producing as soft lead 39 to 45 per cent. of the total\r\ndomestic production; and the Western province, in which the ores are\r\ncomplex, carrying precious metals and often antimony and copper. All of\r\nthe output from the Western province, but only a part of the soft lead,\r\nis desilverized.\r\n\r\nNinety per cent. of the ore mined in southeastern _Missouri_ comes\r\nfrom St. Francois and Madison counties. The ore deposits contain\r\npredominantly galena, and are disseminated in Cambrian limestone over\r\nlarge areas at depths of 100 to 550 feet. Copper, nickel, and cobalt\r\noccur in the Madison County ores, and copper concentrates are separated\r\nand shipped by nearly all the companies in the region. The principal\r\noperating companies, with the names of companies absorbed by them or\r\nnow subsidiaries, shown in parenthesis, are: St. Joseph Lead Co. (Doe\r\nRun Lead Co.), Federal Lead Co., National Lead Co. (St. Louis Smelting\r\n& Refining Co.), Desloge Consolidated Lead Co., Baker Lead Co. (St.\r\nFrancois Lead Co.), Boston Elvins Lead Co., Missouri Metals Co. (Mine\r\nLa Motte Co.), and Missouri Cobalt Co. (North American Lead Co.). The\r\nSt. Joseph Lead Co. is normally the second largest lead-producing\r\ncompany in the United States. Its holdings have a conservatively\r\nestimated life of 20 years, at a rate of production of 2,000,000 tons\r\nof ore, or 80,000 short tons of lead, per annum. In 1917 this company\r\nmined 2,485,431 tons of ore, nearly half the total output of the\r\nregion. The Federal Lead Co., a subsidiary of the American Smelting &\r\nRefining Co., is the next largest producing company in the region. In\r\n1915 it mined and milled 1,355,000 tons of ore. The National Lead Co.,\r\nthrough its subsidiary, the St. Louis Smelting & Refining Co., works\r\nthree mines near Flat River and has a concentration plant with a daily\r\ncapacity of 2,400 tons. Its smelter at Collinsville treats its own\r\nconcentrates, as well as those of the Baker Lead Co. and the Boston\r\nElvins Lead Co. The Desloge Consolidated Lead Co. operates three mines\r\nand a mill of 1,700 tons’ daily capacity; its ores are smelted by the\r\nFederal Lead Co. The Missouri Metals Co. operates the Mine La Motte and\r\na mill treating 700,000 tons annually at the 1917 rate. In 1915 it was\r\nestimated that this mine could produce 3,000,000 tons of ore annually\r\nfor sixty years.\r\n\r\nIn the Joplin region, which is chiefly in Missouri but also includes\r\nadjacent areas in Kansas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, the ores lie at\r\nthree horizons in horizontal limestone and chert beds of Lower\r\nCarboniferous age. At the upper horizon, usually 100 to 150 feet below\r\nthe surface, the ore occurs in clayey chert breccias. The ore bodies\r\nare characteristically “runs” up to 300 feet wide, and continuous in\r\none horizon for several hundred feet and, rarely, for more than a mile.\r\nThe middle horizon, or “sheet ground,” at a depth of 150 to 300 feet\r\nusually ranges from 6 to 15 feet in thickness. The ore, mixed galena\r\nand blende, cements brecciated chert. The third and lowest horizon,\r\nin sandy limestones, contains disseminated ores mainly, and as yet is\r\nlittle exploited. In 1915, about 4,000,000 tons of ore was mined from\r\nthe upper horizon, and 6,500,000 tons from the middle horizon or “sheet\r\nground.” The average lead content of the ore as mined was about 0.25\r\nper cent. Most of the lead concentrates are sold in open market. The\r\nWebb City district is the most important in the Joplin region, and the\r\nAmerican Zinc, Lead & Smelting Co. is the largest galena producer. Most\r\nof the output is by lessees and small operators. The Joplin district\r\nranks second in importance. The A. W. C. Mining Co. is the largest\r\nminer of “sheet ground.” The Ravenswood and Ritz mines of the United\r\nStates Smelting, Refining & Mining Co., in Jasper County, produce\r\n218,000 tons of ore annually. The concentrates of this region are\r\nchiefly smelted by the plants of the Eagle-Picher Lead Co. at Galena,\r\nKansas; Joplin, Missouri; Webb City, Missouri; and by the Granby Mining\r\n& Smelting Co. at Granby, Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe Coeur d’Alene region is in Shoshone County, _Idaho_. The deposits\r\nare metasomatic veins formed by replacement of siliceous sedimentary\r\nrocks along zones of fissuring, and carry mainly galena and siderite\r\nwith some pyrite and sphalerite. In 1915 the crude ore shipments\r\namounted to 95,169 tons with a lead content of 35,271 short tons.\r\nThe remainder of the ore, or nearly 96 per cent. of the total, is\r\nconcentrated to carry about 50 per cent. lead. The 1915 yield of\r\nconcentrates of all kinds amounted to 329,530 tons, having a lead\r\ncontent of 128,928 short tons, making the total lead content of crude\r\nand concentrate shipments 164,199 short tons. The mining companies form\r\nthree groups, determined chiefly by their relations or affiliations\r\nwith the smelters, as follows: The Bunker Hill group, comprising the\r\nBunker Hill & Sullivan Mining & Concentrating Co., and the Hecla Mining\r\nCo.; the Day group, comprising the Tamarack & Custer Mining Co., the\r\nAmazon-Manhattan mine, and the Hercules Mining Co.; and the American\r\nSmelting & Refining group, comprising the Federal Mining & Smelting Co.\r\nand various small producers.\r\n\r\nThe mines of the Bunker Hill & Sullivan Mining & Concentrating Co.\r\nhad reserves on December 31, 1917, of 3,457,634 tons. The ore bodies\r\nare replacements of quartzite. This company’s production in 1917 was\r\n493,030 tons of ore, the metallic lead recovered by smelting being\r\n46,996 tons. The Bunker Hill & Sullivan Co., while still shipping its\r\nown ores to the Helena plant of the American Smelting & Refining Co.,\r\nbuilt its own smelter at Kellogg, Idaho, where it smelts the Hecla and\r\nother ores. The Day family controls the Hercules, and Tamarack & Custer\r\ncompanies, the Northport smelter at Northport, Washington (now closed\r\ndown), and the Pennsylvania Smelting & Refining Co. at Pittsburgh, Pa.\r\nThe 1916 shipments of the Hercules had a lead content of about 22,000\r\ntons. Both companies are close corporations and make public little\r\ninformation as to their operations. The Tamarack & Custer probably has\r\nlarge reserves of ore averaging about 9 per cent. lead; it has produced\r\nas much as 3,000 tons of shipping ore and concentrates per month. The\r\nFederal Mining & Smelting Co. operates several mines. One-sixth of\r\nthe stock is owned by the American Smelters Securities Co. and all\r\nits silver-lead ores and concentrates are contracted to the American\r\nSmelting & Refining Co. The Success Mining Co., working two mines, has\r\nbeen an important producer. The Interstate-Callahan has been chiefly a\r\nzinc producer but ships some lead concentrates to the Salida plant of\r\nthe Ohio & Colorado Smelting Co.\r\n\r\nThe lead production of _Utah_ is chiefly from the Park City,\r\nBingham Canyon, and Tintic districts. The ores, composed of galena,\r\ntetrahedrite and pyrite, and in places sphalerite, with their oxidized\r\nderivatives, occur in lodes cutting limestones, sandstones and shales,\r\nchiefly of Carboniferous age, and also as bedded deposits in limestone.\r\nBoth types are frequently associated with porphyry and form irregular\r\nore bodies in contact-metamorphosed limestone. In many mines copper is\r\nan important constituent of the ores and the silver content is always\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nThe production of _Colorado_ in 1917 comprised 33,995 short tons of\r\nlead, of which 9,293 short tons came from the Leadville district in\r\nLake County, 10,412 short tons from the San Juan district in San Juan,\r\nSan Miguel and Ouray counties, and 6,816 tons from the Aspen district\r\nin Pitkin County. The Leadville deposits are in the Mosquito range.\r\nThe chief producing companies are the Iron Silver Mining Co., the\r\nYak Mining, Milling & Tunnel Co. and its subsidiary, the Leadville\r\nExploration & Mining Co.; the Western Mining Co.; the Downtown Mines\r\nCo.; the Ibex Mining Co.; and the United States Smelting, Refining\r\n& Mining Co. The Yak Mining, Milling & Tunnel Co., and the Western\r\nMining Co. are subsidiaries of the American Smelting & Refining Co. In\r\nthe San Juan district, the principal producers are the Liberty Bell;\r\nSmuggler-Union; Tomboy; Black Bear; Iowa-Gold Tiger; Dives; Shenandoah;\r\nand Silver Lake mines. The veins penetrate all the clastic and igneous\r\nrocks of this region, and the ores are exceedingly complex. In Pitkin\r\nCounty, the Smuggler Leasing Co. operates most of the producing mines\r\nat Aspen. The ores are peculiarly free from other metals than lead,\r\nantimony, and silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australia.=--The lead resources of the Commonwealth of Australia\r\nare chiefly in New South Wales, Western Australia, Tasmania, and\r\nQueensland. New South Wales has been the chief producer in the past,\r\nbut the Tasmanian deposits are now being rapidly developed and equipped\r\nfor production.\r\n\r\nThe most important source of ore in _New South Wales_ is the great\r\nBroken Hill lode, situated in the arid Barrier Ranges at an elevation\r\nof about 1,000 feet above sea level. The lode ranges in width from a\r\nfew inches to 400 feet and has been worked over a distance of three\r\nmiles. Mining began in 1884 and now is conducted by several mining\r\ncompanies which, in the order of the importance of their production\r\nand ore reserves, are: Broken Hill South Silver Mining Co.; Broken\r\nHill North Mining Co.; Zinc Corporation; Sulphide Corporation; British\r\nBroken Hill Proprietary Co.; Broken Hill Proprietary Co.; Broken Hill\r\nProprietary Co., Block 10; and Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Block 14.\r\n\r\nAlthough the deepest workings are 1,815 feet deep, the ore still\r\ncontinues downward. For many years the estimated ore reserves of\r\nall the mines have approximated 12,000,000 tons. The upper part of\r\nthe lode consisted of a gossan 20 to 100 feet wide of siliceous and\r\nmanganiferous limonite, hematite, and kaolin. Below the gossan were\r\ngreat masses of cerussite, anglesite, cuprite, and malachite, with\r\nabundant cerargyrite, embolite, and iodyrite. Between the oxidized\r\nand primary sulphide ores was a thin zone of secondary sulphides. The\r\nearly operations in the district were conducted for the purpose of\r\nobtaining lead ores, and immense dumps were accumulated of zinc-bearing\r\nores sorted out or zinc-bearing tailings left after concentration of\r\nthe lead ores. In 1903 these dumps were estimated at 5,687,400 tons,\r\ncarrying 18.6 per cent. zinc. With the development of a demand for\r\nzinc sulphide ores and of oil-flotation methods of separation and\r\nconcentration, these dumps have been important sources of zinc. There\r\nare two classes of sulphide ores, distinguished as silicate gangue ore,\r\nand calcite gangue ore. The sulphide ores are a close mixture of galena\r\nand zinc blende, carrying silver. The silicate gangue ore bodies carry\r\nrhodonite, garnet, and quartz; and are richer in zinc and silver than\r\nthose with calcite gangue.\r\n\r\nThe Broken Hill South Silver Mining Co. has ore reserves estimated\r\nat 3,350,000 tons and is the largest ore producer in the field.\r\nBroken Hill North, Broken Hill South, Amalgamated Zinc (De Bavay),\r\nZinc Corporation, and Barrier South, Ltd., are controlled by the\r\nHoover-Govett-Bailliau group of British and Australian capitalists.\r\n\r\nThe Amalgamated Zinc Co. in 1913 treated 498,289 tons of tailings\r\ncontaining 17.1 per cent. zinc, 3.7 per cent. lead, and 4.4 ounces\r\nsilver, obtaining 140,098 tons zinc concentrates carrying zinc, 48.9\r\nper cent., lead 5.9 per cent., and silver 8.5 ounces per ton. The\r\nZinc Corporation, a company formed by Bewick, Moreing & Co., has ore\r\nreserves estimated at 1,504,211 tons, averaging 14.8 per cent. lead,\r\n9.2 per cent. zinc, and 2.5 ounces of silver per ton.\r\n\r\nThe largest lead-producing district of _Tasmania_ is on the West Coast,\r\nwhere the largest producers, the Hercules of the Dundas group and the\r\nPrimrose and Tasmanian copper mines of the Rosebery company group, are\r\nnow controlled by the Mount Read-Rosebery Co., affiliated with the\r\nMount Lyell Mining & Railway Co., Ltd. The deposits contain complex\r\nsulphide ores, the reserves being estimated by the state geological\r\nstaff at 1,272,500 tons, averaging 29.79 per cent. zinc, 8.89 per\r\ncent. lead, 12.16 ounces of silver, and 0.17 ounces gold per ton. This\r\nestimate has since been revised and made more conservative.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 _Western Australia_ produced 26,589 long tons of lead ore\r\nand 125 tons of silver-lead ore, almost wholly from the Northampton\r\ndistrict on the West Coast. The only company working on a large scale\r\nis the Fremantle Trading & Smelting Co., operating the Baddera and\r\nNarra Tarra mines and, formerly, a smelter at Fremantle. The Chillagoe\r\ndistrict is the largest producer in _Queensland_, its output amounting\r\nto 2,550 long tons of pig lead in 1913, chiefly from the Girofla mine\r\nof the Mungana company, but in part from lead-copper concentrates. The\r\nChillagoe operated a small smelter. The total pig lead production of\r\nQueensland was 3,603 long tons in 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spain.=--Spain yielded in 1913, 314,369 short tons of lead\r\nconcentrates, from which were smelted 189,559 tons of pig lead. In 1915\r\nonly 1,010 short tons of ore or concentrates was exported, and 161,912\r\nshort tons of desilverized lead was exported, mostly to England. Over\r\n90 per cent. of the production of ore came from the provinces of Jaen,\r\nMurcia, Cordoba, and Ciudad Real. In 1913 the Province of Almeria\r\noccupied fourth place, but its mines are now nearly exhausted. These\r\nprovinces are in the southeastern part of Spain and cover the Sierra\r\nMorena and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Jaen are two principal districts--the\r\nLinares-Santa-Elena and the La Carolina. Many years ago Linares was the\r\ngreatest lead-producing district in the world. The veins cut granite\r\nand thin overlying sandstone and are very narrow. The Arrayanes, a\r\nstate-owned mine, has been exploited over a length of two and a half\r\nmiles and to 1,500 feet in depth. The gangue is granite, quartz and\r\ncalcite. Iron and copper pyrites and sphalerite are present, but a 79\r\nper cent. lead concentrate is easily made. The deepest mine is 1,800\r\nft. deep and is still in rich ore. In the Santa Elena vicinity, the\r\nSan Fernando, Ojo Vecino, and Santa Ana mines are owned locally. The\r\nCaridad is owned by French capital and the Santa Susanna by a Belgian\r\nconcern, the Compagnie Real Asturienne des Mines. In La Carolina\r\ndistrict the nearly vertical lodes cut Silurian quartzites and Cambrian\r\nand Silurian slates. The ore attains a greater width than in the\r\nveins of the Linares district. The Nuevo Centenillo mine (English\r\nowned) produces 27,000 short tons of concentrates annually. The great\r\nGuindo lode runs through six mines, two of which are owned by Spanish\r\ncompanies, and three by the Guindo Co., a German-Spanish corporation\r\nhaving an output of 27,000 short tons of concentrates yearly. The\r\nCastillo La Vieja, owned by a French company, has a yearly output of\r\n20,000 tons of marketable ore.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Murcia the Mazarron and Cartagena districts are\r\nimportant. Most of the veins are nearly vertical but many have spurs or\r\nbranches forming lenticular and bedded deposits in the sedimentaries.\r\nThis district extends southwestward along the coast from Cabo de Palos\r\na few miles north of Cartagena. The production of this province has\r\nbeen steadily decreasing.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Cordoba (district of Posadas) many silver-lead-zinc\r\nmines were worked by the Romans and are still profitable. Near\r\nAlcaracejos are the mines of Anglo-Vask and Penarroya, the latter owned\r\nby a French company of the same name.\r\n\r\nThe development of the lead ores in the Province of Ciudad Real has\r\nbeen retarded by lack of transportation facilities. The best known\r\ndistrict is that of El Hoyo-San Lorenzo, which in 1915 had risen to\r\nfourth place among the lead-producing districts of Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany.=--In imperial Germany the lead-producing districts in the\r\norder of their importance were as follows: Upper Silesia, Rhenish\r\nPrussia, Westphalia, Saxony, Hanover, and Nassau. Rhenish Prussia and\r\nWestphalia are usually grouped together as one metallographic province.\r\nAt Gladbach, east of Cologne in _Rhenish Prussia_, are ore deposits\r\nlying in troughs and basins in limestone. The ore is smithsonite and\r\ngalena mixed with shale. The chief deposits of _Westphalia_ are at\r\nIserlohn and Brilon. At Iserlohn ores containing calamine, galena,\r\nand blende are found in irregular pockets. The deposits of Brilon are\r\nsimilar, but most of the ore is found in crevices in the limestone.\r\nRhenish Prussia and Westphalia are the source of about one-third the\r\nGerman production of lead.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of _Upper Silesia_ lay within the boundaries of\r\nGermany in 1914, although formerly part of the kingdom of Poland, the\r\npopulation being still predominantly Polish; but portions were included\r\nin the old empires of Russia and Austria. The pre-war production of\r\nlead ores from Russian Poland was entirely from this metallographic\r\nprovince. The deposits, which contain lead and zinc together, lie in\r\nTriassic beds that overlie Carboniferous rocks carrying important seams\r\nof coal. This juxtaposition of ore and fuel furnish an ideal basis for\r\nthe great smelting industry that developed locally, for the conditions\r\npermit smelting of low-grade ores.\r\n\r\nThe historic mines at Freiberg, in _Saxony_ (Erzgebirge) yield a small\r\nquantity of blende in connection with the concentration of galena ores\r\nfrom a remarkable series of intersecting veins, which number more than\r\n900, although few are more than 2 feet thick. They have been worked to\r\na depth of 2,100 feet. More than 10 per cent. of the lead production of\r\nGermany is derived from Saxony. These mines are owned and operated by\r\nthe Saxon government, which also owns the smelting plants.\r\n\r\nLead predominates over zinc in the ores of the Upper Harz, in\r\n_Hanover_. These ores occur in veins and zones in slates of Devonian\r\nand Lower Carboniferous age. These mines are worked by the Prussian\r\nDepartment of Mines, which also operates two smelting plants, the\r\noutput being about 10 per cent. of the total German output. In\r\n_Nassau_, in the valley of the Lahn, lead ores are produced as a\r\nby-product, with zinc blende concentrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mexico.=--In Mexico lead ores are mined in several states, the more\r\nimportant being Chihuahua, Durango, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Sonora, San\r\nLuis Potosi, and Zacatecas. In many districts during a considerable\r\npart of the past eight years work has been intermittent and\r\noccasionally suspended for long periods.\r\n\r\nThe Santa Eulalia district in _Chihuahua_ is largely owned by American\r\ncompanies, including the American Smelting & Refining Co., operating\r\nthe Mina Vieja, Sin Nombre, Velardeña, San Antonio and Santo Domingo\r\nmines; and El Potosi Mining Co., operating the mines of the same name.\r\nThe San Toy is under lease to the American Metal Co., now purged of\r\nGerman interests. The Santa Eulalia Mining Co. belongs to the Hearst\r\nestate. The Buena Tierra Mining Co. is a British concern. The mines of\r\nthe Santa Barbara and Parral districts are also largely under American\r\ncontrol, among many others being the Montezuma Lead Mining Co. of\r\nthe R. S. Towne interests, Granadeña Mining Co., American Smelters\r\nSecurities Co. and American Zinc Extraction Co. The American Smelters\r\nSecurities Co. operates the Tecolotes, Montezuma, San Diego, Guadalupe\r\nand Alfarena mines. The San Francisco mines are owned by British\r\ncapital. In the San Isidro district the Calera, Prieta and Buena Vista\r\nmines are operated by the American Smelting & Refining Co. The Lago\r\nmine is operated by C. M. de Las Plomosas (French). In the Parado\r\ndistrict are mines of the Compañia Minera Aurora y Anexas, controlled\r\nby the Madero family (Mexican). Other Chihuahua mines of the American\r\nSmelting & Refining Co. are Orizaba and La Union at Magistral, the\r\nJibosa at Dolores, La Luz and Parcionera at Cordera, the Veta Grande\r\nand Veta Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe largest operators in the state of _Durango_ are the American\r\nSmelters Securities Co. at Velardeña and the Cia. Minera de Peñoles at\r\nMapimi, both now American since the selling of the German-held stock of\r\nthe American Metals Co. by the Alien Property Custodian.\r\n\r\nIn _Sonora_, the Carnegie Lead & Zinc Co. worked a mine near Cananea,\r\nduring the war, but the best part of the deposit is now depleted.\r\n\r\nThe Tiro General mines, in _San Luis Potosi_, belong to the American\r\nSmelting & Refining Co.\r\n\r\nThe Cabrilla and Paloma mines, in the Cabrillas district in _Coahuila_,\r\nare owned by the Compañia Minera de Peñoles, controlled by the\r\nAmerican Metal Co. The Sierra Mojada district is dominated by American\r\ncompanies, the principal mines being owned by the Consolidated Kansas\r\nCity Smelting & Refining Co., a subsidiary of the American Smelting\r\n& Refining Co. The Boquillas de Carmen mine has been acquired by an\r\nAmerican company.\r\n\r\nIn the state of _Nueva Leon_, deposits lying within a radius of 50\r\nmiles of Monterrey, at Villadama, Vallecillo, Ladera Occidental\r\nde Minas Viejas, etc., have been exploited by German and American\r\ncompanies, including the Compañia Metalurgica Mexicana (American),\r\nJoplin-Mexican Mining Co. (American), and the Metallgesellschaft\r\n(German).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Countries.=--The output of lead ore in _Tunis_ in 1913, almost\r\nwholly by French companies, was 56,072 metric tons. It is all exported.\r\n\r\nPractically all the output of lead ore in _Italy_ is derived from the\r\nInglesias district of Sardinia, which in 1915 produced 40,829 metric\r\ntons of ore averaging 55 per cent. lead, out of a total national\r\nproduction of 41,590 metric tons. The principal operators are the\r\nMonteponi and Pertusola companies, the former Italian, the latter\r\nEnglish. The remainder of the ore comes from the provinces of Bergamo,\r\nBrescia Cuneo, and Grosseto, and the operating companies are the\r\nEnglish Crown Spelter Co. (English), and the Societa Austro-Belga and\r\nSociété de la Vieille Montagne (Belgian).\r\n\r\nIn _Czecho-Slovakia_, the most important district is that of Przibram,\r\nin Bohemia. Rich lead ores were once mined at Mies, but the district\r\nis now exhausted. The district of Joachimsthal was for centuries an\r\nimportant producer.\r\n\r\nIn _German-Austria_ are the silver-lead mining districts of Schneeberg,\r\nin Tyrol, and Raibl, in Upper Carinthia. In both districts the mines\r\nwere before the war owned and operated by the Austrian state. Miess, in\r\nCarinthia, is one of the chief sources of ore in recent years.\r\n\r\nThe lead mines of _Great Britain_ in 1916 produced 17,083 tons of\r\ndressed lead ore. The largest operator is the Weardale Lead Co.,\r\noperating the Boltsburn and Stanhopeburn mines and smelting its own\r\nand some custom ores.\r\n\r\nIn _Greece_ the only important lead deposit is that of Laurium, which\r\nwas worked on a large scale in ancient times. It is now controlled and\r\noperated by a French company, the Compagnie Française des Mines de\r\nLaurium.\r\n\r\nThe lead production of _Canada_ is chiefly from British Columbia, the\r\nmost important producers being in the Slocan district. The largest\r\noperator is the Consolidated Mining & Smelting Co. of Canada, Ltd.,\r\nproprietor also of the Trail smelter. This company operates the\r\nSullivan and other mines and produced during the year ended September\r\n30, 1917, 29,542 tons of lead ore from the Sullivan mine, and 1,100 to\r\n1,500 tons from several others. The Sullivan mine has been reported\r\nto have reserves of 3,500,000 tons of galena-sphalerite ore. Numerous\r\nsmaller properties in the same district ship ore to the Trail smelter,\r\nwhich produced some 22,000 tons of lead during the year ended September\r\n30, 1917.\r\n\r\nThe most important lead-silver mines of _Asiatic Turkey_ are those\r\nat Hodsha Gernish (Balia), belonging to the Société des Mines de\r\nBalia-Kara-Aidin (French), which yield about 12,000 tons of lead\r\nannually. There is a state-owned mine at Bulgardagh producing lead,\r\ngold, and silver. The English company, Asia Minor Mining Co., produces\r\nabout 3,000 tons of ore annually.\r\n\r\nIn _China_ the ten lead mines in the Province of Hunan are controlled\r\nby Chinese. The Wah Chang Mining & Smelting Co., Ltd., operates the\r\nTien For Tai mines. The Shui-Ko-Shan mine, controlled by the Hunan\r\nMining Board, from a deposit in limestone, produced in 1913, 51,561\r\nnet tons of ore, which yielded 3,762 tons of lead concentrates and\r\n12,275 tons of zinc concentrates. Since 1913 the production has been\r\nincreased, but the possibilities of the deposit are limited. The\r\nJapanese have endeavored to secure control of this mine, but without\r\nsuccess. The pig-lead output of China is chiefly consumed in the\r\ncountry. The only modern lead smelter is at Changsha and is owned by\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\nThe lead production of _Southwest Africa_ (formerly German) has been\r\nderived chiefly from the Tsumeb deposit in the Grootfontein district\r\nin the Otavi Mountains. The ores exported in the fiscal year 1913-14\r\namounted to 48,000 long tons, averaging 13 per cent. copper, 25 per\r\ncent. lead, and 7.7 ounces silver. The ore is a coarsely crystalline\r\naggregate of argentiferous galena and chalcocite with minor amounts of\r\nother minerals. The Otavi Mines & Railway Co. owns and operates this\r\nmine, the ore having been exported in 1913-14 to the United States for\r\nsmelting.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 all the lead-ore production of _Algeria_ was from the\r\nDepartment of Constantine, and amounted to 21,442 tons. Practically the\r\nwhole production was by French companies.\r\n\r\nLead ore is produced in several scattered districts in _France_,\r\nchiefly in the south. Among the mines are the Chaliac et Chassezac\r\n(Ardeche) mines of the Société Metallurgique et Minière des Cevennes,\r\nproducing 2,200 metric tons in 1913; the mines of the Société Civile\r\ndes Mines des Malines; La Londe mine of the Société des Mines des\r\nBormettes; that of the Société des Mines de Bleymard, producing 2,470\r\ntons of galena ore in 1913; and the Pierrefitte (Haute Pyrenees),\r\nPeybrune, and Bulard de Sentein-Saint Lary (Ariege) mines. All of these\r\nappear to be French companies, except the Pierrefitte, which is English\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\nIn _Burma_, the chief deposits are those of the Bawdwin mines, in the\r\nNorthern Shan States (Burma), now connected with the Burma Railway\r\nfrom Rangoon. The ore bodies of present interest are nearly vertical\r\nshoots in a feldspathic grit (rhyolitic tuff or silicified rhyolite)\r\nand rhyolite series. The Chinaman and the smaller Shan ore body are\r\nbelieved to have been one, though now separated by faulting. Estimated\r\nreserves on December 31, 1917, were 4,033,000 tons of lead-zinc ore\r\nassaying 24.7 ounces of silver, 27.4 per cent. lead, 19.1 per cent.\r\nzinc, and 0.4 per cent. copper; and 105,000 tons of copper-silver ore\r\nassaying 21.0 ounces of silver, 19.9 per cent. lead, 8.8 per cent.\r\nzinc, and 8.9 per cent. copper. Since then development has considerably\r\nincreased these reserves. In addition there is estimated to be\r\n1,600,000 tons of low-grade ore averaging 5.1 ounces of silver, 7.5 per\r\ncent. lead, 4.8 per cent. zinc, and 0.2 per cent. copper per ton, with\r\nexcellent prospects of larger developments. A large tonnage of gossan\r\noutcrop ore containing 4 or 5 ounces silver, 4 to 5 per cent. lead, and\r\na little zinc is cheaply mined and available as siliceous flux. The\r\nessential constituents of the ores are galena and sphalerite with a\r\nlittle pyrite and chalcopyrite. All of the ore is argentiferous.\r\n\r\nThe lead and zinc concentrates are available for the customary methods\r\nof smelting. A zinc-distilling and sulphuric acid plant is being\r\nconstructed at Sakchi, with the aid of the Indian government, to treat\r\nthe table zinc concentrates. Its initial capacity of 25,000 tons of\r\nconcentrates is expected to be increased to 75,000 tons. The company\r\noperates a lead smelter at Nam-Tu, 11 miles from the mines, using a\r\nmixture of ore and ancient slags. Treatment of the middlings by the\r\nGanlin process is proposed and a 100-ton unit is under construction\r\nat Avonmouth, England. The Bawdwin deposits may be expected to be an\r\nimportant factor in the world’s production of lead in the immediate\r\nfuture. They are owned by the Burma Mines, Ltd., an English corporation\r\nrepresenting the R. Tilden Smith-Govett-Hoover interests and some\r\nAmerican capital.\r\n\r\nThe lead production of _Peru_ is largely in the form of ancient\r\nhigh-lead slags from the Cerro de Pasco district, Department of Junin,\r\nshipped to plants of the American Smelting & Refining Co. in the\r\nUnited States. Lead occurs as a minor constituent of copper deposits.\r\n\r\nThe domestic lead-ore deposits of _Japan_ are all owned and operated\r\nby Japanese. During the war Australian concentrates and Chinese ore\r\nwere imported and smelted, 10,666 short tons of the former, carrying\r\n56 per cent. lead, during the fiscal year 1915-16, and 9,829 short\r\ntons of the latter during the year 1916. The Fujita company, mining\r\nin Japan, Korea, and Formosa, produces 382 short tons of lead yearly.\r\nIts principal mine is the Kosaka, at the northern end of Hondo, the\r\nmain island of Japan. The ore is a complex sulphide mixture of lead,\r\nzinc, iron, and copper minerals. The annual output of this mine is\r\nabout 335 short tons of lead. The Mitsui Mining Co., Ltd., is the\r\nlargest producer, its output in 1915 having been 3,561, and in 1916,\r\n8,098 short tons of pig lead. This is derived wholly from the Kamioka\r\nzinc-lead mine, in the Province of Hida, on a contact metamorphic\r\ndeposit in limestone lenses enclosed in Archean gneiss near a quartz\r\nporphyry contact.\r\n\r\nThe only deposit exploited in _Egypt_ is that known to the ancients,\r\nGebel Rosas, now operated by the French company, Compagnie Française\r\ndes Mines de Laurium. As regards the former empire of _Russia_, the\r\nlead production of _Russian Poland_ and the Caucasus Mountains is\r\nsmall, the output in 1913 coming chiefly from the Caucasus Mountains\r\nand being made by the Elboruss Co., and the Compagnie d’Alagir\r\n(Belgian).\r\n\r\nIn the Altai Mountains, in _Siberia_, a zinc-lead-silver deposit, the\r\nZmeinogorsk, formerly belonging to the Russian Mining Corporation\r\n(British), is now owned by a Russian company, Altai Mines, Ltd., though\r\npart of the capital is probably British. The Nerchinski district,\r\nin eastern Siberia, comprises many known deposits. The Akatonevski,\r\nKadaenski, Algachinski and Klichinski deposits are veins, whereas many\r\nof the Zerentniski, Gasimoura Valley, Koultoumski and Maltzevski are\r\nlenticular masses of disseminated ore. In the Kadaenski deposits two\r\nmassive disseminated ore bodies occur in dolomite between two veins.\r\nThese deposits were controlled by the Imperial Cabinet, and their\r\nexploitation was being seriously considered by British and American\r\ncapital shortly before the revolution. The deposits of largest present\r\nimportance in Siberia are those of the Ridder Mining Co., controlled\r\nby the Irtysh Corporation of London, which has developed two mines,\r\nthe Ridder and the Sokolni, on the same mineralized zone. The deposits\r\nare replacements by complex sulphide ore of members of a conformable\r\nseries of slates, tuffs, and igneous sills. In 1916 the reserves were\r\nestimated at 945,000 tons of a grade of 31.2 per cent. zinc, 18.1 per\r\ncent. lead, 1.5 per cent. copper, 9.7 ounces of silver, and 0.47 ounces\r\nof gold; and also 2,229,000 tons averaging 6.7 per cent. zinc, 3.5 per\r\ncent. lead, 0.5 per cent. copper, 1.7 ounces of silver, and 0.7 ounces\r\nof gold per ton. Other known mineralized zones have not been developed,\r\nbut the possibilities of the property are immense, being limited\r\nchiefly by general political and economic conditions.\r\n\r\nA small quantity of lead is produced in _Bulgaria_ from a few small\r\ndeposits containing intimate mixtures of lead, copper and zinc\r\nminerals; usually either zinc or copper predominate.\r\n\r\nThe most important lead deposit in _Sweden_ is the Sala, in\r\nVestmanland, where irregular masses and veins of galena and blende with\r\nminor amounts of pyrite, etc. occur in limestone. Similar deposits\r\noccur at Lofas and Guldmedshyttan.\r\n\r\n_Hungary_ has no lead mines of importance, although galena occurs in\r\nsome of the veins exploited, notably at Schemnitz, where the larger\r\nmines are the property of the Hungarian state.\r\n\r\nMost of the ore from _Bolivia_ exported to the United States comes from\r\nthe Majo mine, which produced 884 tons, lead content, in 1912. This\r\nmine is in southern Bolivia in the region of La Quiaca.\r\n\r\nThe most important lead-producing area in _Portugal_ is Merlota, near\r\nthe Guadiana River, where silver-bearing galena and oxidized ores\r\nare found. Other districts are those of Villa Real, Vizen, Aveiro,\r\nPortalagre, and Beja. The deposits are similar to those of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe only deposit of importance in _Rhodesia_ (South Africa) is the\r\nRhodesia Broken Hill. The large ore bodies are, so far as developed,\r\nalmost wholly oxidized. One ore body is estimated to contain 250,000\r\nlong tons of ore averaging 26 per cent. lead and 22.5 per cent. zinc;\r\nanother ore body is estimated to contain 300,000 long tons, averaging\r\n32 per cent. zinc, with little lead, but much iron oxide and carbonate.\r\nThese ore bodies are controlled by British capital. Considerable\r\ndifficulty has been experienced in developing a commercial treatment.\r\nReports indicate this deposit is of greater magnitude than is generally\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nThe most important lead deposit of _Belgium_, or rather of the neutral\r\ndistrict of Moresnet adjoining Belgium, belonged to the Belgian\r\ncompany, Société de la Vieille Montagne at Moresnet. It was exhausted\r\nin 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Changes in Geographical Distribution of Production in the Near\r\nFuture.=--No marked change in the pre-war rate of production of ores by\r\nthe countries of Europe or northern Africa is anticipated when normal\r\nconditions are resumed. Most of the districts in those countries have\r\nbeen exploited a long time and have passed their zenith of production;\r\nmany are approaching exhaustion. A possible exception to this statement\r\nis the Ciudad Real Province of Spain, which is being energetically\r\ndeveloped by the Penarroya company. The division of Austria-Hungary\r\nwill not materially affect the control of the lead industry.\r\n\r\nThe United States will continue to be the largest source of lead in\r\nthe world, and the only change anticipated is a slight increase in the\r\nrelative importance of the hard-lead output of the Western States.\r\n\r\nThe chief new factor in production will be the Bawdwin mines of Burma,\r\nwhich are being developed on a large scale for the production of\r\n300,000 tons of ore annually.\r\n\r\nRecent developments in the Altai Mountains of southwestern Siberia\r\nhave proved immense bodies of complex zinc-lead ores. Their geographic\r\nisolation will prevent them from becoming an important factor in the\r\nworld market for a long period, notwithstanding their large size and\r\nexcellent grade. The extent of their exploitation will be determined\r\nlargely by how far the Russian market is affected by internal social\r\nand political conditions. The loss of the Polish industrial region,\r\nwith its market protected by stringent tariffs, materially restricts\r\nthe extent of visible outlets.\r\n\r\nIn the future, but not soon, it is anticipated that there will be\r\ndevelopments in the Andes region of South America of complex lead-ore\r\ndeposits similar to those of the Western United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nPolitical control of the lead resources of the world up to the outbreak\r\nof the war in 1914 seems to have been a minor factor in the industry,\r\nand to have made itself felt chiefly through imposition of protective\r\ntariffs or bonuses designed to stimulate domestic production, smelting,\r\nand refining. Such measures resulted in the establishment of lead\r\nsmelting in British Columbia and were an inducement to the development\r\nof the Altai district of Siberia. As will be described later in detail,\r\nthe growth of international commercial relations had permitted the\r\nestablishment by German interests of organizations which, although not\r\nall-inclusive, gave effective control of the industry.\r\n\r\nDuring the World War, however, political jurisdiction was largely\r\ninvoked to restore control of national resources to citizens. This\r\nmovement was particularly marked in the British Empire, where there\r\nnow exists a joint political and commercial control. Alien interests\r\nhave been eliminated by governmental action and the government retains\r\na share in the control through its interest in marketing organizations\r\nor its financial participation in reduction works. In France, the\r\nconsortium Société Minerais et Metaux, organized by government action,\r\nis the arbiter of the industry and comprises all the important French\r\ncompanies both at home and abroad. In the United States the Alien\r\nProperty Custodian was active in eliminating all enemy-alien interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nCopper, lead, and zinc form a class by themselves, with respect to\r\nindustrial utility and tonnage produced, ranking after iron, which far\r\noutclasses them, as the most important base metals. The total yearly\r\nproduction of each throughout the world is considerably more than a\r\nmillion tons.\r\n\r\nTABLE 53.--ORE PRODUCTION, SMELTING, AND CONSUMPTION OF LEAD IN 1913\r\n\r\n(Tons of 2,000 Pounds)\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-------------------------------------------+\r\n                     |     Recoverable lead content of ores      |\r\n                     |             and concentrates              |\r\n                     +---------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n                     |               |             |             |\r\n                     |Mine production|   Exports   |    Imports  |\r\n                     +---------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-----+\r\n                     |         |  Per|       |  Per|       |  Per|\r\n                     |   Net   |cent.|  Net  |cent.|   Net |cent.|\r\n      Country        |  tons   |[130]|  tons |[130]|  tons |[130]|\r\n  -------------------+---------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-----+\r\n  Algeria            |   12,900|  1.0| 12,900|  1.0|  ...  |  ...|\r\n  Australia          | {244,500| 19.7|132,000| 10.6|  ...  |  ...|\r\n                     | {  [133]|     |       |     |       |     |\r\n  Austria-Hungary    |   23,800|  1.9|  ...  |  ...|  2,800|  0.2|\r\n  Belgium            |    ...  |  ...|  ...  |  ...| 56,000|  4.5|\r\n  Bolivia            |    1,100|  0.1|  1,100|  0.1|  ...  |  ...|\r\n  Bulgaria           |    2,200|  0.2|  2,200|  0.2|  ...  |  ...|\r\n  Canada             |   18,800|  1.5|  ...  |  ...|  ...  |  ...|\r\n  China              |   14,000|  1.1| 14,000|  1.1|  ...  |  ...|\r\n  Egypt              |    3,200|  0.3|  3,200|  0.3|  ...  |  ...|\r\n  France             |    9,600|  0.8|  ...  |  ...| 21,300|  1.7|\r\n  German S.

Most of the large smelter interests\r\nengage in, or have subsidiaries engaged in, mining or have sufficient\r\nholdings in large mining companies to influence their smelting\r\ncontracts. The actual basis of control of the industry is, therefore,\r\noften through combined ownership or control of mines and of reduction\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThe ownership or control of reduction plants has been the dominating\r\nfactor in the commercial control of the industry. The production of\r\neach country in 1913, the principal lead reduction works of the world,\r\nand their affiliations and control are discussed below.\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--The control of the lead industry of the United States\r\nthrough ownership or control is vested in ten groups as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The Morgan-Guggenheim group, comprising the American Smelting &\r\nRefining Co.; American Smelters Securities Co.; and their subsidiaries:\r\nSelby Smelting & Lead Co.; Tacoma Smelting Co.; Garfield Smelting Co.;\r\nConsolidated Kansas City Smelting & Refining Co.; Federal Lead Co.;\r\nFederal Mining & Smelting Co.; Western Mining Co.; Silver Lake Mining\r\nCo.; and the Yak Mining, Milling & Tunnel Co.\r\n\r\n2. The St. Joseph Lead Co.\r\n\r\n3. National Lead Co.; St. Louis Smelting & Refining Co.; United Lead Co.\r\n\r\n4. The Rockefeller-Ryan group, comprising the International Smelting\r\nCo.--Tooele smelter, Utah; and the International Lead Refining\r\nCo.,--refinery at East Chicago, Ind.\r\n\r\n5. The United States Smelting, Refining & Mining Co. group, comprising\r\nthe United States Smelting Co.--Mid vale smelter, Utah; U. S. Metals\r\nRefining Co.,--electrolytic lead refinery at Grasselli, Ind.; Needles\r\nMining & Smelting Co.,--zinc-lead custom concentrator at Needles,\r\nCalif.; Bingham Mines Co. and other mines in Utah (Bullion, Beck,\r\nChampion, Utah-Apex, Centennial-Eureka and Tintic); Sunnyside and Gold\r\nPrince mines at Silverton, Colorado, and formerly a half interest in\r\nInternational Metals Selling Co.; and the Leadville Unit.\r\n\r\n6. The Day group, comprising the Northport Smelting & Refining Co.;\r\nPennsylvania Smelting & Refining Co.; Hercules Mining Co.; Tamarack &\r\nCuster Mining Co.; and the Amazon-Manhattan mines et al.\r\n\r\n7. The American Metal Co. group, controlling the Ohio & Colorado\r\nSmelting Co. (owning 65 per cent. of its stock), and the Balbach\r\nSmelting & Refining Co. (owning one-third of its capital stock and\r\nselling the entire output).\r\n\r\n8. Hayden-Stone-Clark-Coolidge group, comprising the American Zinc,\r\nLead & Smelting Co.; American Zinc Co. of Tennessee; American Zinc. Co\r\nof Wisconsin; American Zinc Co. of Illinois; Granby Mining & Smelting\r\nCo. of Missouri; and the Butte & Superior Mining Co.\r\n\r\n9. The Eagle-Picher group, comprising the Eagle-Picher Lead Co.,\r\nJoplin, Mo. with smelter at Joplin, Mo., and controlling the Galena\r\nSmelting & Manufacturing Co., Galena, Kan.; and the Webb City Smelting\r\n& Manufacturing Co., Webb City, Mo.\r\n\r\n10. The Bunker Hill & Sullivan Mining & Concentrating Co., controlled\r\nby Bradley-Crocker interests, and probably representing a certain\r\nproportion of English capital.\r\n\r\n11. The Desloge Consolidated Lead Co., which formerly operated its own\r\nsmelter but now has its ores smelted on toll by the Federal Lead Co.\r\nand markets its own lead.\r\n\r\nAll of the above companies are owned and controlled by American\r\ncitizens so far as known, except certain interests in the American\r\nMetal Co. and perhaps the Bunker Hill & Sullivan Mining & Concentrating\r\nCo.\r\n\r\nThe American Metal Co. has 70,000 shares of capital stock, of which\r\n34,644 shares were owned by the Metallgesellschaft, one of the German\r\n“Trio,” 18,620 shares belong to Germans who have become naturalized\r\nAmerican citizens and have had the management, and the remaining 16,736\r\nbelonged to Henry L. Merton & Co., of London, a firm that is in process\r\nof liquidation. The Alien Property Custodian took over the 34,644\r\nshares referred to above and sold them at public auction. The control\r\nof the company is vested in three voting trustees selected by agreement\r\nbetween the Alien Property Custodian and the American shareholders.\r\n\r\nVogelstein & Co. at one time linked groups 5, 7, 8, and 10, chiefly\r\nthrough selling contracts. Vogelstein & Co. owned the International\r\nMetals Selling Co., formerly marketing the production of the United\r\nStates Smelting, Mining & Refining Co., but this connection is now\r\nbroken. A contract for sale of the entire output of the American Zinc,\r\nLead & Smelting Co. was held by L. Vogelstein & Co., partly owned by\r\nAron Hirsch & Sohn, another member of the great German metal combine.\r\nL. Vogelstein & Co. (Inc). was seized by the Alien Property Custodian\r\nand was controlled by five directors, two of whom were appointees of\r\nthe Custodian.[136] The operative control of the Bunker Hill & Sullivan\r\nMining & Concentrating Co. is vested in Americans, but Vogelstein & Co.\r\nsells the output. Groups 5 and 8 are probably linked to some extent by\r\nlarge stockholders in common, Clark & Coolidge of Boston.\r\n\r\n  [136] L. Vogelstein is reported to have sold his interests to the\r\n  American Metal Co. and subsequently, early in 1920, to have acquired\r\n  a fifth interest in that company.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the activities of the Alien Property Custodian, the\r\nownership and control of substantially all the mines and reduction\r\nworks in the United States are vested in American citizens.

This gives the Penarroya company a dominant position in the\r\nSpanish lead industry. English interests, E. J. Enthoven & Co., have\r\na smelter producing about 25,000 short tons of lead annually. All the\r\nsmelting companies have made a combination to stop competition in ore\r\nbuying. The Spanish government imposes a duty of about $1.80 per ton on\r\nlead concentrates exported.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australia.=--Smelting plants in Australia that produce lead have the\r\ncapacities shown below.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+-----------------------------+----------------\r\n                        |                             |1913 production,\r\n                        |                             |   short tons\r\n         Company        |          Location           |    pig lead\r\n  ----------------------+-----------------------------+----------------\r\n  Broken Hill Associated|                             |\r\n  Smelters              |Port Pirie, South Australia  |    92,824\r\n  Sulphide Corporation  |Cockle Creek, New South Wales|    19,660\r\n                        |                             +----------------\r\n    Total               |                             |   112,484\r\n  ----------------------+-----------------------------+----------------\r\n\r\nThe annual capacity of the Port Pirie plant is now 165,000 short tons\r\nof pig lead.\r\n\r\nTABLE 56.--SILVER LEAD SMELTERS IN MEXICO\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------+--------------+----------+---------\r\n                                    |              |          |  Annual\r\n                                    |              |          | capacity\r\n                                    |              | Number of| tons of\r\n              Company               |   Location   | furnaces |  charge\r\n  ----------------------------------+--------------+----------+---------\r\n  American Smelting & Refining Co.  |Monterrey     | 7        |  410,000\r\n  American Smelting & Refining Co.  |Aguascalientes| 1 (lead) |   40,000\r\n  American Smelting & Refining Co.  |Chihuahua     | 7        |  400,000\r\n  American Smelters Securities Co.  |Velardeña     | 3        |  150,000\r\n  Compañia de Minerales y Metales   |Cerralvo      | 2        |   35,000\r\n  Compañia de Minerales y Metales   |Guadalupe,    | 1        |   70,000\r\n                                    |N.

Prior to the war several of these\r\nwere controlled by German interests through the American Metal Co.\r\n(incorporated in the United States), but the action of the Alien\r\nProperty Custodian eliminated all foreign control in those companies,\r\nwhich comprise Compañia Minera de Peñoles, Compañia de Minerales y\r\nMetales, and Compañia Metalurgica de Torreon, leaving only the Compañia\r\nFundadora y Refinadora de Monterrey still under German control. The\r\nAmerican Metal Co. normally controlled 60,000 to 75,000 tons of bonded\r\nMexican lead and 12,000 to 15,000 tons of lead smelted in Mexico,\r\ntogether with over a thousand tons of antimonial lead.\r\n\r\nThe Aguascalientes and Velardeña plants are chiefly copper smelters.\r\nThere are small lead smelters at Terrazas and Santa Rosalia, Chihuahua,\r\nbut they are probably abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n=British Isles.=--During the war the British lead-smelting capacity\r\nis reported to have been increased. Before the war a large amount of\r\nforeign lead bullion from Spain, Belgium and Germany was desilverized\r\nin the British Isles.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Countries.=--The lead-smelting plants of _France_ escaped\r\ndestruction during the war, being outside the war zone. The capacity\r\nof the Pontgibaud plant was greatly increased. They are all French\r\nowned. The most important lead smelting plant in _Italy_ is that of\r\nthe Societa di Pertusola (English), with a pig-lead output in 1915 of\r\n16,625 metric tons; the other plant is that of the Societa di Monteponi\r\n(Italian), with an output of 5,187 tons. The only lead smelting of\r\n_Greece_ is that of the Compagnie des Mines de Laurium (French).\r\n\r\nThe only important lead smelter of _Canada_ is that of Trail, British\r\nColumbia, which is controlled by the Canadian government. This plant\r\nincludes a refinery using the Betts electrolytic process.\r\n\r\nThe only lead smelter in _Turkey_ is one controlled by French\r\ninterests, that of the Société des Mines de Balia-Kara-Aidin, at\r\nKara-Aidin. The lead smelting plant of the Burma Mines Corporation,\r\nLtd., at Bawdwin, _Burma_, has a capacity of 22,000 short tons lead.\r\n\r\nIn _Siberia_ the Ridder Mining Co., controlled by the Irtysh\r\nCorporation, of London, has constructed 165 miles of railroad,\r\nwhich, together with river transport, brings the ore from the Ridder\r\nconcession and the coal of the Ekibastus coal fields to the smelting\r\nplant at Ermak, which has a capacity of 15,000 tons of lead annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trade Combinations.=--National and even international control of the\r\nlead market has at times been attained through marketing organizations\r\nor trade combinations of reduction works, ore-buying and metal-selling\r\nagencies with interlocking directorates, joint ownership, and long-term\r\ncontracts for ores, concentrates, and metals.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 the so-called Lead Convention, or officially the International\r\nSales Association, was formed in Paris. It was composed of German,\r\nSpanish, and Belgian producers and metal-selling agencies controlling\r\ndirectly about one-half of the European production. Some companies not\r\nnominally in the association acted in concert with it. This convention\r\nwas renewed in 1910 and again in 1913 for three years. The association\r\nwas dominated by the same interests as the German Zinc Syndicate,--the\r\nMerton group, comprising the Metallgesellschaft, the Metallbank and\r\nMetallurgische Gesellschaft of Frankfort and the Merton companies\r\nof London; Beer, Sondheimer & Co., controlling a dozen German metal\r\nand chemical concerns, and Aron Hirsch & Sohn at Halberstadt. The\r\nMerton group of London and Frankfort were the selling agents of the\r\nassociation, and the dominant “Trio,” through the Australian Metal Co.,\r\ncontrolled the lead exported as metal or concentrates from Australia.\r\n\r\nIn the United States and Mexico all lead exported was controlled by the\r\nAmerican Metal Co., affiliated with the association, or the American\r\nSmelting & Refining Co., acting in concert with it. The German “Trio”\r\nmaintained and was rapidly extending and strengthening its ascendancy\r\nthroughout the world through banks, holding companies, affiliations\r\nwith syndicates and cartels, interlocking directorates, joint share\r\nholdings and purchase in whole or in part of mines and smelters.\r\nSome of the English lead refineries were closely associated with the\r\nConvention, and all lead exported from the Port Pirie smelter was sold\r\nby Merton & Co. The association was able to fix the price of lead\r\nin Europe and thus affect the output and, it has been claimed, so\r\nmanipulated the market that lead outside the Convention was controlled\r\njust as effectively as that inside. The membership was international,\r\nbrought together by mercenary motives. That the strongest and most\r\naggressive interests were German citizens was purely incidental.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the war, however, the production of Australian lead\r\nconcentrates and bullion is permanently diverted from German control.\r\nThe activities of the Alien Property Custodian tended to eliminate\r\nall German interests in the United States. Most of the Australian\r\nlead bullion production is now marketed by the Broken Hill Associated\r\nSmelters, Prop., Ltd., of whose capital stock the Broken Hill\r\nProprietary owns one-third and the Broken Hill South, Broken Hill\r\nNorth, and Zinc Corporation each own two-ninths. The plant of this\r\ncompany is now the largest smelter in the world.\r\n\r\nThe nationalist movement in France resulted in the formation of trade\r\nassociations known as “consortiums,” comprising the principal factor in\r\neach industry. These “consortiums,” were recognized by the government,\r\nand each was made virtually arbiter of its particular field. The\r\nconsortium of the mineral industry has been perfected into the Société\r\nMinerals et Metaux, 154 Boulevard Hausmann, Paris. The official\r\nannouncement states that this society is organized under the auspices\r\nof the French government in order to group the French metal producers\r\noperating both at home and abroad into a co-operative association for\r\nthe purchase and sale of metallurgical products.\r\n\r\nThe participants comprise the principal companies in France producing\r\nor refining metals and also the mining and smelting companies\r\ncontrolled by French capital in Spain, Algeria, Tunis, and other\r\nforeign countries. A highly centralized organization of that part of\r\nthe mineral and metal industry under French control is thus achieved\r\nfor mutual protection and advantage in competition with other\r\nnationalities. Members of this organization will produce most of the\r\nore from Algiers and Tunis and probably 75 per cent. of the Spanish\r\nlead bullion. The present annual output of the participating companies\r\nis about 200,000 metric tons of lead, 50,000 metric tons of zinc, and\r\n40,000 tons of copper, besides iron, antimony, platinum, etc. The\r\nassociation comprises the following companies: Société Minière et\r\nMetallurgique de Penarroya; Société d’Affinage de Metaux; Compagnie\r\ndes Mines d’Ain-Barbar; Association Minière; Société des Mines de Zinc\r\nd’Ain-Arko; Compagnie du Boleo; Compagnie Française des Mines de Bor;\r\nCorocoro United Copper Mines, Ltd.; Société des Mines de Fedj-el-Adoum;\r\nSociété des Mines de Zinc de Guergour; Compagnie des Mines de Huaron;\r\nSociété Minière du Kanguet; Compagnie des Minerais de Fer Magnetique\r\nde Mokta-et-Hadid; Comptoir Lyon Allemand; Société Anonyme des Mines\r\nde Malfidano; Compagnie des Mines d’Ouasta et de Desloula; Société des\r\nMines de Parzan; Compagnie Industrielle du Platine; Société Anonyme\r\ndes Mines et Fonderies de Pontgibaud; Société des Mines d’Antimoine\r\nde Rochetrejoux; Société des Anciens Etablissements Sopwith;\r\nSociété Française d’Etudes et d’Enterprises; Société des Mines du\r\nDjebel-Ressas; Société Anonyme Française du Djebel-Hallouf; Société\r\nAnonyme des Mines et Usines de Peyrebrune; and Compagnie La Cruz.\r\n\r\nOne of the results of the war was the stimulation of co-operative\r\nenterprises between British companies, the movement being encouraged\r\nby the government, which in some cases participated financially. The\r\nBritish Australian Lead Manufacturers Proprietary, Ltd., was formed\r\nas a consolidation of the Australian interests of British firms, with\r\nthe object of establishing a white-lead industry in that country.\r\nThose participating comprise: Alexander Ferguson & Co.; Cookson & Co.;\r\nFoster, Blockett & Wilson; Locke, Blockett & Co.; Locke-Lancaster; W.\r\nW. & R. Johnson & Sons, Ltd.; Mersey White Lead Co., Ltd.; and Walkers\r\nParker & Co.\r\n\r\nThe Chloride Syndicate comprising the Zinc Corporation, Ltd., Burma\r\nMines Corporation, and the Swansea Vale Smelter, Ltd., is conducting\r\nexperimental work on the Ganlin process with the object of perfecting\r\nit.\r\n\r\nRichard Tilden Smith, having acquired controlling interests in J. H.\r\nEnthoven & Sons, Locke-Lancaster, Walkers Parker & Co. and a one-third\r\ninterest in the Burma Mines Corporation, became a strong link between\r\nthese important companies and thus secured an arrangement with the\r\nImperial Government for financial assistance with the new plant of the\r\nNational Smelting Co., Ltd., at Avonmouth to the extent of £500,000\r\nout of the total estimated cost of £750,000, the government being\r\nparticularly interested in the production of by-product acid. The\r\nNational Smelting Co. agreed to take 25,000 tons yearly of Broken Hill\r\nconcentrate and smelt no foreign ore without government permission.\r\nEnthoven & Sons control through ownership the output of one of the\r\nSpanish smelters and through desilverizing and marketing contracts the\r\noutput of the French Laurium company of Greece. An attempt to bring\r\nabout a closer combination of all the above-mentioned English and\r\nAustralian companies failed.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that in 1917 Vivian, Younger & Bond, and Morgan,\r\nGrenfeld & Co. were instrumental in forming a “Metal Bank” in London.\r\nBroken Hill Associated Smelters Prop. Ltd., and the Penarroya company\r\nwere said to have agreed to market their production through this bank,\r\nbut it is probable that the arrangement was never made effective. A\r\nChemical and Metallurgical Bank has been formed in London, among the\r\nshareholders being Richard Tilden Smith. Its proposed field is not\r\nclear, but it will probably endeavor to influence the control of lead\r\nin the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nA British Metals Corporation was formed in 1918 by Vivian, Younger &\r\nBond, Chas. Tennant Sons & Co., Cookson & Co., the British Aluminum\r\nCo., Morgan, Grenfeld & Co., and large stockholders of the Rio Tinto\r\nCo., with a capital of £5,000,000. The Imperial Treasury will be\r\nrepresented on the board of directors. The purposes are to finance\r\nBritish non-ferrous metal companies, bring all the production within\r\nthe empire of those metals under one marketing organization and\r\npreserve British control. If plans are successfully carried out, the\r\nsmelting both in England and on the Continent of Europe, should any\r\nBritish concentrates be allotted there, will practically be on toll,\r\nthe metal remaining in the control of the Metals Corporation or the\r\naffiliated bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE GREAT NATIONS\r\n\r\nThe accompanying table presents available statistics of production\r\nsince 1913 in order to show the extent to which the industry in each\r\ncountry is controlled by domestic or foreign capital, and attempts to\r\nshow the extent of commercial control by each of the great powers. Such\r\nstatistics are at best only approximate; the control varies from year\r\nto year and the data are difficult to obtain and verify.\r\n\r\nTABLE 57.--COMMERCIAL CONTROL OF THE WORLD’S OUTPUT OF PIG LEAD\r\n\r\n  ----------+---------+----+-----+--------------------------------------\r\n            |  Recent |    |     |\r\n            | pig-lead|    |     |       Financial control by\r\n            |   pro-  |    | Per +------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n            |  duction|    |cent.| Home |       |       |       |\r\n            |  (short |    | of  | cap- | United| Great |       |\r\n    Country |   tons) |Year|world| ital | States|Britain| France|Germany\r\n  ----------+---------+----+-----+------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  United    |         |    |     |      |       |       |       |\r\n  States    |  612,200|1917| 44.6| ...  |612,200|       |       |\r\n  Australia |  127,800|1913|  9.4| ...  |   ... |127,800|       |\r\n  British   |         |    |     |      |       |       |       |\r\n  Isles     |   12,600|1916|  0.9| ...  |   ... | 12,600|       |\r\n  Canada    |   20,400|1916|  1.5| ...  |   ... | 20,400|       |\r\n  Burma     |   20,000|1917|  1.5| ...  |   ... | 20,000|       |\r\n  France    |   30,800|1913|  2.2| ...  |   ... |  ...  | 30,800|\r\n  Italy     |   24,000| ...|  1.8| 5,700|   ... | 18,300|       |\r\n  Belgium   |   39,400|1913|  2.9|15,000|   ... |  ...  | 24,400|\r\n  Venezuela |      200|1917|  ...| ...  |   ... |  ...  |  ...  |    200\r\n  Bolivia   |    2,400|1917|  0.2|   400|   ... |  ...  |  2,000|\r\n  Greece    |   12,800|1916|  0.9| ...  |   ... |  ...  | 12,800|\r\n  Japan     |   12,300|1916|  0.9|12,300|       |       |       |\r\n  Peru      |    3,000|1917|  0.2|   500|    500|  2,000|       |\r\n  Russia    |    1,100|1913|  0.1| 1,100|       |       |       |\r\n  Chile     |    6,000|1917|  0.4| 3,000|  ...  |  1,000|  ...  |  2,000\r\n  Mexico    |   61,200|1913|  4.4| ...  | 53,200|  8,000|       |\r\n  Spain     |  157,000|1917| 11.4|20,000|  ...  | 25,000|105,000|  7,000\r\n  Sweden    |    2,100|1915|  0.1| 1,100|  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  1,000\r\n  Germany   |  200,000|1913| 14.5| ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |200,000\r\n  Austria-  |         |    |     |      |       |       |       |\r\n  Hungary   |   26,600|1913|  1.9|26,600|       |       |       |\r\n            +---------+----+-----+------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n    Total   |1,371,900| ...|100.0|      |665,900|235,100|175,000|210,200\r\n            +---------+----+-----+------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Per cent. |         |    |     |      |       |       |       |\r\n  of world  |         |    |     |      |       |       |       |\r\n  produc-   |         |    |     |      |       |       |       |\r\n  tion.     |         |    |100.0|      |  48.6 |  17.2 |  12.7 |  16.3\r\n  ----------+---------+----+-----+------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--During the war the United States demonstrated\r\nthat its lead-ore deposits were capable of a production greatly in\r\nexcess of the normal. That the increase was not greater was chiefly\r\nbecause of insufficient incentive in the market price of lead, which\r\ndid not attain the early inflation of many of the other metals; and\r\nlater, when the price was right, was restricted by lack of refining\r\ncapacity. The existing capacity was at times not fully utilized because\r\nof the congestion of railway traffic. The lead-ore deposits in the\r\nUnited States have large possibilities, but with the exception of the\r\ndisseminated lead deposits of southeastern Missouri the developed ore\r\nreserves will supply production for only a few years. Control of the\r\nmines in the United States is vested almost exclusively in Americans\r\nor American companies, some of the latter, however, having foreign\r\nstockholders, chiefly British or Canadian.\r\n\r\nThe United States imports lead ores, to a small percentage of its\r\ntotal production, from Mexico, Canada, South America and Africa. The\r\nMexican ore is largely imported to meet the especial needs of the El\r\nPaso lead smelter, and not because of lack of smelting capacity in\r\nMexico. The smelting capacity of the United States has always been\r\nin excess of the actual production of ore and is now very greatly in\r\nexcess of the normal production. The ownership of most of the important\r\nsmelters has always been vested in American capital, and as a result\r\nof the activity of the Alien Property Custodian all of them are now\r\nowned and controlled by American citizens. A considerable amount of\r\nlead bullion is imported, chiefly from Mexico, for refining. Most\r\nof this is re-exported. United States capital through ownership of\r\nsmelters controls the greater part of the pig lead produced in Mexico\r\nand Peru. The importation of ore and bullion for refining from Canada\r\nis restricted by the government bounty on lead smelted and refined in\r\nCanada. United States capital also controls a considerable percentage\r\nof the mines of Mexico and has some interest in the Burma Mines\r\nCorporation, and the Irtysh Corporation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the enlarged smelting capacity and the possibilities\r\nof production from American mines, it is not expected that there\r\nwill be any considerable export of domestic lead after the period of\r\nreadjustment following the World War.\r\n\r\n\r\n=British Empire.=--The countries of the British Empire in the order\r\nof the importance of their lead output in 1913 are Australia, British\r\nIsles, Canada, Burma, and Egypt.\r\n\r\nBritish capital controls the mines and smelters of the British Isles,\r\nCanada, Australia, Burma, and the Altai Mountains in Siberia, and, by\r\nownership of mines and smelters, some 25,000 tons of lead annually from\r\nSpain and over 70 per cent. of the production of Italy. By contracts\r\nfor desilverization and marketing it has controlled the greater part of\r\nthe Spanish output and part of the production of Greece. It is reported\r\nalso to control small tonnages of ore from Peru and Chile. In view of\r\nthe recent increase of refining capacity in Spain by the Penarroya\r\ncompany (French), and the organization of all French interests into\r\nthe Société Minerais et Metaux, future control by English capital of\r\nSpanish output above the 25,000 tons produced by the English smelter\r\nis doubtful, although it has been reported that the Penarroya company\r\nhad agreed to market its lead through the new Metal Bank of London.\r\nPrior to the war much base bullion from Spain, Belgium, and Germany was\r\nimported and desilverized, and in large part re-exported.\r\n\r\nThe ore production of the British Empire is about 25 per cent. greater\r\nthan its consumption, but insufficient smelting capacity has caused\r\ndependence on foreign-smelted lead. The smelting capacity has been\r\nincreased, and the additional capacity contemplated will make the total\r\nequal the consumption. The empire can be made independent of the rest\r\nof the world should the policy of “Imperial preference” be adopted.\r\n\r\nAll the large interests in the lead industry of the British Empire\r\nhave shown during the war period a strong tendency to co-operate and\r\norganize for mutual protection and benefit. A culmination of this\r\nmovement is apparently the formation of the British Metals Corporation,\r\nintended to vest the marketing control of the production of the whole\r\nBritish Empire in one organization under governmental auspices.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Australia._--The Australian production of lead ore and concentrates,\r\nderived chiefly from New South Wales, makes Australia rank second in\r\nworld production of lead ores. In 1913 little more than half the output\r\nwas exported to Europe for smelting, the remainder being smelted at\r\nCockle Creek and Port Pirie. The pig lead produced, less a small local\r\nconsumption, was also exported.\r\n\r\nAustralian mines have always been owned by British and Australian\r\ncapital. Prior to the war the marketing of concentrates and of all lead\r\nbullion exported was controlled by the Australian Metal Co., affiliated\r\nwith the German metal “Trio” headed by the Metallgesellschaft. During\r\nthe war, however, the governments of Great Britain and Australia\r\nannulled the long-time ore- and metal-purchasing contracts, and the ore\r\nproducers and smelters have organized for mutual protection and to keep\r\nthe industry permanently under exclusive British control. The capacity\r\nof the Port Pirie reduction works has been increased by capital\r\ncontributed jointly by the principal mining companies, and the plant is\r\nnow the largest lead smelter in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_British Isles._--The small output of lead ore in Great Britain is\r\nobtained from a few scattered deposits of little importance. Some ore\r\nis imported and smelted with the domestic production. The consumption\r\nof the British Isles is so large that very large imports of pig lead\r\nare necessary, amounting to 14 per cent. of the world’s production.\r\nAll of the mines and smelters of the British Isles are owned and\r\ncontrolled, so far as known, by British capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canada._--With the assistance, through bounties, of the Canadian\r\ngovernment, the Trail smelter has become firmly established and is the\r\nonly important lead producer of Canada. It handles most of the British\r\nColumbia output of ores, which otherwise would have to go to the United\r\nStates for reduction. The Canadian consumption is, however, about\r\none-third greater than the production.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Burma._--Although the production of ore and pig lead in the Northern\r\nShan States by the Burma Mines Corporation was in 1913 an insignificant\r\npart of the world’s output, the company has developed its deposits so\r\nas to be capable of a very much greater yield, which may amount in the\r\nnear future to 75,000 tons annually. This company is controlled by\r\nBritish with probably some American capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Egypt._--The small ore production of Egypt is exported for smelting\r\nand is controlled by French capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany.=--Germany, a large producer of lead ores, imported in 1913\r\nfor smelting nearly 10 per cent. of the world’s output and in addition\r\nimported a considerable amount of pig lead, being the second largest\r\nconsumer of lead in the world. Should Germany lose Upper Silesia, which\r\nproduced nearly half the domestic ores, it will be still more dependent\r\non imports to supply its smelters. Prior to the war the German lead\r\nindustry was closely organized, much of the lead mining and smelting\r\nbeing conducted by departments of the state governments, although some\r\nof the largest concerns were private corporations. The German metal\r\n“Trio” headed by the Metallgesellschaft through the International\r\nSales Association controlled directly about one-half the European\r\nproduction, comprising in this so-called Lead Convention, besides the\r\nGerman concerns, most of the Spanish and Belgian producers, most of the\r\nlead exported from the United States and Mexico, and the pig lead and\r\nconcentrates exported from Australia. This system of control outside of\r\nGermany has now been permanently destroyed, and the magnitude and the\r\norganization of the German lead industry in the near future cannot be\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=France.=--In France the output of lead ore is small and is controlled,\r\nwith probably one exception, by French capital. Some ores are imported\r\nfor smelting, Tunis and Algeria being capable of supplying even more.\r\nTo provide for the large consumption, France ranking fourth among\r\nlead-consuming countries, there is imported in the form of pig lead\r\nsome 7 per cent. of the world’s output. Recently smelting capacity has\r\nbeen increased. French capital controls more than half the production\r\nof Belgium through ownership of smelters, and through ownership of\r\nmines and smelters controls more than half the production of Spain\r\nand most, if not all, of the output of Greece. It also controls the\r\nore production of Egypt and most of the ores produced in Algeria and\r\nTunis. Under government auspices a strong organization of all the\r\nmetal-producing companies controlled by French capital in France\r\nand foreign countries has recently been effected under the name of\r\nthe Société Minerais et Metaux, which controls the sale of all the\r\nproduction of its members, as well as acting as a purchasing agent for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Belgium.=--Belgium produces no ores but smelts about 4¹⁄₂ per cent.\r\nof the world’s output, nearly the whole of which is consumed within\r\nher borders. A little less than half of this production is controlled\r\nby Belgian capital, the remainder by French interests. Belgian capital\r\nis also interested to a minor extent in Spain, Algeria, the Caucasus\r\nMountains and Tunis. It is believed that a part of the Australian\r\nconcentrates may be allotted to Belgium for smelting.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Italy.=--The Italian ore production, amounting to about 2 per cent. of\r\nthe world’s total, is smelted in that country. The product is consumed,\r\ntogether with about 50 per cent. more, imported as pig lead. More than\r\nthree-fourths of the domestic output is controlled by English capital;\r\nnearly all the remainder is controlled by Italian capital, but other\r\nEnglish, French and Belgian companies produce insignificant amounts of\r\nore.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Austria-Hungary.=--The Austro-Hungarian Empire produced and smelted\r\nores to the amount of about 2 per cent. of the world’s output in 1913,\r\nand consumed this with about 50 per cent. more metal imported in the\r\nform of pig lead. The several lead-producing districts and smelters,\r\nsome of which belong to the states of Austria and Hungary, with the\r\npartition of the empire fall within three or more distinct political\r\njurisdictions, the lead production of none of which will be of\r\nimportance. One of the important lead smelters is at Fiume.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spain.=--Spain ranks third in _content_ of ores produced and second\r\nin smelter production. The domestic consumption being negligible, all\r\nof the lead is exported. Prior to the war most of the production went\r\nto England to be desilverized. During the war, however, the refining\r\ncapacity of Spain was greatly increased, and it now seems likely that\r\nany silver lead which the domestic plants can not take care of will\r\nbe shipped to France for desilverization. More than half the Spanish\r\nproduction is controlled by French capital, and to a minor degree by\r\nBelgian and German interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Japan.=--Japanese lead-ore resources are meagre. The output of lead\r\nore and pig lead in 1913 was about 25 per cent. of the domestic\r\nconsumption. Since then ores and concentrates have been imported from\r\nChina, Formosa, Korea, Siberia, and Australia, but importation of pig\r\nlead has still been necessary. The Japanese are endeavoring to secure\r\ncontrol of ore deposits in China and Siberia, and supply the raw\r\nmaterial for the increase of their domestic smelting and manufacturing\r\nindustries. It is probable, however, that Japan will be dependent for\r\nmany years on imports from other sources for most of the lead consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe chief uses of lead are as metal and in the form of white lead or\r\nbasic carbonate, as a pigment. Metallic lead is used for water pipe,\r\ncovering for electrical cables, lining acid chambers and vats, and for\r\nshot, bullets and shrapnel. Alloys with various other metals are used\r\nin type, bearings, and fuses. The red and orange oxides are used for\r\npigments. The largest single form of consumption is white lead.\r\n\r\nLead and zinc ores are commonly associated and are widely distributed\r\nover the world. Galena is the chief lead mineral, the other ore\r\nminerals, cerussite and anglesite, being derived from it by oxidation.\r\nGalena is a persistent mineral, being found in nearly all types of\r\nore deposits. The countries producing the most ore are, in order of\r\nimportance, United States, Australia, Spain, Germany, and Mexico.\r\nDistricts of major importance are Broken Hill, New South Wales;\r\nsoutheastern Spain; southeastern Missouri; and Coeur d’Alene, Idaho.\r\n\r\nThe developments in selective oil flotation, by which the detrimental\r\nzinc content is eliminated from complex ores and made an asset,\r\nconstitute the greatest recent advance in the dressing of lead ores.\r\nElectrolytic refining is the greatest recent advance in the metallurgy\r\nof lead.\r\n\r\nThe readiness with which lead is reduced from its ores and its utility\r\nas a collector of the precious metals in smelting have resulted in a\r\nwide distribution of reduction plants. Nevertheless a large percentage\r\nof the world’s output of ores is transported from the countries of\r\norigin to others, for reduction near the market and where skilled labor\r\nand fuel are more abundant and cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe countries of largest smelter production are, in order, United\r\nStates, Spain, Germany and Australia; those of much less importance are\r\nMexico, Belgium, Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Greece,\r\nCanada and, recently, Burma. Other countries are of little importance.\r\n\r\nThe countries of major consumption are, in order, United States,\r\nGermany, Great Britain, and France. The United States produces its own\r\nrequirements, but the other three countries import ores for smelting\r\nand also pig lead in large quantity. Australia and northern Africa have\r\nsupplied the bulk of the ores, and Spain, Australia, and Mexico most of\r\nthe pig lead. This is the situation at last analysis, the actual trade\r\nmovement being, of course, much more complex.\r\n\r\nThe political control of the world’s lead production, in terms of the\r\nlead content of ores, in 1913 was as follows: United States, 36.0 per\r\ncent.; British Empire, 23.9 per cent.; Spain, 6.4 per cent.; Germany,\r\n5.9 per cent.; Mexico, 5.1 per cent.; and France, 4.0 per cent. Three\r\npowers thus control 76 per cent. of the production.\r\n\r\nThe ownership of mines is important chiefly as determining the\r\ndistribution of ores to smelters. Ore-purchasing contracts may modify\r\nor annul the effect of political jurisdiction and mine ownership. The\r\nownership or control of reduction plants has been the most effective\r\nbasis for commercial control of the industry. In the United States the\r\nAmerican Smelting & Refining Co. dominates the market, but controls\r\ndirectly only one-third of the output. In Spain the French company of\r\nPenarroya controls more than half the production. In Germany the “Trio”\r\nheaded by the Metallgesellschaft controlled the domestic industry prior\r\nto the war, and through the “Lead Convention” extended its domination\r\nto half the European output and most of the exports of Australia,\r\nMexico, and the United States. This control was, however, never\r\nabsolute. In Australia at present the Broken Hill Associated Smelters\r\ncontrols the marketing of most of the pig lead exported.\r\n\r\nJoint political and commercial control has been established in the\r\nBritish Empire and France. During the war, political jurisdiction was\r\nquite generally invoked to modify or eliminate commercial control,\r\nparticularly with regard to alien-enemy interests.\r\n\r\nThe various combinations of British companies to insure British control\r\nof the resources of the empire, particularly of Australia and Burma,\r\nculminated in the formation of the British Metals Corporation for the\r\nsale of the output. A representative of the Imperial Treasury will be\r\non the board of directors and either the Metal Bank of London or the\r\nChemical & Metallurgical Bank may finance its operation, unless it\r\nabsorbs their functions. This organization is doubtless intended to\r\ntake the place of the Metallgesellschaft as the dominant factor in the\r\nlead industry of the world. It will have much influence, as British\r\ncapital controls all the production of the British Isles, Australia,\r\nBurma, Canada, and normally Siberia, most of that of Italy, part of\r\nthat of Spain and Mexico, and perhaps of Greece. Probably the British\r\nIsles will not in the future desilverize as much foreign lead as\r\nformerly, so that the importance of this basis of commercial control\r\nwill be greatly decreased.\r\n\r\nThe Société Minerais et Metaux, comprising all producers controlled by\r\nFrench capital, under government auspices is selling and purchasing\r\nagent for its members, and controls all the French and most of the\r\nGrecian production, more than half of that of Spain and Belgium,\r\nbesides the ores of northern Africa and of Egypt.\r\n\r\nSince the elimination of alien-enemy holdings by the Alien Property\r\nCustodian, United States capital controls substantially all the\r\ndomestic production and nearly all that of Mexico, besides some ores\r\nimported from Mexico, Canada, and South America. Notwithstanding large\r\nore reserves and reduction capacity, the United States is expected,\r\nafter the period of readjustment, to supply its domestic needs, but to\r\nexport little lead, as was the case prior to the war.\r\n\r\nThe position of Germany will depend largely upon arrangements for\r\nforeign ore supply. Some Mexican ore production may still be under\r\nGerman control. Belgium is wholly dependent on foreign ore, which\r\npresumably will be obtained largely from Australia; and with more than\r\nhalf her production controlled by French capital, she will be under\r\nBritish and French domination; but she consumes most of her smelter\r\noutput. Italy consumes 50 per cent. more than the domestic production,\r\nwhich is chiefly controlled by English capital. None of the states\r\nformed by the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire will be of\r\nimportance in the lead industry.\r\n\r\nThe commercial control of the smelter production of lead, calculated\r\nfrom the latest statistics available, is approximately as follows:\r\nUnited States, 48.6 per cent.; British Empire, 17.2 per cent.; Germany,\r\n15.3 per cent.; and France, 12.7 per cent.; or a total for the four\r\npowers of 93.8 per cent. of the pig-lead output of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nZINC\r\n\r\nBY FREDERICK B. HYDER\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF ZINC\r\n\r\nMetallic zinc, or spelter, as the commercial metal is often known\r\nin the trade, is chiefly used in the form of rolled sheets; in\r\ngalvanizing; in alloys forming brass and bronze; and in the\r\ndesilverization of lead bullion. Rolled sheets are used for roofs,\r\ntanks, conduits, and protective linings. Iron and steel objects are\r\ndipped into baths of molten spelter and coated with the metal or\r\ngalvanized, being thereby protected from oxidizing agencies. Other\r\nmethods of applying this protective coating are also in use.\r\n\r\nZinc and copper unite in all proportions, forming alloys known as brass\r\nwhich are of widespread industrial application. There is only one\r\ndefinite alloy; it corresponds approximately to CuZn₂, contains 33 per\r\ncent. copper and 67 per cent. zinc, is hard and brittle and of little\r\npractical value. All other brasses may be considered as solid solutions\r\nof this definite alloy in an excess of one of its constituents. Brasses\r\nin use vary in zinc content from 20 to 85 per cent. and differ greatly\r\nin their properties according to the composition. Alloys of zinc and\r\naluminum have valuable properties, especially those containing 25 to\r\n35 per cent. zinc. Other alloys used contain, besides copper and zinc,\r\neither lead, tin or nickel.\r\n\r\nThe Parkes process of desilverizing lead bullion has superseded the\r\nolder Pattinson and cupellation process, except where bismuth is\r\npresent, owing to the avidity with which zinc robs the bullion of gold,\r\nsilver, copper and tellurium. This purification may be made as perfect\r\nas desired or only to a commercially profitable point, generally being\r\nbrought down to a content of one-half ounce of silver per ton of lead.\r\n\r\nAmong the miscellaneous uses of zinc are these: ornamental castings;\r\nin galvanic batteries; in photo-engraving; in plates hung in boilers\r\nto prevent formation of scale; precipitation of gold in the cyanide\r\nprocess; in the form of powder, as a reducing agent in organic\r\nchemistry, especially in the reduction of indigo-blue and in a paint\r\nfor structural steel. Zinc is also used in the form of numerous salts,\r\nsuch as the chloride as a wood preservative, and the sulphate, employed\r\nin medicine, dyeing and glue manufacture.\r\n\r\nZinc oxide, produced both from the metal and from ores, is used as\r\na pigment both in combination with white lead and barytes, and as a\r\ncompetitor of them. Considerable amounts of oxide are also used in the\r\nrubber manufacturing industry. Lithopone (an intimate mixture, obtained\r\nby chemical precipitation of zinc sulphide and barium sulphate) is of\r\ngrowing importance as a pigment.\r\n\r\nAll the chief uses of zinc, comprising galvanizing, rolled sheets,\r\nbrass-making and the desilverization of lead bullion, may be considered\r\nessential. Brass belongs with steel in the category of indispensable\r\nmaterials of modern industry. No satisfactory substitute as regards\r\nboth physical qualities and cost is available for many important parts\r\nof machinery and for manufacturing purposes. Its wide use depends on\r\na number of qualities. The excellent sharp castings made from certain\r\nbrasses are readily machined or otherwise finished and electro-plated\r\nif desired. The electrical conductivity of brass is good. Certain\r\nbrasses are easily rolled into sheets and cut and stamped in desired\r\nshapes. Lubricated surfaces of steel on brass make satisfactory and\r\ndurable bearings.\r\n\r\nThe other large uses of zinc depend on its resistance to oxidation and\r\non the possibility of rolling it into fairly thin sheets. In both these\r\nqualities, however, it is surpassed by other metals, notably nickel and\r\ntin. Alloyed with lead it may be rolled into a substitute for tin-foil.\r\nIt is in some cases a fairly satisfactory, cheap substitute for metals\r\nof higher quality. In times of scarcity or high prices, substitution of\r\nmetals of inferior quality is feasible, and in many cases zinc may be\r\ntemporarily dispensed with altogether. Its field is therefore largely\r\nfixed by commercial conditions of supply and price, which determine\r\nbroadly the total consumption and especially the percentages devoted\r\nto the various uses. It may be assumed, however, that the percentages\r\nfor the domestic consumption in the United States in 1910 represent\r\napproximately those of normal peace times. In that year, of the total\r\nconsumption, 60 per cent. was used in galvanizing; 20 per cent. in\r\nbrass-making; 11 per cent. in rolled sheets; and 1 per cent. in lead\r\ndesilverization; leaving 8 per cent. for miscellaneous uses. During the\r\nwar the percentage used in galvanizing was greatly reduced and that\r\nused for brass-making much increased. The use of rolled sheets will\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nA large part of the European production in normal times is rolled into\r\nsheets used chiefly for roofing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nIn the extraction of zinc from its ores the most important changes in\r\npractice during recent years have been adaptations of retort smelting\r\nfor the purpose of utilizing zinc concentrates from complex ores,\r\nthe increased production of zinc oxide and lithopone through the\r\napplication of volatilization methods to the re-treatment of retort\r\nresidues and base ores, and the electrolytic and electro-thermic\r\nprocesses of extraction of the metal.\r\n\r\nThe most revolutionary advance has been the development of the oil\r\nflotation, the electro-magnetic, and electro-static processes for the\r\nconcentration of ores. These processes are being widely introduced and\r\nin connection with electrolytic reduction are particularly adapted to\r\nthe production of spelter of the highest quality from complex ores. As\r\nthe electrolytic and electro-thermic processes find their field only\r\nwhere power is relatively cheap, the tendency is to put installations\r\nwhere hydro-electric power is available, effecting a redistribution of\r\nzinc-smelting centers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nZinc and lead are commonly associated in mineral deposits, sometimes\r\nintimately mixed, sometimes so segregated that one metal predominates,\r\nbut ores of one are seldom free entirely from the other. The geological\r\nand geographical distribution of the two metals is therefore nearly\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nThe sulphide ores, chiefly sphalerite or blende, are the most\r\nimportant, but in the oxidized zone they are often altered\r\nto carbonates--smithsonite, calamine and hydrozincite. The\r\noxides--franklinite, willemite and zincite--are important in only one\r\ndistrict in New Jersey. The carbonates, although they carry a low\r\npercentage of zinc, often occur in concentrated ore bodies, and yield\r\nreadily to metallurgical treatment. Therefore, calamine-smithsonite\r\nores form a large proportion of the production of many important\r\ndistricts, but blende will hereafter be of increasing importance in the\r\nworld production.\r\n\r\nZinc ores occur in deposits of several distinct genetic types. In the\r\norder of their importance they are:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Deposits formed in sedimentary rocks, without apparent connection\r\nwith igneous rocks, as bedded replacements usually of limestones and\r\ndolomites. The ores of this type usually contain lead (galena) and iron\r\n(pyrite or marcasite) minerals, often those of manganese and cadmium,\r\nsometimes those of arsenic, cobalt and nickel, but seldom gold, silver,\r\ncopper, or antimony. Barite and fluorite are sometimes present.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of this type are of world-wide distribution. Their greater\r\npurity and the simplicity of the treatment necessary, particularly of\r\nthe ores in their oxidized zones, have caused them to be exploited\r\nfirst and most extensively and to be until recently the dominant factor\r\nin the world production of zinc. To this type belong the deposits of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley and Silesia, which together produced 34 per\r\ncent. of the world’s output in 1913.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Veins associated with igneous rocks and disseminated sulphide\r\nreplacements of igneous rock. In this group come the deposits of Butte,\r\nLeadville, and the Coeur d’Alene, and the disseminated deposits of the\r\nBawdwin (Burma Mines Co.), Ridder (Siberia) and Salmon River (B.C.).\r\nThese ores are usually complex, comprising minerals of zinc, lead,\r\ncopper, iron, gold and silver, and often arsenic, antimony and other\r\nmetals. In one group, the silver-lead deposits, zinc seems a minor\r\nfactor, but with depth replaces lead as the predominant metal. Deposits\r\nof these complex ores have in recent years become important sources\r\nof zinc through recognition of the zinc ores in their oxidized zones,\r\nthrough zinc becoming the dominant metal with increasing depth at many\r\nmines, and especially through improvements in methods of concentrating\r\ncomplex ores and extracting metal from the concentrates. Ores of this\r\ntype will be of increasing importance in the future because of their\r\nworld-wide distribution.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Igneous metamorphic deposits containing franklinite, willemite,\r\nzincite, a little blende, and a gangue of calcite, rhodonite,\r\ngarnet, pyroxene, hornblende, magnetite and tremolite. This type\r\nis characteristic of the Franklin and Adirondack deposits of the\r\nnortheastern metallographic province of the United States and is also\r\nfound at Magdalena and Hanover, New Mexico and the Horn Silver mine, in\r\nUtah.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Metamorphosed deposits. Originally these may have been of any of\r\nthe preceding types but are now disguised by regional metamorphism.\r\nThe best example is the important deposit of Ammeberg, Sweden. Blende\r\nthere occurs disseminated in bands in gneissoid granulite, which also\r\ncontains bands of disseminated pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe chief zinc ore deposits of the world are in the countries listed in\r\nthe table below; the order of the countries is that of their importance\r\nin the industry in 1913, as nearly as can be estimated from incomplete\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nThe three major metallographic provinces of the world as indicated by\r\npresent exploitation are those of Broken Hill, N.S.W., Silesia, and the\r\nMississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the zinc industry in the principal countries, in 1913,\r\nis shown in Table 59.\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--The zinc deposits of the United States may be\r\nassigned to three metallographic provinces, which in the order of their\r\npresent importance are: the Mississippi Valley province; the Western\r\nprovince; and the Northeastern province.\r\n\r\nJudged by present knowledge, the _Mississippi Valley province_ is\r\none of the three major zinc-bearing metallographic provinces of the\r\nworld. It occupies an area underlain with slightly disturbed Paleozoic\r\nlimestone, ranging from Ordovician to Lower Carboniferous in age, that\r\ncomprises most of the great mid-continental valley of the Mississippi\r\nin the states of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Illinois,\r\nKentucky, Wisconsin, Iowa, also Tennessee and the western part of\r\nVirginia. Igneous rocks are generally absent. There are three principal\r\nsubprovinces: the Ozark province, comprising Missouri, Oklahoma,\r\nKansas, Arkansas; the upper Mississippi valley, comprising Wisconsin,\r\nNorthern Illinois, and Iowa; and the regions of Tennessee and Virginia.\r\n\r\nTABLE 58.--CHIEF ZINC-ORE DEPOSITS OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n  -----------+---------------------------------+------------------\r\n  Approximate|                                 |  Percentage of\r\n    order    |             Country             |world’s production\r\n             |                                 |     in 1913\r\n  -----------+---------------------------------+------------------\r\n        1    |United States                    |     35.0\r\n        2    |Germany                          |     25.0\r\n        3    |Australia                        |     15.0\r\n        4    |Italy                            |      5.0\r\n        5    |Algeria                          |      3.0\r\n        6    |Japan                            |      2.0\r\n        7    |Spain                            |      2.0\r\n        8    |Russia (including Russian Poland)|      2.0\r\n        9    |France                           |      1.5\r\n       10    |Greece                           |      1.0\r\n       11    |Sweden                           |      1.0\r\n       12    |Mexico                           |      1.0\r\n       13    |Austria                          |      1.0\r\n       14    |Tunis                            |      1.0\r\n       15    |Indo-China (Tonkin)              |\r\n       16    |Great Britain                    |\r\n       17    |China                            |\r\n       18    |Bolivia                          |\r\n       19    |Canada                           |\r\n       20    |India (Burma)                    |\r\n       21    |Egypt                            |\r\n       22    |South Africa                     |\r\n       23    |Peru                             |\r\n  -----------+---------------------------------+------------------\r\n\r\nIn the Ozark subprovinces the Joplin district is most important.\r\nThe ores lie at three horizons in flat-lying lower Carboniferous\r\nlimestones. In the upper horizon, below the surface, the ore lies in\r\nclayey chert breccias, and galena predominates. The middle horizon,\r\nor “sheet ground,” carries mixed galena and blende, which cements\r\nbrecciated chert. The ore is low grade, the average recovery of zinc\r\nbeing 1.9 per cent. This horizon has been the most important source of\r\nore. The third and lowest horizon, as yet little exploited, contains\r\ndisseminated ores. Thirty mills were busy in the Joplin district in\r\n1918. The Athletic Mining & Smelting Co. was the largest producer,\r\noperating the Athletic mine, at Duenweg, the Bertha A., at Webb City,\r\nand Mutual mine, at Oronogo. Miami Zinc Syndicate, affiliated with the\r\nButte & Superior and American Zinc, Lead & Smelting Co.; the Commerce\r\nMining & Royalty Co.; the Century Zinc Co.; and the Tri-State Mining\r\nCo., are large operators. Much of the production is by lessees and\r\nsmall operators.\r\n\r\nTABLE 59.--ZINC INDUSTRY IN 1913\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+-------------------------------------++\r\n                          |                                     ||\r\n                          |       Available zinc in ore         ++\r\n                          |            (short tons)             ||\r\n                          +---------+---------+--------+--------++\r\n                          |         |         |        |        ||\r\n         Country          | Produced| Smelted |Exported|Imported||\r\n  ------------------------+---------+---------+--------+--------++\r\n  United States           |  305,500|  310,500|  8,500 |  13,500||\r\n                          |         |         |        |        ||\r\n  Australasia             |  206,000|    4,000| 202,000|   ...  ||\r\n  British Isles           |   50,000|   65,000|   ...  |  15,000||\r\n  Canada                  |   24,000|    ...  |  24,000|   ...  ||\r\n  Burma, Indo China, etc. |   18,000|    ...  |  18,000|   ...  ||\r\n  France and French Africa|   69,000|   63,000|   6,000|   ...  ||\r\n  Italy                   |   40,000|    ...  |  40,000|   ...  ||\r\n  Belgium                 |   11,000|  218,000|    ... | 207,000||\r\n  China                   |    5,000|    2,500|   2,500|   ...  ||\r\n  Greece                  |   12,000|    ...  |  12,000|        ||\r\n  Japan                   |   10,000|    8,000|   2,000|   ...  ||\r\n  Russia                  |   35,000|   13,000|  22,000|   ...  ||\r\n  Holland                 |    ...  |   27,000|   ...  |  27,000||\r\n  Mexico                  |   30,000|    ...  |  30,000|        ||\r\n  Norway                  |   15,000|   10,000|   5,000|   ...  ||\r\n  Spain                   |   50,000|   15,000|  35,000|   ...  ||\r\n  Sweden                  |   10,000|    6,000|   4,000|   ...  ||\r\n  Austria-Hungary         |   24,000|   24,000|   ...  |   ...  ||\r\n  Germany                 |  163,500|  312,000|   ...  | 148,500||\r\n  Other                   |    ...  |    ...  |   ...  |   ...  ||\r\n                          +---------+---------+--------+--------++\r\n    Total                 |1,078,000|1,078,000| 411,000| 411,000||\r\n  ------------------------+---------+---------+--------+--------++\r\n  ------------------------++-------------------------------------------\r\n                          ||           Spelter (short tons)\r\n                          ++-----------------+-------+-------+---------\r\n                          ||     Produced    |       |       |\r\n                          ++---------+-------+       | To be |  Annual\r\n                          ||         |  Sec- |  For  |  im-  |   con-\r\n         Country          || Primary | ondary| export| ported| sumption\r\n  ------------------------++---------+-------+-------+-------+---------\r\n  United States           ||  310,500| 50,000| 21,000|       |  339,500\r\n                          ||         |       |       |       |\r\n  Australasia             ||    4,000|  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |    4,000\r\n  British Isles           ||   65,000|  6,000|  ...  |143,500|  214,500\r\n  Canada                  ||    ...  |  ...  |  ...  | 20,000|   20,000\r\n  Burma, Indo China, etc. ||         |       |       |       |\r\n  France and French Africa||   63,000| 20,500|  ...  |  5,500|   89,000\r\n  Italy                   ||    ...  |  ...  |  ...  | 12,000|   12,000\r\n  Belgium                 ||  218,000|  3,500|  7,500|  ...  |   84,000\r\n  China                   ||    2,500|  ...  |  ...  |  7,500|   10,000\r\n  Greece                  ||         |       |       |       |\r\n  Japan                   ||    8,000|  ...  |  ...  |  4,000|   12,000\r\n  Russia                  ||   13,000|  ...  |  ...  | 23,500|   36,500\r\n  Holland                 ||   27,000| 3,000 | 25,500|  ...  |    4,500\r\n  Mexico                  ||         |       |       |       |\r\n  Norway                  ||   10,000|  ...  | 10,000|       |\r\n  Spain                   ||   15,000|  ...  |  8,500|  ...  |    6,500\r\n  Sweden                  ||    6,000|  ...  |  6,000|  ...  |\r\n  Austria-Hungary         ||   24,000|  3,000|  ...  | 17,500|   44,500\r\n  Germany                 ||  312,000| 18,500| 75,000|  ...  |  255,500\r\n  Other                   ||    ...  |  1,500|  ...  | 45,000|   46,500\r\n                          ++---------+-------+-------+-------+---------\r\n    Total                 ||1,078,000|106,000|283,500|278,500|1,179,000\r\n  ------------------------++---------+-------+-------+-------+---------\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas the ores are of similar character and mode of occurrence\r\nand are found in the same formation and also in the Ordovician\r\nlimestone. The Lavender Mining & Milling Co. is the largest operator\r\nand the production has been largely carbonate ores.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Mississippi region comprises deposits in nearly horizontal\r\nlimestones of Ordovician age. Three-fourths of the output of this\r\ndistrict is made by five companies: the Mineral Point Zinc Co., a\r\nsubsidiary of the New Jersey Zinc Co., with seven mines; the Vinegar\r\nHill Zinc Co., with six mines; the Wisconsin Zinc Co., a subsidiary of\r\nthe American Zinc, Lead & Smelting Co., with four mines; the Frontier\r\nMining Co., with five producing mines; and the Cleveland Mining Co.,\r\nwith two mines. Other important companies are Burr Mining Co., Block\r\nHouse Mining Co., M. & A. Mining Co., B. M. & B. Mining Co., and Oliver\r\nMining Co., a subsidiary of the U. S. Steel Corporation. All of the\r\nmines are equipped with milling plants. The production of the district\r\nshows a steady growth.\r\n\r\nThe zinc deposits of southwest Virginia and northeastern Tennessee\r\noccur as disseminated replacement breccia along crushed and faulted\r\nzones in folded Cambro-Ordovician limestones, and also as oxidized\r\nores in clays residual from the weathering of the same limestones. The\r\ngangue is calcite and dolomite. The American Zinc Co. is the largest\r\noperator in Tennessee; it has a milling capacity of 3,000 tons daily\r\nand zinc-blende ore reserves greater than 6,000,000 tons averaging\r\nbetween 4 and 5 per cent. zinc, from which 60 per cent. zinc-blende\r\nconcentrates are made. This company is a subsidiary of the American\r\nZinc, Lead & Smelting Co.\r\n\r\nThe _Western province_ comprises most of the western states; it\r\nextends north into British Columbia and south into Mexico. The chief\r\nsubprovinces are those of Leadville, Butte, and Coeur d’Alene.\r\n\r\nThe Leadville deposits are found in strata varying in age from Archean\r\nto Cretaceous, which have been intruded by igneous rocks. The ores\r\nare mainly replacements of limestone and occur in large masses.\r\nThis district first became of importance in zinc production upon\r\nthe recognition of smithsonite and calamine in the large masses of\r\noxidized ores. Of recent years sulphides form an increasing part of the\r\nproduction, now coming largely from deeper levels. The ores carry gold,\r\nsilver, manganese, copper and sometimes bismuth. The United States\r\nSmelting Refining & Mining Co., the Empire Zinc Co., a subsidiary of\r\nthe New Jersey Zinc Co.; the Western Mining Co., the Downtown Mines\r\nCo., the Wellington Mines Co., at Breckenridge; and the Mary Murphy\r\nmine, at Chalk Creek, are the largest operators in this region.\r\n\r\nThe Butte ores occur as veins in igneous rocks. The area in which zinc\r\nores predominate surrounds that of important copper veins on three\r\nsides. On the border of the two areas, zinc-silver ores predominate in\r\nthe upper levels and copper in the deeper workings. Many of the present\r\nzinc mines were formerly worked for silver. These complex zinc ores\r\nhave been made available by the successful application of oil flotation\r\nand electrolytic deposition. The Black Rock mine of the Butte &\r\nSuperior Mining Co., the Elm Orlu of W. A. Clark & Son, the Alice, and\r\nseveral other mines of the Anaconda Copper Mining Co., and the North\r\nButte Mining Co. are among the most important producers. The twelve\r\nmines yielding zinc in 1915 together have immense reserves. The ores\r\nall carry lead and silver and some pyrite, and many contain copper and\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nThe Coeur d’Alene subprovince comprises a number of mining districts in\r\nIdaho, at least five being zinc producers. The Interstate-Callahan, in\r\nthe Beaver district, is the largest zinc mine in the state. The ore is\r\nremarkable for the small percentage of minerals other than sphalerite,\r\naveraging 28 per cent. zinc.\r\n\r\nThe _Northeastern province_ comprises important deposits at Franklin,\r\nNew Jersey, and in the Adirondack Mountains in New York, and others\r\nof minor importance in the New England states. It is characterized\r\nby deposits of igneous metamorphic origin in Pre-Cambrian limestone.\r\nThe Franklin deposits, in New Jersey, consist chiefly of franklinite,\r\nwillemite and zincite in a gangue of calcite, rhodonite, garnet,\r\npyroxene, magnetite and hornblende. Willemite is separated magnetically\r\nfrom these ores and used to produce a very high-grade spelter free from\r\nlead and cadmium and therefore in great demand for certain purposes.\r\nThe other classes of ore are smelted for the production of zinc white\r\nand spiegeleisen. These mines, owned and operated by the New Jersey\r\nZinc Co., have produced more than 1,500,000 tons of zinc in the form of\r\nspelter and zinc oxide. The Edwards-Balmat district, in St. Lawrence\r\nCounty, New York, comprises an area two to three miles wide and fifteen\r\nmiles long, of Pre-Cambrian limestone. The ore occurs in lenses and is\r\na mixture of sphalerite, pyrite and a little galena with a gangue of\r\ndolomite. Separation is effected by magnetic tables. The typical ore\r\ncontains: sphalerite, 25.5 per cent.; galena, 1.43 per cent.; pyrite,\r\n12.4 per cent.; barite, 3.9 per cent. The ore reserves of the Northern\r\nOre Co., the largest operator, are known to exceed one million tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany.=--Imperial Germany comprised most of one metallographic\r\nprovince of major importance, Silesia, and other districts ranking as\r\nfollows: Upper Silesia; Rhenish Prussia; Westphalia; Saxony; Hanover;\r\nand Nassau.\r\n\r\nThe major part of the mineral province of Upper Silesia lay within\r\nthe boundaries of Germany in 1914. Once it was part of the Kingdom\r\nof Poland, except for portions included in the old empires of Russia\r\nand Austria. The pre-war production of zinc ores from Russian Poland\r\nwas entirely from this metallographic province. The deposits,\r\nwhich contain lead and zinc together, occur in Triassic formation\r\noverlying Carboniferous rocks that carry important seams of coal. This\r\njuxtaposition of ore and fuel has furnished an ideal basis for the\r\ngreat smelting industry that has been developed, and facilitates the\r\nsmelting of low-grade ores. The ores are said to average 17 per cent.\r\nzinc and 5 per cent. lead. They come from two ore horizons. The lower\r\nis characterized by blende, with a little galena and marcasite; the\r\nupper or lead horizon comprises a very persistent sheet of galena 0.05\r\nto 0.30 meters thick, which generally is underlain by red calamine. The\r\nblende deposits are extensive and will be productive for a long time.\r\n\r\nIn Rhenish Prussia, zinc ore (smithsonite) deposits are found in strata\r\nof Devonian age. These deposits are approaching exhaustion. The chief\r\nzinc deposits of Westphalia are in Devonian strata. The historic mines\r\nat Freiberg (Erzgebirge), in Saxony, produce a small quantity of blende\r\nfrom the concentration of galena ores. The blende carries considerable\r\niron and silver and some of it contains traces of tin. These mines are\r\ncontrolled by the Saxon government.\r\n\r\nA considerable quantity of blende ore is concentrated as a by-product\r\nin the dressing of the lead ore of the Upper Harz, Hanover. The ore of\r\nRammelsberg, in the Lower Harz, occurs in a bed interstratified with\r\nlower Devonian slates and sandstones; it is an intimate mixture of\r\nblende, galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and barite and some calcite and\r\nquartz. Zinc is produced as a by-product of lead ores in the valley\r\nof Lahn (Nassau), where a series of strong veins are found in Lower\r\nDevonian strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australia.=--The zinc resources of the Commonwealth of Australia are\r\nchiefly in New South Wales and Tasmania. The former has been the chief\r\nsource of zinc in the past, but the Tasmania deposits are now being\r\nrapidly developed and equipped for production.\r\n\r\nThe most important source of zinc ore in _New South Wales_ is the great\r\nBroken Hill lode, where operations began in 1884. The country rock\r\ncomprises crystalline schists and gneisses. Between the oxidized and\r\nprimary sulphide ores was a thin zone of secondary sulphides. The early\r\noperations in the district were for lead, and immense dumps accumulated\r\nof zinc-bearing ores sorted out or of zinc-bearing tailings from the\r\nconcentration of the lead ores. In 1903 these dumps were estimated\r\nat 5,687,400 tons carrying 18.6 per cent. zinc. With the development\r\nof demand for zinc sulphide ores and of oil flotation methods of\r\nseparation and concentration these dumps became important sources\r\nof zinc concentrates, but many of them are approaching exhaustion.\r\nThe sulphide ores are a close mixture of galena and zinc blende,\r\ncarrying silver. There are two classes of these ores, distinguished as\r\nsilicate-gangue ore, and calcite-gangue ore. The silicate gangue ore\r\nbodies carry rhodonite, garnet and quartz and are richer in zinc and\r\nsilver than those of calcite gangue.\r\n\r\nEight mining companies are now at work. In the order of the importance\r\nof their output and ore reserves, these companies are: Broken\r\nHill South Silver Mining Co.; Broken Hill North Mining Co.; Zinc\r\nCorporation; Sulphide Corporation; British Broken Hill Proprietary Co.;\r\nBroken Hill Proprietary Co., Block 10; and Broken Hill Proprietary\r\nCo., Block 14. The estimated ore reserves of all the mines approximate\r\n12,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThe Broken Hill South Silver Mining Co. has ore reserves estimated\r\nat 3,350,000 tons, and is the largest producer. Broken Hill North,\r\nAmalgamated Zinc (de Bavay), Zinc Corporation, and Barrier South\r\nLtd. are controlled by Govett and associates, a group of Australian\r\ncapitalists. The Amalgamated Zinc Co. in 1913 treated 498,289 tons of\r\ntailings, obtaining 140,098 tons zinc concentrates, carrying zinc, 48.9\r\nper cent.; also lead concentrates amounting to 1,584 tons, carrying\r\n57.1 per cent. lead. The Zinc Corporation, a company formed by Bewick,\r\nMoreing Co., has ore reserves estimated at 1,504,211 tons, averaging\r\n14.8 per cent. lead, 9.2 per cent. zinc, and 2.5 ounces of silver per\r\nton. The mine of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. is, according to last\r\nreports, nearly exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe principal deposits of Tasmania are those of the Primrose, Hercules,\r\nand Tasmania Copper Mines, all owned by the Mount Reed Rosebery\r\nCo., affiliated with the Mount Lyell Mining & Railway Co. The state\r\ngeological staff estimates reserves at 1,272,500 tons averaging 29.79\r\nper cent. zinc, 8.89 per cent. lead, 12.16 ounces of silver and 0.17\r\nounces of gold per ton.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Italy.=--The zinc production of Italy is derived from the Iglesias\r\ndistrict of Sardinia, and the Province of Bergamo. The Iglesias\r\ndistrict is in the southeastern part of the island of Sardinia. The\r\nores are oxidized and mostly worked by open pits. They are mined and\r\nmilled by two Italian companies, Societa di Monteponi, and the Societa\r\ndi Pertusola. The ores have usually been smelted in Germany, England or\r\nBelgium. The Bergamo mines, in the Province of Lombardy, are worked by\r\nthe English Crown Spelter Co., which ships the ore to Swansea, Wales,\r\nfor smelting.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Algeria.=--Algeria produced 82,256 tons of zinc ore in 1913. Of the\r\n78,973 tons whose origin is known, 31 per cent. of the total was\r\nextracted by Belgian companies and the remainder was produced by French\r\noperators.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Japan.=--The only important zinc-producing district in Japan is the\r\nProvince of Hida. The principal companies are the Osaka Zinc Mining\r\n& Smelting Co., Takata & Co., the Rhuara Mining Co., and the Mitsui\r\nMining Co. The largest producer is the Kamioka Mine of the last named,\r\nwhich produces annually about 10,000 tons. The Osaka Mining Co. also\r\nproduces from Korea (Chosen) about 15,000 tons of ore annually.\r\n\r\nThe annual smelting capacity in Japan, with all projected construction\r\ncompleted, is estimated at 300,000 tons of zinc ore, whereas the\r\ndomestic output of ore is about 50,000 tons. The difference has been\r\nimported chiefly from Siberia, China, Tonkin and Australia. In the\r\nfuture it is expected that the foreign ores will come chiefly from\r\nChina and Siberia. The domestic spelter production has reached about\r\n60,000 tons annually and the domestic consumption 29,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spain.=--Zinc ores are produced in the provinces of Santander, Murcia,\r\nTereul, Biscay and Guipuzcoa. The only district of importance is that\r\nof Santander, where there is a zinc smelter owned by the Compagnie\r\nRoyale Asturienne des Mines (French). Some of the ore is smelted in\r\nFrance. Most of the Spanish ores are calamine and occur almost without\r\nexception in limestone. Eighty per cent. of the Spanish production\r\ncomes from Santander and Murcia. In the latter the mines are worked\r\nprimarily for lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Russia.=--The zinc output of the Russian Empire was derived from\r\nRussian Poland, eastern Siberia, the Altai Mountains in southwestern\r\nSiberia, and the northern Caucasus Mountains. The Polish deposits\r\nare part of the Silesian field. The ores are largely carbonates and\r\nsilicates. Some of the mines and plants were owned by the Russian\r\ngovernment, others apparently by French companies. In eastern\r\nSiberia, the Tyuticha mine has a calamine orebody containing at least\r\n200,000 tons averaging 48 per cent. zinc. Some ore has come from the\r\nUssurisk district. It is believed that the Mitsui Mining Co. has made\r\narrangements to ship ores from this district to Japan for treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the Altai Mountains of southwestern Siberia the Ridder Mining Co.,\r\ncontrolled by the Irtysh Corporation, Ltd., of London, has developed\r\ntwo large deposits on the same mineralized zone, with ore reserves\r\nestimated in 1917 at over 3,500,000 tons. The possibilities of this\r\nproperty are immense. The company has acquired the Ekibastus coal\r\nfields, constructed about 165 miles of railroad and provided river\r\ntransport, thus bringing the ore and coal together at a smelting plant\r\nhaving a capacity of 15,000 tons lead and 5,000 tons spelter annually.\r\n\r\nIn the northern Caucasus Mountains, the Sadon mine, belonging to the\r\nSociété d’Alagir (French), has been worked for a long time. The ores\r\nfrom this mine are smelted locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Countries.=--The zinc-ore production of _France_ comes from\r\nseveral scattered districts. Of the 45,929 long tons reported in 1912,\r\nnearly all came from six mines which are all controlled by French\r\ncapital with perhaps some Belgian participation.\r\n\r\nThe only important source of zinc in _Greece_ is the famous Laurium\r\ndeposit, which was worked in ancient times. The ancients, however,\r\nrejected, as far as possible, the zinc ores. These deposits are now\r\ncontrolled and operated by a French company, the Compagnie Française\r\ndes Mines de Laurium, which also has reopened the ancient workings of\r\nGebel Rosas, near the Red Sea, in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe chief zinc mines of _Sweden_ are the Ammeberg, the Rylls Wytland\r\nand the Sala. At the Sala immense piles of tailings made in centuries\r\nof operation, containing quantities of zinc, can now be treated,\r\nas well as zinciferous areas left in mining silver-lead ores. The\r\nimportant Ammeberg deposit consists of bands and lenses of disseminated\r\nblende in gneissoid granulite and is exploited by the Société de la\r\nVieille Montagne (Belgian).\r\n\r\nThe zinc production of _Mexico_ has come chiefly from the states of\r\nNuevo Leon, Chihuahua and Sonora. Various zinc deposits have been\r\nworked in Nuevo Leon by German and American capital. Most of them are\r\nwithin 50 miles of Monterrey. Zinc-producing districts are scattered\r\nover the State of Chihuahua. In the Santa Eulalia district, El Potosi\r\nMining Co., controlled by Americans, works the mine of the same name,\r\nwhich has carbonate ores to a depth of 1,700 feet. The Buena Tierra,\r\nin the same district, is controlled by British capital. The principal\r\nmines in the Parral district are owned by Americans and British\r\ncompanies, including the American Smelters Securities Co., American\r\nZinc Extraction Co., and San Francisco Mines of Mexico, Ltd. (British).\r\nThe Carnegie Lead & Zinc Co. owns the largest zinc mine in Sonora,\r\nlocated near Cananea. The Calumet & Arizona Co. and the Mexican Metal\r\nCo. own zinc deposits in the Arizpe district. All of these companies\r\nare American.\r\n\r\nZinc ores are produced in Austria in the provinces of Carinthia,\r\nStyria, Carniole, Tyrol and Galicia. The Raibl and Schneeberg\r\nmines of Carinthia are government owned, and the ores are smelted\r\nat the government works at Cilli. Tyrolean ores were shipped to\r\nFrankfort-on-Main and Aix-la-Chapelle. Styrian ores were shipped to\r\nSilesia and Rhenish Prussia for smelting.\r\n\r\nThe considerable production of calamine with some blende from _Tunis_\r\nis under French political and commercial control. The chief zinc ore\r\nproducers appear to be French companies, in general paying a royalty of\r\n5 per cent. of the net proceeds to the government of Tunis. The total\r\nproduction for 1916 was 12,544 tons.\r\n\r\nFour districts of _Indo-China_ produce zinc ores with an aggregate\r\ntotal annual output of about 46,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThe largest zinc mine in _Great Britain_ is the Nenthead, in\r\nCumberland, worked by the Société de la Vieille Montagne (Belgian). The\r\nsecond largest producer is the Carshield mine, in Northumberland. With\r\nthe exception of the Nenthead mine all the important producers are, so\r\nfar as known, owned and operated by British capital.\r\n\r\nThe chief mine in _China_ is the Shui K’ou Shan, under control of the\r\nHunan Board of Mines. Prior to the war this mine was dominated by\r\nGerman capital, which had provided machinery and shipped the product\r\nto Europe. Japanese have sought diligently and with partial success to\r\nsecure control of this mine.\r\n\r\nThe chief zinc-mining district in _Bolivia_ is Huanchaca, the\r\nproduction of which has recently decreased because of great quantities\r\nof water entering the workings. The largest operator is the Compañia\r\nHuanchaca de Bolivia, the capital and control of which is French. Its\r\nzinc production is incidental, the principal metal produced being\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nThe zinc production of _Canada_ is chiefly from British Columbia, but\r\na small amount is from Ontario and Quebec. The only production of any\r\nmoment is from the southern part of British Columbia, where the Slocan\r\ndistrict is of greatest importance. British, Canadian and American\r\ncapital are largely interested. In 1915, the mines of the Slocan\r\ndistrict were estimated by the management of the Trail smelter to be\r\ncapable of producing 10,000 to 15,000 tons of ore carrying 40 to 45 per\r\ncent. zinc. Apparently this was in addition to the possible production\r\nfrom the Sullivan mine, owned by the Consolidated Mining & Smelting\r\nCo., Ltd. (Trail smelter), which had proved reserves of 3,500,000 tons\r\nof galena-sphalerite ore. The principal mines of Ontario and Quebec\r\nproduced 580 tons of zinc, or one-thirtieth of the production of\r\nCanada. These are operated at least in part by American capital, and\r\nthe ores are smelted by the Zinc Co., Ltd., owned by Americans.\r\n\r\nThe chief deposits of _India_ are those of the Bawdwin mines, located\r\nin the Northern Shan States (Burma). There was estimated December 31,\r\n1917, 4,033,000 tons lead-zinc ore assaying 24.7 oz. silver, 27.4 per\r\ncent. lead, and 19.1 per cent. zinc. The essential constituents of the\r\nores are galena and sphalerite with a little pyrite and chalcopyrite.\r\nThe lead and zinc concentrates are available for the customary methods\r\nof smelting. A zinc-distilling and sulphuric acid plant is being\r\nconstructed at Sakohi, with the aid of the Indian government, to treat\r\nthe table zinc concentrate. The company operates a lead smelter at\r\nNam-Tu, 11 miles from the mines. The Bawdwin deposits may be expected\r\nto be an important factor in the world’s production of zinc in the\r\nimmediate future. They are owned by the Burma Mines, Ltd., an English\r\ncorporation of the R. Tilden Smith-Govett-Hoover interests, in which\r\nsome American capital is interested.\r\n\r\nThe only zinc deposit of note in _Egypt_ is the Gebel Rosas, operated\r\nby the Compagnie Française de Laurium. This deposit is located near the\r\nRed Sea and was worked in ancient times.\r\n\r\nThe only deposit of importance in _South Africa_ is the Rhodesia Broken\r\nHill. The large ore bodies are, so far as developed, almost wholly\r\noxidized. One ore body is estimated at 250,000 long tons, averaging 26\r\nper cent. lead, 22¹⁄₂ per cent. zinc, and another at 300,000 long tons,\r\naveraging 32 per cent. zinc, with little lead, but much iron oxide\r\nand carbonate. They are controlled by British capital. Considerable\r\ndifficulty has been experienced in developing a commercial treatment.\r\n\r\nIn _Peru_ a French company, the Association Minière, has interests in\r\nthe Compagnie des Mines de Huaron.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENTS AND CHANGES IN KNOWN GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE NEAR\r\nFUTURE\r\n\r\nSo far as information is available no marked change in the rate of\r\nproduction in the countries of _Europe_ and northern _Africa_ seems\r\nprobable. Most of the districts in those countries have been exploited\r\nover a long period and have passed their zenith of production; many are\r\napproaching exhaustion. The decrease in most of them will, however,\r\nbe gradual. The most important change in Europe probably will be the\r\ntransfer to Polish jurisdiction of the whole of the Silesian field,\r\nmaking the new state of Poland, if established as proposed, the largest\r\nsingle source of zinc ore in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the _United States_, which will continue to be the largest producer\r\nof zinc in the world, the greatest increase in relative importance may\r\nbe expected from the western metallographic province, particularly in\r\nthe northwest, in the Butte and Coeur d’Alene districts. The Leadville\r\ndistrict has already passed the zenith of production and has dropped to\r\nsecond place after Butte, which is capable of still further increase.\r\n\r\nIn _Australia_ the Broken Hill district may be expected to yield about\r\n450,000 tons of concentrates annually for some three years, after\r\nwhich the output should drop to about 300,000 tons. The increase of\r\nproduction from Tasmania will largely depend upon the construction of\r\nelectrolytic zinc plants, but the island will be a factor in production\r\nin the immediate future.\r\n\r\nThe greatest new factor in the world’s output of zinc will be the\r\nBawdwin mines, in _Burma_, which within a short time will be equipped\r\nto produce about 300,000 tons of ore annually or about 75,000 tons of\r\nhigh-grade zinc concentrates and 100,000 tons of low-grade concentrates\r\nor middlings for treatment by the Ganlin process. The extent to which\r\nthe zinc concentrates from this ore will be treated in India will be\r\ndetermined by the development of the local market for sulphuric acid.\r\nThe remainder of the concentrates will be treated in England.\r\n\r\nRecent developments in the Altai Mountains of southwestern _Siberia_\r\nhave proved immense bodies of complex zinc-lead ores. The extent of\r\ntheir exploitation will, however, be determined largely by the extent\r\nof the Russian market as affected by social and political conditions.\r\nRemoval of the stringent tariff on importations from abroad to the\r\nmanufacturing centers of Warsaw, Petrograd and Moscow might greatly\r\nrestrict the market for the output of these mines. Their extreme\r\ngeographic isolation will prevent the deposits from becoming an\r\nimportant factor in the world market for a long period, notwithstanding\r\ntheir large size and excellent grade.\r\n\r\nThe utilization of the Rhodesia Broken Hill deposit in _South Africa_\r\nwill be delayed by the difficulty of separating the oxidized lead\r\nand zinc minerals, the lack of fuel, and geographic and commercial\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nPolitical control of the zinc resources of the world up to the\r\noutbreak of the war in 1914 seems to have had only a minor effect\r\nupon the industry. Economic factors made ineffective any control not\r\ninternational in scope. A very large percentage of the zinc ores of\r\nthe world were transported from the country of production to another\r\nfor treatment, in some cases even being re-exported, sometimes after\r\ncalcination, for the purpose of utilizing the sulphur content in the\r\nproduction of acid. Tariffs were imposed by some countries, as, for\r\nexample, by the United States, on certain classes of zinc ores. Such\r\nmeasures had some effect on production in Mexico and Canada. Russia had\r\nimposed heavy import duties which subsidized domestic production and\r\nstimulated exploration and development. The chief European countries\r\nimporting and smelting zinc ores admitted them free of duty.\r\n\r\nDuring the World War, however, political jurisdiction was largely\r\ninvoked to restore control of national resources to citizens of the\r\ngiven country or its allies. This movement was particularly marked in\r\nthe British Empire, wherein there now exists a joint political and\r\ncommercial control. Alien interests have been eliminated by government\r\naction and the government retains a share in the control through\r\ninterests in marketing organizations or through financial participation\r\nin treatment works. Canada has established a small bounty on zinc\r\nproduced in Canada from domestic ores and given financial aid to\r\nattempts to establish domestic smelting and refining plants.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the Alien Property Custodian has been active in\r\neliminating all alien enemy control. His appointees will control many\r\nimportant companies for several years. Such action as has been taken\r\ndoes not appear to have disturbed such centralization of control as had\r\nbeen effected.[138]\r\n\r\n  [138] See Chapter on Copper, pages 232-235, for discussion of German\r\n  interests in the American metal trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nCopper, lead and zinc form a class by themselves as regards industrial\r\nutility and tonnage produced, ranking after iron, which far outclasses\r\nthem, as the most important base metals. The annual production\r\nof each is considerably more than a million tons. In view of the\r\nindustrial importance of zinc and the fact that brass, an alloy of\r\ncopper and zinc, is an indispensable material in modern industry, it\r\nis not strange that the great industrial nations have contrived many\r\nexpedients in the endeavor to control the zinc industry.\r\n\r\nThe ownership and operative control of the mines has been a minor\r\nfactor in the commercial control of this industry. Economic factors\r\nforce the location of retort smelting plants in industrial districts\r\nadjacent to coal fields, the most important factors being availability\r\nand cost of fuel and labor, and proximity to a market for spelter. A\r\nlack of fuel and scarcity or high cost of labor has prevented smelting\r\nin some regions producing considerable ore. On the other hand, the\r\nsmelting done in some countries has been entirely disproportionate to\r\ntheir ore output. The revival of nationalist sentiment as a result of\r\nthe World War may make ownership and operative control a more important\r\nfactor in the future.\r\n\r\nElectrolytic and electro-thermic reduction of ores makes possible the\r\neconomic production of spelter where previously impossible and may\r\nbring about some decentralization of the industry.\r\n\r\nOwnership or control of the reduction plants has been an important\r\nbasis for control of the industry. The most effective control has\r\nbeen exercised through marketing organizations or trade combinations\r\nof reduction works, ore-buying and metal-selling agencies, with\r\ninterlocking directorates, joint ownership and long-term contracts for\r\nores, concentrates and metals. In recent years these became world-wide\r\nin their scope and completely dominated the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--Below are listed the most important zinc smelting\r\ncompanies in the United States, together with the percentage of the\r\ntotal reduction capacity that each controls:\r\n\r\n                                               Percentage of\r\n                                           production controlled\r\n  New Jersey Zinc Co.                               13.4\r\n  American Metal Co.                                15.2\r\n  Grasselli Chemical Co.                            10.1\r\n  Anaconda Copper Mining Co.                        10.0\r\n  United States Steel Corporation                    7.7\r\n  American Smelting & Refining Co.                   7.2\r\n  American Zinc, Lead & Smelting Co.                 5.7\r\n  Beer, Sondheimer & Co.                             4.7\r\n  L.

Vogelstein & Co., Beer, Sondheimer & Co.,\r\nthe American Metal Co., and their subsidiary companies, comprising\r\n27.3 per cent. of the smelting capacity, and various ore producers,\r\nwith their metal-selling contracts with other smelters, enabled them\r\nto dominate the American metal market in the interest of the German\r\n“Trio.” The Alien Property Custodian took over all three companies\r\nduring the war and eliminated all alien-enemy ownership and control by\r\ndisposing of German-owned stock at auction.\r\n\r\nThe American Metal Co. completely owns the American Zinc & Chemical\r\nCo., South American Metal Transport Co., Bartlesville Zinc Co., and\r\nSouth American Metal Co.; it has large holdings of stock in the Ohio\r\nand Colorado Smelting & Refining Co., Compañia Minera de Peñoles,\r\nCompañia de Minerales y Metales, Compañia Metalurgica de Torreon,\r\nCompañia Minera Palmo y Cabrillos, Fundicion de Guayacan, Balbach\r\nSmelting & Refining Co., and Nichols Copper Co., some of which operate\r\nin Mexico and South America. The capital stock of the American Metal\r\nCo. comprised 70,000 shares, of which 34,644 were owned by aliens\r\naffiliated with the German “Trio”; 18,620 shares belong to American\r\ncitizens who have had control of the management, and the remainder\r\nbelonged to the Merton interests, of London, which has been reorganized\r\nby the British government, eliminating alien ownership. The alien-owned\r\nshares have been sold by the Alien Property Custodian and the control\r\nof the business for a period of five years was vested in a board of\r\nfive trustees named by him.\r\n\r\nThe National Zinc Co. was owned by Beer, Sondheimer & Co., one of the\r\nGerman “Trio,” which also owned other metal-producing companies in the\r\nUnited States and Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe operative control of the American Zinc, Lead & Smelting Co. has\r\nbeen acquired by the Butte & Superior Mining Co., dominated by Hayden,\r\nStone & Co., of New York and Boston. A large interest in the American\r\nZinc, Lead & Smelting Co. was held by L. Vogelstein & Co., formerly the\r\nrepresentative of the German Metallgesellschaft in the United States.\r\nThe American Zinc, Lead & Smelting Co. controls the Wisconsin Zinc\r\nCo.; the American Zinc Co., of Illinois; the American Zinc Co., of\r\nTennessee; and the American Zinc Ore Separating Co.\r\n\r\nThe New Jersey Zinc Co., an American concern, controls the New Jersey\r\nfield, and, through its subsidiary, the Empire Zinc Co., owns and\r\noperates a number of mines in the western states and Mexico, and\r\nthe Mineral Point Zinc Co., of Wisconsin, one of the three largest\r\nproducers in that region, and four zinc smelters.\r\n\r\nThe Anaconda company operates a number of zinc-producing mines in the\r\nButte district and has erected electrolytic plants for the treatment of\r\nits own concentrates, one of 25-tons’ capacity as an experimental plant\r\nat Anaconda and a plant of 200-tons’ daily capacity at Great Falls,\r\nMontana. It has treated some of the production of other companies,\r\nnotably of the Butte & Superior Mining Co. It is an American company\r\nunder American control but has many European stockholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany.=--The ambition of German commercial interests to control the\r\nmetal markets and resources of the world was more nearly realized in\r\nthe case of zinc than of any other metal.\r\n\r\nThe German Zinc Syndicate (Zinkhüttenverband) was organized in 1909,\r\nby three powerful interests: (1) The Merton group, comprising the\r\nMetallgesellschaft, the Metallbank and Metallurgische Gesellschaft,\r\nall of Frankfurt, and the Merton companies of London; (2) Beer,\r\nSondheimer & Co., which through the Tellus stock company controlled\r\nover a dozen metal and chemical concerns; and (3) Aron Hirsch & Sohn,\r\nat Halberstadt; and was immediately joined by all the important\r\nSilesian and Rhenish-Westphalian zinc concerns. The organizers were\r\nmade exclusive selling agencies for the syndicate and purchases from\r\nany foreign sources were made in unison. The syndicate immediately made\r\nagreements with Austrian and Belgian producers including the Vieille\r\nMontagne, which has mines, works and agencies in many parts of the\r\nworld. It was also joined by a Dutch concern, Zincs de la Campine.\r\nThe syndicate embraced altogether 18 firms and regulated both their\r\noutput and prices. By the end of 1912 this German syndicate controlled\r\ndirectly one-half of the world’s output of zinc and three-fourths of\r\nthe European production.\r\n\r\nTwo Belgian and some French works formed another syndicate. A third\r\nwas formed by six English works, and the competition of United States\r\nfirms drove all three into the International Zinc Syndicate, which\r\nendured up to April, 1914. The International regulated the output\r\nof its members but did not fix exact prices. Through the American\r\nMetal Co., and affiliated companies, the German syndicate was rapidly\r\nbecoming a factor of importance in the control of American, Mexican,\r\nand Australian zinc production at its source. The German syndicate\r\nmaintained its dominancy and was rapidly extending and strengthening\r\nit throughout the world through banks, holding companies, affiliations\r\nwith syndicates and cartels, interlocking directorates, and joint\r\nshareholdings.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the war, the Australian zinc concentrates are\r\npermanently diverted from German reduction works, and all German\r\ncontrol is eliminated. The activities of the Alien Property Custodian\r\nhave tended to eliminate German interests in the United States. The\r\nre-establishment of the nation of Poland may take from Germany all\r\nthe Silesian deposits and reduction plants, leaving only those of the\r\nRhenish-Westphalian, Harz and Erzgebirge regions, with only one-third\r\nthe former domestic production of ore. Poland should be twice as\r\nimportant as Germany in the zinc industry, unless Germany should be\r\nable to import ores and concentrates on a large scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australia.=--At the outbreak of the World War the Australian zinc\r\nindustry was in the grip of the great German zinc syndicate, described\r\nin more detail above under “Germany.” This controlled the world’s\r\nspelter market, determined output and prices and manipulated the market\r\nin the interests of Germany. This was possible through long-term\r\ncontracts for zinc concentrates, in which form nearly the whole zinc\r\nproduct was exported for reduction in Belgium and Germany. Only 10 per\r\ncent. of the concentrates was smelted at Port Pirie or in England.\r\n\r\nDuring the war these contracts were cancelled by the Australian and\r\nBritish governments and the work of reconstructing the industry on a\r\npurely Australian and British basis was undertaken, the idea being\r\nto provide for the treatment, so far as possible, of all ores in\r\nAustralia, so that they could be marketed in their finished state.\r\nThe Australian government first formed a metals exchange, through\r\nwhich all metals produced in Australia must pass for sale. The Zinc\r\nProducers’ Association Proprietary, Ltd., was registered May 20, 1916,\r\nin Victoria, Australia, to market products of the member companies\r\nproducing zinc ores, concentrates, and metals in the Commonwealth of\r\nAustralia and Tasmania, all of which have sold their entire output\r\nto the association for fifty years. The shares, 100,000 of £1 each,\r\nare held by the following companies: Amalgamated Zinc (De Bavay’s);\r\nBroken Hill Proprietary, Block 14; Zinc Corporation; Broken Hill\r\nProprietary; Electrolytic Zinc Smelters; Junction North; North Broken\r\nHill; Sulphide Corporation; British Broken Hill; Broken Hill Associated\r\nSmelters; Broken Hill Junction; Broken Hill South Silver; Broken Hill\r\nProprietary, Block 10; Mount Lyell Mining & Railway Co.\r\n\r\nThe Australian federal government, acting through the Zinc Producers’\r\nAssociation, contracted to sell to the British government the whole\r\noutput of zinc concentrates in Australia for the period of the war and\r\nten years thereafter. Previously the Prime Minister had contracted\r\nfor the sale to the imperial government of 100,000 tons of zinc\r\nconcentrates and 45,000 tons of electrolytic zinc and spelter for ten\r\nyears. The arrangement provided for the British government taking the\r\nstocks of zinc concentrates on hand December 31, 1917, less a definite\r\npercentage reserve, and thereafter 250,000 tons per annum for the\r\nperiod of the war, and 300,000 tons annually for the following nine\r\nyears. Provision was also made for supplying the requirements of the\r\nAustralian zinc-refining works and the fulfilling of Japanese contracts\r\nduring the period covered by the British contract. Under normal\r\nconditions the Australian output of zinc concentrates, averaging from\r\n46 to 48 per cent. zinc, is about 450,000 tons per annum, valued at\r\n$25,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the above arrangements is to transfer permanently the\r\ncontrol of the Australian zinc industry from German to British citizens\r\nunder a system jointly commercial and political. The mines and works\r\nalways were owned by British and Australian capital.\r\n\r\nThe Zinc Producers’ Association is co-operative in character,\r\nguaranteeing to all members equality of treatment irrespective of\r\ntonnage. The commonwealth is represented on the board. The federal\r\ngovernment is also encouraging in every possible way the establishment\r\nof reduction works, particularly electrolytic zinc works. It has been\r\nreported that the Burma Corporation was a stockholder of the Zinc\r\nProducers’ Association, but this report has not been satisfactorily\r\nconfirmed. In case it should be true the association may ultimately\r\ncontrol the sale of 85 to 95 per cent. of the zinc ores of the British\r\nEmpire. Having smelting capacity for a considerable part of their\r\nproduction and acting as a unit in selling the surplus, the Australian\r\nzinc producers should hereafter be in a strong position in dealing with\r\nGerman, Dutch and Belgian smelters. The smelting capacity will not be\r\nlargely increased in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n=France.=--The nationalist movement in France during the war resulted\r\nin the formation of trade associations known as “consortiums,”\r\ncomprising the principal factor in each industry.[139]\r\n\r\n  [139] For a description of the consortium covering the mineral\r\n  industry, the Société Minerais et Metaux, see the Chapter on Lead,\r\n  pages 284 and 285.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE GREAT NATIONS\r\n\r\nSince the elimination of the alien-enemy interests in the American\r\nMetal Co., L. Vogelstein & Co., and Beer, Sondheimer & Co., the\r\nindustry in the _United States_ is controlled and the mines and works\r\nare owned by American capital, which also controls some zinc production\r\nin Mexico, Canada and Peru. Future production and consumption will\r\nprobably balance as before the war. There is now excess smelting\r\ncapacity, but it has been conclusively demonstrated that the country\r\nis capable of supplying the ore for even greater capacity. The United\r\nStates will retain first place as a producer. During the period of\r\nreadjustment some concentrates may be shipped to Belgium and Holland.\r\n\r\nWith the permanent diversion of the Australian concentrates, and the\r\nprobable loss of the Silesian deposits and reduction works, _Germany_\r\nwill lose its second place in the industry. With only the Rhenish,\r\nWestphalian, Harz, and Erzgebirge districts as sources of domestic\r\nores, the supply will be reduced to one-third of that produced before\r\n1914, which was only two-thirds of all the ore smelted in the country.\r\nUnless ores or concentrates can be imported, Germany will be only a\r\nsmall factor in zinc production. Whereas in 1912 Germany had 50,000\r\ntons of spelter available for export, importation may now be necessary.\r\nAs a result of the treaty of peace the Polish industry may be dominated\r\nby French capital.\r\n\r\nNot over 5 per cent. of the ore smelted in _Belgium_ is of domestic\r\nproduction. The mines are owned by French and German companies.\r\nThe works are owned by French, Belgian and Germans in about equal\r\nproportions. Part of the Australian concentrates will be allotted\r\nto Belgium for smelting. The largest single factor in the Belgian\r\nindustry, the Société de la Vieille Montagne, owned and worked mines\r\nin Belgium, Moresnet, Germany, Sweden, England, Algiers and Tunis and\r\nreduction works in Belgium, Germany and France. Although formerly\r\na member of the German zinc convention this company seems to be\r\ncontrolled by Belgian capital affiliated with the strongest Belgian\r\nfinancial interests. Several other Belgian companies have important\r\ninterests in France, Spain, Algiers, and Tunis. Close affiliation seems\r\nto exist, and may be expected to continue, between French and Belgian\r\ncapital in the zinc industry.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the _British Empire_. The domestic production of\r\nzinc ores in the British Isles is insignificant, but the smelting works\r\nhave made England an important factor in the industry, although before\r\n1914 they produced only 32 per cent. of the zinc consumption of the\r\nempire. The capacity of these works, which are British owned, has been\r\nlargely increased and new plants are being constructed to treat the\r\nconcentrates from Australia and Burma, from which sources a supply more\r\nthan sufficient is assured by the contracts of the imperial government\r\nwith the Zinc Producers’ Association of Australia. The imperial\r\ngovernment is interested in some of the plants. Reduction plants will\r\nalso be in operation in Australia, Tasmania, India, and Canada. The\r\nexcess Australian concentrates are to be allotted to French and Belgian\r\nworks. With the organization now in effect, British domination of the\r\nEuropean zinc industry seems certain.\r\n\r\nThe mines and works of _Australia_ are entirely controlled by English\r\nand Australian capital. An organization under Australian government\r\ncontrol has been made the sole marketing agency for the producers.\r\nThe mines of _India_ and _Burma_ are English controlled and the\r\nsmelter being constructed at Sakchi is partly financed by the Indian\r\ngovernment. The mines of _Canada_ are mostly British owned, although\r\nthere are some American interests. The potential capacity of the mines\r\nis large. In spite of government subsidies, the capacity and future of\r\nthe reduction works is uncertain.\r\n\r\nFrench capital controls all the domestic works and mines of _France_;\r\nalso those of Greece, Indo-China, Tunis, most of the mines of Algiers,\r\nwhere some Belgian capital is also interested, part of the Belgian\r\nand Polish mines and reduction works, some of the Spanish mines and\r\nsmelters, and probably the Caucasus mines in Russia. France should be\r\nan important factor in the industry during the near future.\r\n\r\nThe largest mines of _Italy_ are owned by Italian companies and some\r\ndomestic reduction works are under construction by them. The chief\r\nproducing company in northern Italy is English.\r\n\r\nIn _Japan_, Japanese capital owns all the domestic mines and works;\r\nalso those of Chosen (Korea), and is rapidly securing control of the\r\ndeposits of China and eastern Siberia. The present smelting capacity is\r\ngreater than domestic consumption and much larger than the domestic ore\r\nsupply. Ore is imported from China, Siberia, Indo-China and Australia.\r\n\r\nAs to _Russia_, the ownership of deposits in the Polish regions was\r\ndivided between Russians and French before 1914, and this condition\r\npresumably will be restored, modified by Polish political control. The\r\nRussian interests were doubtless under German influence. The Altai\r\nMountains region is controlled by British capital and its development\r\ndepends wholly upon how internal social and political conditions affect\r\nthe domestic market to which the product of this region is limited by\r\ngeographic isolation. Eastern Siberia seems to be rapidly coming under\r\nthe commercial control of the Japanese.\r\n\r\n_Holland_ has no mines but has considerable smelting capacity. It is\r\ndependent on its neighbors for coal also. Its future is difficult to\r\nforecast. The mines and works of _Spain_ are largely under French\r\nand Belgian control, which may be modified by contracts with English\r\ninterests. The control in _Norway_ and _Sweden_ is not definitely\r\nknown. It is nominally by local capital but some English and German\r\ninterests are probable. The Sulphide and the Zinc corporations, both\r\nBritish, are reported interested in the Hydraulic Power & Smelting Co.\r\n\r\nThe mines and works in _Austria_, which were owned by the Austrian\r\ngovernment and Austrian companies, perhaps under German domination,\r\nwill now be distributed among two or three political jurisdictions.\r\nLittle ore is imported or exported, and the region as a whole is not an\r\nimportant factor in the industry.\r\n\r\nThe mines in _Mexico_ are largely owned by Mexicans and Americans.\r\nGerman control is reported to be strong and growing. The possibilities\r\nof ore production are large.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe essential uses of zinc are: in brass, the alloy with copper, an\r\nindispensable material in modern industry; in galvanizing as rolled\r\nsheets; and in desilverizing lead bullion. The consumption is greatest\r\nin galvanizing. The amount used in the form of rolled sheets will\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nZinc and lead are commonly associated in their ores and are widely\r\ndistributed over the world, but the countries of largest ore production\r\nare, in order, United States, Germany, and Australia. Burma will soon\r\nbe of importance. Siberia can produce much ore in the near future, but\r\nexploitation will be retarded by political conditions and geographic\r\nisolation. Canada, Mexico, Chile, Peru and Bolivia may be expected to\r\nincrease their output.\r\n\r\nThe successful commercial application of electro-magnetic,\r\nelectro-static, and more especially oil flotation processes to the\r\nseparation and concentration of complex ores has made available vast\r\nresources, adding to the list of regions of ore production and\r\nmaterially affecting their relative importance.\r\n\r\nEconomic factors, particularly availability and cost of fuel and\r\nskilled labor in retort smelting and market for spelter, determined the\r\nlocation of reduction works in populous industrial districts adjacent\r\nto coal fields. The mineral resources, however, in many instances occur\r\nin countries either undeveloped industrially or without abundant and\r\ncheap fuel, and a large percentage of the zinc ores are transported\r\nfrom the producing country to another for treatment. In the order of\r\ntheir importance the countries making the most spelter are: the United\r\nStates, Germany, Belgium, Great Britain and France.\r\n\r\nCommercial control of the industry has been based chiefly on the\r\ncontrol of reduction plants and ore-buying and metal-selling\r\norganizations rather than on ownership of deposits, and to be\r\neffective it necessarily became international in scope. Before 1914\r\nan organization, apparently international in character, but really\r\ndominated by Germans, had through control on this basis achieved\r\na commanding position in the industry, influencing output and\r\nprices quite effectively. During the World War, however, political\r\njurisdiction was largely invoked to restore control of the resources\r\nof a country and industries to citizens of that country or its allies.\r\nThis movement has been particularly marked in the British Empire,\r\nwherein there now exists a joint political and commercial control\r\nthrough the Zinc Producers’ Association and contracts in which the\r\ngovernments are participants, and in France, where the Société Minerais\r\net Metaux, under government auspices, comprises all the principal\r\nmining and metallurgical companies controlled by French capital and is\r\nthe arbiter of the metal industry.\r\n\r\nA decentralization of the industry and redistribution of reduction\r\nworks is to some extent resulting from the successful application of\r\nelectrolytic reduction and to the dissemination of knowledge of the\r\npractice of retort smelting.\r\n\r\nThe _British Empire_ as a unit should be able to dominate the industry\r\nin Europe during the near future. _France_, through political and\r\ncommercial control of Algeria and Tunis, and large financial control\r\nin Belgium, Spain and Poland, will be in a strong position. _Belgium_,\r\nwith minor but widespread financial interests in mines and works in\r\nFrance, Germany, England, Sweden, Spain, Algiers and Tunis, is an\r\nimportant factor in the European situation. Its interests appear\r\nclosely affiliated with those of France. The _United States_,\r\nwith large reduction capacity and ore reserves, while maintaining\r\nits position as largest producer, is expected to supply domestic\r\nconsumption but to export little, as was the case prior to the war. The\r\nposition of _Germany_ will depend mainly upon the supply of foreign\r\nore, which may have to be imported largely from Mexico and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTIN\r\n\r\nBY JAMES M. HILL[140]\r\n\r\n  [140] The writer hereby expresses his thanks to Adolph Knopf, of the\r\n  United States Geological Survey, and R. R. Horner, of the United\r\n  States Bureau of Mines, for their assistance in the preparation of\r\n  this article.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF TIN\r\n\r\nTin, ordinarily considered one of the minor metals, is nevertheless a\r\nmetal of prime importance in the world’s present state of development.\r\nIn 1913 the value of the world’s output of tin was $131,000,000,\r\nwhich was greater than the value of the world’s output of either\r\nlead or zinc. Without tin it is very doubtful if the present methods\r\nof food packing and distribution could have been accomplished. The\r\nprincipal use of tin is in the manufacture of tin plate, from which are\r\nfabricated the so-called “tins” or “tin cans” that everyone knows. The\r\nsecond largest consumption of tin is for the alloys, solder and babbitt\r\nmade with lead, and brass and bronzes made with copper. Minor amounts\r\nof tin are used for making fine metal tubing, tin foil, and collapsible\r\ntubes for packing such materials as dental and toilet creams, artists\r\ncolors, etc. Tin is consumed by the makers of silk, principally to give\r\nweight and “rustle” to their product.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 the consumption of tin in the United States was approximately\r\n93,000 tons,[141] of which 19,000 tons was recovered from scrap\r\nmaterials. Of the total consumption 31,000 short tons was used for\r\nmaking tin plate, 20,400 short tons for solder, 13,800 short tons\r\nfor bearing metals, (babbitt, bronzes, etc.,), and 27,700 short tons\r\nfor the many minor uses, items of which are 1,000 tons for the silk\r\nindustry, 5,000 tons for foil, 4,000 tons for collapsible tubes, 3,000\r\ntons for white metal.\r\n\r\n  [141] In this report the figures for tons refer to metric tons (2,204\r\n  pounds avoirdupois) unless otherwise stated, and are given in round\r\n  numbers because errors in statistics and in conversion do not warrant\r\n  closer figuring.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to distinguish between the essential and the\r\nnon-essential uses of tin in the industries. Surely tin plate is\r\nessential, yet some saving of tin containers was made during the war\r\nshortage by curtailing the use of tin and substituting paper and other\r\nsubstances for packages carrying non-perishable products. Solders,\r\nbearing metals, and bronzes are unquestionably essential, but variation\r\nin alloy specifications made possible, during the war period, a\r\nconsiderable saving of tin without detriment to the results. In fact\r\nsome of the standards set under the emergency were superior to those\r\nused before. Aluminum foil is to some extent replacing tin foil, but\r\nno suitable substitutes have been found for tin in the manufacture of\r\ncollapsible tubes, which are necessities.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nOver 70 per cent. of the tin produced in the world is won from\r\nplacer deposits, although in the last few years the exploitation of\r\ntin-bearing lodes has become of considerable importance. Tin ores are\r\nintimately connected with siliceous igneous rocks. Practically all of\r\nthe known lode deposits are either in or lie near siliceous igneous\r\nrocks such as granite, granite-porphyry, quartz-porphyry or monzonitic\r\ntypes. In Mexico and the United States unimportant tin deposits have\r\nbeen found in rhyolite. In only one or two places in the world are tin\r\nlodes known where siliceous igneous rocks do not show on the surface,\r\nand in these places geologic evidence points to the presence of\r\ngranitic rocks at no great depth. In the world’s chief centers of tin\r\nproduction--the Malay Peninsula, Bolivia, Australia, Nigeria, Cornwall,\r\nand South Africa--the granitic rocks are everywhere in evidence, and\r\nthe tin lodes are so closely related to these granites that there is no\r\nquestion of their origin.\r\n\r\nFluorine-bearing minerals such as fluorite and topaz, tourmaline, and\r\nthe tungsten mineral, wolframite, are found in practically all tin\r\ndeposits. Molybdenite and bismuth minerals are present in many tin\r\ndeposits, though their distribution is not so general as that of the\r\nformer minerals. Copper, lead, zinc, and iron sulphides, the latter\r\noften arsenical, are common in tin lodes, and quartz and feldspar are\r\nthe chief gangue minerals.\r\n\r\nIt is generally accepted that the tin lodes were formed near the\r\nclose of intrusive activity by the final differentiates of the acid\r\nmagmas. These final solutions are notable for their pneumatolitic\r\naction and their ability to cause the profound change of granite to\r\ngreisen and the formation of stanniferous pegmatite and quartz veins.\r\nGreisen, an alteration product of granite, consists of quartz, mica\r\nand varying amounts of topaz and tourmaline. It is commonly developed\r\nalong fractures, and in favorable places large masses of rock may be\r\ngreisenized.\r\n\r\nTin deposits are most often found as lodes, both fissure and\r\npegmatitic, or stockworks, but some segregations are known. A peculiar\r\npipe-like form of deposit is found at places in the Transvaal and\r\nTasmania.\r\n\r\nGenerally tin deposits he close to the contact of intrusive and\r\nintruded rocks and are mainly found near the top of the intruding mass.\r\nIt therefore follows that in deeply eroded granite masses the chance of\r\nfinding lode tin deposits is smaller than where search is made in the\r\ntops of granitic intrusions. It has also been noted that deposits in\r\nintruded rocks generally lie where the dip of the intrusive contact is\r\nlow and are rarely present along a steeply dipping intrusive contact.\r\n\r\nPractically the sole ore mineral of tin is cassiterite (tin oxide),\r\nwhich carries 78.6 per cent. of the metal. Cassiterite is known\r\ncommercially by various names, such as tinstone, black-oxide of\r\ntin, black tin, or, where it occurs in placers, stream tin. The tin\r\nconcentrates from placer mining normally carry 60 to 75 per cent.\r\nmetallic tin, 70 per cent. being a fair average. The concentrates from\r\nthe mills treating Bolivian lode tin make a product called barilla that\r\naverages about 62 per cent. tin; the concentrates produced from lodes\r\nin Cornwall average about 65 per cent.; and from the lodes and placers\r\nof the Malay Peninsula carry about 72 per cent. tin.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the world the lodes do not carry sufficient tin to be\r\nworked profitably. In Cornwall and in Tasmania, lodes carrying about 1\r\nper cent. of tin are being mined; but in general a content of 1 to 2\r\nper cent. tin is the lower limit for commercial lode mining. In Bolivia\r\nthe tin lodes average 5 to 8 per cent. tin and some bodies of ore\r\ncarrying as much as 40 per cent. tin have been opened. In the places\r\nwhere low-grade tin ores have been mined the by-products, principally\r\narsenic and wolfram, have helped to pay expenses, and most of these\r\nmines are advantageously situated with respect to transportation and\r\nsupplies. In the placers of the Malay Peninsula, including Banca and\r\nBilliton, and those of Australia, which are worked by dredges, the tin\r\ncontent ranges from one-half pound to as high as 3 pounds, but averages\r\nless than a pound of cassiterite to the cubic yard. Advantageous\r\nlocation and cheap labor make profitable exploitation possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the map, Plate IX, tin deposits are found in every\r\npart of the world, though an inspection of Table 60 and figure 9 will\r\nshow that the deposits within the British Empire are the most important\r\nsources of the world supply. Bolivia and the Dutch East Indies have\r\nbeen the chief producers of tin outside of the British Empire, though\r\nChina and Siam are steadily gaining importance as tin producers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=British Empire.=--The British Empire has tin deposits in England,\r\nAsia, Australia, and Africa. The largest production is from the\r\ndeposits in the Malay Peninsula. The African deposits, those in Nigeria\r\nand the South African Union, yield the second largest output of the\r\nempire, the Australian deposits rank third, and the Cornwall deposits,\r\nformerly the largest producer of tin in the world, now rank fourth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Malay Peninsula._--The _Federated Malay States_ and the _British\r\nProtected Malay States_ occupy the southern end of the Malay Peninsula.\r\nThis region, which is entirely British controlled, produced for many\r\nyears one-half of the world’s output of tin, but in the last few years\r\nthe output has declined steadily. The decline seems to be due to the\r\nexhaustion of the easily worked placer deposits, though in 1917 and\r\n1918 an additional cause was the scarcity of labor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.--Tin-producing localities of the world.

S. Geological Survey, “Mineral\r\n  Resources of the United States in 1918.”\r\n\r\nThe largest tin-smelting center of the world is Singapore, where the\r\nStraits Trading Co., and the Eastern Smelting Co., both British owned,\r\nand a Chinese-owned smelter, have a combined capacity of 58,000 metric\r\ntons of metal a year.\r\n\r\nA large number of the Malaysian mines are worked by Chinese, though\r\nmuch English and Australian capital is invested in tin mining companies\r\nin the Peninsula, and the financial control of the industry is in\r\nthe hands of British subjects. Political control is exercised by a\r\nprohibitive export duty ($285 per ton) on all tin ore exported for\r\ntreatment except to the Straits Settlements, United Kingdom, or\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from Table 60 the Federated Malay States produce much\r\nmore tin than the Protected States. Practically all of the tin in the\r\nPeninsula is taken from placer deposits, some of which are still worked\r\nby hand methods, though part of the black tin is now being mined by\r\ndredges.\r\n\r\nThe backbone of the Malay Peninsula is composed of granite which is\r\nintrusive into limestone, shale, and quartzite. Tin has been found\r\nin place in practically all of the rock formations. Owing to the\r\nintense weathering and erosion of the tin-bearing formations great\r\naccumulations of detritus, more or less mixed with clay, all of which\r\ncarry cassiterite, are found in almost all parts of the Peninsula. The\r\noriginal deposits are so softened by weathering that they can be worked\r\nby hydraulic methods.\r\n\r\nThe provinces of Perak, Selangor, Pahang, and Negri Sembilan, in the\r\nFederated Malay States, produce tin. The following table shows their\r\nrelative importance.\r\n\r\nTABLE 61.--PRODUCTION OF TIN IN THE FEDERATED MALAY STATES IN 1917\r\n\r\n                    Metric tons\r\n  Perak                25,075\r\n  Selangor             10,595\r\n  Pahang                3,750\r\n  Negri Sembilan        1,055\r\n\r\nIn Negri Sembilan, quartz veins in decomposed pegmatite are worked\r\nby hydraulicking and the mixed tin-tungsten concentrate obtained is\r\nfurther separated by magnetic machines. The principal mines are near\r\nTiti and Seremban.\r\n\r\nPahang, on the eastern side of the mountains, has many widely scattered\r\ntin deposits, both lodes and placers. The chief workings at present\r\nare in the mountains near the Selangor boundary, at Bentong, Tras, and\r\nMachi. Some mining is also done at various places along the Kuantan\r\nRiver and its tributaries. Transportation is a serious item in working\r\ntin mines in Pahang.\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur is the center of the more important tin-mining operations\r\nin Selangor. Both decomposed lode-stuff and gravels are being worked.\r\nNear Serendah soft greisenized granite is worked by monitors. Near\r\nTanjong, Malim, and on the Kalumpang and Selangor rivers in the\r\nnorthern part of the state both gravels and decomposed vein materials\r\nare worked.\r\n\r\nThe Kinta district, in the State of Perak, is the most important\r\ntin-producing area in the Federated States. A structural valley eroded\r\nin soft limestones between granite ridges is the location of most\r\nof the workings. The valley is filled with clays and boulder clays\r\ncarrying tin, and the present stream channels are also stanniferous.\r\nMining is in progress around 15 or more settlements in this district;\r\nmuch of the mining is by open cuts and dredges, but some lode mining is\r\ndone on pipes in limestones. Next in importance to Kinta is the Larut\r\ndistrict, northwest of the former. Placer deposits are the chief source\r\nof tin in the district but lodes are worked at Selama and Blanda Mabok.\r\nIn the south of Perak, at Bruseh, stockworks in schist are worked by\r\nhydraulicking, yielding about three-fourths of a pound to the cubic\r\nyard of material worked.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the tin deposits in the _Protected Malay States_ has\r\nbeen hampered by transportation difficulties. Until recently the\r\nalluvial tin was won by crude native methods. The principal producing\r\ncomes from the states of Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis, and Trengganu.\r\n\r\nNear Setul, in the State of Perlis, peculiar gravel-filled caves in\r\nlimestone have been mined for tin. Some of these caves have been\r\nfollowed for four or five miles. In the State of Trengganu, lode mining\r\nunder European management is under way. The lodes seem to be decomposed\r\nstockworks in granite.\r\n\r\nAn insignificant amount of tin is mined from the beach deposits on\r\nthe Island of Malacca, Straits Settlements. The tin was derived from\r\nschists intruded by granite in which there are many stanniferous\r\nveinlets.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Africa._--As will be seen from Table 60, the principal production of\r\ntin in Africa is from _British Nigeria_. The district was worked by\r\nnatives in the early days, but no important production was made until\r\n1904, after the subjugation of the Emir of Bauchi. The production of\r\nNigeria has grown steadily till it reached 8,500 tons of concentrates\r\nin 1917. Seemingly all of the mines are controlled by British capital\r\nand the exports have been largely to the smelters in England.\r\n\r\nThe alluvial deposits of Nigeria are in the valleys of the Bauchi\r\nPlateau. Soda granite and pegmatites, intrusive into older crystalline\r\nrocks, seem to be the source of the cassiterite that has been\r\nconcentrated by the present streams. Sluicing is the principal mining\r\nmethod, though some deposits are suitable only for dredging. Tin is\r\nalso known in northern Nigeria in the Ningi and Burra hills, and other\r\nlocalities. In southern Nigeria tin has been found near Akwa-Ibami, in\r\nthe Uwet district.\r\n\r\nThe tin output of the _Union of South Africa_ is chiefly from the\r\nWaterberg-Zaaiplaats district, in the western Transvaal, a little tin\r\nbeing mined in Swaziland and the Cape province. The production has\r\nranged from 2,950 tons to 3,450 tons of concentrate a year, most of\r\nwhich before the war went to England for smelting, but since 1915 to\r\nthe Straits Settlements. A small smelter, rated at 250 tons a year, was\r\nbuilt at Zaaiplaats in 1917; it is expected to supply the tin needed in\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Waterberg district contains several tin fields. Tin ores are\r\nfound in the Red Granite and Waterberg felsites, sandstones, and\r\nconglomerates. In the former the ores occur in pipes, in irregular\r\nbodies of altered granite, disseminated in the granite, in\r\nimpregnations along fissures, and in pegmatites and quartz veins. In\r\nthe Waterberg series the tin ores are in lodes, and in irregular lenses\r\nand pockets whose position is determined by fissures or bedding planes.\r\n\r\nIn the Potgietersrust district the principal mines are largely pipe\r\ndeposits in the Red Granite. These pipes, which are very erratic in\r\ndirection, range from a few inches to 20 feet in diameter; some have\r\nbeen followed for 3,000 feet. The filling material varies greatly,\r\nranging from slightly altered granite to a greenish homogeneous rock;\r\nthe outer zones are tourmaline-quartz rock. In the smaller pipes the\r\ncassiterite is fairly evenly distributed but in the larger pipes it\r\noccurs near the outer edges.\r\n\r\nIn the Nylstroom district the principal mines are working ore deposits\r\nin felsites and shales of the Lower Waterberg series. The deposits are\r\nbrecciated country rock cemented by quartz, tourmaline, cassiterite,\r\nand fluorite.\r\n\r\nThe Warmbaths field includes several mines located along the junction\r\nof the Red Granite and the felsites. Tin is found in lodes in both\r\ntypes of rocks and some alluvial tin has been mined. In the Rooiberg\r\nfield, the tin deposits are practically all in fissures in quartzite\r\nintruded by Red Granite. Tin occurs in the Red Granite 40 miles north\r\nof Pretoria.\r\n\r\nIn the Cape Province, near Kuils River, cassiterite is found\r\ndisseminated in granite and in veins at the contact of granite and\r\nslates. Most of the small amount of tin won has been obtained from\r\ngravels derived from these deposits.\r\n\r\nIn northwestern _Swaziland_ alluvial deposits have been worked for a\r\nnumber of years, producing around 500 tons of concentrates a year. At\r\nForbes Reef, schists and slates have been intruded by granite and tin\r\nlodes are found near the contact of the two formations.\r\n\r\nTin has been reported in placer deposits in the Winnebah district and\r\nin pegmatite dikes in the Mankofa and Mount Mankwadi districts of the\r\n_Gold Coast_. Tin has been found in placer concentrates from streams in\r\n_Nyasaland_. Tin deposits seemingly of little value have been found in\r\nthe Enterprise district, east of Salisbury, and in the Ndanga district,\r\neast of Victoria, in _Rhodesia_. These deposits are stanniferous\r\npegmatites which are found in schists near granite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Australia._--Tin is produced in the following provinces of Australia:\r\nTasmania, Queensland, New South Wales, West Australia, Northern\r\nTerritory, Victoria, named in the order of their importance. In\r\n1907, the output of Tasmania was about 14,000 tons of concentrates,\r\nbut production since then steadily declined until it became nearly\r\nstationary at 3,000 tons annually for the last few years, and it is\r\nbelieved that this output can be maintained for some time.\r\n\r\nThere are tin-smelting works at Launceston, in Tasmania; Woolwich, near\r\nSydney, New South Wales; and Irvinebank, near Herberton, Queensland,\r\ncapable of producing over 4,200 tons of metallic tin a year. Of\r\nrecent years tin concentrate is being sent to the Straits Settlements\r\n(Singapore) for smelting. The exports of metallic tin from Australian\r\nports in 1917 came to about 3,100 tons.\r\n\r\nPractically all of the mining companies are controlled by Australian\r\nand English capital, and as the tin is smelted either locally or at\r\nSingapore the total Australian output can be considered as under the\r\ndirect political and commercial control of England.\r\n\r\nThe total production of tin ore from _Tasmania_[143] from 1880 to 1918,\r\ninclusive, is stated to be approximately 128,200 tons.\r\n\r\n  [143] Tasmania, Report Secretary for Mines for the year ending\r\n  December 31, 1918, p. 46.\r\n\r\nThe most important tin mine is Mount Bischoff, 45 miles southwest of\r\nEmu Bay. The deposits, discovered in 1871, are credited with a total\r\nproduction of about 75,000 tons of tin ore. There are several deposits,\r\nsoft altered quartz porphyries intrusive into schists. Topaz and\r\ncassiterite are disseminated in the porphyries, and veins carrying tin\r\nand wolframite, together with pyrite and arsenopyrite, are found both\r\nin the porphyry and schists.\r\n\r\nThe Shepherd and Murphy mine, near Middlesex, is in a zone of\r\nmetamorphism at the contact of granite, intrusive into sandstone and\r\nquartzite. Tin, tungsten, and bismuth are produced from this ore.\r\nPlacer tin deposits on the Ringarooma River (Derby district) supply\r\nabout 1,000 tons of tin concentrates a year. The principal placer\r\nmines are the Pioneer and Briseis. Near Gladstone, placers and lode\r\ndeposits carrying tin and tungsten are worked. At the Anchor mine, in\r\nthe Blue Tier district, a tin-bearing granite averaging one-half per\r\ncent. tin is worked, but mining has not been profitable. The Renison\r\nBell, Dreadnought-Boulder and Montana mines, in the North Dundas\r\nfield, are in slates cut by dikes of quartz porphyry. Zinc, lead, and\r\niron sulphides are important in the lodes. In the Heemskirt district,\r\nsouthwestern Tasmania, the tin deposits are in granite and in overlying\r\nslate and sandstone. At the Federation mine the ore is in a pipe\r\nmeasuring 25 by 15 feet at the surface, but contracting to only 1 by 5\r\nfeet at 115 feet down.\r\n\r\nTin was first produced in _Queensland_ in 1872, and the total output,\r\nincluding 1917, is estimated to be about 144,008 tons. The chief\r\nproducing districts are Herberton, Cooktown, Chillagoe, near the port\r\nof Cairns; Stannhills, Kangaroo Hills, and Stanthorpe, the latter\r\nbeing near the New South Wales border. In the Herberton-Cooktown\r\ndistricts the tin occurs in greisenized granite intruded into slates,\r\nschists, and quartzite; bismuth and tungsten minerals are associated\r\nwith it. Placer deposits are worked by hydraulicking, and in places\r\nthe tin-bearing greisen is broken down by hydraulic giants. In the\r\nStannhills field, near Croydon, cassiterite is found in veins in\r\ngranite with galena, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite. The Kangaroo Hills,\r\n100 miles south of Herberton, produces both lode and placer tin. In the\r\nStanthorpe district most of the output is from placer deposits, some of\r\nwhich are buried under basalts.\r\n\r\nTin was first mined in _New South Wales_ in 1872, and the total\r\nproduction, including the output of 1917, is estimated at 84,230 tons\r\nof tin and 34,510 tons of tin concentrates.\r\n\r\nThe chief producing districts are the Vegetable Creek and\r\nEmmaville-Tingha-Inverell region, in the northeast near the Queensland\r\nborder, and the Ardlethan district, 40 miles west of Temora, in the\r\nsouth. In the Emmaville-Inverell region the erosion of stanniferous\r\ngreisenized granite, intrusive into slates, has resulted in a\r\nwidespread distribution of tin placers, both in the present streams and\r\nin what are believed to be Tertiary stream beds that are now capped\r\nby lavas. The Vegetable Creek mines, near Emmaville, are typical of\r\nthe older placer deposits. Since 1900, dredging has become important,\r\nand it is estimated that the dredge production up to 1917 was 18,854\r\ntons of concentrates. Lode mining, although not as important, has been\r\ndone in this district in pipes and stock works in granite; the typical\r\nfluorine-bearing gangue minerals are common, and tungsten, bismuth,\r\ncopper, and lead minerals are found.\r\n\r\nTin was discovered in the Ardlethan district in 1912 in lodes in\r\ngranite and schist. Molybdenum, bismuth, and tungsten are commonly\r\nassociated with tin in the greisenized granite lodes. The Barrier\r\ndistrict, in the western part of the province, has not been a large\r\ncontributor, because of lack of water. Cassiterite is found in dikes of\r\ncoarsely crystalline granite intrusive into greisen and mica schist.\r\n\r\nIn _West Australia_ the most important tin-producing districts are\r\nGreenbushes, near the southwest, and Pilbara, on the northwest, though\r\nthere has been a very small recovery of tin in the Murchison goldfield,\r\nand Coolgardie. In the Greenbushes district cassiterite is found in\r\npegmatite and quartz-tourmaline veins in granite, but the tin won\r\nis from stream deposits and from laterite. In the Pilbara field the\r\nalluvial tin has been derived from pegmatite dikes that cut granite and\r\nmetamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\nThe production of tin in _Northern Territory_ has amounted to about\r\n200 tons a year, most of it being obtained from pegmatitic deposits in\r\ngranite in the vicinity of Burrundie.\r\n\r\nA few tons of tin concentrates are saved each year in the operation of\r\ngold placers in the Northeastern and Gippsland divisions of _Victoria_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_India._--The principal output of tin in India is from the Mergui and\r\nTavoy districts, southern Lower Burma; Tharton and Amherst districts,\r\nnorthern Lower Burma; and the Southern Shan States. The production\r\namounts to about 150 tons of metallic tin a year, and is sent to the\r\nStraits Settlements for smelting.\r\n\r\nIn the Mergui district cassiterite is found in alluvial deposits near\r\ngranite hills, the granite being intrusive into sedimentary rocks of\r\nuncertain age. Tin ore is also found in pegmatite and quartz veins. In\r\nthe Tavoy district tin is obtained as a by-product of wolfram mining.\r\nThe deposits occur in pegmatite and quartz veins cutting granite and\r\nsedimentary rocks. In the Tharton district the tin-bearing alluvium\r\nis said to be rich and its development is awaited with interest.\r\nProduction of tin began in 1912 from the deposits of Bawlake State,\r\nKarenni, Southern Shan States, and in 1917 these deposits were the\r\nchief producers in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cornwall._--In the extreme southwest of England is the famous Cornwall\r\ntin region, which includes the Camborne, St. Austell, and Liskeard\r\ndistricts, in Cornwall, and the Tavistock district, in Devon. The mines\r\nhave produced about 8,000 tons of concentrates a year, but at present\r\nthe output seems to be diminishing; in 1915 the production of metallic\r\ntin was approximately 5,000 tons, but in 1918 was only about 4,000 tons.\r\n\r\nTin mining in Cornwall dates back to prehistoric times. In the\r\nsixteenth century the mines produced about 700 tons of tin a year;\r\nthe maximum output was reached in the period 1860 to 1890, when about\r\n10,000 tons was produced annually. It is estimated that the total\r\noutput of tin from this district is approximately 1,750,000 tons. The\r\nmining companies are without exception controlled by British capital.\r\n\r\nThe second largest tin-smelting capacity in the world is in the\r\nCornwall district. The following companies, Williams Harvey & Co.,\r\nPenpoll, Cornish Tin Smelting Co., Copper Pass, Redruth Tin Smelting\r\nCo., and the London Smelting Co. operate smelters having a combined\r\noutput of approximately 31,100 tons of tin a year.\r\n\r\nThe tin deposits of Cornwall and Devon lie about five masses of\r\ngranite, which are intruded into slates (killas) and greenstones.\r\nQuartz porphyry dikes are closely connected with the granite, and the\r\ntin lodes are found in both slates and granite, being particularly\r\nabundant near intrusive contacts with low dips. The principal lodes are\r\nwide zones of fissured rock that are tourmalinized, the less important\r\nfissures containing tin and gangue minerals. Copper and tungsten\r\nminerals are produced from these lodes, and arsenic is an important\r\nby-product of smelting. The lodes in slates are as a rule richer in\r\ncopper than in the granite, and in depth the lodes contain a larger\r\nproportion of tin than nearer the surface. The mines about the Camborne\r\ngranite mass yield about 85 per cent. of the tin mined, those about the\r\nLands End granite mass 12 per cent., and the mines about St. Austell,\r\nBodmin Moor, and Dartmoor about 1 per cent. each.\r\n\r\nPractically all of the tin produced in recent years has been from\r\nlodes, but placer tin was mined near St. Austell. The lodes have been\r\nworked to a depth of 3,000 feet, which seems to be about the greatest\r\ndepth to which commercially profitable ore extends. As considerable\r\nground above this level remains to be developed, the district should be\r\nproductive for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Nations.=--Outside of the British Empire the principal tin\r\ndeposits of the world are in Bolivia, the Dutch East Indies, China,\r\nand Siam, named in the order of their importance as producers in 1918.\r\nThere are small outputs of tin from deposits in Japan, Spain, Portugal,\r\nand the United States, and tin deposits are known in Germany, Italy,\r\nRussia, Belgian-Congo, and Southwest Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bolivia._--Practically all of the tin ore shipped from Bolivia is\r\nmined from lodes. Mining began late in the last century. Exports are\r\nin the form of barilla, a tin concentrate carrying 60 to 65 per cent.\r\nand averaging about 62 per cent. tin. The output has been steadily\r\nincreasing, and since 1913 Bolivia has been the second largest producer\r\nof tin in the world. (See Table 60, and Figure 9). The majority of\r\nthe companies working in Bolivia are controlled by Chilean or local\r\ncapital, though a little English, French, Swiss, and German capital was\r\ninvested in Bolivian tin mines before the war. Recently English and\r\nAmerican capital has become interested in the deposits.\r\n\r\nPrior to the war practically all of the barilla was sent to Germany\r\nand England to be smelted, but lately exports have been to the United\r\nStates and England. A small Chilean-owned smelter, estimated capacity\r\n900 tons a year, has recently been built at Arica to handle the\r\nconcentrates from one of the larger mines.\r\n\r\nThere are four important tin-producing districts in east central\r\nBolivia, in the provinces of Potosi, Oruro, and La Paz. The region lies\r\non the high plateau (elevation, 12,000 feet) and the principal mines\r\nare near or in the mountains on the east of the pampa rather than in\r\nthe western range of the Cordillera. Schists, slates, and quartzites\r\nhave been intruded by acid igneous rocks, and the tin deposits are\r\nfound in the granites, the quartz porphyries, and the sedimentary rocks\r\nnear the contacts. The quartz veins are strong and carry between 3 and\r\n8 per cent. tin in most of the productive mines, though some bodies\r\nof ore have carried as much as 40 per cent. tin. Some of the mines\r\nwere worked for silver by the Spanish, but the silver ores seem to be\r\nlimited to the upper zones, the lodes becoming relatively richer in\r\ntin at depth. Wolframite and bismuth are won as by-products at some of\r\nthe mines. Pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and galena are usually\r\nabundant in the tin ores, and tourmaline and fluorite are not uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe Bolivian deposits are of considerable future importance. Many\r\nmines and prospects, either through lack of knowledge or finances,\r\nhave not been developed; the local management of most of the mines has\r\nbeen notoriously poor; and it is thought that with proper technical\r\ndirection the output of tin can be greatly increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dutch East Indies._--On the islands of Banca, Billiton, and Singkep,\r\nsouth of the Malay Peninsula, are important tin mines. As will be\r\nseen from Table 60 the output of tin from these islands has been\r\napproximately 21,000 tons a year. Mining began on Banka about 1718,\r\nbut the Billiton deposits were not worked until about 1860. The mines\r\nof Banka are worked by the government, but on Billiton and Singkep the\r\ndeposits are leased by private concerns, mostly Dutch. At Banka the\r\nDutch government operates smelters having a yearly capacity of 16,000\r\ntons. The concentrates produced on Billiton and Singkep are in part\r\nsent to the Straits Settlements for treatment, but some are smelted\r\nlocally.\r\n\r\nPractically all of the tin mined in the Dutch East Indies is from\r\nplacer deposits, some of which are alluvial. There is, however,\r\na little lode mining on Billiton. The cassiterite was formed in\r\ngreisenized granite and sediments, and the original deposits are\r\nsimilar to those of the Malay Peninsula. A little tungsten and gold are\r\nobtained as by-products of the tin mining.\r\n\r\n\r\n_China._--Tin deposits in the Mengtze district, near Kochiu, Province\r\nof Yunnan, southeastern China, have been worked for many years. During\r\nrecent years about 8,000 tons of tin have been exported, and it is\r\nknown that considerable tin ore produced from these deposits is smelted\r\nlocally, the metal being consumed in China. The exports go out through\r\nthe French port of Haifong. The mining industry is entirely under\r\nChinese control. Most of the tin ore is obtained by placer and open-cut\r\nmethods from decomposed granitic and pegmatitic lodes which are found\r\nnear the contact of granite that is intrusive into limestone. There are\r\nless important tin deposits in the Fuchuan and Tungchwan districts, the\r\nformer producing a very pure metal.\r\n\r\nThe tin concentrates exported go mostly to Hong Kong and the Straits\r\nSettlements for treatment, so the Chinese tin output is more or less at\r\nthe disposal of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Siam._--In that part of Siam lying in the Malay Peninsula, tin\r\ndeposits, similar in origin and occurrence to those in the British\r\nprovinces, are being worked, and as shown by Table 60 are yearly\r\nbecoming larger factors in the world’s output. The largest operations\r\nare near Renong and Tongkah, where dredging by British companies is\r\nactive. The chief producing companies are Tongkah Harbor Tin Dredging\r\nCo., Tin Benbong, Bangnon Valley, Ronpibon Extended, Beebook Dredging\r\nCo., and Katoo Syndicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Japan._--The tin-producing localities in Japan are near Kagoshima,\r\nSatsuma, on Kyushu Island; about 50 miles north of Kobe in Tajima\r\nprovince; and near Nayegi, Mino Province, near the center of the main\r\nisland. Placer deposits near Nayegi have yielded some tin, seemingly\r\nderived from pegmatite dikes in granite. The Akinobe mine, in Tajima\r\nProvince, was developed as a copper mine, but about 1912 tin and\r\ntungsten minerals were found in the ore. The veins are in slates and\r\nquartzites intruded by diorites. It is said that in 1917 about 40 tons\r\nof mixed tin-tungsten ores was produced daily. A small smelter at Ikuno\r\nhandles the tin concentrates and produces about 250 tons of tin a year.\r\nThe Susuijama mine, in Satsuma, produces tin from veins, in shales and\r\nsandstones, that also carry lead and zinc. Apparently the output is\r\nsmelted and used locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spain._--In the provinces of Salamanca, Zamora, Orense, Pontevedra,\r\nand Coruña, northwest Spain, there are tin deposits. Lode deposits are\r\nfound near the contact of granite intrusive into schists and gneisses,\r\nand placer deposits have been worked since ancient times. In 1913 about\r\n6,700 tons of ore is said to have been produced, but since then the\r\noutput has been around 100 tons a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Portugal._--In Portugal, just south of the Spanish border, tin lodes\r\nin granite and slates have been found and placer deposits worked in the\r\ngravels adjacent to the lodes. The yearly output of these deposits is\r\naround 300 tons. It is reported that American capital is interested in\r\nsome of the Portuguese tin and tungsten deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n_United States._--In the United States the domestic output is only\r\nnominal, being equivalent to 60 to 100 tons of tin a year. The\r\nproductive deposits, placers worked by dredges, are in the York\r\ndistrict of Seward Peninsula, _Alaska_. They occur near the contact\r\nof granite intrusive into limestones, in peculiar rocks of contact\r\nmetamorphic origin.\r\n\r\nCassiterite has been mined from gravels derived from pegmatite dikes\r\nintrusive in pre-Cambrian rocks of the Black Hills near Tinton and\r\nHill City, _South Dakota_, and various attempts have been made to mine\r\nthe lode deposits. These deposits are of more scientific interest\r\nthan commercial importance. A little stream tin has also been mined\r\non the _North Carolina-South Carolina_ boundary near King’s Mountain,\r\nthe cassiterite being an original constituent of pegmatite dikes\r\nintrusive into pre-Cambrian schists. At Irish Creek, Rockbridge County,\r\n_Virginia_, there are known stanniferous veins in coarse granites. In\r\nthe Franklin Mountains 14 miles north of El Paso, _Texas_, quartz veins\r\nin granite carrying cassiterite were worked at one time but have not\r\nbeen productive of late. In the Temescal Mountains, Riverside County,\r\n_California_, small quartz veins carrying cassiterite are found in\r\nacid granitic rocks that are intrusive into metamorphosed sediments.\r\nConsiderable work was done in this locality in the years 1880 to 1890,\r\nbut the irregularity of the deposits and their low tin content do not\r\nhold much promise for future production.\r\n\r\nPrior to the war the United States, although the largest consumer of\r\ntin in the world, produced practically no tin ore, and imported only\r\nmetallic tin, having no smelters for treating tin ore. Since 1916\r\nsmelters have been erected by the American Smelting & Refining Co., and\r\nthe Williams Harvey Corporation, their estimated capacity being 18,000\r\ntons of tin a year. Presumably these smelters must rely largely on\r\nBolivian concentrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Germany-Austria._--Germany has produced practically no tin ores in\r\nrecent years, though the country had a smelting industry, estimated at\r\nabout 16,000 tons of tin a year, dependent on foreign ores. The normal\r\nimports of tin ore before the war were 17,000 to 18,000 metric tons a\r\nyear, most of which came from Bolivia.\r\n\r\nIn the Erzgebirge, on the German-Austrian frontier, in the\r\nAltenberg-Zinnwald district, there was formerly some tin mining. The\r\ndeposits, which are typical greisen lying near the tops and sides of\r\nbodies of granite intrusive into schists and gneisses, have made almost\r\nno production for several years and they are considered to be exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Italy._--At Campiglia Marittima, Tuscany, iron and tin have been\r\nproduced from veins in limestone and shale. The output is variable and\r\ncannot be relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russia._--In the former Empire of Russia tin has been found in the\r\nTrans-Baikal Province, Siberia, and in the Urals and Finland in\r\nEuropean Russia. The Siberian deposits are placers in the basin of the\r\nOnon River. A German company was formed before the war to work lode\r\ntin deposits near Olovianoy, southwest of Nerchinsk, in the Urals. The\r\nFinnish deposits are at Pitkaranta, north of Lake Ladoga. The ores are\r\na mixture of magnetite, cassiterite, and chalcopyrite, occurring in\r\naltered limestone and schist.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Belgian Congo (Katanga)._--Alluvial tin derived from veins in granite\r\nand intruded sedimentary rocks has been found along Lualaba River and\r\non Busanga Ridge. There are no records of production, but the field\r\nholds considerable promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Southwest Africa._--Cassiterite occurs in pegmatite, intrusive into\r\ngranite, in the Erongo Mountains east of Brandberg, and some placer tin\r\ndeposits have been worked. On the whole the region does not seem to be\r\nparticularly promising.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBABLE CHANGES IN KNOWN GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nIt seems reasonably certain that _England_ is in a position to keep\r\nproducing a large part of the world’s tin for some time, the lessening\r\noutput from the Malaysian provinces being offset by the increased\r\nproduction of the African colonies. Both Cornwall and Australia, it\r\nis believed, will be able to maintain for a number of years a rather\r\nsteady output of about the present size.\r\n\r\n_Bolivia_ will doubtless be able to increase her output of tin, and\r\nprobably both _Siam_ and _China_ can be expected to produce larger\r\nquantities in the future. Production of the _Dutch East Indies_ can\r\nprobably be maintained at about its present rate for a number of years.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from Table 62 and Figure 10, _Great Britain_ controls\r\npolitically over 50 per cent. of the tin output of the world, in that\r\nher political influence is absolute in England, Africa, Australia, and\r\nall of her colonial possessions on the east side of the Indian Ocean;\r\nand there can be little doubt that the strong British policy with\r\nregard to the eastern colonies is also potent with respect to Siam and\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Political control of tin deposits and tin\r\nsmelters, based on estimates for 1918.]\r\n\r\n_Holland_ controls the tin output of the East Indian island colonies,\r\nin which there are smelting works that seem capable of taking care of\r\nmost of the ore mined. Holland consumes little tin herself and has\r\napproximately 16 per cent. of the world’s supply at her disposal. Prior\r\nto the war Holland was a large distributor of tin, but during the war\r\ntin from her colonies was sent direct to America and England, the\r\nlargest consuming countries.\r\n\r\n_China_ has a rather feeble political control of the output of the\r\nYunnan tin mines, but as that part of her production which reaches the\r\nrest of the world is exported through French territory, largely through\r\nEnglish middlemen, her actual control is not particularly great.\r\n\r\n_Siam_ controls some important tin fields. The very strong British\r\ninfluence on the Malay Peninsula, coupled with the fact that the\r\nSiamese ore is smelted in the Straits Settlements, seems to indicate\r\nthat British policy will largely dominate the tin-mining industry of\r\nSiam.\r\n\r\n_Bolivia_, using little tin and producing nearly a quarter of the\r\nworld’s output, is really the only considerable producer that can\r\nact more or less independently. Her mines are mostly controlled by\r\nChilian-Bolivian capital and she has the world for a market. It would\r\nseem that Bolivian barilla might be smelted locally, but as Bolivia\r\nhas no fuel, the tin smelting capacity of Bolivia amounts thus far to\r\nalmost nothing. Her nearest market at present is the United States, but\r\nthe future will show whether Bolivian ore will continue to be smelted\r\nin the United States, as during the past few years, or will be sent to\r\nEngland and Germany, as before the war.\r\n\r\nThe relation of political control of tin deposits and tin smelting is\r\nshown in the following table, and diagrammatically in Figure 10.\r\n\r\nTABLE 62.--POLITICAL CONTROL OF TIN DEPOSITS AND SMELTERS BASED ON\r\nESTIMATES FOR 1918\r\n\r\n  -------------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------\r\n               | Control of  |             |  Control of   |\r\n               |tin deposits,|             | tin smelters, |Percentage\r\n               |annual output|Percentage of|annual capacity| of world\r\n    Country    |(metric tons)| world output| (metric tons) | capacity\r\n  -------------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------\r\n  Great Britain|    59,900   |     45.5    |     88,300    |  57.3\r\n  Holland      |    20,200   |     15.2    |     16,000    |  10.2\r\n  China        |    12,000   |      9.3    |     12,000    |   7.4\r\n  Siam         |     8,600   |      7.0    |               |\r\n  Bolivia      |    28,000   |     21.3    |      2,700    |   1.6\r\n  Germany      |      ...    |      ...    |     16,000    |  10.2\r\n  France       |      ...    |      ...    |      1,500    |   0.7\r\n  America      |      ...    |      ...    |     18,000    |  12.4\r\n  All others   |     2,000   |      1.7    |        500    |   0.2\r\n               +-------------+-------------+---------------+----------\r\n    Total      |   130,700   |             |    154,000    |\r\n  -------------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL OF TIN MINES\r\n\r\nBritish capital is the dominant controlling factor of approximately\r\n57 per cent. of the world’s tin output, and through affiliations\r\nwith capital of other countries it has a partial control of about 15\r\nper cent. more. British capital is dominant in all of the British\r\npossessions and Siam, and through buying agencies practically controls\r\nthe export tin from China. Bolivian tin mines are the only ones in\r\nthe world in which British control is not strongly felt. The largest\r\npart of the Bolivian output is under the financial control of Chilean\r\nfinanciers, with local capital the next strongest factor. French and\r\nGerman money has been invested to a limited extent in Bolivian mines.\r\n\r\nRecently the firm of Guggenheim Brothers, of New York, connected with\r\nthe American tin-smelting industry, has acquired certain tin mines in\r\nBolivia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL OF TIN SMELTING\r\n\r\n_British_ capital controls tin smelters with a yearly capacity of\r\napproximately 88,300 tons of tin a year. These are situated in England,\r\nStraits Settlements, and Australia. The tin deposits of undoubted\r\nBritish control can produce ore to furnish only 62,550 tons, so that\r\nEngland has a smelting capacity of 15,750 tons a year in excess of her\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nThe _Dutch_ control the smelters, having a capacity of 16,000 tons, of\r\ntheir East Indian colonies, but the annual output of ore from these\r\ncolonies is equivalent to 20,200 tons of tin, so that an excess of\r\n4,200 tons must be smelted elsewhere, and most of this goes to the\r\nsmelters in the Straits Settlements, which are English owned.\r\n\r\n_Chinese_ capital controls smelters that are seemingly capable of\r\nhandling the entire output of China, about 12,000 tons of tin a year.\r\n\r\n_American_ capital, since the war, has developed tin smelters in the\r\nUnited States and Bolivia, which have an annual capacity of 18,000\r\nmetric tons. This capacity is being enlarged and should be able shortly\r\nto take care of the entire Bolivian tin output, provided it receives\r\nthe ore. But Chilean capital has built a smelter at Arica which could\r\nhandle about 10 per cent. of the Bolivian output, and if this smelter\r\nis favored by Chilean mine owners the American smelters may find\r\nthemselves short of ore.\r\n\r\n_German_ capital is interested in tin smelters in Germany that have a\r\nproducing capacity of 15,000 tons a year. All of the ore treated must\r\nbe imported, but it hardly seems possible that much ore from outside\r\nsources can be expected for some time, as the smelting capacity of the\r\nworld exceeds the output of the mines.\r\n\r\nThe tin-smelting capacity of the world is approximately 154,000\r\ntons, whereas the world’s production of tin ore is equivalent to\r\napproximately 130,700 tons. It is evident that, unless greater\r\nproduction is forthcoming, some smelters will be idle, and it is a\r\nreasonable surmise that neither the British nor Dutch smelters will\r\nlack ore. The United States, owing to its favorable situation with\r\nrespect to Bolivian supply, may hope to have a large part of its\r\nsmelter capacity at work, though there is some question whether enough\r\nore will be available to assure the maximum operation of the tin\r\nsmelters in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE TIN-CONSUMING COUNTRIES\r\n\r\n_Great Britain_ produces more tin than she consumes and is therefore\r\nin a position to dispose of tin to the rest of the world. From a study\r\nof import and export tables it seems that England consumes about\r\n20,000 tons of tin a year and that she imports about 55,000 tons and\r\ntherefore has 35,000 tons for export. She is in position through her\r\nlarge political and commercial control of tin deposits and smelters to\r\npractically dictate the world’s tin policy.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch colonies produce about 16 per cent. of the world’s tin, and\r\nas _Holland_ is normally a very small consumer of tin, she has supplied\r\na considerable part of the tin used in Germany and the United States.\r\n\r\nPrior to the war a considerable tin-plate industry, dependent on\r\nforeign tin, was built up in southern Russia. The consumption was about\r\n8,000 tons of tin a year, which was largely supplied by Great Britain,\r\nHolland, and Germany. If this industry is maintained Russia will still\r\nbe under the necessity of importing considerable tin.\r\n\r\nTin users in _Germany_, who, before the war, apparently consumed about\r\n22,000 tons of tin, must purchase all supplies from others. Before\r\nthe war the principal supply of tin ore was Bolivia, and of metallic\r\ntin the Dutch East Indies. It seems reasonable that Germany’s supply\r\nof Bolivian ore may be curtailed in the future, as the United States\r\nis now in position to treat the ore, and freight rates should favor\r\nshipments of Bolivian barilla to the United States rather than to\r\nGermany. Whether the German tin-smelting industry will survive or not\r\nremains to be seen.\r\n\r\n_France_ has a small tin-smelting industry, treating about 1,500 tons a\r\nyear. The apparent consumption is about 7,000 tons of tin a year, most\r\nof which was formerly imported from British India, England, and the\r\nDutch East Indies.\r\n\r\nThe _United States_ annually consumes over 80,000 tons of tin,\r\nincluding secondary metal, and produces from domestic ores about 100\r\ntons. Prior to the war, metallic tin was obtained through England and\r\nHolland, as there were no tin smelters in this country. During the\r\nwar there was established a tin-smelting industry, which is dependent\r\nentirely on foreign ore, most of which so far has come from Bolivia.\r\nThe estimated capacity of tin smelters in America is about 18,000 tons\r\na year or about 20 per cent. of the estimated yearly requirement. A\r\ncombination of English, Bolivian and American capital is interested in\r\none of these smelters, and also in Bolivian tin mines, and probably\r\nthis smelter can be supplied. There is, however, considerable question\r\nwhether the other smelters can obtain supplies of Bolivian ore.\r\nCertainly they will have competition from both English and German\r\nsmelting concerns, which will be somewhat offset by cheaper freight to\r\nthe United States than across the Atlantic. This difference is probably\r\nnot large, and it would seem that if American smelters are to get\r\nBolivian tin ore their charges must be low. A surer method of meeting\r\ntheir ore requirements would be to obtain financial control of enough\r\nore deposits in Bolivia to supply the demand.\r\n\r\nEvidently the United States must in the future, as in the past, import\r\nconsiderable quantities of tin from both Great Britain and Holland. It\r\nis to be hoped that the tin trade routes established during the war\r\nmay be maintained and that American consumers will not have to pay the\r\nadditional charges necessitated by Eastern tin going to Europe and back\r\nto the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nMERCURY\r\n\r\nBY F. L. RANSOME\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF MERCURY\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions the chief uses of quicksilver (mercury) or its\r\nsalts, stated in order of decreasing importance, are as follows: In the\r\nmanufacture of drugs and chemicals, including calomel and corrosive\r\nsublimate; in the manufacture of certain chemicals, such as glacial\r\nacetic acid, phthalic acid and phthalic anhydride, into which mercury\r\nitself does not enter; as mercury fulminate ((C:N.O₂)Hg, ¹⁄₂H₂O), made\r\nby treating mercury with alcohol and nitric acid, which is used as\r\na detonator for high explosives, and, though less than formerly, in\r\nsmall-arms ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of mercury fulminate by Howard in 1799 led to the\r\ninvention of the percussion cap in place of the old flint-lock,\r\nand fulminate still remains the best-known and most-used detonator\r\nfor gunpowder and high explosives. It is often combined with other\r\nsubstances, particularly an abrasive such as powdered glass, to\r\nincrease its sensitiveness, and with compounds or mixtures that\r\nthemselves have the property of detonating, such as sulphide of\r\nantimony and chlorate of potassium. Recently a large part of the\r\nmercury fulminate in detonators for modern high explosives has been\r\nreplaced by picric acid, trinitrotoluene, or tetranitromethylamine,\r\nwhereby a much stronger initial effect is obtained, and one part of\r\nmercury fulminate is made to detonate a charge that would have required\r\nsix times as much fulminate used alone. Other substances have been\r\nfound, which seem likely to replace mercury fulminate entirely for\r\ncertain uses. One of these is lead azide, a salt of hydronitric acid.\r\nLarge dry crystals of this salt are so sensitive as to explode when\r\nbrushed with a feather, but smaller crystals are less sensitive.\r\n\r\nAs mercuric sulphide, mercury forms the brilliant red pigment\r\n_vermilion_. The metal is employed extensively in electrical apparatus,\r\nincluding rectifiers for changing alternating into direct current,\r\nmercury vapor lamps, and storage batteries. In the manufacture of\r\nfelt hats from rabbits’ fur, mercuric nitrate is used to roughen the\r\nhairs so that they will adhere together, a process technically known\r\nas “carroting.” Metallic quicksilver is employed in the amalgamation\r\nof gold and silver ores, although of late years the wide application\r\nof the cyanide process has decreased this use. The metal is also\r\nutilized in the manufacture of instruments, thermostats, gas governors,\r\nand other appliances. Mercury enters into the composition of some\r\nanti-fouling marine paints for ship bottoms, a modern and at present\r\nrapidly increasing use. The mercury for this purpose is generally\r\nemployed as red mercuric oxide, its efficiency depending upon the\r\ngradual conversion of the oxide to the poisonous bichloride by the\r\nsodium chloride of salt water. Mercury is also used in certain\r\ncompounds for preventing boiler scale, in cosmetics, and in dental\r\namalgam. Silver nitrate has to a large extent replaced mercury in\r\nsilvering mirrors. A small quantity of quicksilver, not more than\r\ntwo or three flasks annually, is used in floating certain types of\r\nrevolving lights in lighthouses. Quicksilver is also used as the\r\ncathode in certain electrolytic processes for manufacturing chlorine\r\nand caustic soda from common salt. Mercuric oxide parts with oxygen\r\nreadily and is a useful oxidizing agent in certain chemical processes.\r\nAn important modern utilization of this property is in the manufacture\r\nof glacial acetic acid by the oxidation of acetylene.\r\n\r\nExperiments to determine the possible advantages of using mercury\r\nvapor with steam in turbine power generators are reported to have been\r\nencouraging and a 4,000-kilowatt unit has been built by the General\r\nElectric Co. to test further this application. Except for incidental\r\nlosses, the mercury so used is recoverable, but if in practice the\r\nincrease of power is as much as the experimental work has indicated a\r\nlarge consumption of the metal is likely to result.\r\n\r\nThe production of quicksilver in this country in 1917 was 35,954 flasks\r\n(of 75 pounds) and in 1918 it was 32,883 flasks.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe ores of quicksilver, like those of most metals, show on the whole\r\na close association with igneous rocks and with zones of fissuring.\r\nMore commonly than with other metals, with the possible exception of\r\nantimony, they are associated with volcanism as opposed to plutonic\r\nigneous activity and were deposited comparatively near the surface.\r\nIt follows that quicksilver deposits as a rule are found in regions\r\nof Tertiary and Quaternary volcanic activity which have not been\r\nsubjected to long and deep erosion, that they are more likely to be in\r\nthe younger geologic formations than in the older rocks, and that as a\r\nclass, compared for example with the hypogene ores of gold or copper,\r\ndo not extend to great depth. It must be noted, however, that there\r\nare some conspicuous exceptions to these generalizations. Although\r\nthe California deposits are in a region of late volcanic activity and\r\nmany of them are closely associated with active hot springs, the ore\r\nbodies that are now most productive, those at New Idria (Idria post\r\noffice) and the great deposits, at New Almaden, that formerly yielded\r\nso richly, have no obvious connection with volcanism. The greatest\r\nquicksilver mine in the world, that at Almaden, Spain, has no known\r\nconnection with volcanism or massive igneous rocks, has been worked\r\nto a depth of 1,150 feet, and the ore bodies have been found to grow\r\nlarger and richer downward. The deepest quicksilver mine in the world\r\nis the New Almaden in California, worked to a depth of 2,200 feet. The\r\npart of the mine below the 600-foot level was abandoned at a time when\r\nthe price of quicksilver was low, but it is doubtful whether, under any\r\nconditions that can now be foreseen, it will be profitable to reopen\r\nand work the deep levels of this mine.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the known quicksilver deposits are in regions of\r\ngeologically late volcanic eruptions it is probable that ores of\r\nquicksilver were deposited during or closely following epochs of\r\nsimilar igneous activity in the older geologic periods, but that many\r\nof them have been removed by erosion. Some of the deposits in the older\r\nrocks, which do not appear to be related to Tertiary or later volcanic\r\neruptions, may have had such earlier origin.\r\n\r\nThe quicksilver deposits of the Adriatic region in Europe, including\r\nthose at Idria, in Austria; Avala, in Serbia; and Monte Amiata,\r\nin Italy, have been shown by De Launay to belong to a single\r\nmetallogenetic province characterized by Tertiary eruptions. Similarly,\r\nthe somewhat scattered occurrences of quicksilver in Alaska,\r\nWashington, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, California, Arizona,\r\nMexico, Peru, and Chile coincide in part with the belt of Tertiary\r\nand Quaternary volcanic activity along the western sides of the\r\ncontinents of North and South America. The deposits at Almaden, Spain,\r\nin the Donetz basin, Russia, in Asiatic Turkey, and in China appear\r\nto be isolated occurrences that can not at present be assigned to\r\nrecognizable provinces of eruptive activity and metallization.\r\n\r\nQuicksilver deposits are not confined to rocks of any particular kind\r\nor of any particular geologic age.\r\n\r\nAt Oviedo the ore averages 0.33 per cent. and yields arsenic compounds\r\nas by-products. At Idria the ore yields 0.65 per cent. The ore of the\r\nAbbadia-San Salvatore, the principal mine in the Monte Amiata district,\r\nin Italy, yielded about 0.9 per cent. in 1915. In California few mines\r\nhave over 2 per cent. ore, and the average yield of the ore worked\r\nis about 0.5 per cent. The lowest yield that was profitably obtained\r\nin that state in 1917 was 0.185 per cent. The ores worked in Texas\r\nare generally of higher grade than those mined in California. In the\r\nprincipal mine of the Terlingua district, Texas, the won tenor of the\r\nore in 1916 was 2.5 per cent. and in 1917, 3.9 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n=Europe.=--The largest and richest deposit of quicksilver ore known\r\nis at Almaden, in central Spain. There are three nearly parallel ore\r\nbodies standing vertically side by side, each consisting of a portion\r\nof a bed of quartzite of Silurian age, impregnated with cinnabar. The\r\nore bodies have been mined to a depth of 350 meters. The production in\r\n1917 was probably about 25,000 flasks. The mine is said to have ore\r\nopened up that insures a future production of at least 40,000 metric\r\ntons of quicksilver. Other productive deposits in Spain are those near\r\nOviedo, where the ore, which contains cinnabar, pyrite, orpiment,\r\nand realgar, is said to average about one-third of 1 per cent. of\r\nquicksilver, with arsenic compounds as by-products. According to a\r\nreport from Vice Consul General H. A. McBride, written in Barcelona in\r\n1911, the principal companies operating in the Oviedo districts were\r\nthe Oviedo Mercury Mines Co., Ltd., of London, the Sociedad Fabrica de\r\nMieres, of Oviedo, and the Sociedad Union Asturiana, of Mieres. The\r\nproduction from the district in 1915 was 608 flasks (20.7 metric tons).\r\nA third group of deposits lies on the south slope of the Sierra Nevada\r\nin the provinces of Granada and Almeria, southern Spain. The production\r\nfrom Granada in 1915 was 41 flasks (1.4 metric tons).\r\n\r\nA small quantity of quicksilver was produced in _Portugal_ in the\r\nnineteenth century from a mine not far from Lisbon. Cinnabar occurs\r\nat a number of localities in _France_ and also in Corsica, but the\r\ndeposits are not of economic character.\r\n\r\nIn South _Germany_, north of Zweibrucken, are quicksilver deposits that\r\nhad considerable importance near the end of the thirteenth century,\r\nbut at the beginning of the World War the mines had been closed for\r\nmany years. Zinc ores mined near Bensberg, east of Cologne, yield\r\nannually about 90 flasks of quicksilver, won as a by-product in zinc\r\nsmelting. In the former _Austrian Empire_ the principal deposit is at\r\nIdria, about 28 miles from Trieste. The ore body occurs chiefly as an\r\nimpregnation of Triassic dolomite and shale. The output in Austria in\r\n1916, probably all from Idria, is believed to have been about 25,000\r\nflasks. Reserves capable of yielding 20,000 metric tons, or 587,733\r\nflasks, are known. At latest reports these mines were in the possession\r\nof Italy. At Zips, in northern _Hungary_, quicksilver is obtained as a\r\nby-product from iron ore (siderite) that carries mercurial tetrahedrite\r\nand some cinnabar. The production in 1913 was 2,615 flasks.\r\n\r\nTo the west of Idria, quicksilver deposits belonging to the same\r\ngeneral belt of metallization extend into northern _Italy_. The\r\nprincipal deposit of this belt in Venetia is the Vallalta. The mine\r\nproduced 9,550 flasks (325 metric tons) between 1856 and 1870, but has\r\nlong been idle. The most productive deposits of quicksilver in Italy\r\nare those of the Monte Amiata district, in Tuscany, about half way\r\nbetween Rome and Florence. Monte Amiata is apparently a post-Pliocene\r\nvolcano, and traces of recent volcanic activity survive. The most\r\nproductive mine is the Abbadia-San Salvatore, which yields about 65 per\r\ncent. of the output from the district, which in 1917 amounted to about\r\n29,300 flasks.\r\n\r\nAt Mount Avala, near Belgrade in _Serbia_, deposits of quicksilver ore\r\nhave been known since 1883, which resemble many of those in California.\r\nThe Avala deposits were worked between 1889 and 1895, but seemingly\r\nhave not been productive in late years.\r\n\r\nThe only quicksilver deposits of note in European _Russia_ are those\r\nin the Donetz coal basin, southern Russia. The essential mineral\r\nis cinnabar, accompanied by stibnite and pyrite. The deposits were\r\ndiscovered in 1879, the maximum output, 18,102 flasks (616 metric\r\ntons), was reached in 1897, and work was abandoned in 1911, but has\r\nbeen resumed since in a small way.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Asia.=--The Konia mine, in south-central _Asia Minor_, is in\r\nsilicified limestone. The quicksilver occurs as cinnabar and most\r\nof the ore carries from 1 to 2.5 per cent. of the metal. The known\r\nreserves were estimated in 1908 at 13,000 metric tons of 1 per cent.\r\nore. The production in 1911 was only 90 flasks of 75 pounds. The\r\nKara-Burnu mine, said to be the only important quicksilver mine in\r\nTurkey, is situated southeast of Smyrna. In 1906 and 1907 the mine was\r\nproducing about 3,000 flasks annually, but of late years the output has\r\ndeclined and in 1912 amounted to only 811 flasks (31 metric tons).\r\n\r\nThe Ildekansk quicksilver mine, in southeastern _Siberia_, east of Lake\r\nBaikal, has gained notoriety from the fact that political exiles were\r\ncondemned to mine the ore. The deposit appears to be of slight economic\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThat quicksilver deposits occur in the Province of Kweichow,\r\nsouth-central _China_, has long been known, but the locality is remote\r\nfrom ordinary routes of travel and comparatively little is on record\r\nconcerning their character. The ore bodies of the Wan San Chang mines\r\nare the most extensively worked. For several years prior to 1905 the\r\noutput averaged about 4,000 pounds of quicksilver a month. This would\r\nbe equivalent to about 640 flasks annually. More recent figures of\r\nproduction are not available.\r\n\r\n\r\n=North America.=--The quicksilver deposits of North America are\r\nconfined to the Cordilleran region from Alaska to Central America.\r\nThe most productive deposits are in California and western Texas. In\r\n_Alaska_ minerals containing quicksilver have been found in a number\r\nof the placer-mining districts, but deposits in place have been\r\ndiscovered in the central Kuskokwim region only. The ore occurs as\r\ncinnabar accompanied by stibnite, quartz, and a ferruginous dolomite.\r\nDevelopment has been hindered by transportation difficulties, and\r\nonly a few hundred pounds of quicksilver have been produced for local\r\nconsumption. In _Washington_ quicksilver ores have been prospected\r\nin various places, but the production is as yet inconsiderable. In\r\n_Oregon_ cinnabar is widely distributed, but only one deposit (at\r\nBlackbutte, in Lane County) is at present productive. In the Black\r\nButte mine the ore averages about 0.25 per cent. of quicksilver, and\r\nthe quantity available above the 500-foot level is estimated by the\r\ncompany at about 150,000 tons. The production of Oregon in 1917 was 388\r\nflasks, all but 3 flasks being from the Black Butte mine.\r\n\r\nIn _California_ the principal deposits occur in the Coast Ranges within\r\na belt that is about 400 miles long and has a maximum width of about\r\n75 miles. The known deposits within this area are numerous. About\r\ntwenty-five of these are at present productive, while probably three\r\ntimes that number which were once productive are now idle. With a few\r\nexceptions, the deposits of this main quicksilver belt are in rocks of\r\nprobable Jurassic age, or in serpentine which is the alteration product\r\nof peridotites. The most notable exceptions are the deposits of the\r\nOceanic mine, San Luis Obispo County, and of the Sulphur Bank mine, in\r\nLake County. Many of the most productive mines of the past have yielded\r\nno quicksilver from underground work for years.\r\n\r\nThe most productive mine in California at present is the New Idria,\r\nin San Benito County, which in 1917 yielded 11,000 flasks out of a\r\ntotal for the state of 23,733 flasks and for the United States of\r\n35,954 flasks. The New Idria ore comes from two mines, the New Idria\r\nproper and the San Carlos. The New Idria has been extensively opened\r\nto a depth of about 1,000 feet. In the San Carlos practically all\r\nof the known ore lies within 200 feet of the surface. The two mines\r\ncontributed nearly equally to the total production in 1917, and the\r\naverage winnable tenor of the ore in that year was 0.32 per cent. It\r\nhas been estimated that in the two mines there is available 2,400,000\r\ntons of ore averaging 0.253 per cent. of quicksilver.\r\n\r\nThe New Almaden mine is in Santa Clara County. At present, all the\r\nlevels below the 800-foot are under water and of late years very little\r\nore has been taken from the old mine. Most of the recent production of\r\nthe New Almaden Co., Inc., which for 1917 amounted to 2,683 flasks,\r\nhas come from the El Senador mine, northeast of the old mine, and from\r\nquicksilver recovered from ground under old furnaces and condensers. In\r\nthe New Almaden, the El Senador, and in the neighboring New Guadalupe,\r\nwhich produced 3,100 flasks in 1917, the ore occurs as irregular bodies\r\nin serpentine. Close to the mine now being worked by the New Guadalupe\r\nMining Co., and owned by the same company, is the original Guadalupe\r\nmine, once highly productive but now long idle.\r\n\r\nThe Oceanic mine, in San Luis Obispo County, ranked fourth in\r\nproductiveness in California in 1917, with an output of 1,246 flasks.\r\nThe ore occurs as an impregnation of sandstone. The average winnable\r\ntenor of the ore in 1917 was 0.185 per cent. Other mines in California\r\nwhich yielded from 500 to 1,000 flasks in 1917 are the Great Eastern,\r\nthe Cloverdale, and the Culver-Baer, all in Sonoma County. Those whose\r\noutput was between 400 and 500 flasks are the St. Johns, and the Helen,\r\nin Lake County.\r\n\r\n_Nevada_ contains many widely scattered deposits of quicksilver ore,\r\nno one of which has yet been worked on an extensive scale, although a\r\nfew have been fairly productive for short periods. The ores occur in\r\nrhyolite of Tertiary age and in limestone or associated sedimentary\r\nbeds of various ages from Paleozoic to Mesozoic. The total yield from\r\nNevada in 1917 was 997 flasks, nearly half of which came from the\r\nFarnham and Drew mine, east of Mina, which closed for lack of ore near\r\nthe end of the year. The next mine in point of yield, the Goldbanks, in\r\nHumboldt county, is also at present non-productive.\r\n\r\nIn _Texas_ the principal quicksilver deposits are in the Terlingua\r\ndistrict, in Brewster County. The ore occurs along fissure zones in\r\nCretaceous limestones and shales, generally in proximity to intrusive\r\nrock. The principal mines are the Chisos, Mariposa, Big Bend, and\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nIn _Mexico_ quicksilver deposits in the states of San Luis Potosi,\r\nGuerrero, and Durango are said to be yielding considerable quicksilver,\r\neven in the present disturbed condition of the country. A quicksilver\r\ndealer, testifying at the Tariff Commission hearing in San Francisco,\r\non June 26, 1918, said that 400 flasks a month was being exported\r\ninto the United States, but a considerable part of this was probably\r\nreclaimed quicksilver that has been used in the amalgamation of silver\r\nores.\r\n\r\n\r\n=South America.=--Quicksilver deposits are known in Colombia, Ecuador,\r\nBolivia, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, and Peru, but only those in Peru\r\nseem to be of present economic importance, and the production of that\r\ncountry in 1916 was only 62 flasks (2.1 metric tons). The most famous\r\ndeposits in Peru are those at Huancavelica, particularly those of the\r\nSanta Barbara mine, on the east flank of the western chain of the\r\nAndes. These have been worked since 1566 and are said to have yielded\r\n46,500 metric tons (1,366,480 flasks of 75 pounds) before 1790. The\r\nproduction in the 19th century has been estimated at 3,500 metric tons\r\n(102,865 flasks). The ore bodies are numerous, irregular, and occur in\r\nstratified rocks that are cut by igneous rocks. In 1916 the greater\r\npart of the quicksilver-bearing ground in the Huancavelica district was\r\npurchased by E. E. Fernandini, of Lima, and there appears to be some\r\nprospect of a resumption of active mining.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN KNOWN GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE FUTURE\r\n\r\nAs with most metalliferous ores that have been formed later than the\r\ndeposition or solidification of their inclosing rocks, the ores of\r\nquicksilver are most likely to be found in regions of eruptive activity\r\nand complex geologic structure, especially in regions of comparatively\r\nlate volcanic disturbance. It follows that new deposits are most\r\nlikely to be discovered within the areas of Tertiary or post-Tertiary\r\nvolcanic activity, as in the Cordilleran belts of North and South\r\nAmerica, the eastern coast of Asia, certain parts of Oceania, and the\r\nshores of the Mediterranean. Alaska, Mexico, and the western part\r\nof South America seem to offer the greatest possibilities of future\r\nproductivity, but there is little probability of any important changes\r\nin the sources of quicksilver taking place in the near future. The\r\nvalue of a quicksilver deposit can be ascertained as a rule only by\r\nmining exploration, and in very few quicksilver mines can any safe\r\nestimate be made of “undeveloped” ore. The known facts afford no secure\r\nbasis for predicting that in the near future some now unimportant\r\ndistrict will, within the next ten years, wrest the supremacy in\r\nproduction from Spain, or compete with Austria, Italy, California, or\r\nTexas. As regards the principal known sources, it appears that the\r\nhigh-water mark of productivity in California has long been passed,\r\nalthough the mines are still capable of increasing their present\r\nproduction under sufficient stimulus. The Italian output has been\r\nincreasing of late years, but whether this represents the discovery of\r\nnew ore bodies or indicates a longer life for the Monte Amiata district\r\nis uncertain. A permanent improvement in the political conditions in\r\nMexico, with a continuance of the present, or higher, prices, would\r\nprobably lead to a notable increase in yield from that country. There\r\nis some probability also that Peru may again become an important source\r\nof quicksilver.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nThe quicksilver industry is less likely to be modified by changes\r\nin mining methods than by improvements in metallurgy. Although very\r\nsimple in principle, the treatment of quicksilver ores, owing to the\r\nmobility and elusiveness of the metal both in the liquid and vaporized\r\ncondition, is beset with many practical difficulties.\r\n\r\nCoarsely broken ore is generally treated in various types of simple\r\nshaft furnaces, the fuel being either mixed with the charge or burned\r\nin a firebox. Finely broken or pulverulent ore, however, such as forms\r\nthe larger part of the material from most quicksilver mines, requires\r\ndifferent treatment. In Europe the common type of furnace for fine\r\nore is the Spirek and in the United States the Scott-Hütner, or, as\r\nmore commonly called, the Scott furnace. In both, the ore descends\r\nby gravity over tiles of fire-clay so shaped and placed as to permit\r\nthe flame to pass back and forth through passages under tiles, the\r\npassageways or flues being formed partly by the tiles and partly by the\r\nore itself. From the furnace the mercury-laden vapors are conducted\r\nthrough a series of condensing chambers of brick, iron, wood, or other\r\nmaterial, in which the metal collects.\r\n\r\nWhen intelligently operated, the Scott furnace is remarkably economical\r\nand efficient; but its construction is expensive and requires specially\r\nskilled masons. Moreover the furnace is difficult to repair, and once\r\nerected can not be moved. These are serious disadvantages to the man of\r\nsmall capital who is developing a new mine, and he usually has to fall\r\nback on retorts which are expensive to operate and are unsatisfactory\r\nexcept for relatively small quantities of rich ore.\r\n\r\nOf late years attempts have been made in California and Texas to use\r\nslightly modified rotary cement-kilns for treating quicksilver ores.\r\nThis innovation is promising and seems likely to prove successful.\r\nSuch a furnace, although it may not displace the Scott under some\r\nconditions, does not require elaborate masonry structure, and its use\r\nmay lead to a considerably increased production from the smaller mines.\r\n\r\nThe condensing systems used with quicksilver furnaces differ greatly\r\nand at no two mines in the United States are they identical. The brick\r\ncondensing chambers formerly so extensively used with the Scott furnace\r\nare expensive to build; also the bricks are poor conductors of heat\r\nand absorb large quantities of quicksilver. The recent tendency in\r\nCalifornia has been to replace the brick chambers with large boxes or\r\ncylindrical tanks of wood. European practice, followed by one mine in\r\nOregon and one in Texas, favors condensers constructed of vitrified\r\nearthenware pipe. The whole question of quicksilver condensation calls\r\nfor study and skillful experiment. The establishment of a standard\r\nof practice would increase production by elimination of much of the\r\nloss and discouragement that come from inefficient individual efforts\r\nto collect the mercury from the furnace vapors and gases in the most\r\ncomplete and economical way.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe quicksilver industry offers two conspicuous examples of the direct\r\npolitical control of mineral resources. The Almaden mine, whose output\r\nis such as in normal times to determine the market for quicksilver,\r\nhas been owned and worked by the Spanish government since 1645,\r\nand the Idria mine up until the close of the war was owned by the\r\nAustro-Hungarian government.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish government, on the basis of competitive proposals,\r\ncontracts with the successful bidder for the sale of the quicksilver\r\nfor periods of ten years. For a number of successive periods the\r\ncontract has been awarded to the Rothschilds of London, the present\r\none dating from June 1, 1912. The contractors bind themselves to sell,\r\nin London, the greatest possible quantity of quicksilver, which they\r\ntake f.o.b. at the reduction plant at Almaden, at prices above 7 pounds\r\nper flask, They receive a commission of 1¹⁄₄ per cent. of the amount\r\nof the sale; 6 shillings for each flask shipped from Spain to London;\r\nand 10 per cent. of the amount by which the sales price exceeds 8\r\npounds 2 shillings per flask. The Spanish government reserves from the\r\noperation of this contract 500 flasks[144] annually for the national\r\nrequirements of Spain. By this arrangement, although the mine is owned\r\nby Spain, the market has been controlled in London. During the war the\r\nsale of Almaden mercury was taken over by the Admiralty through Messrs.\r\nRothschild. The quantity received in London from Almaden in 1917 was\r\nabout 25,000 flasks.\r\n\r\n  [144] Increased to 10,000 flasks in 1919.\r\n\r\nThe Konia mine, in Asia Minor, reverted to the Turkish government in\r\n1912, but its output, as previously noted, is inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe quicksilver mines of the Monte Amiata district, Italy, although\r\nless obviously illustrative of political control than those just\r\nmentioned, should perhaps be referred to in the present connection.\r\nGerman capital has been dominant in their development in the late years\r\nbefore the war, and the most productive mines are credibly reported to\r\nhave been owned wholly or in part by the German Emperor. With the entry\r\nof Italy into the war they were seized by the Italian government. The\r\nItalian mines produced about 28,000 flasks, of which from 12,000 to\r\n15,000 flasks were purchased by the British Admiralty.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nUnder present practice the reduction of quicksilver ores is almost\r\ninvariably at the mine, both mine and reduction works being under the\r\nsame ownership. They must therefore be considered together for the\r\npurpose of the present inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous example of commercial control is that exercised by\r\nthe Rothschilds of London, who do not own the resources that give them\r\nthis pre-eminence. The yield of the remarkably rich Almaden mine, whose\r\nannual output surpasses that of any other mine and in 1916 exceeded\r\nthat of any country except Spain (whose ore, even when carelessly\r\nworked, yields quicksilver at low cost, and whose known reserves are\r\nlarge), enables the Rothschilds, in time of peace and subject to the\r\nminimum fixed price in their contract, to determine the price at which\r\nquicksilver shall be sold in the world’s markets. Another but much\r\nsmaller factor in making London the leading quicksilver mart of the\r\nworld is the control by British capital of the principal mines in the\r\nOviedo district, in northern Spain.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the country which ranks next to Spain as a\r\nproducer of quicksilver, the mines are all owned by corporations\r\nor individuals, and so far as known, there is at present no formal\r\ncombination or understanding between these owners to control output\r\nor sales. Some years ago most of the leading producers in California\r\nformed the Eureka company, which acted as selling agent and to some\r\nextent was able to control prices. Often referred to by those outside\r\nof it as the “quicksilver trust,” this organization was abandoned\r\nafter a brief existence. The firm of Haas Brothers, of San Francisco\r\n(distinct from Haas Brothers, of New York), took a leading part in the\r\nEureka company, and since its dissolution has fulfilled many of the\r\nfunctions that the company was to perform. The firm owns stock in the\r\nleading mine on the Pacific Coast and acts as selling agents for the\r\nNew Idria Quicksilver Mining Co., whom it charges 1 per cent.[145],\r\nwhereas it charges others 2¹⁄₂ per cent. It also buys the metal for\r\nitself, usually from the smaller producers, at prices generally much\r\nbelow the current market quotation, and is to supply operators with\r\nempty flasks, but only on condition that Haas Brothers shall buy the\r\nproduct or sell it on commission. Other brokers who handle important\r\nquantities of quicksilver on the Pacific Coast are Atkins, Kroll & Co.,\r\nand the Braun-Knecht-Hiemann Co., both of San Francisco. So far as\r\nknown these two firms have no ownership in quicksilver mines and sell\r\nonly on commission.\r\n\r\n  [145] This connection is reported to have been broken in 1919.\r\n\r\nThe quicksilver mines in Texas are owned by American citizens or\r\nAmerican corporations. The ore from each is independently worked and\r\nthe quicksilver is sold by the individual producers.\r\n\r\nThe mercury deposits of Mexico are owned, as far as is known, by native\r\nMexicans. British capital is probably interested in some of the larger\r\nmines. The formerly productive quicksilver mines at Huancavelica,\r\nPeru, have been purchased by E. E. Fernandini, of Lima, and may again\r\ncontribute to the world’s supply.\r\n\r\nSo far as known to the writer of this article, patents, secret\r\nprocesses or trade agreements play no part in the control of\r\nquicksilver resources.\r\n\r\nDuring the war Germany and her allies controlled the quicksilver\r\ndeposits of Australia, Serbia, Turkey and probably European Russia.\r\nOnly the Idria deposit, and perhaps the Zips deposit, in Austria, are\r\nimportant, and the available annual supply for the Teutonic allies was\r\nprobably 25,000 to 30,000 flasks. The Entente allies controlled the\r\ndeposits of the United States, yielding about 36,000 flasks annually;\r\nof Italy, yielding about 28,000 flasks; and controlled, although they\r\ndid not own, the deposits of neutral Spain, yielding from 30,000 to\r\n41,000 flasks annually. The Chinese mercury deposits were possibly\r\ndrawn upon to some extent by Japan, who, like Britain and France, has\r\nno deposits of her own that are worth mentioning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe chief uses of mercury and mercury compounds, in general order of\r\ndecreasing importance, are as follows: In the manufacture of drugs and\r\nchemicals, including calomel, corrosive sublimate, and glacial acetic\r\nacid; as a detonator for high explosives; as vermilion pigment; in\r\nelectrical apparatus, thermostats, gas governors, and other appliances;\r\nin the amalgamation of gold and silver ores; in anti-fouling marine\r\npaint; in compounds to prevent boiler scale; in cosmetics; and in\r\ndental amalgam. There are comparatively few applications of mercury\r\nwhere a substitute could not be employed, although the substitute might\r\nnot be as economical or as satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn general the ores of quicksilver do not extend to great depths and\r\nshow on the whole a close association with Tertiary and Quaternary\r\nigneous rocks that have not been subjected to long and deep erosion.\r\nThere are some notable exceptions, however, to these generalizations.\r\nNew deposits of mercury are most likely to be discovered on the eastern\r\ncoast of Asia, in certain parts of Oceania, on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, or in the Cordilleran belts of North and South America.\r\nThe known facts afford no secure basis for predicting that there will\r\nbe within the next ten years any marked shift from the present main\r\nsources of supply to some newly discovered deposit.\r\n\r\nThe richest mercury deposits are at Almaden, central Spain; at Idria,\r\nAustria-Hungary; and in the Monte Amiata district of Italy. Other\r\nproductive deposits are situated near Oviedo and Granada, Spain; in\r\nthe Donetz coal basin, Russia; near Aidin, Turkey; in the province of\r\nKweichow, China; in Oregon, California, Nevada, and Texas; in San Luis\r\nPotosi, Guerrero, and Durango, Mexico; and in Peru. Many deposits at\r\npresent unproductive are known in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe political control of the quicksilver deposits corresponds for the\r\nmost part with geographic location. The rich deposits of Almaden, in\r\nSpain, and Idria, in old Austria-Hungary, are government-owned. The\r\nSpanish government, on the basis of competitive proposals, contracts\r\nwith the successful bidder for the sale of the quicksilver for a period\r\nof ten years. The contract has been awarded to the Rothschilds of\r\nLondon for a number of successive periods. This control of the output\r\nof the Spanish mines gives the Rothschilds a control of the world’s\r\nquicksilver market. The Spanish government reserves a sufficient number\r\nof flasks annually for the national requirements of Spain. The Konia\r\nmine, in Asia Minor, has been the property of the Turkish government\r\nsince 1912. It is believed that the most productive mines of the Monte\r\nAmiata district, Italy, were owned wholly or in part by the German\r\nEmperor; with the entry of Italy into the war they were seized by the\r\nItalian government. The mines of the United States are all controlled\r\nby corporations or individuals. It is believed that the mines of Mexico\r\nare owned by Mexican citizens, although British capital may be invested\r\nin some of them. The mines at Huancavelica, Peru, have been purchased\r\nby Señor E. E. Fernandini, of Lima.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nBAUXITE AND ALUMINUM\r\n\r\nBY J. M. HILL\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF BAUXITE AND ALUMINUM\r\n\r\nBauxite, aluminum oxide, besides being the chief ore of aluminum,\r\nhas an important use in the manufacture of artificial abrasives\r\nwhich are of wide application in all metal-fabricating industries.\r\nBauxite is also the basis of an extensive chemical industry, being the\r\ncrude material from which alum, aluminum sulphate, and several other\r\nchemicals used for water purification, dyeing, and tanning are made. A\r\nrapidly growing use for bauxite is in the manufacture of bauxite brick\r\nfor furnace linings. The more essential uses of bauxite are for the\r\nmanufacture of aluminum and abrasives, though it seems doubtful whether\r\nthe utilization of bauxite for chemicals could be much restricted. The\r\nuse of bauxite for refractories is relatively small. In 1917 nearly 65\r\nper cent. of the domestic output of bauxite went into aluminum, nearly\r\n13 per cent. was taken by manufactures of aluminum salts, 19 per cent.\r\nwas consumed in the manufacture of bauxite abrasives, and 3 per cent.\r\nwas used by makers of bauxite refractories.\r\n\r\nThe uses of aluminum are myriad, chief among them are in the\r\nmanufacture of parts of internal-combustion engines, and the\r\nfabrication of industrial and household utensils.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE OF ALUMINUM MANUFACTURE\r\n\r\nHeretofore bauxites low in silica (2 to 5 per cent. SiO₂) have been\r\nused for the preparation of alumina for the manufacture of aluminum.\r\nMany experimenters have endeavored to utilize low-grade (high-silica)\r\nbauxites, or aluminum silicates for the recovery of alumina. These\r\nexperiments show that it is chemically possible to produce low-silica\r\nalumina from many aluminous materials, but not on a commercially\r\nprofitable basis. It seems reasonably certain that one or more of the\r\nmethods of handling low-grade bauxite or even aluminous silicates will\r\nbe developed to the commercial stage, even under ordinary conditions,\r\nin the near future. That event should tend to revolutionize the\r\naluminum industry, as clays and shales carrying from 25 to 35 per cent.\r\nAl₂O₃ are of widespread occurrence. Whether it would materially lower\r\nthe price of aluminum is more doubtful, for the costs of manufacture\r\nwould be raised by the increased cost of treating the low-grade crude\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe European bauxite deposits are in folded sedimentary rocks, mainly\r\nof Cretaceous age. In the United States bauxite deposits are surficial\r\nand have resulted from the alteration of either sedimentary kaolin\r\n(aluminum silicate) or kaolin derived from the weathering of syenite or\r\nof dolomitic limestones. In the tropical fields, which have as yet been\r\nlittle exploited and are in fact little known, the bauxites seemingly\r\nare surficial deposits derived from the alteration of feldspathic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe chief bauxite deposits of _Europe_ are in the provinces of Var\r\nand Herault, in southern France, though other deposits are known in\r\nBouches du Rhone and several other southern provinces. In central Italy\r\nbauxite has been mined for some years. In Germany low-grade bauxite\r\nhas been mined in the Vogelsberg Mountains, Hesse, near Königswinter,\r\nin the lower Rhine country, and is known in Hanover. In the former\r\nEmpire of Austria-Hungary there are extensive bauxite deposits in the\r\nBihar Mountains and in the provinces of Istria, Croatia, and Dalmatia.\r\nBauxite is also known in northwestern Russia, about 200 miles southeast\r\nof Petrograd. Bauxite has been mined for a number of years from beds in\r\nnorthwestern Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the _United States_, bauxite has been mined for years in central\r\nArkansas, northwestern Georgia, northeastern Alabama, and southeastern\r\nTennessee, and more recently from the central Georgia field, which is\r\nbeing extended into west-central Georgia.\r\n\r\nIn _South America_, extensive deposits of good bauxite have been\r\nfound in British and Dutch Guiana, and it is reported that there are\r\nevidences of bauxite in eastern Venezuela, western French Guiana, and\r\nnortheastern Brazil.\r\n\r\nIn _Africa_, bauxite of good quality is reported to have been developed\r\nnear the coast of French Guinea and to have been found in a number of\r\ninland localities in that colony. Vague rumors are current of large\r\nareas of bauxitic laterite[146] at many places in equatorial Africa.\r\n\r\n  [146] Laterite is the general name for rock of any kind that is in\r\n  a thoroughly softened and decomposed state, due to alteration or\r\n  weathering at the surface.\r\n\r\nIn the literature of the geology of _India_ there are many references\r\nto bauxitic laterites, and it is reported that recently some of the\r\nDeccan bauxite deposits are being exploited.\r\n\r\nIn southwestern and eastern _Australia_ some of the laterites are\r\nreported to be bauxitic, though so far as known no bauxite has been\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThere is a persistent rumor, without confirmation, that bauxite has\r\nbeen discovered recently in _China_. As to this deposit no information\r\nis available.\r\n\r\nThe table below shows the world’s production of bauxite for a number\r\nof years. Although the figures give an idea of the relative importance\r\nof the deposits with respect to consuming centers, it is not believed\r\nthat they represent relative importance with regard to the future. It\r\nseems unavoidable to conclude that the tropical countries hold immense\r\nreserves of bauxite and that some day the aluminum industry will be\r\nnearer the tropics than it is at present.\r\n\r\nTABLE 63.--WORLD’S OUTPUT OF BAUXITE, 1910-1916\r\n\r\n(Output in tons)\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n      Country             |  1910 |  1911 |  1912 |  1913 |\r\n  ------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  United States           |148,932|155,618|159,865|210,241|\r\n  France                  |192,913|250,818|254,851|304,407|\r\n  United Kingdom (Ireland)|  3,792|  6,007|  5,790|  6,055|\r\n  Italy                   |  4,524|  5,600|  6,596|  6,843|\r\n  India                   |     66|     12|   950 |  1,184|\r\n                          +-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n    Total                 |350,277|418,055|428,052|528,730|\r\n  ------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n      Country             |  1914 |  1915 |  1916\r\n  ------------------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  United States           |219,318|297,041|425,100\r\n  France                  |([147])|([147])|([147])\r\n  United Kingdom (Ireland)|  8,286| 11,723| 10,329\r\n  Italy                   |  3,844|  6,504|  8,746\r\n  India                   |    514|    400|    750\r\n                          +-------+-------+-------\r\n    Total                 |       |       |\r\n  ------------------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n  [147] No statistics available.\r\n\r\nThe production of bauxite in the United States in 1917 was 568,690 long\r\ntons.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nFrance and the United States hold within their boundaries the largest\r\ndeposits of bauxite that have been worked in the past. England\r\ncontrols, through her colonial possessions, a large share of the\r\nequatorial areas that probably contain much of the undeveloped bauxite.\r\nFrance and Holland each have possessions in the tropics in which\r\nbauxite is known, and it seems probable that bauxite may be found\r\nin the colonies of Portugal and of Belgium and in those formerly\r\ncontrolled by Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that England has placed certain restrictions on the\r\nacquisition of bauxite deposits in India and Guiana by foreign\r\nindividuals or corporations. It is known that she has restricted\r\nthe destination of bauxite exported from British Guiana. The Dutch\r\ngovernment is understood to have examined recently the bauxite deposits\r\nof Dutch Guiana, probably with a view to restricting acquisition of\r\nproperty not already acquired. Evidently there is some understanding\r\nbetween the British, French, and Italian governments which permits\r\nthe sending of French bauxite to the aluminum works of both Italy and\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe aluminum works of the world are largely under the political\r\ndomination of the United States, England, France, Germany,\r\nSwitzerland, Italy and Norway. The producing capacity of the various\r\ncountries has been estimated as follows:[148]\r\n\r\nPRODUCING CAPACITY OF ALUMINUM WORKS\r\n\r\n                                    Short tons\r\n  United States and Canada             87,500\r\n  France                               20,000\r\n  Switzerland, Germany and Austria     20,000\r\n  Norway                               16,000\r\n  England                              12,000\r\n  Italy                                 7,000\r\n  Japan                                   250\r\n                                      -------\r\n    Total                             162,750\r\n\r\n  [148] HILL, J. M., “Bauxite and Aluminum in 1916;” United States\r\n  Geological Survey; “Mineral Resources of the United States,” Part I,\r\n  1917, p. 167.\r\n\r\nThe actual output of the plants included in the above table does not\r\nrepresent full capacity, and it seems more reasonable to assume that\r\nthe production at present is probably nearer 150,000 tons a year than\r\nthe total given. There is little question that the United States and\r\nCanadian plants are producing over half of the world’s supply of\r\naluminum. It is reported that during 1917 and 1918 extensions of the\r\nBritish and Italian works brought their output nearly to the rated\r\nplant capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that the aluminum industries of the various\r\ncountries control to a large extent the bauxite deposits of the world.\r\nThe principal aluminum companies are as follows: Aluminum Company\r\nof America, British Aluminum Co., L’Aluminium Française, Aluminum\r\nIndustries A. G.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly known that before the war agreements between these four\r\ncompanies stabilized the prices of aluminum throughout the world. At\r\npresent (1919) the outlook is that the Aluminum Company of America\r\nshould be in position to dominate the aluminum industry of the world\r\nfor some years through the expansion of its electrical plants and its\r\ninitiative in acquiring newly discovered deposits of exceptionally pure\r\nbauxite in South America. It seems quite conceivable that the British\r\nand French and possibly the German interests may seek to adjust their\r\nrelations so that they can offset the American dominance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_United States and Canada._--The great bulk of the bauxite deposits of\r\nthe United States seems controlled by the Aluminum Company of America,\r\nthrough its subsidiaries, the American Bauxite Co. and the Republic\r\nMining & Manufacturing Co. There are small holdings of bauxite lands\r\ncontrolled by the National Bauxite Co., a subsidiary of the E. I. du\r\nPont de Nemours Co., and by the Norton Co., of Worcester, Mass.,\r\nmakers of artificial abrasives. Aside from these more important\r\nholders, there are a few independent operators of bauxite mines, but\r\ntheir combined output is so small that it can be disregarded.\r\n\r\nAll of the aluminum works of the United States and Canada are\r\ncontrolled by the Aluminum Company of America, which is dominated by\r\nthe Mellen banking interests, of Pittsburgh, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Guianas._--It is reported that the Aluminum Company of America\r\ncontrols about 2,030,000 acres of bauxite land in the British and Dutch\r\ncolonies. In British Guiana the ownership is seemingly in the Canadian\r\nBauxite Co. Associated with the Aluminum Company of America in the\r\nBritish Guiana holdings is the Merrimac Chemical Co., of Boston. It is\r\nalso reported that the Norton Co., of Worcester, Mass., has acquired\r\nin Dutch Guiana small holdings of bauxite lands. There are no works\r\nutilizing bauxite in Dutch Guiana.\r\n\r\n\r\n_France._--Prior to the war, some of the large deposits of high-grade\r\nbauxite in the Province of Var were controlled by the “Bauxites de\r\nFrance,” a German enterprise, but this control was naturally suspended\r\nat the beginning of hostilities, and it will probably not be resumed.\r\nThe French bauxite industry is largely in the hands of the French\r\nproducers of aluminum mentioned below, though some deposits are said to\r\nbe controlled by the British Aluminum Co. through its control of the\r\nUnion des Bauxites company.\r\n\r\nThe French aluminum industry is centralized under one selling\r\nagency, L’Aluminium Française, in which the following five companies\r\nparticipate:\r\n\r\nCompagnie des Produits Chemiques d’Alais et de la Camargue, Société\r\nElectro-Metallurgique Française, Société d’Electro-Chemie, Société des\r\nForces Motrices de l’Arve, Société Electro-Metallurgique de Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the stock of the selling company is owned by\r\nparticipating companies in proportion to their output of aluminum,\r\nwhich would indicate that the control of l’Aluminium Française rests\r\nwith the first two companies above.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great Britain._--The bauxite deposits in County Antrim, Ireland, are\r\nseemingly controlled exclusively by the British Aluminium Co. The\r\nBritish Aluminium Co. is the sole producer of the metal in England,\r\noperating plants at Foyers and Loch Leven, in the British Isles, and\r\nplants in Norway.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Norway._--All the bauxite used by the aluminum works in Norway is\r\nof French or British origin. There are no deposits of bauxite in the\r\ncountry. The British Aluminium Co. controls the aluminum plants at\r\nHigeland and Strangfiord through the Anglo-Norwegian Co. The Compagnie\r\ndes Produits Chemiques d’Alais et de la Camargue (French) largely\r\ncontrols the Société Norvegienne des Nitrures, which operates aluminum\r\nworks at Arendal and Tyssedal. A Norwegian company, the Norske Aluminum\r\nCo., has been recently organized to make aluminum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Italy._--There is little information concerning the ownership of the\r\nItalian bauxite deposits, but presumably they are controlled by the\r\nproducers of aluminum. The principal aluminum manufacturer is the\r\nSocieta Italiana per la Fabricazione dell’Alluminio, which is under\r\nItalian-French control.\r\n\r\nThe new aluminum company, L’Allumino Italiano, recently organized in\r\nItaly, if reports are true, may be in part controlled by German and\r\nSwiss interests. As the company was organized during the war, it does\r\nnot seem reasonable to suppose that German participation would be\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Central Powers._--Apparently most of the aluminum industry of these\r\ncountries is controlled by a German-Swiss company, Société Swisse\r\npour l’Industrie de l’Aluminium, or Aluminum Industrie, A. G., which\r\noperates plants at Neuhausen, Chippes, Navisance, and Borgne, in\r\nSwitzerland; at Rheinfelden, Germany, and at Lend and Rauris, in\r\nAustria. A small quantity of aluminum is also made by the German firm,\r\nGebrüder Guilini, at its plant at Martigny. It is reported that the\r\nAluminum Fabrik-Martigny, A. G., has recently been formed with G.\r\nGuilini at its head, which is possibly a reorganization of the former\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nBy far the largest and most important use of bauxite is for the\r\nextraction of aluminum, a metal used mainly in the manufacture of\r\nparts for internal-combustion engines and of industrial and household\r\nutensils. Bauxite is also used in the manufacture of artificial\r\nabrasives, as a source of certain aluminum salts, and in the\r\nmanufacture of refractory bricks. The first two uses, the manufacture\r\nof aluminum and abrasives, are the most essential, though it would\r\nbe difficult to restrict to any great extent the use in the chemical\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe principal bauxite deposits of the world are in the provinces of Var\r\nand Herault, southern France; in the former empire of Austria-Hungary;\r\nin Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama; in British and Dutch Guiana; and in\r\nnorthwestern Ireland. Minor deposits are located in Germany, Russia,\r\nVenezuela, French Guiana, Brazil, Africa, Australia, and probably\r\nChina. It is believed that the tropical countries hold immense reserves\r\nof bauxite.\r\n\r\nExperiments have shown that it is chemically possible to manufacture\r\naluminum from the low-grade (high-silicate) bauxite ores. No commercial\r\nprocess has been perfected, but it seems certain that one or more\r\nmethods will be developed to the commercial stage in the near future.\r\nA reduction in the price of aluminum is not to be expected as a\r\nresult of this change in practice, however, for the use of low-grade\r\nmaterials will undoubtedly increase the manufacturing costs.\r\n\r\nThe largest producing bauxite deposits are controlled politically by\r\nthe United States and France. Great Britain controls a large share of\r\nthe equatorial regions that probably contain most of the undeveloped\r\ndeposits. Bauxite may also be found in the colonial possessions of\r\nPortugal and Belgium, and in those formerly owned by Germany. The\r\naluminum works of the world are controlled by the United States, Great\r\nBritain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Norway.\r\n\r\nMost of the bauxite deposits of the United States are owned by the\r\nAluminum Company of America, which is dominated by the Mellen banking\r\ninterests, of Pittsburgh, and controls all of the aluminum works of\r\nthe United States and Canada. Small holdings in the United States are\r\ncontrolled by a subsidiary of the E. I. du Pont de Nemours Co., and by\r\nthe Norton Co., of Worcester, Mass. The Aluminum Company of America\r\nalso controls, through subsidiaries, large areas of bauxite land in\r\nBritish and Dutch Guiana. Before the war some of the large French\r\ndeposits were controlled by German interests. The French industry is\r\nlargely in the hands of French producers of aluminum, although some\r\nof the deposits are said to be controlled by British capital. The\r\nmain French companies have organized a selling company, L’Aluminium\r\nFrançaise.\r\n\r\nThe British Aluminium Co., controls the deposits in Ireland and is the\r\nsole producer of aluminum in England. British capital also controls\r\naluminum works in Norway. The principal bauxite deposits of Italy are\r\nprobably controlled by the Societa Italiana per la Fabricazione dell’\r\nAlluminio, an Italian-French company. Apparently most of the aluminum\r\nindustry of the Central Powers is controlled by a German-Swiss company.\r\nAmerican interests are reported to have explored bauxite deposits in\r\nFrench Guinea, Africa, but so far as known have produced no bauxite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nEMERY AND CORUNDUM\r\n\r\nBY FRANK J. KATZ\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF EMERY AND CORUNDUM\r\n\r\nCorundum is the natural (mineral) crystalline oxide of aluminum. Emery\r\nis a very fine-grained and intimate intergrowth of corundum and other\r\nminerals, chiefly magnetite, some varieties containing also important\r\namounts of hematite, spinel, and chlorite. Both emery and corundum are\r\nvery hard, and break into rough, sharp grains; hence they are used as\r\nabrasives for grinding, dressing, and polishing metals--chiefly iron\r\nand steel--and glass, and, to a less extent, stone, wood, and other\r\nmaterials. Emery and corundum are used loose in the form of grains,\r\npowders, and flours, and also as grains made up into solid wheels,\r\ncylinders, blocks, and files of many shapes by means of a great variety\r\nof binders. The essential uses are in work on iron and steel and glass.\r\nThe softer metals and other materials can be worked in many cases to\r\nbetter advantage with other abrasives, such as quartz, tripoli, garnet\r\nand pumice.\r\n\r\nThe essential operations for which emery and corundum are used can be\r\nperformed with the artificial carbide and alumina abrasives. For some\r\nwork, however, such substitutions appear not to be advisable, as the\r\nabrasive quality and efficiency of both the natural and artificial\r\nabrasives depend not only on the hardness of these materials, but also\r\non a number of other factors: among these being the physical qualities\r\nof the materials worked; the sharpness of edges and angles of broken\r\nparticles of the abrasive; the manner in which the abrasive breaks down\r\nunder use; the manner of, and materials used in, binding the abrasive\r\nparticles; and the speed and pressure with which they are applied to\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nOf the various kinds of material abraded, each calls for different\r\ngrades and kinds of abrasives, and for variation in the above factors\r\nin the use of these abrasives in order to insure most efficient use.\r\nConsequently, it is almost impossible to determine arbitrarily the uses\r\nfor which each of the various abrasive materials is essential. This\r\nmuch, at least, seems certain--that for finishing and polishing glass,\r\nparticularly optical glass and plate glass, there is as yet no general\r\nagreement that satisfactory substitutes are available for the better\r\ngrades of Turkish and Greek emery, although experiments in manufacture\r\nand use of suitable artificial abrasives have been successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe known emery deposits are products of magmatic differentiation or of\r\nregional metamorphism, or of combined contact and regional metamorphism\r\nof limestone, presumably argillaceous, and of argillaceous sediments.\r\nA study of certain individual deposits, therefore, makes possible some\r\nforecast as to future supplies in some regions, particularly those\r\nin which the emery deposits are intimately related to certain beds\r\nin metamorphic sedimentary formations in close proximity to igneous\r\nrocks. The emery bodies are, however, as a rule, spotted or irregularly\r\ndistributed, and reliable estimates of reserves are difficult.\r\n\r\nCorundum, in a number of associations, is an original constituent of\r\na great variety of igneous rocks, such as peridotites, anorthosites,\r\nsyenites, nepheline syenites, and syenite pegmatites. It is also\r\nabundantly found in regionally metamorphosed rocks and in contact\r\nmetamorphic zones, occurring in serpentines, mica schists, quartz\r\nschists, and crystalline limestones. A third important source of\r\ncorundum is alluvial deposits. Corundum is not a characteristic or\r\nessential constituent in any of these types of rocks and is present\r\nin alluvial deposits in restricted localities only. Furthermore, its\r\ndistribution and its concentration, when present, are irregular and\r\nunsystematic, and there are, therefore, no geologic guides by which\r\nfuture supplies can be forecast without intensive study of each\r\nindividual occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe chief deposits of emery and corundum in the _United States_ are in\r\nthe eastern seaboard or Appalachian states.\r\n\r\nThe emery deposits of Chester, Massachusetts, are in a narrow band less\r\nthan 500 feet wide that has been traced for nearly five miles. The\r\nChester deposits have been worked at various times since the eighties\r\nand up to 1913.\r\n\r\nEmery deposits near Peekskill, New York, are associated with igneous\r\nrocks in an area of 20 to 25 square miles. These deposits have been\r\nworked since 1889. Some of the material mined is a true emery, that\r\nis, an intimate mixture of corundum and magnetite, but most of it is\r\nlargely a mixture of spinel and magnetite, which, while not a true\r\nemery, makes an excellent abrasive. In 1916 and 1917, the annual output\r\nof ore was approximately 15,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Whittle, Pittsylvania County, Virginia, spinel\r\nemery, somewhat like the New York emery, but containing more corundum,\r\nis abundant. The deposits in this region have already produced\r\nconsiderable emery and may be counted on for a large supply.\r\n\r\nCorundum is associated with a serpentine belt extending through\r\nLancaster, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Bucks counties,\r\nPennsylvania, and through adjoining counties in Delaware and Maryland.\r\nThe deposits in this region do not seem to be of commercial importance.\r\n\r\nCorundum is found in a large number of localities in North Carolina.\r\nThe most important occurrences of corundum are in or near peridotite\r\nmasses, also in schists, and in alluvial deposits. Active mining work\r\nwas first begun in 1871 and continued until about 1906, when North\r\nCarolina corundum was driven from the market by the competition of\r\nCanadian corundum and artificial abrasives. Corundum mining was revived\r\nin 1915, and the three properties worked in 1917 made an output of 820\r\ntons. There is unquestionably a very large reserve of corundum in this\r\nregion, but transportation is difficult and efficient labor is scarce;\r\nso that there is little immediate prospect of a large development.\r\n\r\nThe only commercially important deposits of abrasive corundum west of\r\nthe Appalachian Mountains are in the central part of Gallatin County\r\nnear Salesville, Montana, where corundum occurs in syenite and syenite\r\npegmatite. The deposits have been worked by three companies, and up\r\nto 1903, when operations ceased, had produced several hundred tons of\r\ncorundum.\r\n\r\nThe sources in _Canada_ of abrasive corundum of commercial importance\r\nare limited to the corundum syenites and anorthosites in central\r\nOntario. These deposits have been developed and mined only at the\r\nBurgess mines and at Craigmont. Corundum mining as an industry in\r\nCanada began in 1900. The production reached a maximum in 1906 and was\r\nsmaller and fairly uniform from 1907 to 1913, in which year operations\r\nwere practically suspended.\r\n\r\nThe reported occurrences of corundum in _Mexico_ and _Central and South\r\nAmerica_ are chiefly of the gem variety. Emery is reported from Musco,\r\nColombia, and common corundum is reported as especially abundant at\r\nlocalities in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe only occurrence of emery and corundum of commercial importance in\r\n_Europe_ is in the islands of the Grecian Archipelago, particularly\r\nthe Island of Naxos. The deposits occur there as lenses and masses in\r\nlimestones and in the vicinity of granites. Exploration and development\r\nwork has been superficial, but reserves or future supplies there\r\nare probably enormous. Annual exports during the years 1897 to 1914\r\naveraged 6,800 metric tons.\r\n\r\nIn _Asia_ there are commercial corundum deposits in Asiatic Turkey and\r\nin India.\r\n\r\nThe emery deposits of Asiatic Turkey are near Smyrna. The Turkish\r\nemery is similar in origin and general character to the Greek emery,\r\nexcept that none is found in Asia Minor of quite the superior quality\r\nof that of Naxos. The main source of supply seems so far to have been\r\nfrom the detrital deposits. It seems almost certain that supplies are\r\nlarge. The emery mines of Asia Minor are very old and have annually\r\ncontributed large quantities to the world’s supply, their output having\r\nbeen larger than from any other region in the world. Statistics for\r\nrecent years are lacking. The recorded output in official reports of\r\nthe Turkish government was about 62,000 metric tons in 1908 and about\r\n25,000 in 1909.\r\n\r\nThe corundum deposits of India are numerous and include not only\r\nthe common abrasive varieties but also the most highly prized gem\r\nvarieties. Commercially important deposits of the abrasive variety\r\noccur in the presidency of Madras. The following provinces and native\r\nstates also contain the mineral in more or less abundance: Afghanistan,\r\nBengal, Burma, Central Provinces, Punjab, and Travancore.\r\n\r\nAvailable data on the production of corundum in India indicate an\r\noutput between 100 and 500 long tons a year, up to and including 1915.\r\nIn 1916 the production was approximately 2,000 long tons and since\r\nthen it has probably equaled or exceeded that figure. Nothing definite\r\nis known as to the corundum resources of India, except that they are\r\nundoubtedly large.\r\n\r\nThe only recorded deposits of abrasive corundum in commercial\r\nquantities on the continent of _Africa_ are in the vicinity of\r\nPretoria, in the Transvaal, where corundum, probably occurring\r\noriginally in schists, is concentrated from residual material on the\r\nland surface. Little information concerning these corundum deposits is\r\navailable, but it is probable that large reserves may be developed. The\r\nproduction, which had been slight or negligible prior to 1912, expanded\r\ngreatly in 1917 to about 3,000 long tons.\r\n\r\nCorundum appears to be abundant on the Island of Madagascar, where\r\nlarge amounts of gem stuff and abrasive materials have been found in\r\nalluvial deposits. The production of abrasive corundum, which was\r\nvery small in 1910, expanded to about 1,100 metric tons in 1913, and\r\napproximately 1,000 metric tons in 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENTS AND CHANGES IN THE NEAR FUTURE\r\n\r\nNo material changes in geographic distribution of resources appear\r\nprobable in the near future. None of the deposits now productive is\r\napproaching exhaustion, and only concerning emery in Virginia, where\r\nsomewhat larger emery production may be expected, is information at\r\nhand upon which to forecast changes in output.\r\n\r\nSubstitution of artificial abrasives for emery and corundum may be\r\nextended. Experiments conducted early in 1918 looking toward the\r\ndevelopment of an artificial abrasive suitable for use in optical\r\nand plate-glass work have been successful, so that there may remain\r\nno industrial operation wholly dependent on emery and corundum. The\r\ncomplete supplanting of the natural abrasives, however, will depend in\r\npart on the supply of bauxite available for manufacture into artificial\r\nabrasives. At present the United States supplies of bauxite are\r\nsufficient for such use.\r\n\r\nThe demand in Britain and France for Indian and South African corundum\r\nand Greek emery would undoubtedly diminish if the French artificial\r\nabrasive plants were in full operation. Such a change would also\r\nprobably cut down exports of artificial abrasives from the United\r\nStates, and correspondingly affect the demand for emery and corundum.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nEmery and corundum resources within the United States are owned, so far\r\nas known, by American citizens, and are in no way state controlled.\r\n\r\nThe Greek emery industry was formerly a monopoly controlled by\r\nthe Greek government, but the inhabitants of the emery region had\r\nalways maintained their sole right to mine the emery. This right was\r\nrespected, and the Greek government merely regulated and managed\r\nsales and exports, exacted high royalties, which were changed from\r\ntime to time, fixed prices, and maintained high quality and uniform\r\nstandards of emery for export. The French government during the war\r\nassumed control of the Naxos emery supply and presumably continued\r\nthe regulations of the Greek government. Supplies of Greek emery were\r\navailable only to France and her allies, through allocation by the\r\nFrench government.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nIn the United States the various emery and corundum deposits are in\r\nsmall holdings that are mostly owned by local residents. The mines\r\nand quarries have been worked by lessees on royalty, generally. A\r\nconsiderable number of operators are and have been engaged in several\r\nlocalities, and there are no trade coalitions. Crushing and grading\r\nare in the hands of eight independent competitive companies, except in\r\nso far as they were welded during the war into a trade association by\r\nthe War Trade Board for the purpose of allocating, under Government\r\nsupervision, the small imports of Greek emery to essential industries.\r\n\r\nIn Canada the better portions of the corundum deposits seem to be\r\ncontrolled largely by one company--Manufacturers Corundum Co.--whose\r\nowners seem to be dominantly or entirely of Canadian nationality.\r\n\r\nThe Greek emery deposits, particularly those of Naxos, are claimed to\r\nbe the inalienable property of the families resident upon the island.\r\n\r\nThere is no control of emery and corundum resources through ownership\r\nof crushing, milling, and grading plants, nor through patents or\r\nsecret processes of preparation. Trade combinations as affecting\r\nemery and corundum supply are unknown. There are a number of milling\r\ncompanies in the United States, Britain, France, and Germany, who\r\ncompete for the world’s supply of raw material, and those of each\r\ncountry compete with one another for markets for the graded, prepared\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE NATIONS\r\n\r\nThe _United States_ has supplies of inferior emery and resources of\r\ncorundum which are not developed adequately to meet the demands for\r\nnatural abrasive materials. During the war the United States was short\r\nof the amount of emery and corundum desired by consumers. However, this\r\nshortage was offset by an excess supply of artificial abrasives.\r\n\r\n_England_, in India and South Africa, has corundum supplies probably\r\nmore than sufficient for her needs. England is probably well enough\r\nsupplied with these abrasives, particularly as long as she continues\r\nto import from Canada and the United States the needed artificial\r\nabrasives.\r\n\r\n_France_ has no home supply of emery and corundum, but has large\r\nresources in her colony, Madagascar, and during the war controlled the\r\nGreek emery supply. Furthermore, France has in reserve rich bauxite\r\ndeposits and hydro-electric power for manufacture of artificial\r\nabrasives.\r\n\r\n_Germany_ depended upon Turkish emery during the war. She is short of\r\nbauxite, but makes large quantities of carborundum.\r\n\r\n_Japan_ probably can supply her needs by drawing on Indian corundum\r\nresources and on the United States for artificial abrasives. During the\r\nstringency of supply in 1917 some material was exported to the United\r\nStates from Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nCorundum and emery, the latter a close association of corundum with\r\ncertain other minerals, are used as abrasives for grinding and\r\npolishing metals, glass, stone, and wood. Many of the operations\r\nformerly performed with emery and corundum are now being performed with\r\nartificial carbide and alumina abrasives.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of emery and corundum are few in number, but their product\r\nis ample for all present needs. Commercially important deposits are\r\nsituated in the Appalachian region of the United States; on the islands\r\nof the Grecian Archipelago, especially the Island of Naxos; in the\r\nProvince of Aidin, in Asia Minor; in the presidency of Madras and the\r\nprovinces of Punjab, Bengal, and Travancore, India; in Madagascar; and\r\nin the Transvaal near Pretoria.\r\n\r\nThe geological formation of emery and corundum deposits makes\r\nimpossible any accurate estimate of reserves or any forecast of future\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nThe political control of the emery and corundum resources of the\r\nworld corresponds to the geographical location except as regards the\r\ndeposits on the Island of Naxos. This island is Grecian territory,\r\nbut the French government during the war assumed control of the emery\r\nindustry and allocated supplies of the abrasive only to the industries\r\nof France and her allies. The deposits of Asia Minor are at present\r\n(1920) nominally in the control of Turkey, but actually partly in the\r\ncoastal strips seized and held by the Italians and the Greeks after the\r\narmistice. Madagascar is a French possession, and the Transvaal and\r\nIndia are parts of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of the United States are owned by a number of small\r\nindependent operators, all American as far as is known. The Canadian\r\ndeposits are controlled largely by one company, the Manufacturers\r\nCorundum Co., whose owners are predominantly or entirely Canadian. The\r\nGreek emery deposits, particularly those of Naxos, are claimed to be\r\nthe inalienable property of the families resident on the island.\r\n\r\nTABLE 64.--PRODUCTION OF EMERY AND CORUNDUM, 1910-1917\r\n\r\n  --------------------------+-------------------------------------\r\n      |        Emery        |              Corundum\r\n  ----+------+-------+------+------+-------+------+-------+-------\r\n      |United|       |      |United|       |      | Mada- |So.\r\n      |States| Greece|      |States| Canada| India| gascar|Africa\r\n      | [149]| [149] |Turkey| [149]| [149] | [149]| [149] | [149]\r\n  ----+------+-------+------+------+-------+------+-------+-------\r\n      |      |  Ore  |      |      |       |      | Grains| Grains\r\n      | Ore  |shipped|      |Grains|       |Grains| or ore| or ore\r\n      | pro- | from  |      | pro- | Grains| pro- |  pro- |  pro-\r\n      | duced| Syria |      | duced|shipped| duced| duced | duced\r\n      | (long|(metric|      | (long| (long | (long|(metric| (long\r\n      | tons)| tons) |      | tons)| tons) | tons)| tons) | tons)\r\n  ----+------+-------+------+------+-------+------+-------+-------\r\n  1910|   940| 12,939| [150]| [151]| 1,660 |   218|    11 | [150]\r\n  1911|   620|  9,845| [150]| [151]| 1,270 |   275|   150 | [150]\r\n  1912|   870|  7,687| [150]| [151]| 1,600 |   345|   496 |    99\r\n  1913|   900|  1,440| [150]| [151]| 1,090 |   355| 1,099 | [150]\r\n  1914|   460| 10,226| [150]| [151]|   500 |   105|   556 | [150]\r\n  1915| 2,840|  [150]| [150]| [152]|   220 |    62|   327 | [150]\r\n  1916|14,400|  [150]| [150]| [152]|    60 | 1,868|   914 | [150]\r\n  1917|15,400|  [150]| [150]|  770 |   160 | [150]| [151] | 4,051\r\n      |      |       |      |      |       |      |       | [153]\r\n  ----+------+-------+------+------+-------+------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n  [149] Statistics for United States from U.

W. STONE\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF MAGNESITE\r\n\r\nMagnesite and its derived products are used in a variety of industries,\r\nthe most essential of which, beyond doubt, is metallurgy. Owing to the\r\nhigh fusion point and chemical inertness of the oxide of magnesium,\r\nmagnesite is one of the principal minerals used in the metallurgical\r\nand other industries where highly refractory material is required. For\r\nthis purpose dead-burned magnesite is used in the form of brick or of\r\ngrains. Brick and shapes are employed for lining open-hearth steel\r\nfurnaces, welding, heating, and melting furnaces, reverberatories,\r\nsettlers, and furnaces for refining lead, copper converters, and\r\nelectrical furnaces. Crushed or granular magnesite is used for lining\r\nthe bottoms of open-hearth steel furnaces, and in making crucibles and\r\ncupels.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of the cement known as oxychloride or Sorel cement\r\nthe quantity of magnesite used is exceeded only by that used for\r\nrefractory purposes. This cement is employed largely for sanitary\r\nflooring, and to a less extent for wall plaster, both interior and\r\nexterior. It is used also instead of Portland cement for some forms\r\nof exterior construction where quick and strong set is required.\r\nMagnesite is used in the manufacture of wood-pulp paper on the Pacific\r\nCoast, in fire-resisting paint, as a non-conductor of heat in pipe and\r\nfurnace coverings, and in the manufacture of magnesium chloride, light\r\ncarbonate, and other products, including metallic magnesium.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL OCCURRENCE\r\n\r\nDeposits of magnesite are widely distributed throughout the world and\r\noccur in two distinct forms, amorphous and crystalline. Amorphous\r\nmagnesite, the most common form, is fine-grained, and compact; it\r\nis usually found in veins or masses in serpentine resulting from\r\nthe alteration of magnesia-rich rocks of the peridotite family. To\r\nthis group belong the Grecian deposits, nearly all the California\r\ndeposits, and those in Mexico, Venezuela, and other parts of the\r\nworld. Crystalline magnesite is medium to coarse grained, and occurs\r\nas masses in limestone, dolomite or associated sediments which have\r\nbeen metamorphosed. The principal deposits of this class are those in\r\nAustria, Hungary, Quebec, and Washington.\r\n\r\nDeposits of magnesite are regarded as having originated in three\r\nways. The massive non-crystalline variety, such as that in California\r\nand Greece, is believed to have been formed by the decomposition of\r\nserpentine. Magnesite deposits near Bissel, California, and on Muddy\r\nRiver, near St. Thomas, Nevada, are said to be of sedimentary origin.\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian, Washington, and Quebec deposits are regarded\r\nas resulting from the replacement of calcareous sedimentary rocks by\r\nmagnesian-bearing solutions.\r\n\r\nMagnesite deposits that occur as veins in connection with serpentinized\r\nmagnesian rocks probably are formed both from the breaking down of the\r\nserpentine-making minerals and from the serpentine itself. It seems\r\nprobable that usually both serpentine and magnesite are formed in the\r\nprocess of decay of the original minerals in peridotite and the allied\r\nbasic rocks, and that during the decay of the serpentine the formation\r\nof magnesite continues. In any case the magnesia or magnesian mineral\r\nis changed to carbonate, dissolved by percolating water charged with\r\ncarbon dioxide, and precipitated in cracks and crevices as veins. When\r\nformed in this way the magnesite occurs in large and small veins,\r\nlenses, and stockwork, and its distribution and extent are erratic.\r\nIt seems fair to assume that these deposits may extend to the limit\r\nof depth of easily circulating surface waters, which in favorable\r\nconditions may be several hundred feet. Faulting, on the other hand, is\r\nas likely to cut the veins off in depth as in length. Any estimate of\r\navailable tonnage of magnesite in deposits of this type therefore is\r\nunwarranted in advance of development work.\r\n\r\nSedimentary deposits such as those of Bissel, California, and near St.\r\nThomas, Nevada, are by their nature more regular in occurrence, and\r\ntheir tonnage can be estimated from the outcrop in natural exposures\r\nand prospects.\r\n\r\nReplacement deposits like those in Washington and Quebec are not so\r\nregular as the sedimentary deposits, but are more regular than the\r\nveins, and tonnage estimates may be based on the surface exposure and\r\nan assumed depth of 50 to 100 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe known distribution of magnesite deposits is as follows:\r\n\r\n  _North America._\r\n    Canada: Quebec, British Columbia and elsewhere.\r\n    United States: California, Washington, Nevada.\r\n    Mexico: Lower California on Santa Margarita Island.\r\n\r\n  _South America._\r\n    Venezuela: Island of Margarita.\r\n\r\n  _Europe._\r\n    Austria, Hungary, Germany, Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Norway, Sweden,\r\n    Russia.\r\n\r\n  _Africa._\r\n    Transvaal, Rhodesia, Portuguese West Africa.\r\n\r\n  _Asia._\r\n    India, in Madras and Mysore.\r\n\r\n  _Australia._\r\n    Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania.\r\n\r\n  _Oceania._\r\n    New Caledonia.\r\n\r\nThe following description by countries is in the order given above:\r\n\r\n\r\n=North America.=\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canada._--The principal magnesite deposits in Canada are in the\r\nGrenville district, Argenteuil County, _Quebec_, where the mineral is\r\nassociated with serpentine, dolomite, and other minerals. The magnesite\r\nin the Grenville district is a glistening cream-white to milk-white\r\nor gray material that occurs in extensive masses associated with\r\nbands or lenses of dark green to light-yellow serpentine. Throughout\r\nthe great mass of the deposits the magnesite and dolomite are so\r\nsimilar in appearance that the detecting of dolomite is difficult.\r\nThere is considerable positive evidence in support of the hypothesis\r\nthat the deposits have been formed by the solution and replacement\r\nof crystalline limestone through the agency of magnesia-rich\r\nsolutions. Outcrops of the deposits are up to 1,000 feet long and 300\r\nfeet wide. It is estimated that there are in sight 686,900 tons of\r\nmagnesite containing less than 12 per cent. CaO and 483,700 tons of\r\nmagnesite-dolomite containing more than 12 per cent. CaO.\r\n\r\nIn the Atlin mining district, in _British Columbia_, both magnesite\r\nand hydromagnesite have been noted, but the extensive masses of\r\nhydromagnesite near the town of Atlin are the most important. These\r\ndeposits are superficial beds of fine powdery white hydromagnesite 6 to\r\n8 feet thick, that cover areas up to 18 acres in extent. Two groups of\r\nthese deposits are estimated to contain 180,000 tons of hydromagnesite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_United States._--Magnesite in commercial quantity occurs in\r\nCalifornia, Nevada, and Washington. Reports of workable deposits in\r\nother states have not been verified.\r\n\r\nIn _California_ there are magnesite deposits in many places throughout\r\nthe Coast Range and on the west slope of the Sierras, from Mendocino\r\nand Placer counties on the north to Riverside County on the south.\r\nBefore the war, mining was limited to a few localities and the annual\r\noutput was about 10,000 tons, but the demand caused by large reduction\r\nin imports started active prospecting and development, with the result\r\nthat in 1917 thirteen counties yielded a total of 211,663 tons, valued\r\nat $2,116,630. In nine counties the deposits are large and in four\r\ncounties only small deposits have been found as yet. The most important\r\ndeposits are in Napa, Santa Clara, San Benito, and Tulare counties.\r\nIn 1917, 63 per cent. of the crude magnesite produced was mined in\r\nTulare County. Practically all of the California magnesite deposits\r\nare irregular veins in serpentine, resulting from the alteration of\r\nmagnesian igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nIn the state of _Washington_ deposits of crystalline magnesite have\r\nbeen found at several places. The Washington magnesite differs greatly\r\nfrom the California deposits and occurs in larger masses. It is\r\ncoarsely crystalline, like marble or coarse textured dolomite, and is\r\nred, pink, black, white, and gray. The Stevens County magnesite has\r\nbeen formed by the replacement of lenses of dolomite in sedimentary\r\nrocks. The recrystallization of the purer magnesian carbonate may have\r\nbeen secondary and influenced by the intrusion of basic magnesian\r\nrock which occurs above and below the magnesite in some places. The\r\nlarger deposits are 200 or more feet thick and 1,000 or more feet\r\nlong. Estimates of one million tons within 100 feet of the surface are\r\nreasonable for at least three of the deposits. Mining in Washington\r\nbegan in December, 1916, with a production of 715 tons. The output in\r\n1917 was 105,175 tons, valued at $783,188.\r\n\r\nThe only known deposit of magnesite in _Nevada_ is an extensive\r\nsedimentary bed in the valley of Muddy River, Clark County. The\r\nmagnesite carries more than 5 per cent. lime and more than 11 per cent.\r\nsilica. It has not been developed.\r\n\r\nThe total production of magnesite in the United States in 1915 was\r\n30,499 short tons; in 1916, 154,974 short tons; in 1917, 316,838 short\r\ntons; and in 1918, 231,605 short tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mexico._--On the Island of Santa Margarita, in Magdalena Bay, _Lower\r\nCalifornia_, are extensive deposits of magnesite from which exports\r\nhave been made to the United States. Walls of canyons in the mountains\r\nshow masses of magnesite several feet thick, and magnesite boulders\r\nstrew the stream beds. Large quantities can be obtained without mining\r\nand need only to be broken up for shipment. An analysis of calcined\r\nmagnesite from Santa Margarita Island shows practically no silica,\r\nlime, or iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n=South America.=--The deposits on Margarita Island, _Venezuela_, are\r\nof the amorphous or California type and occur in veins and stockwork.\r\nNo information is available regarding their extent, but 500 tons were\r\nexported to the United States in 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Europe.=--The magnesite deposits of _Austria_ and _Hungary_, which\r\nuntil recently furnished much of the world’s supply, extend along a\r\nnortheast line for several hundred miles across the two countries.\r\nThe mineral occurs in lenses. A large deposit near Veitsch, Austria,\r\nmeasures 700 to 800 feet from the top to the base. The ore is quarried\r\nin a series of benches. Another very large deposit in Austria is at\r\nRadenthein. The magnesite is quarried by great cuts, and lowered by\r\ngravity to rotary kilns. Calcining is done near the mine and both grain\r\nand magnesite bricks are shipped. The property was owned by Americans\r\nbefore the war and much of the output went to American ports.\r\n\r\nThe magnesite in these deposits is crystalline and occurs in dolomite,\r\nprobably of Carboniferous age, from which it was derived by the\r\ninfiltration of magnesium carbonate solutions and the leaching out of\r\nsoluble calcium carbonate. It is finely to coarsely crystalline, yellow\r\nor bluish-white, carries 3 to 4.5 per cent. iron oxide, less than 2 per\r\ncent. silica, and less than 3 per cent. lime. It calcines readily to\r\nthe dead-burned state and makes satisfactory grain magnesite and brick\r\nfor refractory purposes.\r\n\r\nDeposits of magnesite were worked for many years near Frankenstein,\r\nSilesia, _Germany_.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Santander, in northern _Spain_, coarse crystalline\r\nmagnesite lying in Lower Cretaceous limestone and dolomite has been\r\nmined for a number of years. The production in 1915 was 1,400 tons.\r\n\r\nIn _Greece_, magnesite is of the non-crystalline type and occurs\r\nassociated with serpentine in veins and masses. The most important\r\ndeposits are on the Island of Euboea. The Euboean deposits are all\r\nclose to the seashore, and under normal conditions cheap water\r\ntransportation to the principal magnesite markets of the world is\r\navailable. The production of Greek magnesite in 1914 was mainly in the\r\nhands of three companies: the Anglo-Greek Magnesite Co., 24 Finsbury\r\nSq., London; the Société Hellenique des Mines, Athens; and the Hellenic\r\nMagnesite Co., Athens. The distribution of the magnesite is controlled\r\nby the London company. The Anglo-Greek Magnesite Co. works mines at\r\nGalataki and Afration, in Euboea. At the Galataki mines the vein of\r\nore exposed is known to be 1,300 feet long and 50 to 60 feet wide. The\r\nSociété Hellenique des Mines (now called The Financial Corporation of\r\nGreece, Ltd.,) controls the production of several mines at Mantoudi,\r\nLimni, Larimna, etc. The Hellenic Magnesite Co. obtains most of its\r\nore from surface excavations. In 1912 the production of magnesite by\r\nseveral companies in Greece, (not including the Hellenic Magnesite Co.)\r\nwas as follows: Raw magnesite, 87,338 tons; calcined magnesite, 30,645\r\ntons; dead-burned magnesite, 3,201 tons. This is equivalent to about\r\n150,000 tons of crude ore, and does not include the product of one of\r\nthe three largest producers.\r\n\r\nThe magnesite from Greece and that from California are practically\r\nidentical in physical and chemical character, but prior to 1915 the\r\nCalifornia material could not compete with the Grecian in the New York\r\nmarket, because of the transcontinental freight rate being so high in\r\ncomparison with the ocean freight on material brought as ballast.\r\n\r\nMagnesite is found in large quantities in _Macedonia_, occurring as\r\nveins in serpentine.\r\n\r\nMagnesite deposits, formerly worked, occur in _Italy_ in the Turin\r\ndistrict, and on the Island of Elba. None of the deposits seems to be\r\nlarge. An analysis of magnesite from the Island of Elba shows over 8\r\nper cent. silica, a trace of iron, and from 1 to 3.5 per cent. lime.\r\n\r\nMagnesite occurs in _Norway_ as small veins in serpentine, but, unlike\r\nother magnesite in serpentine, it is crystalline. It is remarkable in\r\nthat it shows no lime, but it carries over 4 per cent. iron and 9 per\r\ncent. silica. It is calcined and made into brick.\r\n\r\nDeposits similar to those in Norway are found in _Sweden_, but\r\non account of their situation, which entails heavy operating and\r\ntransportation expenses, it is doubtful if they will ever be able to\r\ncompete with cheaper European magnesite.\r\n\r\nMagnesite has been mined in the Orenburg government, _Russia_. One mine\r\nyielded 26,320 metric tons in 1906. Magnesite occurs also on the north\r\nslope of the Caucasus Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Africa.=--Extensive deposits of magnesite occur in the _Transvaal_,\r\nas veins, that range up to 4 feet in thickness. The rock is used\r\nfor making carbon dioxide and oxychloride cement. Great deposits of\r\nmagnesite are reported in _Portuguese West Africa_. The deposits are\r\nnear, or associated with, boiling springs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Asia.=--The most important occurrence of magnesite in _India_ seems\r\nto be in the Madras presidency, in the southern part of the peninsula\r\nof Hindustan, where the mineral occurs in interlacing veins. The main\r\ndeposits have produced more than 2,000 tons in a single year.\r\n\r\nCrystalline magnesite occurs in limestone in the _Manchuria_ mountains,\r\nand is mined at Daisetsukyo for refractory purposes.\r\n\r\nMagnesite is reported in _Asiatic Turkey_ about 75 kilometers from\r\nSmyrna.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australia.=--The deposits of magnesite in _Queensland_ are so small\r\nthat they probably have no commercial value. Rounded blocks of pure\r\nwhite magnesite outcrop in one locality in _New South Wales_, where\r\nmany thousands of tons are available at small cost. An analysis shows\r\n99.01 per cent. magnesium carbonate and no lime. Large deposits of\r\nmagnesite are reported in _South Australia_. Extensive deposits also\r\noccur on the north end of the west coast of _New Caledonia_. A small\r\nquantity has been exported.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe magnesite deposits that play a notable part in the world’s economy\r\nare situated in Canada, United States, Austria-Hungary, and Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\n_United States._--The principal magnesite deposits in the State of\r\nWashington are owned by the Northwest Magnesite Co., Spokane, Wash.;\r\nValley Magnesite Co., Spokane, Wash.; and American Mineral Production\r\nCo., Chicago, Ill. The Northwest Magnesite Co. is the largest producer\r\nin the Washington field and probably has made the largest investment.\r\nThe American Mineral Production Co. has a plant at Valley, Wash.; the\r\nValley Magnesite Co. has a deposit near Valley, but is not operating it.\r\n\r\nThe principal producers of magnesite in California in the summer\r\nof 1918 were the Tulare Mining Co., with a mine near Porterville;\r\nPorterville Magnesite Co. of California, with mine at Porterville;\r\nWestern Magnesite Development Co., with a mine at Red Mountain; and\r\nFrank R. Sweasy, working the White Rock mine, Pope Valley, Napa County.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Austria._--The Veitscher Magnesite Co., of Vienna, and the Magnesite\r\nCo., Ltd., of Budapest, formed a combination or cartel, with the\r\nunderstanding or agreement that all the sales of magnesite outside of\r\nAustria and Hungary had to be made through Carl Spater & Co., a German\r\nfirm in Coblenz, Germany. The firm of Carl Spater & Co. formerly owned\r\nthe works of the Veitscher Magnesite Co., but sold out and obtained\r\nthe perpetual selling agency when the stock company was formed. The\r\nHarbison-Walker Refractories Co., Pittsburgh, Penn., is said to have\r\nbeen the American representative of Spater & Co.\r\n\r\nThe Austro-American Magnesite Co., whose deposit and works at\r\nRadenthein, Austria, represent an investment of $1,800,000, is owned by\r\nAmericans. The entire stock is absolutely controlled by the principal\r\nstockholders of the American Refractories Co., or was so controlled\r\nbefore the war. The Austro-American Magnesite Co., it is claimed, was\r\ndoing virtually 95 per cent. of the magnesite business in England\r\nbefore the war, and about 65 to 70 per cent. of the business in the\r\nUnited States. This company has a capacity of 150,000 tons of calcined\r\nmagnesite a year.\r\n\r\nWhen it was found that Carl Spater & Co., who handle both magnesite and\r\nmagnesite brick made by the Veitscher Magnesite Co. and the Magnesite\r\nCo., Ltd., would not sell magnesite to the English refractory brick\r\nmakers, the Austro-American Magnesite Co. formed a selling company\r\nin England, called the Anglo-Austrian Magnesite Co., of Sheffield,\r\nEngland. The English company sold magnesite from the Austro-American\r\nMagnesite Co. works at Radenthein, Austria, to all the refractory brick\r\nmanufacturers of England, and virtually took all the English trade from\r\nthe Germans.\r\n\r\nThe General Magnesite Co., of Budapest, has a magnesite deposit and\r\nplant at Hizonvich (Hisnyoviz?), Hungary. The stock of this company\r\nis believed to be owned principally by stockholders of the General\r\nRefractories Co., 111 Broadway, New York. The balance of the stock,\r\nbelieved to be about 40 per cent., is owned by some Hungarians of\r\nBudapest, represented by Mr. Gunst, of Budapest, president of the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nAccording to the United States Department of Commerce,[154] there\r\nare seven companies exploiting magnesite in Greece: The Anglo-Greek\r\nMagnesite Co., Ltd., with head offices in London, England; the\r\nSociété Financière de Grèce, Solon and Lycabettus Streets, Athens;\r\nThe Internationale Magnesite Werken, with head offices in Rotterdam,\r\nNetherlands; L. Carambelas, Limni, Euboea; N. Papantonatos, Limni,\r\nEuboea; G. A. Georgidades, Athens, (exploiting a concession on behalf\r\nof the General Magnesite & Magnesia Co., of Philadelphia); and Alexiou,\r\nDaphnopotamos, Euboea. Most of the producers in 1917 had an abundance\r\nof orders for magnesite to be used in the steel industry in France and\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n  [154] Commerce Reports, May 1, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe principal and most essential use of magnesite is in metallurgy,\r\nas a refractory material for lining furnaces. Magnesite is also used\r\nin the manufacture of Sorel cement and of paper from wood-pulp, in\r\nfire-resisting paints, as a non-conductor of heat in pipe and furnace\r\ncoverings, and in the manufacture of magnesium chloride, light\r\ncarbonate and other products, including metallic magnesium.\r\n\r\nMagnesite occurs in two forms, amorphous and crystalline, and the\r\ndeposits originate in three ways: by the decomposition of serpentine,\r\nas sedimentary deposits, and by the replacement of calcareous\r\nsedimentary rocks by magnesium-bearing solutions. In advance of\r\ndevelopment work it is impossible to make reliable estimates of\r\navailable tonnage of the first type, but fairly accurate estimates can\r\nbe made of deposits of the second and third types.\r\n\r\nDeveloped magnesite deposits that have been productive at one time are\r\nsituated in California and Washington; in Quebec and British Columbia,\r\nCanada; on Santa Margarita Island, Lower California; on the Island\r\nof Margarita, Venezuela; in Austria-Hungary, Germany, Spain, Greece,\r\nMacedonia, Russia, Norway, Transvaal, and India. Other deposits, some\r\nof which have produced small amounts, are situated in Nevada, Ontario,\r\nNew Brunswick, on Cedros Island, Lower California; in Asia Minor,\r\nSweden, Rhodesia, Portuguese West Africa, Australia, Tasmania, and New\r\nCaledonia. There is no reason to believe that there will be in the near\r\nfuture any marked shift in the important sources of supply. In 1916\r\nand 1917 the production from the deposits of the Pacific Coast of the\r\nUnited States increased very rapidly, but since January, 1918, there\r\nhas been a severe slump in California production.\r\n\r\nThe magnesite deposits of California and Washington are owned by\r\na number of companies, all of them American. American refractory\r\nmanufacturers are believed to be interested in some of the Canadian\r\ndeposits. The deposits on Santa Margarita and Cedros islands, Lower\r\nCalifornia, seem to be owned or operated for the most part by residents\r\nof California. The deposits off the coast of Venezuela are held by\r\na Philadelphia company. Two of the large magnesite companies of\r\nAustria-Hungary have agreed to make all of their sales outside of\r\nAustria-Hungary through a German firm in Coblenz. Two other companies,\r\nthe Austro-American Magnesite Co. and the General Magnesite Co.,\r\nare owned mainly by Americans. The magnesite deposits of Greece are\r\ncontrolled by seven companies, one of them being English, one American,\r\none Dutch, and the remainder seemingly Greek. The other magnesite\r\ndeposits of the world are of little importance at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nGRAPHITE\r\n\r\nBY H. G. FERGUSON, FRANK F. GROUT, AND GEORGE D. DUB\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF GRAPHITE\r\n\r\nGraphite is produced in several grades which are adapted to different\r\npurposes. Amorphous graphite is a trade term applied to non-crystalline\r\nor very fine-grained graphite of varying degrees of purity. If\r\ncrystalline graphite is produced in flakes or scales, it is flake\r\ngraphite; but if mined from veins it may have other forms, and be known\r\nas vein graphite. Lump, chip, and dust refer to products of larger\r\ncrystals of Ceylon vein graphite more or less broken in mining and\r\ntreatment. All those three are spoken of as crystalline. Artificial\r\ngraphite, made from coal or other carbonaceous matter, resembles the\r\namorphous variety.\r\n\r\nGraphite for crucible use must be high grade, either lump, chip, or\r\nflake graphite, contain at least 85 per cent. graphitic carbon and be\r\nfree from fluxing impurities. Vein graphite is considered especially\r\ndesirable for this use. Possibly the increased development of the\r\nelectric furnace in the steel industry and in non-ferrous metallurgy\r\nwill reduce the demand for crucibles. Both crystalline and amorphous\r\ngraphite are used as lubricants. For this purpose the graphite should\r\nbe free from quartz or other gritty impurities. For foundry facings,\r\namorphous graphite and Ceylon dust are chiefly used; high-grade\r\nmaterial is not required. For the better grades of pencils, mixtures\r\nof crystalline and high-grade amorphous are needed; for the poorer\r\ngrades, amorphous is used alone. The graphite used as polish for high\r\nexplosives is amorphous. This use does not consume large amounts. For\r\nthe manufacture of electrodes, artificial graphite is considered the\r\nmost suitable. The graphite used as dry battery filler may be either\r\namorphous, artificial or crystalline. Pure material is required, but\r\nthe size of grain is not a factor.\r\n\r\nAmorphous graphite is used in boiler compounds for preventing hard\r\nscale; pure material is not essential. For paints, either amorphous or\r\ncrystalline graphite may be used and need not be high grade.\r\n\r\nFor stove polish and shoe polish amorphous graphite is chiefly used;\r\nimperial graphite is used as an adulterant in fertilizers, to give the\r\ndesired dark color.\r\n\r\nFor amorphous graphite and dust, artificial graphite may be\r\nsubstituted. For crystalline graphite used in the manufacture of\r\ncrucibles no good substitute is available. However, the use of\r\nelectric furnaces or open-flame furnaces in non-ferrous metallurgy may\r\nreduce the need of crucibles. For lubricating, mica is used in somewhat\r\nthe same way as graphite but is much inferior. Many other boiler\r\ncompounds serve the same purpose as graphite. In paints, lampblack is a\r\nsubstitute. Talc is used in connection with and as a partial substitute\r\nfor graphite in foundry work. Blast furnace graphite, or “kish,” offers\r\npossibilities as a substitute for flake graphite for lubricating\r\npurposes. Developments along this line, however, have not proceeded far\r\nenough to be conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL OCCURRENCE\r\n\r\nAmorphous graphite may occur wherever coal or other carbonaceous beds\r\nhave undergone regional or igneous metamorphism. Crystalline graphite\r\nhas two principal geologic occurrences, as flakes in schists and\r\nas larger crystals in veins. Flake graphite in schists is usually\r\nassociated with granitic intrusions which appear to have aided\r\nrecrystallization of original carbonaceous material in the sediments.\r\nVein graphite in commercial quantities is rather rare. It is found\r\nassociated with granitic intrusives and generally with graphitic\r\nsediments containing the flake variety. Such rocks in most parts of the\r\nworld have not been prospected enough to make sure that all important\r\nbodies of graphite are discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD CAPACITY FOR GRAPHITE PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIn the order of their importance the following table lists the various\r\ncountries which produce graphite or in which graphite deposits have\r\nbeen reported:\r\n\r\n  =1. Crystalline Graphite=\r\n      _A. Vein Graphite_\r\n          Ceylon--could produce up to 35,000 short tons per year, all\r\n          grades.\r\n          United States--small production from Montana.\r\n          Canada--small amount recently produced.\r\n      _B. Flake Graphite_\r\n          Madagascar--could produce up to nearly 50,000 short tons per\r\n          year.\r\n          Bavaria--has averaged 12,000 tons for several pre-war years,\r\n          and greatly increased production during the war. Produced\r\n          40,000 metric tons in 1917.\r\n          United States--could readily produce 4,000 tons of flake\r\n          exclusive of dust.\r\n          Canada--could probably produce 1,200 tons of flake exclusive\r\n          of dust.\r\n          Spain--deposits being developed.\r\n          Norway--new development reported.\r\n          Roumania--important deposits recently reported.\r\n          Japan--has not produced very much.\r\n          Sweden--very small production.\r\n          Transvaal--very small production, locally consumed.\r\n          Greenland}--large deposits reported. Very little development.\r\n          Brazil   }\r\n          German East Africa (former)--deposits of supposed large extent\r\n          reported.\r\n  =2. Amorphous Graphite=\r\n          German Austria }--has long produced large amount of graphite\r\n          Czecko-Slovakia}  annually.\r\n          Chosen--could probably produce 12,000 tons per annum.\r\n          Italy--could probably produce 12,000 tons per annum.\r\n          Mexico--could probably produce 6,000 tons per annum.\r\n          United States--could readily produce 6,000 tons natural and\r\n          6,000 tons artificial amorphous graphite.\r\n          Spain--could probably produce 1,000 tons annually.\r\n          France--could probably produce 1,000 tons annually.\r\n          Siberia--large amount available but undeveloped.\r\n          Rhodesia--local supply.\r\n          Brazil--supply undeveloped.\r\n          Queensland--supply undeveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\r\n\r\nAlthough no definite data are available, it is believed that Ceylon can\r\nnot produce much longer at the present rate, and it is possible that\r\nthe virtual exhaustion of the deposits is not far distant. Madagascar\r\nis capable of greatly increased production. It is doubtful if American\r\ndeposits with less than 5 per cent. graphite will be able to meet free\r\ncompetition from Madagascar, where over 20 per cent. of the rock as\r\nmined is graphite. Too little is known of the Greenland and Brazilian\r\ndeposits to hazard a guess as to their future importance, but it is\r\nreported that immense reserves exist in Greenland. The German flake\r\ndeposits will hardly survive free competition from Madagascar, unless\r\nmodern methods are introduced. Amorphous graphite will probably be\r\nchiefly produced, as at present, by Austria, Bohemia, Mexico and\r\nChosen. Mexico and Chosen are likely to supply most of the pencil\r\ngraphite of the world. Increased production of artificial graphite\r\nmay reduce the demand for amorphous graphite. In 1918, notices in\r\nthe German technical press told of the discovery of immense deposits\r\nof flake graphite in Roumania. These were to be worked jointly by\r\nthe German and Austrian governments under a 75 year lease from the\r\nRoumanian government. The outcome of the war of course annulled this\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nVein graphite (that is, Ceylon graphite) is preferred for crucible\r\nmanufacture, but increasing amounts of flake are being used\r\nsuccessfully. European manufacturers seem to use flake almost\r\nexclusively; and American manufacturers will no doubt find it possible,\r\nif necessary. Increasing amounts of amorphous graphite are being\r\nemployed for various industrial uses, chiefly foundry facings. The\r\ndevelopment of the electric steel furnace, by reducing the use of\r\ncrucibles, may tend in some degree to reduce the difference in value\r\nbetween crystalline and amorphous graphite.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nAmorphous graphite is so widely distributed that no serious difficulty\r\nis likely to be encountered by any of the great commercial nations in\r\nfilling their vital needs. Mexican graphite is the chief supply of good\r\nmaterial for pencils. Interest centers in the material capable of being\r\nmade into crucibles.\r\n\r\nCrucible graphite has been produced in the past mostly in _Ceylon_. Its\r\ngranular form (characteristic of vein graphite) has been assumed by\r\ncrucible makers to be the best. The deposits are worked mostly by small\r\nlocal owners in Ceylon, and the output is controlled by the British\r\nthrough state sovereignty and shipping. Control by ownership and\r\noperation with modern plant was attempted by an English company, but\r\nmet native opposition until a few years ago.\r\n\r\nRecently _Madagascar_ flake graphite has largely replaced Ceylon\r\nmaterial in European practice. This deposit is under French sovereignty\r\nand the French exercise a large degree of commercial control. The flake\r\ngraphite of the United States has not yet reached a high development.\r\nThere are large reserves of schist with about 5 per cent. graphite.\r\nBavarian material is crystalline though not of such good quality. It is\r\nunder German control. Prior to the war, mining and milling methods were\r\nprimitive, and the product correspondingly poor. _Canada_, _Norway_,\r\n_Sweden_, _Greenland_, _Brazil_ and possibly others have reserves of\r\nflake within their boundaries. _Japan_ has a small production of flake\r\ngraphite and controls a supply in Chosen.\r\n\r\nAmerican control of _Mexican_ mines brings the entire Mexican output to\r\nthis country for refining and re-export. One of the large _Canadian_\r\nmines is also owned in the United States.\r\n\r\nWhen the British supply in Ceylon declined and the Madagascar\r\nproduction increased, the British, who had always controlled the\r\nworld’s main supply, did not readily relinquish control. They bought a\r\nlarge part of the Madagascar product and have a concentrating plant on\r\nthe island. The Morgan Crucible Co., of London, operates on the island\r\nas the French company “Graphites Maskar,” but this is a subsidiary of\r\nthe London company and the control is entirely British. This is not the\r\nonly plant, however, working on the island. One large company before\r\nthe war had its main office in Hamburg, Germany, one at Antwerp, and\r\nthere were several French companies. Some Austrian mines were owned by\r\nBelgian companies prior to the war, and English interests own a part of\r\nthe Italian deposits.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the French and British, having adopted the Madagascar\r\ngraphite successfully, apparently arranged an agreement by which that\r\nsupply should be used in Europe, while Ceylon graphite was sent mostly\r\nto the United States. The control was only possible by a combination\r\nof British and French, apparently a commercial rather than a political\r\nmatter, though subject to government control.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be a combination among Madagascar graphite producers,\r\nas evidenced by a statement from the consul in Tananarive in November,\r\n1918, that the “Union des Producteurs de Graphite” could furnish to\r\nthis country annually 15,000-20,000 tons of 85 per cent. graphite at a\r\ndefinite price, f.o.b. Tamatave. The object of the combine appears to\r\nbe to protect producers against unfair practices of the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nThe Colombo Graphite Union is mentioned in some sources as a local\r\ncombination, probably interrelated with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.\r\nIt has not been active in improving mining and milling methods, and has\r\nalso objected to modernization by outside capital.\r\n\r\nThe Graphite Producers’ Association of Alabama was organized in\r\n1917 and had for its objects the furthering of the interests of the\r\ngraphite miners of the state. An effort was made to sample and analyze\r\nshipments honestly and thus help remove the most serious objections\r\nthat manufacturers had against using domestic flake--unreliability of\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE NATIONS\r\n\r\nLow-grade amorphous graphite is abundant in the _United States_.\r\nThere are supplies in many states and in Alaska, which have not been\r\ndeveloped to any extent. An excellent grade of material from Mexico\r\nis available in large amounts, making extensive domestic development\r\nunprofitable, except when the deposits are very favorably situated. The\r\nmost productive Mexican deposit is owned by the United States Graphite\r\nCo., of Saginaw, Mich. Artificial graphite is made at Niagara Falls\r\nin large amounts, making the country independent in the matter of\r\nelectrodes.\r\n\r\nThis country is not yet independent in the matter of crucible graphite.\r\nCrucible makers have insisted on having Ceylon graphite, about 15,000\r\ntons or more a year. The only supply of similar graphite in the country\r\nis a very small deposit in Montana. However, there is a fair supply of\r\nflake graphite in Alabama, Pennsylvania, New York, Alaska, Texas and\r\npossibly other states. Some 3,500 tons a year were produced prior to\r\n1919. This resembles Madagascar rather than Ceylon graphite, though\r\nthe flakes are smaller. American crucible makers are slow to make use\r\nof it, though there is evidence that it might serve very well. If the\r\ndemand for crucible graphite continues, the demand for imports will\r\nprobably continue.\r\n\r\nOur deposits are not so high grade or so favorably situated as to\r\ncompete successfully with those of Ceylon and Madagascar.\r\n\r\nCanadian companies producing flake similar to that in the United States\r\nare in part owned by United States capital.\r\n\r\nThe flake graphite supply for crucible makers in normal times may come\r\nfrom Madagascar, but we can be fairly independent in case of necessity\r\nif we are prepared to stimulate mining in this country.\r\n\r\n_England_ controls the graphite from Ceylon. However, there seems to be\r\na general opinion that Ceylon production is likely to decrease unless\r\nthe control passes into the hands of some one who will introduce modern\r\nefficient mining methods. England normally allows about two-thirds of\r\nthe Ceylon product to come to the United States. England’s own supply\r\nof crucible graphite is now mainly obtained from Madagascar, where an\r\nEnglish owned and controlled company operates on the island. Amorphous\r\ngraphite is obtained from Italy and Chosen. A London company operates\r\nin Quebec, producing some flake and dust. English capital is invested\r\nin Italian graphite deposits and apparently also in the Spanish.\r\n\r\nThrough her sovereignty over Madagascar, _France_ probably controls\r\nthe world’s best future supplies of flake graphite. The deposits are\r\nlarge, conveniently situated, and remarkably rich--20 per cent. or more\r\ngraphite. They are capable of greatly increased production. Already\r\nthe output exceeds that of any other country, though the deposits have\r\nbeen developed but recently. France has a small local production of\r\namorphous graphite, and obtains some from Italy.\r\n\r\n_Germany_ is now chiefly dependent on Bavarian flake graphite for\r\ncrucibles. The efforts made during the war to get Ceylon graphite in\r\nthrough Holland and Switzerland indicate that the Bavarian supply is\r\nnot wholly satisfactory. Amorphous graphite is supplied from Austria.\r\nOverproduction has made it possible at times to sell the products in\r\nAmerica below cost.\r\n\r\n_Japan_ produces some flake graphite. Chosen has an abundant supply of\r\nthe amorphous variety. In Chosen there have been recent discoveries of\r\ncrystalline graphite which may be of importance.\r\n\r\nFigure 11 shows the changes in the annual output of graphite in the\r\nchief producing countries, and Figure 12 shows the percentage of\r\ncrucible graphites produced by the main sources of supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nGraphite occurs in nature in two forms, crystalline and amorphous, each\r\nform having its own peculiar uses. Crystalline graphite is used in the\r\nmanufacture of crucibles, as a lubricant, and in paints. Amorphous\r\ngraphite is used as a lubricant, for foundry facings, in pencils,\r\nin paints, as a polish for high explosives, in boiler compounds, in\r\nelectrodes, in dry batteries, as a stove and shoe polish, and as a\r\nfiller for fertilizers. Most of the above uses are essential and\r\ncannot easily be eliminated. Artificial graphite made from coal or\r\nother carbonaceous matter can be substituted for the natural amorphous\r\ngraphite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Annual output of graphite in chief producing\r\ncountries, 1902-18. Full lines indicate crystalline graphite; dotted\r\nlines principally amorphous graphite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Percentage of crucible graphite produced by\r\nmain sources of supply, 1907-1917. Bavarian data since 1913 doubtful,\r\nbut since completion of the graph it has been found that the 1917\r\nproduction was much larger than shown.]\r\n\r\nAmorphous graphite may occur wherever coal or other carbonaceous beds\r\nhave undergone regional or igneous metamorphism. Crystalline graphite,\r\nboth flake and vein, is usually found in association with granitic\r\nintrusives. Since such rocks have not been thoroughly prospected in\r\nall parts of the world, it is probable that important new deposits of\r\ngraphite will be discovered, especially in Canada, Siberia and parts of\r\nSouth America and Africa.\r\n\r\nCeylon is the chief source of supply of the best grades of crystalline\r\ngraphite, viz., vein graphite. The crystalline graphite obtained in\r\nMadagascar, Bavaria, and in small quantities in the United States,\r\nCanada, Norway, Sweden, Japan and Chosen is chiefly of the flake\r\nvariety and for that reason it is considered by manufacturers inferior\r\nin grade to that obtained in Ceylon. Large undeveloped deposits are\r\nreported in Greenland and Brazil. The discovery of the large deposits\r\nof flake graphite in Roumania was reported some time since. From\r\ntime to time discoveries are reported from other localities but the\r\nimportance is questionable, chiefly because the deposits are usually\r\nsituated in places difficult to reach. It is believed that the Ceylon\r\ndeposits have passed the maximum of their production and if deposits\r\nof vein graphite of equal grade and richness could be found, Ceylon\r\nproducers might be hard pressed. During the last few years Madagascar\r\nhas become the leading producer of crystalline graphite, and the\r\ninfluence of this potential supply should exert a stabilizing effect on\r\nprices of Ceylon graphite.\r\n\r\nAustria, Chosen, Mexico, Italy and the United States are the principal\r\nproducers of amorphous graphite; Chosen and Mexico supply most of the\r\npencil graphite of the world.\r\n\r\nThe development of the electric furnace will no doubt decrease the\r\ndemand for crucibles in steel making.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, through sovereignty over Ceylon and Canada, and France,\r\nthrough sovereignty over Madagascar, control politically the world’s\r\nmost important deposits of crystalline graphite. Japan controls the\r\ndeposits of Chosen.\r\n\r\nAmerican capital controls the deposits of the United States, the\r\ndeposits of Mexico, and in part the deposits of Canada. The Ceylon\r\ndeposits have been worked mainly by small local owners, who opposed\r\nuntil a few years ago the attempts of an English company to gain\r\ncontrol through the erection and operation of a modern plant. The\r\nGraphites Maskar, owning a part of the Madagascar deposits, is a\r\nsubsidiary of a British company, the Morgan Crucible Co. Another large\r\nMadagascar company before the war had its main office in Hamburg,\r\nGermany. Other companies are controlled by Belgian and French capital.\r\nBritish interests own a part of the Italian and probably a part of the\r\nSpanish deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nMICA\r\n\r\nBY DURAND A. HALL\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF MICA\r\n\r\nTwo varieties of mica are of particular economic importance: muscovite\r\nor white mica, and phlogopite or amber mica. Three other varieties,\r\nlepidolite, zinnwaldite and biotite, find occasional commercial use.\r\n\r\nMica is marketed as sheet or block mica, mica splittings, thin sheets\r\nsplit chiefly from smaller sizes of block mica, and scrap or ground\r\nmica. The uses to which sheet or block mica may be put depend upon the\r\nsize, thickness and shape of the piece which can be cut from it and the\r\nquality of the material itself. Factors entering into the quality of\r\nmica are: presence or absence of stains, spots, inclusions, cracks or\r\npin holes; flexibility and elasticity; hardness; degree of distortion\r\nof the sheets; transparency; and dielectric strength.\r\n\r\nAn essential use of sheet or block muscovite is in electrical work;\r\nfrom the mica are made condensers for radio equipment, magnetos and\r\ncertain telephone equipment; also to a less extent for resonators\r\nin sounding boxes. This mica is also used in making spark plugs,\r\nparticularly plugs in high-compression engines, for winding cores and\r\nas washers in place of porcelain. These uses were widely extended by\r\nthe war to meet requirements for motor transport, airplanes and radio\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nA great deal of this variety of mica is used for other insulating\r\npurposes. There are a vast variety of uses, such as for sheets, washers\r\nand disks in dynamos, electric-light sockets, guards in rheostats, fuse\r\nboxes, telephones, etc.\r\n\r\nSheet or block phlogopite is used for general electrical\r\ninsulation--particularly where mica softer than muscovite is required.\r\n\r\nMica splittings of both muscovite and phlogopite are employed for the\r\nmanufacture of “built-up mica,” which is used widely for electric\r\ninsulation in many different forms, such as sheets, tubes, cups, etc.\r\nMica board built up from phlogopite splittings is used extensively for\r\ninsulation between the copper segments of commutators.\r\n\r\nAmong the less essential uses of sheet or block mica (mainly muscovite)\r\nare in windows for stove fronts and ovens; chimneys and shades for\r\nlamps and lanterns; and for many other purposes where a transparent\r\nnon-inflammable, non-shattering material is required. It is also used\r\nfor heat insulation, in various electric heating devices.\r\n\r\nGround mica is also used for heat insulation, as in pipe and boiler\r\ncovering, etc.; and as a patent roofing, both as a coating to prevent\r\nsticking when rolled, and as a filler in the roofing itself. It is also\r\nused in annealing steel, and as a lubricant for wooden bearings.\r\n\r\nAmong the non-essential uses of mica, those for which a satisfactory\r\nsubstitute is known, are the uses of sheet or block mica for phonograph\r\ndiaphragms, and for decorative purposes, chiefly in India. On a similar\r\nbasis are the uses of ground mica (mixed with oil) as a lubricant for\r\nmetal bearings; as a filler for rubber goods, etc.; and for decorative\r\npurposes--in wall paper, decorative paints, ornamental stone, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Substitutes.=--No other substance possesses the combination of\r\nelasticity, toughness, flexibility, transparency, ability to withstand\r\nexcessive heat and sudden changes in temperature, high dielectric\r\nstrength, flatness and amenability to splitting into thin films, which\r\nbelongs to mica.\r\n\r\nFor the vast variety of electrical equipment in which mica is used, no\r\nsatisfactory substitute has been found. In the manufacture of certain\r\nlow-tension condensers sheets of oiled paper have been used instead of\r\nmica films, but attempts to substitute this material more widely have\r\nmet with little success. According to one report a compressed paper\r\nproduct called “Pertinax” was developed in Germany during the war which\r\nis claimed to be “most satisfactory” for all electrical purposes, even\r\nfor the manufacture of high-tension condensers. The fact, however, that\r\nGermany was paying $75 a pound for mica from Norway, and continued\r\nto use mica in the manufacture of condensers for airplane magnetos,\r\nindicates that complete substitution was not possible.\r\n\r\nFor a great many glazing purposes it is possible to substitute\r\nheat-withstanding or non-shattering varieties of glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of mica deposits there has been little encouragement\r\nfor the application of any but rather crude and simple methods of\r\nmining. These methods proved sufficient as long as there remained new\r\nand easily accessible deposits. There is at present a tendency in\r\nIndia, Canada, and the United States to apply more scientific methods\r\nto exploration and extraction, where the exhaustion of the easily\r\nworked deposits is threatened.\r\n\r\nSorting, cleaning, grading, trimming and cutting of mica for the market\r\nare all essentially hand processes, and from the nature of the product\r\nwill continue to be. For this reason producing localities possessing\r\nabundant cheap labor have a distinct advantage over those where labor\r\nis high and scarce. In one important direction attempts have been made\r\nto apply a mechanical device to a process which has always required\r\nhand labor. This is in the manufacture of mica splittings, widely used\r\nin the manufacture of built-up mica. These inventions have not yet been\r\ndemonstrated as commercially successful on a broad scale.\r\n\r\nMica is being used to an increasing extent for electrical purposes.\r\nThe war created a large demand, particularly for the better grades of\r\nmaterial for the manufacture of magnetos and radio condensers and spark\r\nplugs, and many of these uses will continue to require much mica. The\r\nuse of mica for glazing purposes, however, particularly in the fronts\r\nof stoves, is diminishing. This is due to the decreasing manufacture of\r\nthe type of stove in which mica is used.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that mica constitutes about 4 per cent. of the\r\nigneous rocks of the world. Segregation into deposits of workable size\r\ncontaining mica of commercial size and quality is comparatively rare.\r\nMica mines are worked for the small percentage of sheet or block mica\r\nthey contain, the large amount of waste mica being utilized only where\r\na ready market warrants the grinding.\r\n\r\nIndividual deposits of both muscovite and phlogopite are characterized\r\nby their extreme irregularity, so that any prediction as to reserve is\r\nuncertain. This fact is responsible for the crude methods of mining\r\nwhich have for so long been almost universally employed. The output of\r\na district as a whole is from many small mines rather than from any\r\nsingle large one.\r\n\r\nAn important consideration in the geological distribution of mica from\r\nan economic standpoint is the degree of dynamic metamorphism to which\r\nthe region has been subjected during or subsequent to the formation of\r\nthe mica-bearing deposits. This is due to the fact that the value of\r\nsheet mica depends, among many other factors, upon the freedom from\r\ndistortion of the sheets.\r\n\r\nMuscovite mica in commercial quantities invariably occurs in dikes and\r\nlenses of pegmatite which are considered to represent segregations\r\nof certain portions of granitic intrusions. The principal associated\r\nminerals are quartz and feldspar, both of which are usually\r\nconsiderably in excess of the mica. The dikes or lenses of pegmatite\r\nmay be within the granite itself or in other inclosing rocks that may\r\nseem unrelated to a parent intrusive. Schists or gneisses form the\r\ninclosing rock of the pegmatite in most commercial deposits.\r\n\r\nPhlogopite is much rarer than muscovite and occurs in deposits\r\nstructurally similar to granitic pegmatites. The important associated\r\nminerals are pyroxene, apatite and calcite, although in certain\r\ndeposits the mass is almost entirely of mica. The Canadian deposits,\r\nwhich are best known, consist of veins and pockets in pyroxenite dikes\r\nand the inclosing rock is usually limestone, a significant fact as\r\nregards the origin of the deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nIndia, Canada, and the United States produce about 98 per cent. of\r\nthe sheet mica of the world. The output of India and of the United\r\nStates is entirely muscovite, whereas the Canadian production is\r\nalmost entirely phlogopite. Brazil and Argentina have become important\r\nproducers in the last two years, and German East Africa was becoming\r\nof considerable importance immediately before the war. South Africa,\r\nGuatemala, Ceylon, Madagascar and Australia have produced small amounts\r\nof mica and may be considered as potential sources of supply.\r\n\r\n_India_ produces about 65 per cent. of the sheet mica of the world,\r\nand is the most important source of high quality muscovite. The two\r\nprincipal producing regions are the Hazaribagh district, in the\r\nProvince of Behar, and Orissa, in Bengal, and the Nellore district,\r\nMadras Presidency.\r\n\r\nThe output of _Canada_ is practically all phlogopite or amber mica,\r\nof which that country is the world’s principal source. The important\r\nproducing districts are north of the city of Ottawa, in the Province of\r\nQuebec, and in the central part of the Province of Ontario. The Lacey\r\nmine, in Ontario, has been the largest producer of amber mica in Canada\r\nfor many years.\r\n\r\nThe _United States_ produces about 15 per cent. of the sheet mica\r\nmuscovite of the world. In terms of value, about 70 per cent. of the\r\nAmerican product comes from North Carolina, and 23 from New Hampshire.\r\nOther districts are insignificant: 3 per cent. comes from Virginia, 1\r\nfrom South Dakota, and 3 from Georgia, Alabama, Idaho, and Colorado\r\ntaken together.\r\n\r\nThe principal sources of mica in _Brazil_ are the states of Bahia, Sao\r\nPaulo, Goyaz and Minas Geraes. The two last mentioned are particularly\r\nimportant. The deposits are widely scattered over a large area.\r\n\r\nProduction of mica in _Argentina_ has been incidental until very\r\nrecently and the development has been slight. Deposits are numerous but\r\nare of special importance in the provinces of Cordoba, San Luis and San\r\nJuan. As far as is known muscovite is the only mica produced.\r\n\r\nConsiderable activity has been shown in mica mining in _Guatemala_ and\r\nshipments have been made quite regularly to this country. The mica,\r\nhowever, is of inferior grade and has not found favor in American\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nThe production of the former _German East Africa_ is confined entirely\r\nto muscovite mica found in the districts of the Ulguru Mountains and\r\nneighboring ranges. Considerable quantities of high-grade material\r\nwere exported to Germany before the war. The mica mines in German East\r\nAfrica were worked during the war under the direction of the British\r\nMinistry of Munitions. The district is of importance as a future source\r\nof high-grade muscovite.\r\n\r\nThe principal locality in _South Africa_ is near Leydersdorp, in the\r\nNorthern Transvaal. Both muscovite and amber mica are reported from\r\nthis area.\r\n\r\nSmall amounts of high-quality amber mica have been shipped from\r\n_Ceylon_ to England.\r\n\r\nDeposits of excellent quality mica are known to exist in the McDonald\r\nrange, in _South Australia_, from which small shipments have been made\r\nsporadically. This is the only district from which lepidolite or lithia\r\nmica has been noted in sheets of commercial size.\r\n\r\nIn _China_, large deposits of muscovite mica are reported from the\r\nvicinity of Kiao-Chau bay and also from Shantung, but no commercial\r\ndevelopment has taken place, and it is believed that the deposits are\r\nworthless as a source of sheet mica.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1914 efforts to produce mica in _Norway_ on a commercial scale\r\nmet with no success and little is known of the deposits. The great need\r\nof mica in Germany during the war stimulated production in Norway,\r\ntremendous prices being paid for the material.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN KNOWN GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE\r\n\r\nThe most important change in known geographic distribution of mica\r\nfor the near future concerns the increased development of the South\r\nAmerican fields. During the war Brazilian mica found considerable favor\r\nboth in this country and Europe, and the better grades are considered\r\nequal to the best India mica. Importations of mica from _Brazil_\r\nwere of much importance in meeting the large demands of the United\r\nStates for mica of high quality to fill government needs. Owing to the\r\nnature of mica deposits in general, it is not safe to make estimates\r\nconcerning reserves. This is particularly true of Brazil, where the\r\nindustry is young, and careful prospecting and development have not\r\nbeen carried far. From the large number of known deposits and the\r\nrapidity with which the industry responded to war demands, despite\r\ndifficulties in transportation from the mines to the seaboard, it would\r\nappear that Brazilian mica will play an increasingly important part in\r\nthe mica markets of the world, particularly of the United States. No\r\nmatter how great the merit of the mines of a district may be, however,\r\nunless the mica is carefully prepared, graded as to size and quality,\r\nand shipments are standardized, it cannot expect to attain permanent\r\nfavor among consumers in this country or in Europe.\r\n\r\nLess is known concerning the future possibilities of _Argentina_ as\r\na mica-producing country of importance. Many deposits are known and\r\nconsiderable shipments have been made to the United States and to\r\nEurope. The material received here has not been equal to Indian or\r\nBrazilian mica.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to expect that _India_ will retain its position\r\nas the most important mica-producing country. The great number of\r\ndeposits offer almost every grade of muscovite required in the trade.\r\nThe industry is well-established, and labor conditions are extremely\r\nfavorable for the production of a commodity requiring such a large\r\namount of hand labor before being ready for market. It is true,\r\nhowever, that the richest and most easily accessible deposits have\r\nbeen mined out, and scientific methods must be applied to mining if\r\nproduction is to retain its former place.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the immediate future will see any important\r\nchange in the position of the _United States_ as a mica producer.\r\nAlthough the reserves of the country as a whole are probably large,\r\nthe deposits are small and the percentage of high-quality mica is\r\nnot great. Production of important amounts of medium-grade mica will\r\ncontinue. Labor conditions are not favorable to producing cheaply an\r\narticle that has a large part of its value determined by preparation\r\nand careful grading.\r\n\r\nScientific methods have been applied to the mining and preparation of\r\na considerable part of the Canadian output. Reserves are large and\r\n_Canada_ will undoubtedly retain for many years its position as the\r\nprincipal source of amber mica.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe British Empire, through state sovereignty, controls 75 per cent.\r\nof the present sheet-mica production of the world. In Brazil and\r\nArgentina, which have important potential resources of mica, and in the\r\nUnited States, political control is determined by state sovereignty.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the ownership of mines and concessions in India\r\nhas been in the hands of natives. In the Hazaribagh district, F. F.\r\nChristen & Co., an English firm, owns rights over large areas of land\r\noutside the government forest and has mined on a considerable scale.\r\nAt the outbreak of the war, Germany, through commercial interests,\r\nhad obtained a large measure of control over many Indian mines. S.\r\nO. Fillion & Co., of New York, is the one American firm known to be\r\nworking mines in India.\r\n\r\nThe most important producing phlogopite mine in Canada, at Sydenham,\r\nOntario, is owned and operated by the General Electric Co., of\r\nSchenectady, New York. The same company owns several other properties\r\nin the vicinity and has a large mica-manufacturing plant at Ottawa,\r\nOntario. Other smaller interests are held chiefly in Canada.\r\n\r\nDavol & Co., of New York, is the only foreign firm known to be actively\r\nworking mica mines in Brazil at present.\r\n\r\nMica mines in the United States are, as far as is known, all owned by\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF LEADING NATIONS\r\n\r\nThe _United States_ was before the war the world’s largest consumer\r\nof mica of all kinds. The development of her electrical industry\r\nis dependent upon her supply of mica, a large part of which is\r\nimported from India and Canada. Production in this country has been\r\nconsiderable, but has not proved nearly adequate to supply the demands,\r\nparticularly the demand for the higher grades of mica for use in\r\nmagnetos, radio condensers and spark plugs, and for mica splittings\r\nused in making built-up mica.\r\n\r\nThe large demands and high prices created by the war did not increase\r\ndomestic production enough to warrant the belief that this country\r\ncan become independent as regards sheet mica under any but the most\r\nartificial conditions. The producer is protected by a 25 per cent.\r\nimport duty on unmanufactured (rough or knife-trimmed) mica and a 30\r\nper cent. duty on cut mica, splittings and other manufactured forms.\r\nProduction in this country is largely in the hands of individuals and\r\nsmall companies, who are financially incapable of increasing output\r\nspasmodically even under very favorable conditions. Moreover, many\r\nconsumers have a decided prejudice in favor of imported mica.\r\n\r\nIf the United States is to take a dominant position in the electrical\r\nindustry of the world an adequate supply of mica must be assured.\r\nThe most promising field for the development of such a supply is\r\nundoubtedly South America. This is particularly true because the\r\nimportant development of the electrical industry in England during the\r\nwar places that country in the dominating position formerly occupied by\r\nGermany and Austria. This development will require a large part of the\r\nIndian mica formerly available for export trade.\r\n\r\nThe _British Empire_ possesses in India the most important source of\r\nmuscovite mica in the world and in Canada the only important supply of\r\namber mica. In spite of England’s tremendous advantage with regard to\r\nraw material, Germany, through her important position in the electrical\r\nindustry and the large measure of control acquired in the Indian mines,\r\nthreatened to dominate the mica market of the world at the outbreak of\r\nthe war. Since the outbreak of the war England has secured her position\r\nnot only as the controlling center for raw mica but as the chief\r\nproducing nation of electrical equipment. London is the distributing\r\ncenter of the world for Indian mica and London prices regulate the\r\nmarket. During the war Indian mica was controlled by the British\r\nMinistry of Munitions, and allotments were made to the associated\r\nnations at fixed prices.\r\n\r\nIn the development of the South American fields lies the best\r\npossibility of the world lessening its dependence upon England for this\r\nmost essential raw material.\r\n\r\n_France_ is entirely dependent upon outside sources for her supply of\r\nmica. Before the war her demands were not large and were filled by\r\nIndian mica.\r\n\r\nAlthough _Germany_ before the war was entirely dependent on outside\r\nsources for mica, her leading position in the electrical industry\r\nenabled her to gain control of much of the Indian production. Every\r\nadvantage was taken of this opportunity, and in 1914, according to the\r\nBritish Secretary of Munitions, the mica market of the world was at\r\nthe point of being transferred from London to Hamburg. The deposits of\r\nGerman East Africa were being actively exploited and German commercial\r\ninterests were being extended to South America.\r\n\r\nAlthough probably possessing very large stocks in 1914, Germany felt\r\nvery acutely the shortage of mica during the war. High prices were paid\r\nto Norway for the output of that country, but this source is probably\r\nentirely incapable of meeting the normal demands of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nSheet mica is essential to the manufacture of a vast variety of\r\nelectrical equipment, and must, therefore, be classed as one of the\r\nimportant raw materials of the world. The magneto, such a vital factor\r\nin modern transport on land, air and sea, depends upon mica for its\r\nconstruction, and mica condensers are indispensable in modern radio\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nIndia, Canada, and the United States are at present the most important\r\nmica-producing countries. Deposits of future importance from which\r\nproduction has thus far not been great are known in German East Africa,\r\nBrazil, Argentina and the Transvaal; from several other parts of the\r\nworld more sporadic production is reported.\r\n\r\nUnlike the development of many other raw materials the production of\r\nmica has not been universally undertaken on a large scale, nor have\r\nscientific methods been applied to its extraction. This has been\r\nlargely due to the irregular nature of the deposits and their scattered\r\nposition within a district, making considerable investment of capital\r\nin mining a particularly hazardous venture. Trading interests have,\r\ntherefore, played an important part in controlling production and\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nThe British Empire, having within its boundaries a large proportion\r\nof the important mica-producing districts, at present dominates\r\nthe situation politically. British commercial control, threatened\r\nby Germany’s leading position in the electrical industry and wide\r\ninterests in Indian mines at the outbreak of war, is now firmly\r\nre-established, and Great Britain has taken the place in the electrical\r\nindustry formerly held by Germany and Austria.\r\n\r\nThe United States, the largest consumer of mica among the nations of\r\nthe world, has relied upon imports to supply a considerable part of the\r\nconsumption and will probably continue to do so in the future, although\r\nsteady development of domestic sources of supply may be expected.\r\nBrazil offers the most promising foreign field for the development of\r\nan independent source of supply for American markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nASBESTOS\r\n\r\nBY OLIVER BOWLES\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF ASBESTOS\r\n\r\nAsbestos is useful because of its incombustibility, insulating\r\nqualities, and fibrous structure. High-grade asbestos is spun or woven\r\ninto ropes and fabrics, the fabrics being used for many purposes,\r\nsuch as safety curtains, mats, mattresses, upholstering, firemen’s\r\nsuits and gloves. Of late years much high-grade asbestos has been used\r\nfor friction facings in brakes and for packings. Low-grade asbestos\r\nis used for a great many purposes, which may be classed in three\r\ngroups--building, insulating, and miscellaneous.\r\n\r\nFor building purposes asbestos is employed in many ways. A mixture\r\nof asbestos and cement is used to make fireproof shingles or slates.\r\nAsbestos is also used with Portland cement to make a protective surface\r\non metal sheathing; asbestos paper is used for weather and sound\r\nproofing and also for fire-protection purposes. It is used widely for\r\nplaster, which not only is fireproof but also improves the acoustic\r\nproperties of auditoriums, churches, etc. Asbestos is also used for\r\nfloor tiling and in the manufacture of paints. Asbestos lumber and\r\nmillboard are employed for many structural purposes.\r\n\r\nAsbestos cement, a mixture of asbestos fiber and clay, is much used as\r\na covering for boilers and steam pipes to prevent heat radiation. Other\r\ncoverings are made from a mixture of asbestos and magnesia. Varieties\r\nof asbestos having a low iron content are useful for electrical\r\ninsulating purposes.\r\n\r\nSome of the many miscellaneous uses of asbestos are for fire brick,\r\nacid filters, lead-fume collectors, stove mats, cooking-utensil\r\nlinings, etc.\r\n\r\nThe most essential of the above uses are those in which the long-fiber\r\nasbestos is employed. For fireproof ropes and fabrics nothing can take\r\nits place. Its use in friction facings for brakes is essential in all\r\nmotor vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe uses for which low-grade asbestos is employed may be regarded as\r\nless essential and might be eliminated in case of necessity, though\r\nsuch elimination would no doubt involve many serious difficulties.\r\nFire risk would thereby be increased and many boilers and heating\r\nplants would be rendered less efficient and more wasteful, though\r\nthese difficulties could be overcome to some degree by the use of\r\nsubstitutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Substitutes.=--Slag wool or mineral wool is a fireproof material and\r\na good non-conductor of heat and sound. It is also highly porous,\r\nand hence it is useful as an absorbent. It can, therefore, be used\r\nto some extent as a substitute for asbestos for heat insulation and\r\nfireproofing. However, as it is brittle and cannot be woven as readily\r\nas asbestos, it is not to be regarded as a satisfactory substitute for\r\nthe higher grades. Talc may be employed in the manufacture of fireproof\r\nand corrosive-proof paints, and also as a lining for furnaces and\r\nfireplaces. Infusorial earth is used to some extent as a substitute for\r\nasbestos for insulating and fireproofing. But it is important to note\r\nthat none of the substitutes mentioned above can replace the high-grade\r\nspinning fiber.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nAs has been indicated, there is a probability of the demand for\r\nasbestos increasing. The wide use of motor-transport equipment\r\ndemands a large amount of high-grade fiber for brake linings, while\r\nthe increasing use of steam equipment, and electrical equipment and\r\nappliances, demands more and more material, both for electrical and\r\nheat-insulating purposes. Although substitutes may be employed for\r\nthe lower grades, no substitutes are known for the spinning grades of\r\nasbestos, which are now in strongest demand. Consequently there are no\r\nchanges in practice that will reduce the demand for asbestos.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nAsbestos originates for the most part from rocks consisting largely\r\nof olivine, such as peridotites or dunites, or from rocks consisting\r\nlargely of pyroxene. Hence it is only in altered rocks of this nature\r\nthat asbestos of the common types is to be expected. Two distinct types\r\nof alteration are common: Alteration of the olivine or pyroxene to\r\nserpentine, with development of chrysotile in places; and alteration of\r\nolivine or pyroxene to amphibole with development of anthophyllite (a\r\nvariety of amphibole) and related forms. Both types of alteration are\r\nwell represented in the great North American belt of asbestos-bearing\r\nperidotites that extends from central Alabama along the Piedmont\r\nPlateau to the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec, a distance of more than\r\n1,600 miles. In the northern part of the belt, in Vermont and Quebec,\r\nthe alteration has been to serpentine with chrysotile asbestos in\r\nplaces, while in the southern part the alteration has been largely to\r\namphibolite with development of anthophyllite asbestos and talc.\r\n\r\nChrysotile asbestos (Quebec type), as represented in most deposits, is\r\nformed by serpentinization, with subsequent prismatic crystallization\r\nin cracks, the veins thus formed representing a recrystallization\r\nalong the walls and thus being replacement veins rather than fissure\r\nveins. Contact metamorphism evidently plays an important part in the\r\nprocess, for in most regions intrusive dikes are associated with the\r\ndeposits and evidently had a definite influence on the development of\r\nthe commercial product. As serpentinization is a deep-seated process,\r\nchrysotile deposits may occur at considerable depth.\r\n\r\nAnthophyllite asbestos (Georgia type) results from alteration\r\nof peridotites or pyroxenites to amphibole, giving the fibrous\r\nanthophyllite and related forms. This type of asbestos does not occur\r\nin veins but constitutes the major part of the rock mass.\r\n\r\nWhile the modes of alteration noted above account for most of the\r\nasbestos deposits known, there are two important exceptions--the\r\ncrocidolite, or blue asbestos, of South Africa, and the chrysotile\r\ndeposits of Arizona, both of which occur in sedimentary rocks.\r\nCrocidolite is interbedded in jasper and ironstone, and the Arizona\r\nchrysotile has resulted from the alteration of cherty limestone\r\ninfluenced to some extent by the action of diabase intrusions.\r\n\r\nAs pointed out in the discussion of uses, for various select purposes\r\nanthophyllite cannot be employed as a substitute for chrysotile of\r\nspinning grade. As the uses of anthophyllite are thus restricted, and\r\nas the supply seems to be ample for many years to come, the problem of\r\nsupply centers about the deposits of high-grade chrysotile.\r\n\r\nDeposits of serpentinized basic rocks are by no means rare, and\r\neven the development of a fibrous structure is common, but in all\r\nchrysotile-bearing deposits only a small part of the serpentine is\r\nfibrous, and of the fibrous part only a small percentage can be\r\nutilized as high-grade asbestos. The value of deposits of most ores\r\ndepends largely on the percentage of metal and of impurities present,\r\nand little attention need be given to the physical character of an\r\nore. The value of asbestos, however, depends not only on purity\r\nof composition, but on very definite physical properties, such as\r\nlength of fiber, flexibility, and tensile strength. Such properties\r\nresult from a combination of favorable conditions of crystallization,\r\nconditions that are at present little understood.\r\n\r\nA large body of serpentinized basic rock bears, therefore, no certain\r\npromise of an asbestos supply, though it may offer encouragement for\r\nprospecting. High-grade fiber is evidently formed under a peculiar\r\ncombination of geologic conditions which involve the presence of\r\ncertain primary rock types, their alteration to secondary minerals\r\nand recrystallization of these in veins, such recrystallization being\r\ninduced by a combination of metamorphic agencies. Although it is quite\r\nprobable, therefore, that new fields will be discovered, there is no\r\nprobability of an abundant supply.\r\n\r\nAn important point to be considered in connection with future supplies\r\nis that for most uses of asbestos there is little or no scrap\r\nrecovery; that which is once used is for the most part gone beyond\r\nrecall. It is wise, therefore, to maintain a conservative view of the\r\nasbestos reserve, for although there is evidence of a supply in the\r\nCanadian deposits and elsewhere to last for many years, the probability\r\nis that deposits of high-grade material are neither numerous nor\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\nThe total production and estimated reserves of spinning asbestos in the\r\nimportant producing countries are shown in Figure 13.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Total production and estimated reserves of\r\nspinning asbestos.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--Asbestos in the United States is of two types,\r\nchrysotile and anthophyllite. The chrysotile variety occurs in Arizona,\r\nVermont, Wyoming, and California, and the anthophyllite in Georgia,\r\nVirginia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Idaho.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chrysotile Asbestos._--The asbestos deposits of _Arizona_ are unusual\r\nin being cross-fiber chrysotile veins in cherty limestone, and thus\r\nquite distinct in origin from the Quebec deposits. The asbestos-bearing\r\nbeds are thin and some of them are almost inaccessible.\r\n\r\nAsbestos was first discovered in Arizona at two points in the Grand\r\nCanyon of the Colorado, west of the mouth of the Little Colorado River.\r\nThe mineral occurs in a single bed, 12 to 14 inches thick, the veins\r\nbeing parallel with the bedding. In some places the veins are 4 inches\r\nthick, but usually they do not exceed 2¹⁄₂ inches. The visible supply,\r\ntherefore, is not great, and as the district is difficult of access\r\nproduction has been slight. Asbestos also occurs in Ash Creek Canyon\r\nnear Globe. Production began in 1914, and has increased considerably\r\nsince. The asbestos carries only 0.5 per cent. iron oxide, while\r\nCanadian asbestos runs 2.2 per cent. to 2.6 per cent. iron oxide. The\r\nArizona material is, therefore, superior to Canadian asbestos for\r\nelectrical insulation. It is estimated that under favorable conditions\r\nthe region can supply 1,000 tons annually for many years to come, but\r\nthat the output will never be large as compared with that of Canada.\r\nIn 1914 an asbestos deposit similar to those of Ash Creek was reported\r\nnear Young postoffice. It is 80 miles from the nearest railroad station\r\nand will probably be inaccessible for many years. Near the summit of\r\nMount Baker, north of the Roosevelt Reservoir, a mine producing good\r\nchrysotile was opened in 1917. The asbestos occurs in cross-fiber veins\r\nin limestone.\r\n\r\nThe asbestos deposits of _Vermont_ are situated at Lowell, in the same\r\nformation as the Quebec deposits. The asbestos occurs in numerous\r\nirregular veins, the supply is probably large, and some of it compares\r\nfavorably with the Canadian product. There was a considerable\r\nproduction in former years, but after 1912 the quarries were idle. The\r\nreserves of low-grade rock are probably large.\r\n\r\nThe main deposits of _Wyoming_ occur south of Casper in igneous Archean\r\nrocks. The mineral is chrysotile asbestos, mostly of the cross-fiber\r\ntype, though some slip-fiber is present. It is claimed that the Wyoming\r\nasbestos has better heat-resisting qualities than the Canadian fiber.\r\nHowever, a very small proportion of the fiber is of spinning grade.\r\n\r\nDeposits of chrysotile asbestos have been noted in many parts of\r\n_California_, scattered over 13 counties. The deposits seem to be\r\nsmall, and thus far the production has not exceeded a few tons a year.\r\nA small production is recorded for 1917 from Nevada and Inyo counties.\r\nThere was an increased output in 1918, the total being 229 tons. Some\r\nNo. 1 spinning fiber was obtained in Nevada County.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anthophyllite Asbestos._--The anthophyllite asbestos deposits in\r\n_Georgia_ yield the largest production of any state in the Union. The\r\nmaterial is not of spinning grade and is practically all used for\r\nfireproofing and insulating. There is a considerable demand for such\r\nmaterial, however, and the industry is established on a firm basis.\r\nA notable feature of the Georgia deposits is that approximately 95\r\nper cent. of the rock quarried is fibrous anthophyllite of commercial\r\nquality, whereas in Quebec only about 6¹⁄₂ per cent. of the material\r\nquarried can be utilized.\r\n\r\nAnthophyllite asbestos deposits occur in _Virginia_ near Bedford. The\r\nmaterial is low-grade and the amount is probably small. A little is\r\nconsumed in the manufacture of “tenax,” a preparation used by dentists.\r\nAmphibole slip-fiber asbestos has lately been mined on a small scale in\r\n_Maryland_, near Pylesville. It is used for filters. Several years ago\r\na small production was recorded from Dalton, _Massachusetts_, and New\r\nHartford, _Connecticut_.\r\n\r\nAnthophyllite asbestos occurs in _Idaho_, near Kamiah. It is not of\r\nspinning grade, is of low tensile strength, and is inferior to all but\r\nthe lowest grades of chrysotile. The deposit is evidently large, but\r\nthe production is almost negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canada and Newfoundland.=--The most important asbestos-producing\r\ndeposits of the world are those of the province of _Quebec_, Canada,\r\nchiefly in the region of Thetford and Broughton. Asbestos occurs\r\nin serpentine of Cambrian age, the area in which the important\r\nmines are found extending from southern Vermont to Gaspé, in the\r\nProvince of Quebec. The serpentine lies in three prominent belts.\r\nThe Danville-Eastman-Vermont serpentine belt is about 62 miles long.\r\nThe scattered outcrops probably are connected beneath the heavy\r\ndrift deposits and forest growth. Prospects have been worked in six\r\nplaces, but the production attained is small. The belt is an uncertain\r\nquantity, that gives fair promise of a large future supply.\r\n\r\nThe Thetford-Black Lake area is the important area of Quebec and now\r\nthe most productive asbestos district of the world. In 1917 there were\r\n17 active mines in the district. In 1918 the quantity of rock mined\r\nwas 2,445,745 tons, and the total asbestos production was 159,225\r\ntons, valued at $9,053,945. The Broughton and the central and eastern\r\nThetford areas are mainly slip-fiber asbestos. The West Thetford,\r\nSouth Ireland, and North Coleraine Township deposits constitute the\r\nvein-fiber belt which yields the high-grade spinning asbestos that has\r\na world-wide reputation.\r\n\r\nSerpentine rocks bearing chrysotile asbestos are reported near Port au\r\nPort, in _Newfoundland_, probably representing a continuation of the\r\nQuebec belt. The possibility of commercial development is uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mexico, Central and South America.=--Asbestos deposits have been\r\nreported in _Brazil_, but aside from this no commercial deposits have\r\nbeen noted in South America.\r\n\r\nThere is no record of asbestos deposits in Mexico or in Central America.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Europe.=--The asbestos deposits of _Russia_ probably rank next\r\nto those of Canada. The principal mines are 57 miles north of\r\nEkaterinburg, in the Ural Mountains. The quarries can be worked only\r\nfrom May to November in each year. Transportation is over the Perm\r\nRailroad, and the output is exported via Riga. The fiber is of the same\r\ntype as the Canadian, a chrysotile asbestos, chiefly of the cross-fiber\r\ntype. The richest ore yields 42 to 55 pounds of asbestos per cubic\r\nyard. Production has also been reported by the South Urals Asbestos\r\nCo., operating in the Orsk district, in Orenburg. Russian asbestos is\r\nsaid to be harsher than Canadian and less suitable for spinning, but a\r\ngreat deal of high-grade fiber has been produced and Russia is likely\r\nto be an important future source of asbestos.\r\n\r\nThe asbestos of _Italy_ is of the anthophyllite variety. There are\r\nthree main districts: the Susa Valley deposits, near the French\r\nborder, which lie 6,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level and are,\r\ntherefore, not readily available; the Aosta Valley deposits, of wide\r\nextent, with long-fibered, strong, and soapy product; and the deposits\r\nin Lombardy, also of great extent. Italian asbestos may be used to some\r\nextent as a substitute for Canadian fiber, or to mix with it, but the\r\nsupply of high-grade fiber is not great, and it is more difficult and\r\nexpensive to work than the Canadian material. The United Asbestos Co.,\r\nof London, England, is the largest producer.\r\n\r\nLarge deposits of asbestos are known on the island of _Cyprus_.\r\nThe material is derived from serpentine and is of the amphibole\r\nanthophyllite type. Much of it is short-fibered but some of it can be\r\nused to mix with Canadian fiber.\r\n\r\nGood spinning asbestos has been noted in central _Finland_ but\r\nproduction up to the present time is almost negligible.\r\n\r\nAsbestos deposits have been noted in _England_, _Scotland_, _Ireland_,\r\n_France_, _Portugal_, _Spain_, _Switzerland_, _Germany_, _Norway_,\r\n_Greece_, and _Turkey_, but all the above deposits are said to consist\r\nof coarse and brittle material of little commercial value. A large\r\ndeposit of good asbestos is reported in the island of _Corsica_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Asia.=--Deposits are known in various districts of _India_. Asbestos\r\nis also reported in _Afghanistan_. Indian asbestos is of inferior\r\ntensile strength, and the lack of development renders it an uncertain\r\nresource.\r\n\r\nThe United States Geological Survey reported in 1912 that three\r\nasbestos mines were in operation 45 miles northeast of Antung, China.\r\nThe product, which was shipped into Manchuria, is of the amphibole\r\n(anthophyllite) type and quite brittle. Chrysotile asbestos of good\r\nquality is reported south of Lake Baikal, in _Mongolia_. It has never\r\nbeen mined, and on account of its remoteness is not likely to be\r\ndeveloped. Deposits yielding a small output are reported from several\r\nother provinces.\r\n\r\nAsbestos deposits occur in several localities in _Japan_. The output is\r\nof inferior quality and is mixed with imported material for asbestos\r\npacking. The Japan Asbestos Co., of Osaka, is the chief manufacturer of\r\nasbestos products.\r\n\r\nDeposits have been opened at Minusinck, on the Yenesei River, in\r\n_Siberia_, but production is reported for the year 1905 only.\r\nTransportation is difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Africa.=--The asbestos of _Cape Colony_ is crocidolite, or blue\r\nasbestos; it is of the amphibole type and will not bear high\r\ntemperature, probably on account of its iron content, but is longer,\r\nstronger, finer, and more elastic than chrysotile. On account of its\r\nlow fusibility it is useful in electric welding. The mineral occurs\r\nin three important districts and outcrops at numerous points from the\r\nOrange River north to Bechuanaland. Government engineers report it\r\nto be the largest asbestos-bearing area in the world. The principal\r\ndeposits are at Koejas, where the Cape Asbestos Co., Ltd., produced in\r\n1916 about two-thirds of the total amount of asbestos mined in South\r\nAfrica. Blue asbestos is gaining favor in foreign markets, and this\r\nfact, in connection with the great extent of the deposits, indicates\r\nthat these deposits constitute an important factor in world supply.\r\n\r\nLarge and probably extensive deposits of chrysotile asbestos of the\r\nfinest quality occur in the _Transvaal_. Three companies have recently\r\noperated in this district. Production, which began about 1914, in which\r\nyear 30 tons were reported, had increased to a total of 407 tons in\r\n1916.\r\n\r\nA new and important development is the mining of a long-fibered\r\namphibole asbestos known as “amosite.”\r\n\r\nA small output of asbestos from _Natal_ has been reported for several\r\nyears; however, the fiber is not high grade and an increase of\r\nproduction is not likely.\r\n\r\nImportant deposits occur in southern _Rhodesia_. The Southern Rhodesia\r\nGeological Survey reports that there is in sight several years’ supply\r\nfor an output of 200 tons per month without going deeper than 60 feet.\r\nThe “probable ore” supply is very great. It has been stated that the\r\nRhodesian fiber is the only class of chrysotile asbestos that can\r\ncompete successfully with the best grade of Canadian fiber.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australasia.=--A chrysotile-bearing serpentine belt covers a\r\nconsiderable area in _Queensland_. A deposit occurs near Rockwell,\r\n_South Australia_. The Australia Asbestos Manufacturing Co. has\r\nproduced a small amount of material similar to Italian asbestos. A\r\nsmall amount of chrysotile has also been found. A deposit of chrysotile\r\nprospected in _New South Wales_ is claimed to have the longest asbestos\r\nfiber in the world. No production has been reported. In the Pilbarra\r\ndistrict, _West Australia_, there is chrysotile asbestos of spinning\r\ngrade which is said to be superior to either the Russian or Italian\r\nproduct. Some years ago a mine was worked to considerable depth by the\r\nPilbarra Asbestos Co., of London, England, but in recent years the\r\nproduction has been almost negligible. In _New Zealand_ chrysotile\r\nasbestos of spinning grade occurs in Nelson Province. The Australasian\r\nAsbestos Co., of Sydney, has recently prospected the serpentine belt of\r\n_Tasmania_, which contains both chrysotile and anthophyllite asbestos.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENTS AND CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION OF MINES\r\n\r\nThe United States leads all nations in the manufacture of asbestos\r\nproducts, and the large supply of asbestos in Quebec is readily\r\navailable. There is, therefore, little prospect of any radical change\r\nin the geographical distribution of American asbestos mines. As there\r\nis always a possibility of such changes, however, it is well to\r\nconsider the controlling factors.\r\n\r\nAs to the future of the Quebec deposits, the present source of\r\nsupply, little definite information is available. The fact that\r\nserpentinization is a deep-seated process has led Canadian geologists\r\nto conclude that commercial fiber may be formed to the full depth of\r\nthe original peridotite rock. For all practical purposes, however, the\r\ndepth of the deposit is limited to the depth at which asbestos can be\r\nextracted profitably. One mine is now working at a depth of 300 feet\r\nand drill holes sunk 400 feet farther indicate a thickness of at least\r\n700 feet of good fiber-bearing rock. Cirkel has stated that in one of\r\nthe Black Lake quarries there is 44,377,500 tons of asbestos rock in\r\nsight above the railway tracks, ready for immediate exploitation. A\r\ndeduction of 50 per cent. for waste rock would leave 22,000,000 tons of\r\nmill rock available, or enough to supply for 22 years a plant capable\r\nof producing 4,000 tons a day. As this includes only the visible ore\r\nit may be inferred that the reserve is very great. Cirkel estimates\r\nthe total acreage of productive vein fiber as 12,420, of which 1,100\r\nacres is under development at the present time. A geologist who spent\r\ntwo summers studying the geology of the region states that second-grade\r\nfiber is very abundant and that the high-grade deposits are not more\r\nthan 25 per cent. exhausted. There is, therefore, no prospect for many\r\nyears of any change in the geographical distribution of working mines\r\nthrough the exhaustion of present deposits.\r\n\r\nDuring 1916 and 1917 the production of high-grade fiber in the United\r\nStates grew steadily, but is still far from meeting domestic demands,\r\nas the total United States output in 1917 was only one-eightieth of\r\nthe amount imported. The most important development has been in the\r\nhigh-grade chrysotile districts of Arizona, but these new deposits do\r\nnot give promise of an abundant supply, and it is unlikely that they\r\nwill constitute a dominating factor in American production.\r\n\r\nLegislation may have a profound effect on the development of deposits.\r\nA high export duty placed on raw asbestos by a country now producing it\r\nin large quantities would have the effect of encouraging prospecting\r\nin other countries and the development of deposits that might supply\r\nsubstitute material. In this connection it is interesting to note\r\nthat the Board of Trade of the eastern townships of Quebec proposed\r\nmeasures to protect the export of raw asbestos, in order to force\r\nthe manufacture of asbestos products in Canada. The Canadian Mining\r\nInstitute Bulletin (August, 1916) pointed out the dangers of such\r\naction, for other countries would immediately search for asbestos\r\ndeposits elsewhere, and as good asbestos occurs in Russia, South\r\nAfrica, Cyprus, and other localities, substitutes for Canadian material\r\ncould probably be found. It is evident, therefore, that Canada does not\r\ncontrol the supply, but that so long as Canadian fiber is available at\r\nreasonable prices there is no strong incentive for the development of\r\nnew deposits.\r\n\r\nIn the Old World the situation is less stable than in America.\r\nEuropean countries import considerable material from Canada, and the\r\nbalance of their requirements is filled from various sources, chiefly\r\nfrom Russia, Cyprus, Italy, South Africa, and Australia. High-grade\r\nasbestos deposits exist in various countries and are for the most\r\npart developed to a small extent. The factors determining changes in\r\nproduction are somewhat different from those outlined for America.\r\nThe lack of a strong central government greatly hampers production in\r\nany country. Thus under recent conditions in Russia the output fell\r\nfrom nearly 20,000 tons in 1913 to about 9,000 in 1916. Stabilized\r\nconditions and more efficient governments would tend to increase\r\nthe output of several eastern countries. The most important factor\r\ncontributing to the slow development of the Old World deposits is poor\r\ntransportation. Russian asbestos for the English market has to pay\r\ntransportation costs of $25 to $30 per ton. The important crocidolite\r\ndeposits of South Africa are likewise hampered by poor transportation.\r\nNot only are the roads poor, but the most important deposits of Koegas\r\nare 18 miles from a traveled road, and other deposits are about 100\r\nmiles from roads. This drawback is offset to some extent by cheap labor.\r\n\r\nThe present political upheaval in Europe, involving the formation of\r\nnew states and new forms of government, may have a pronounced effect on\r\nthe development of asbestos deposits, but until progressive governments\r\nare established and vast improvements made in transportation, no great\r\nincrease in production is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nA large share of the asbestos deposits of the world, being situated in\r\nBritish colonial possessions, are under the political control of Great\r\nBritain. The deposits of Cyprus are at present under British political\r\ncontrol, but this may not be permanent. Before the war, Cyprus was\r\nnominally Turkish, though administered by Great Britain; in 1914, Great\r\nBritain formally annexed the island. Cyprus was offered to Greece in\r\nreturn for her assistance in the war, but the offer was not accepted.\r\n\r\nFrom information available it is evident that the governments of Russia\r\nand Italy have in the past imposed no serious restrictions on the\r\ndevelopment of their asbestos properties through either domestic or\r\nforeign capital.\r\n\r\nBelow is set forth the commercial control of the asbestos deposits of\r\nthe world, by countries, in the following order: United States, Canada,\r\nRussia, South Africa, Italy, Cyprus, and Australia.\r\n\r\nIn the Globe district of Arizona, in the _United States_, spinning\r\nasbestos is produced by the Johns-Manville Co., working the Snell &\r\nFisk property, and by the American Ores & Asbestos Co. The Sierra\r\nAsbestos Co., near Nevada City, California, produced spinning fiber in\r\n1918. As far as is known all the companies operating in the United\r\nStates are American owned.\r\n\r\nThe asbestos mining industry in _Canada_ is confined to the eastern\r\ntownships of the Province of Quebec. The largest company is the\r\nAsbestos Corporation of Canada, Ltd., with head office in Montreal.\r\nThis company operates the Kings and Beaver mines, at Thetford Mines,\r\nthe British Canadian mine, at Black Lake, and the Frazer mine, at East\r\nBroughton. The company is controlled by English, Canadian, and United\r\nStates capital. The Bell Asbestos Mines Co., the Asbestos & Asbestic\r\nCorporation, and the Manville Asbestos Co. are wholly or largely owned\r\nin the United States. The remaining companies are mostly controlled\r\nby English or Canadian capital, though United States interests are\r\nrepresented in some of them. Evidently, therefore, the ownership of\r\nthe companies is divided between English, Canadian and United States\r\ncapital, with British interests probably predominating.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the Ekaterinburg mines in _Russia_ are the\r\nVoznesensky and Zoe-Anonsky, near Bazhenof. About one-third of the\r\ntotal output of the Urals came from these mines in 1916. It is reported\r\nthat prior to the war a German syndicate controlled several Russian\r\nmines which produced in all more than 80 per cent. of the entire\r\nRussian output. Germany and Austria were the chief buyers of Russian\r\nasbestos before the war.\r\n\r\nIn _South Africa_ the crocidolite of Cape Colony is mined largely\r\nby the Cape Asbestos Co., a British firm with mines at Koegas and\r\nWesterberg, and having factories in England, Turin, and Hamburg. A\r\nsister company in France, Compagnie Française de l’Amiante du Cap,\r\nhandled in 1916 about two-thirds of the total South African production\r\nand was the chief manufacturer of blue asbestos products. In the\r\nTransvaal, asbestos is mined by three companies, The Transvaal Asbestos\r\nSyndicate, now absorbed by the Consolidated Gold Fields; the South\r\nAfrican Minerals Option Syndicate, a subsidiary of the Bechuanaland\r\nExploration Co., and the Anglo-Swiss Asbestos Co. British capital\r\npredominates. The Rhodesia Asbestos Co., Ltd., was the chief Rhodesian\r\nproducer until recently, but in 1917 the Rhodesia and General Asbestos\r\nCorporation was organized with a capital of £400,000 to take over the\r\noperating mines. The commercial control is, therefore, British.\r\n\r\nThe chief producer in _Italy_ is the United Asbestos Co., of London,\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nPrior to the war the _Cyprus_ deposits were worked by the Cyprian\r\nMining Co., an Austrian corporation. As mining concessions are obtained\r\nfrom the British government by lease on a royalty basis, it is probable\r\nthat the lease has now been cancelled.\r\n\r\nThe deposits in _Australasia_ are practically all controlled by English\r\nor Australian capital.\r\n\r\nMines that have no milling equipment can produce crude fiber which may\r\nbe treated at manufacturing plants. The various grades of mill fiber\r\nmay be produced only where mills are located at or near the mines.\r\nAs the utilization of all grades can be accomplished only with the\r\nassistance of mills, such mills are necessary for efficient mining.\r\nConsequently, with other factors equal, mines with near-by mills have\r\na distinct commercial advantage over mines that produce crude fiber\r\nonly. Although mills are not essential factors in the asbestos-mining\r\nindustry, they exert a secondary influence in commercial control\r\nthrough the increase in mining efficiency that they render possible.\r\nFor deposits remote from centers of manufacture, mills are of\r\nlittle advantage, as fiber below spinning grade will not bear heavy\r\ntransportation charges. Most of the United States and Canadian mines\r\nhave mills for treatment of rock bearing short fiber. Several of the\r\nRussian mines are similarly equipped, but in other parts of the world\r\nlittle or no milling is done.\r\n\r\nA number of important manufacturers of asbestos products in the United\r\nStates are owners of or have intimate trade agreements with large\r\nCanadian asbestos mines, and also with some of the domestic mines.\r\nHence as regards commercial control the United States is practically\r\nassured of a supply of raw material.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF LEADING COMMERCIAL NATIONS\r\n\r\nAlthough the _United States_ is the largest manufacturer of asbestos\r\nproducts in the world, in 1917 less than 1 per cent. of the raw\r\nmaterial was mined in this country. The country is, therefore, largely\r\ndependent on foreign sources of supply. The abundant deposits of\r\nQuebec, Canada, are conveniently near, and so long as the present\r\namicable relations with Canada continue, an ample supply seems to be\r\nassured. In 1916 the United States used 86 per cent. of the Canadian\r\noutput. During 1916 and 1917 there was marked activity in developing\r\nthe high-grade chrysotile deposits of Arizona. While there is as\r\nyet no evidence of an abundant supply, the material is an important\r\nsupplementary source of supply because of its quality.\r\n\r\nWhile no commercial asbestos is mined in the British Isles, British\r\ncolonial possessions hold control of about 88 per cent. of the annual\r\nasbestos output of the world and approximately 70 per cent. of the\r\nworld’s reserves. Thus, although the supply within the _British Empire_\r\nis ample, the home requirements of the nation can be met only under\r\nfavorable shipping conditions, as all necessary material must be\r\ntransported several thousand miles.\r\n\r\n_Russia_ is the second largest producer of asbestos in the world, and\r\nseemingly has large reserves. As little manufacturing is done in the\r\ncountry, practically the entire output is exported. Being independent\r\nas regards her own needs for raw asbestos, Russia requires only the\r\nmaintenance of an active foreign market to assure a permanent industry.\r\n\r\nNo commercial asbestos deposits are known to exist in _Germany_. Prior\r\nto the war asbestos was imported chiefly from Russia and Canada. The\r\nchief Russian mines are said to have been controlled by German capital.\r\n\r\n_Italy_ has large deposits of amphibole (anthophyllite) asbestos,\r\nsome of which is of spinning grade, but as production has always been\r\nsmall and has, except for minor fluctuations, been stationary for the\r\npast 18 years, it is unlikely that the deposits can supply domestic\r\nrequirements of high-grade fiber. A small amount has been exported for\r\nfilter use, for which Italian asbestos is well adapted. As the chief\r\nmine is operated by a British company, considerable Italian asbestos is\r\nshipped to England.\r\n\r\nNo asbestos deposits are worked in _France_. Supplies are obtained from\r\nRussia, Canada, and South Africa. France is the leading nation in the\r\nmanufacture of blue asbestos products.\r\n\r\nSeveral deposits of asbestos occur in _Japan_, but all are of inferior\r\nquality. The material mined is mixed with imported fiber for the\r\nmanufacture of asbestos packing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nAsbestos is a unique mineral for the reason that it combines\r\nincombustibility and insulating qualities with a fibrous structure that\r\nmakes possible its manufacture into fabrics, felts, and similar wares.\r\nThe spinning grades of asbestos are most in demand and the problem of\r\nsupply hinges largely on the deposits of high-grade chrysotile. Such\r\nmaterial is used for the manufacture of ropes, safety curtains, mats,\r\npackings and friction facings in brakes. The lower grades are used for\r\nmaking fireproof shingles and other building materials, for insulating,\r\nand for fire brick, acid filters, etc. Although some substitutes may be\r\nfound for the lower grades, no substitutes are known for spinning fiber.\r\n\r\nAsbestos occurs in three main types, chrysotile, crocidolite, and\r\nanthophyllite; the first and second provide most of the spinning fiber,\r\nand the third is almost all of non-spinning quality. The most important\r\ndeposit of chrysotile asbestos is in Quebec, Canada, but large deposits\r\nare worked in Russia and Rhodesia. Crocidolite is mined only in Cape\r\nColony, South Africa. Large deposits of anthophyllite occur in the\r\nUnited States, Italy, and Cyprus.\r\n\r\nThe United States is by far the largest manufacturer of asbestos\r\nproducts in the world, but produces only a small fraction of the\r\nnecessary raw material; it is practically assured of an ample supply\r\nof this because the largest deposits in the world are in the adjacent\r\nProvince of Quebec, Canada. The Arizona deposits provide an excellent\r\ngrade of fiber and constitute a promising supplementary source of\r\nsupply, though the estimated reserves are not great. The British\r\nEmpire holds a dominating position, controlling about 88 per cent.\r\nof the annual asbestos production of the world and approximately 70\r\nper cent. of the estimated reserves. Canada is far in the lead of all\r\ncountries, supplying about 85 per cent. of the world’s output. Russia\r\nwas, before the revolution, second to Canada as a producer; because of\r\nthe cost of transportation the chief output is spinning fiber. South\r\nAfrica has large reserves of good fiber, but the output is handicapped\r\nby poor transportation.\r\n\r\nExhaustion of the chief sources of supply is not likely for many years,\r\nnor is there immediate prospect of any material shift in the centers of\r\nproduction, though with improved transportation a shift to South Africa\r\nis possible. The demand for high-grade asbestos will probably increase\r\nat a steady rate.\r\n\r\nAll the asbestos quarries in the United States seem to be American\r\nowned. The Canadian deposits are controlled by Canadian, English, and\r\nAmerican capital, British interests probably being predominant. British\r\ncompanies evidently hold exclusive control of the present output in\r\nSouth Africa, Australasia, and Italy. Before the war the Russian output\r\nwas largely controlled by a German syndicate, and the Cyprus output by\r\nan Austrian company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nPHOSPHATE ROCK\r\n\r\nBY R. W. STONE\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF PHOSPHATE ROCK\r\n\r\nPhosphate rock is chiefly used, after treatment with sulphuric acid,\r\nas an ingredient of artificial fertilizers. A small quantity is finely\r\nground and used directly as fertilizer. Lesser quantities are used for\r\nmaking phosphoric acid and phosphorus. Phosphorus plays an important\r\npart in military operations, being used for incendiary bullets and\r\nsmoke screens. Phosphorus also is a common ingredient of matches and\r\nthe striking surface on boxes of safety matches, and it enters in small\r\nproportion into phosphor-bronze, phosphor-copper and phosphor-tin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Substitutes.=--Substitutes for phosphate rock may be classed as\r\nnatural and artificial. Natural substitutes are phosphatic limestone;\r\nother phosphate-bearing minerals, such as apatite, nelsonite, and\r\nwavellite; guano; marl; animal excrement and bones. Artificial\r\nsubstitutes include basic slag and manufactured compounds, like\r\nammonium phosphate.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL OCCURRENCE\r\n\r\nPhosphate rock is a sedimentary deposit containing phosphate of lime.\r\nIt occurs as a hard rock interstratified with beds of sandstone, shale,\r\nor other sediments; as amorphous nodular concretions or pebbles in\r\nstream deposits; and as a residuum from the decomposition of phosphatic\r\ndolomite or limestone, or other rocks containing phosphate of lime.\r\nAnother type of deposit commonly classed as phosphate rock is the\r\nporous coralline or other limestone of tropical islands which has been\r\npermeated with phosphate leached from guano.\r\n\r\nPhosphate deposits of the western United States, Algeria, Tunis,\r\nand Egypt are hard rock beds of the first type. Amorphous nodular\r\ndeposits occur in South Carolina, part of Florida, Wales, England,\r\nBelgium, north-central and eastern France, and Russia. The deposits\r\nin Tennessee, Kentucky, and some of those in Florida are residual.\r\nLeached guano deposits are found on the islands of Aruba, Curacao, and\r\nSombrero, in the West Indies, and on Christmas, Ocean, Makatea, Angaur\r\nand other islands in the Indian and South Pacific oceans.\r\n\r\nThe reserves in the United States are fairly well known and are\r\nestimated at 6,000,000,000 tons. Reserves of high-grade rock in Algeria\r\nand Tunis have been estimated at 300,000,000 tons. No information is at\r\nhand regarding the quantity of phosphate rock in Egypt or in Europe,\r\nexcept that Russia is believed to have 80,000,000 tons in one of its\r\nfields. The deposits in the South Pacific islands are estimated at\r\n70,000,000 tons. Before the war the world’s output of phosphate rock\r\nwas about 6,000,000 tons annually, of which about one-half was mined\r\nin the United States. The next largest production is made in northern\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nPhosphoric acid is derived also from apatite, a calcium phosphate that\r\noccurs in veins. Apatite has been mined in the Province of Quebec,\r\nCanada, and in Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nIn the Western Hemisphere phosphate rock is produced in the United\r\nStates, in Canada, the Dutch West Indies, and French Guiana, and occurs\r\nin Peru and Chile.\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--The principal deposits of phosphate rock in the\r\nUnited States are in Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky,\r\nArkansas, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah. Although by far the\r\nlargest deposits are in the western states, those deposits yield less\r\nthan 1 per cent. of the whole because of the lack of a large near-by\r\nmarket and because of high freight rates on the crude rock. It is not a\r\nmatter of common knowledge, but it is, nevertheless, a fact, that the\r\nwestern rock phosphate deposits are so extensive as to be practically\r\ninexhaustible, even if the entire world depended on them for its supply\r\nof phosphate.\r\n\r\nThe _Florida_ phosphate deposits, which are the most extensively\r\ndeveloped in the United States, comprise three classes of\r\nphosphate--hard rock, land pebble, and river pebble. The first is\r\nhighest grade, the second is produced in largest quantity, and the\r\nthird is not mined at present. The hard-rock deposits lie in a narrow\r\nstrip along the western part of the Florida peninsula from Suwanee\r\nCounty to Pasco County, a distance of approximately 100 miles. The\r\nland-pebble phosphate area, just east of Tampa, is about 30 miles long\r\nand 10 miles wide. Sales of Florida phosphate declined tremendously\r\nafter 1913 through the restriction on exports by the war. In 1913\r\nthe sales were 2,500,000 tons, valued at $9,500,000, and in 1915 the\r\nproduction was 1,350,000 tons, valued at $3,700,000.\r\n\r\n_South Carolina_ produces land rock phosphate in the vicinity of\r\nCharleston. River-pebble phosphate occurs in the same area but is not\r\nmined. Some of the South Carolina output has been exported annually.\r\nSales decreased from 169,000 tons in 1911 to 83,000 in 1915, and the\r\nvalue in the same years from $673,000 to $311,000.\r\n\r\n_Tennessee_ deposits of rock phosphate are in the west-central part and\r\nextreme northeast corner of the state; the latter have not been mined.\r\nThree types are recognized and known by their colors as brown, blue,\r\nand white rock; the last has not been mined recently. The brown rock\r\nis sold under guarantee of 70 to 80 per cent. tricalcium phosphate;\r\nthe blue rock varies considerably in its phosphatic content. Sales of\r\nTennessee phosphate in 1914 were 483,000 tons, valued at $1,823,000; by\r\n1915 they had fallen to 390,000 tons, valued at $1,328,000.\r\n\r\n_Kentucky_ has been an insignificant producer of phosphate rock in\r\nrecent years. _Arkansas_ phosphate deposits are in the north-central\r\npart of the state. The output is small.\r\n\r\nFour western states possess enormous deposits of high-grade rock\r\nphosphate, but their output is as yet insignificant, being only 3,000\r\nto 5,000 tons a year. The producing states are Idaho, Utah, and\r\nWyoming. Montana is not a producer, although it contains extensive\r\ndeposits easy of access and close to rail transportation.\r\n\r\n_Idaho_ has an unlimited supply of high-grade phosphate in the\r\nsoutheast part of the state. A small quantity is mined in Bear Lake\r\nCounty. The _Utah_ deposits are east of Great Salt Lake, in the Wasatch\r\nand Uintah ranges, and east of Bear Lake. These deposits are extensive,\r\nbut the rock is leaner than the general run of the Idaho phosphate,\r\naveraging nearer 60 per cent. than 80 per cent. tricalcium phosphate.\r\nWestern _Wyoming_ also is rich in rock phosphate, the deposits being\r\nmostly in the Owl Creek, Wind River, Gros Ventre, and Salt River\r\nranges. Some of the beds are thick, carrying 80 per cent. tricalcium\r\nphosphate, and extend for many miles. They constitute a reserve supply\r\nthat may be called inexhaustible. Small local demand for fertilizer and\r\nlack of cheap transportation may retard for some years the development\r\nof the great and rich western deposits.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the quantity of rock phosphate available in the United\r\nStates was made several years ago and need not be revised to account\r\nfor that mined in the meantime. It is repeated here:\r\n\r\nRESERVES OF PHOSPHATE ROCK IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n                                                         Long tons\r\n  Florida                                               227,000,000\r\n  Tennessee                                              88,000,000\r\n  South Carolina                                          9,000,000\r\n  Kentucky                                                1,000,000\r\n  Arkansas                                               20,000,000\r\n                                                        -----------\r\n                                                        345,000,000\r\n  Western States: Montana, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming   5,367,082,000\r\n                                                      -------------\r\n    Total                                             5,712,082,000\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canada.=--The principal phosphatic rock in Canada is apatite, which\r\noccurs in workable quantity in two main districts--one in the Province\r\nof _Ontario_, the other in the Province of _Quebec_. These deposits,\r\nwhich were worked mainly by quarrying, are now practically abandoned.\r\nRock phosphate occurs in a thin bed near Banff, _Alberta_, but is not\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n=South America.=--In Aruba and Curacao, islands of the _Dutch West\r\nIndies_, off the coast of Venezuela, are deposits of phosphate rock,\r\nfrom which a small quantity is mined and shipped to Europe. It is\r\nreported that the output in 1914 was about 100,000 tons, averaging 85\r\nto 90 per cent. of calcium phosphate.\r\n\r\nIn _Peru_, in the Department of Ica, is a deposit of nodular lime\r\nphosphate, which is not used because of a local preference for guano.\r\n\r\nA large, rich deposit of phosphate is reported in _Chile_, about 300\r\nmiles north of Valparaiso, but has not been developed as yet.\r\n\r\nPhosphate deposits occur on the Island of Salut and on the Connetables,\r\nclose to the coast of _French Guiana_. The rock is exported.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Europe.=--The high-grade phosphate deposits of _Belgium_ are\r\nexhausted, only low-grade deposits remaining. The rock is found in\r\nlayers and pockets, and carries between 25 and 65 per cent. of bone\r\nphosphate. The production from 1911 to 1913 averaged more than 200,000\r\ntons annually.\r\n\r\nThe principal deposits in _France_ are in the Somme and Oise basins.\r\nThe best French deposits are higher grade than the Belgian, as they\r\ncarry 50 to 80 per cent. of bone phosphate, but they are nearly\r\nexhausted, only low-grade material remaining. The production from 1910\r\nto 1914 was about 300,000 tons annually.\r\n\r\nImportant deposits of phosphate rock in _Russia_ can be divided into\r\nthe northern, central, and southern groups. The deposits of the\r\nsouthern group were the only ones exploited before the war. Their\r\noutput was about 25,000 tons a year--very small in comparison with\r\nthe size of the deposits, which are estimated to contain more than\r\n1,500,000,000 tons. Some of the rock is high grade, carrying as much as\r\n75 per cent. tricalcium phosphate, but the normal grade is about 50 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThe only deposits worked extensively in _Spain_ are apatite veins in\r\nthe Province of Caceras. After lying idle many years these deposits\r\nwere reopened and produced 28,000 tons in 1917.\r\n\r\nLow-grade phosphate in the form of beds of nodules occurs in _England_,\r\nand in _Wales_. The production has been slight because the deposits are\r\ntoo small for commercial exploitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Africa.=--The principal deposits of phosphate rock in _Tunis_ are the\r\nGafsa fields, in the southern half of the country. There phosphate\r\noccurs in beds several feet thick, but only those carrying more than\r\n58 per cent. phosphate of lime are exploited. The deposits can be\r\ntraced for several hundred miles, and constitute a reserve of hundreds\r\nof millions of tons. Tunis now produces more phosphate than any\r\nother foreign country, its annual output being between 1,500,000 and\r\n2,000,000 tons, most of which goes to southern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of phosphate rock in _Algeria_ are continuations of those\r\nin Tunis, the important mining districts being in eastern Algeria. The\r\nproduction is over 500,000 tons a year, and the exported rock carries\r\n58 to 68 per cent. of lime phosphate.\r\n\r\nExtensive deposits of phosphate occur in _Egypt_, near the Red Sea,\r\nin thin and irregular beds of the same geologic age (Eocene) as the\r\ndeposits in Tunis and Algeria. The best deposits average 70 per cent.\r\nlime phosphate and the output in 1916 was 125,000 tons. There are\r\nmines 20 miles from Port Safalga, and concessions 12 miles inland from\r\nKosseir and also at Sebaia, on the eastern bank of the Nile between\r\nKeneh and Assouan. Beds of phosphate are found in other districts on\r\nboth sides of the Nile valley. Practically all the raw rock phosphate\r\nproduced contains 65 per cent. or more of tricalcium phosphate and is\r\nexported mainly to Japan.\r\n\r\nDeposits of phosphate occur 80 to 120 kilometers from the city of\r\n_Tripoli_ in beds more than 1 meter thick. These beds probably are a\r\ncontinuation of the phosphate deposits in southern Tunis.\r\n\r\nDeposits of phosphate are reported in _Morocco_ 125 kilometers\r\nsouth-southwest of Casa Blanca on the west coast and 70 kilometers from\r\nthe end of a railroad. These deposits are said to be comparable to the\r\nGafsa field, in Tunis.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that at Dielor, in _Senegal_, about the latitude of Cape\r\nVerde, the westernmost point on the African coast, there is a phosphate\r\nbed which is 2 meters thick to a depth of 64 meters. The rock carries\r\nonly 50 per cent. tricalcium phosphate, so it is not workable under\r\npresent conditions, especially in view of the abundant high-grade rock\r\nin Algeria and Tunis.\r\n\r\nPhosphates have been found in _Natal_, near Weenen, Ladysmith, and\r\nByrnetown, in the form of phosphatic shales and of nodules. The\r\npercentage of tricalcium phosphate in the phosphatic shales is too low\r\nfor use in making superphosphates; the phosphatic nodules are of higher\r\ngrade but not abundant enough to be of value.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Asia and Australasia.=--In the government of Uralsk, in southwestern\r\n_Siberia_, bordering on the north end of the Caspian Sea, there is\r\nreported to be 600,000,000 tons of phosphate rock. It is said that the\r\ngreater part of this material carries 17 to 20 per cent. phosphoric\r\nacid, which is equivalent to 36 to 43 per cent. tricalcium phosphate.\r\nThe government of Turgai, which borders Uralsk on the east, is\r\nreported to contain 67,000,000 tons of phosphate rock, most of which\r\ncarries 18 to 19 per cent. phosphoric acid, or about 40 per cent.\r\ntricalcium phosphate. The highest-grade material reported is 24 per\r\ncent. phosphoric acid, equivalent to about 52 per cent. tricalcium\r\nphosphate. All the phosphate therefore is low grade. No production is\r\nreported from either of the localities.\r\n\r\nLow-grade phosphate rock, in sedimentary beds of considerable extent,\r\nand high-grade vein deposits are reported in _Palestine_, on the east\r\nside of the Jordan. The sedimentary deposits occur also on the west\r\nside of the Jordan. The known reserves are about 3,500,000 tons. The\r\nsedimentary deposits average about 48 per cent. and the vein deposits\r\n77 per cent. tricalcium phosphate. As the vein material is suitable\r\nfor export, these deposits have been explored by a French company, but\r\navailable information indicates there has been no output.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Islands in the North Pacific Ocean._--After the discovery of phosphate\r\nrock on _Rasa Island_, 500 miles east of Formosa, a number of years\r\nago, a Japanese company was formed to exploit the deposits. The rock\r\nis rich, carrying 75 per cent. phosphate of lime, and the reserves are\r\nestimated at 2,800,000 tons. In 1915 Rasa Island yielded 50,000 tons. A\r\nformer German supply of phosphate is on _Angaur Island_, in the Pelew\r\ngroup, east of the southern end of the Philippines. Reserves on this\r\nisland are estimated at 2,000,000 to 4,000,000 tons of phosphate rock,\r\nmostly of high grade. Germany increased the output from 45,000 tons in\r\n1910 to 90,000 tons in 1913. Japan has held this island since October,\r\n1914, and is mining 30,000 tons or more phosphate annually.\r\n\r\nDeposits of phosphate, consisting of replacements of dolomitic\r\ncoralline limestone, and phosphatic guano are reported on several other\r\nislands in Oceania, as Baker and Fanning Islands, in _Polynesia_, and\r\nFais Island, in the _West Caroline Islands_. It is probable that on\r\nother islands there are commercial deposits as yet undiscovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Islands in Indian and South Pacific Oceans._--North of Adelaide,\r\nin _Australia_, are pockety deposits of phosphate; they are without\r\nregular stratification and are of varying quality. The annual output\r\nhas been 4,000 to 6,000 tons for several years. In the Otago district,\r\nnear Clarendon, _New Zealand_, beds of phosphate 3 to 12 feet thick\r\nrest in pockets in limestone. There has been very little if any\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nOn _Christmas Island_ (Straits Settlements), which lies in the Indian\r\nOcean 190 miles south of Java, rock carrying 80 per cent. of bone\r\nphosphate is quarried and shipped to Australia and Japan. The deposits\r\nseem to be irregular, but are estimated to contain several million tons\r\nof rock of very high grade. The island belongs to the government of\r\nSingapore. Exploitation of the deposits by the British began in 1900.\r\nExports in 1913 were 150,000 tons.\r\n\r\nPhosphate rock of high grade is mined on _Ocean Island_, in the\r\nGilbert Archipelago, between the Marshall and Solomon Islands, east\r\nof New Guinea and north of New Zealand. On this and other so-called\r\ncoral islands in the equatorial belt which for ages have been sea-bird\r\nrookeries, leachings from the guano have impregnated the limestone,\r\nforming phosphate rock many feet deep. The deposits on this island\r\nare said to be many millions of tons and are among the richest in the\r\nworld. They have been mined since 1901, and have produced as high\r\nas 300,000 tons a year. In 1916 the output was 70,000 tons of rock\r\ncarrying about 85 per cent. tricalcium phosphate. The island is a\r\nBritish possession.\r\n\r\nAnother British possession in the Gilbert Archipelago containing\r\nphosphate rock is _Pleasant Island_, which is also known as Nauru, or\r\nNgaru, Island. The deposits are similar to those on Ocean and Christmas\r\nIslands, being very high in calcium phosphate and low in iron and\r\nalumina. Germany formerly owned this island, but it was taken over by\r\nthe British in 1917.\r\n\r\nMakatea, near Tahiti, in the _Society Islands_, is estimated to\r\ncontain 10,000,000 tons of very high-grade phosphate rock, irregularly\r\ndistributed between reefs and pinnacles of dolomite. The deposits were\r\ndeveloped as recently as 1910 and yielded more than 300,000 tons before\r\n1917. Some of the rock carries 85 per cent. lime phosphate. The island\r\nis a French possession.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS\r\n\r\nWhen the World War began, exports of phosphate rock from the United\r\nStates, ordinarily about 1,000,000 tons a year, were cut off and\r\nthe annual production of the United States fell from 3,000,000 tons\r\nto 1,800,000 tons. There has been a strong recovery in the domestic\r\nindustry and if labor and transportation conditions improve there\r\nshould shortly be an annual production of nearly 3,000,000 tons for\r\ndomestic consumption, or as much phosphate rock for our own use as\r\nformerly was produced for ourselves and a large export trade.\r\n\r\nIt is surmised that northern Africa will yield larger quantities in the\r\nfuture than during the pre-war period. Production in Algeria, Tunis,\r\nand Egypt was probably stimulated during the war on account of the\r\nlarge reduction in the quantity of American rock sent to Europe.\r\n\r\nJapan doubtless will make a large output from the German deposits in\r\nPolynesia which came into her possession at the beginning of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nOwnership of the phosphate deposits in the United States is largely\r\ndomestic; some of the Florida hard-rock deposits are owned by French\r\nand (before the war) German companies. The German-owned deposits were\r\ntaken over by the Custodian of Alien-Enemy Property, and have doubtless\r\npassed into other hands. The phosphate deposits on Curacao, Dutch West\r\nIndies, are worked by the Curacao Phosphate Mining Co., which ships the\r\noutput to England and Germany. Phosphate deposits in Algeria and Tunis\r\nare exploited by French companies. Some of the companies work under\r\nlease. La Compagnie des Phosphates de Paris and La Compagnie Algerienne\r\ndes Phosphates have been mentioned as engaged in these fields. Deposits\r\non the lower Nile and Red Sea are worked by the Egyptian Phosphate Co.,\r\na British concern, and by the Societa Egiziana per l’Estrazione de il\r\nCommercio dei Phosphati, a company managed by Italians. It is reported\r\nthat much of the output goes to Japan. The Pacific Phosphate Co., Ltd.,\r\nof London, operates under concession the phosphate deposits on Ocean\r\nand Pleasant islands. Japanese companies are mining phosphate on Rasa\r\nand Angaur islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF LEADING NATIONS\r\n\r\nThe United States has the largest known deposits of phosphate rock\r\nin the world, and, as before the war, can supply the needs of other\r\ncountries as well as her own. Since mining began about 55,000,000 tons\r\nhave been mined, or less than 1 per cent. of reserves. Great Britain\r\npossesses phosphate in Egypt and on Christmas, Ocean and Pleasant\r\nislands, and has imported from the United States and probably from\r\nnorthern Africa. France and the other Mediterranean countries have an\r\nample supply in Algeria and Tunis. Germany formerly possessed rich\r\ndeposits of phosphate on Angaur Island, in the Pelew group, Polynesia,\r\nand on Pleasant and Ocean islands, but so far as known now lacks a\r\nsource of supply. Japan has a large supply of high-grade phosphate at\r\nher disposal on Rasa and Angaur islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe principal use of phosphate rock is as an ingredient of fertilizers.\r\nLesser quantities are consumed in the manufacture of phosphoric acid,\r\nin phosphorus used in military operations, in the manufacture of\r\nmatches, and in metallurgy. Both natural and artificial substitutes are\r\navailable for many of the uses of phosphate rock.\r\n\r\nPhosphate rock is a sedimentary deposit containing phosphate of lime.\r\nIt occurs as a hard rock between beds of sandstone or shale, as\r\namorphous nodular phosphates in stream deposits, and as a residuum\r\nfrom the decomposition of phosphatic dolomite, limestone, and other\r\nphosphate-bearing rocks. The porous limestone of tropical islands,\r\nwhere it is permeated with phosphate leached from guano, is commonly\r\nclassed as phosphate rock.\r\n\r\nThe phosphate rock deposits of present commercial importance are\r\nsituated in the United States, Algeria, Tunis, Egypt, and the islands\r\nof the Indian and South Pacific oceans, the United States possessing\r\nby far the largest reserves. Smaller deposits, either undeveloped or\r\nnearly exhausted, are in Canada, Venezuela, Chile, Belgium, France,\r\nRussia, England, Spain, South Australia, and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the exports of phosphate rock from the United States\r\ndecreased greatly. With the return to normal conditions, however, the\r\nUnited States should experience little difficulty in becoming once more\r\nthe principal source of phosphate rock.\r\n\r\nThe principal phosphate-rock deposits are controlled politically by the\r\nUnited States, France (Algeria and Tunis), and Great Britain (Egypt). A\r\nnumber of phosphate-bearing islands in the Pacific Ocean were owned by\r\nGermany before the war, but have been seized by Great Britain and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe commercial control of the deposits of the United States is mainly\r\nin the hands of Americans, although German (before the war) and French\r\ninterests own some of the Florida hard-rock deposits. The deposits of\r\nAlgeria and Tunis are controlled by French companies. The Egyptian\r\ndeposits are controlled by two companies, one British and the other\r\nItalian.\r\n\r\nGermany will be without a source of supply under her own control now\r\nthat she has lost her colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nPOTASH\r\n\r\nBY HOYT S. GALE AND A. W. STOCKETT\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE AND USES OF POTASH\r\n\r\nThe term potash is commonly used to designate any of the salts of the\r\nelement potassium, particularly those soluble in water, which are\r\nlargely used in agriculture and manufacturing. The element potassium\r\nis widely distributed as a component of rocks, soils, and vegetable\r\nand animal substances, but large quantities of potassium salts in\r\nforms suitable for the uses of man have been found in only a few\r\nplaces. Ashes of wood, which were formerly the principal source of\r\npotash in commerce, now supply an inconsiderable part of the world’s\r\nrequirements. Since 1860, the principal, in fact almost the only,\r\ncommercial source of potash salts has been the immense deposits in\r\nnorthern Germany. The crude potassium salts obtained from these\r\ndeposits by mining operations are used either as fertilizer in the\r\nform in which they are taken from the ground, or are purified by\r\ncrystallization or manufactured into various compounds of potassium\r\nneeded for both agriculture and other industrial uses.\r\n\r\nUse in agriculture as an ingredient of the so-called artificial or\r\nchemical fertilizers accounts for 90 per cent. or more of the world’s\r\nconsumption. Potassium is not only one of the ten or more chemical\r\nelements essential to plant life, but of these ten it is one of three\r\nthat frequently become so lacking in soils that the yield of crops is\r\nnot profitable. Even if potassium exists in soils, it may be and often\r\nis present in some form not readily available for plant use, so that\r\nthe addition of fresh, readily water-soluble salts of potassium shows\r\nprompt reaction in stimulating the growth of the crop. In a general way\r\npotash is supposed to supply a necessary plant food, that strengthens\r\nthe stalk and fills the kernels of the growing plant. Also it is a\r\ngeneral belief that some destructive plant diseases, such as blight and\r\nrust of cotton and potatoes, are largely favored by improper nutrition\r\nas well as by poor physical condition of the soil, for which potash\r\nseems to be a specific. Thus the so-called potash industry, by which is\r\nmeant the mining and marketing of the principal or commonest compounds\r\nof potash, is based chiefly on use in agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe other uses of the salts of potassium are many and diverse. Most\r\nof the potassium salts have properties similar to the corresponding\r\nsalts of sodium, and for most industrial purposes the salts of these\r\ntwo elements may be interchanged, a generalization which does not,\r\nhowever, apply to any extent whatever to the agricultural application\r\nof potassium. Some industrial preferences for the potassium salt depend\r\non more favorable physical properties of the potassium over the sodium\r\nsalt, such as a less tendency of the potassium salt to absorb moisture\r\nfrom the air. Other preferences depend on slight chemical differences,\r\nas for instance a somewhat greater solubility, which renders the\r\npurification of the potassium salt more easy. During the scarcity and\r\nhigh prices of the wartime period many substitutions have been made,\r\nwhich either directly or by some modification of practice are now\r\nproving so satisfactory that they will probably be continued.\r\n\r\nOne of the most urgent demands for potash has come from the match\r\nmanufacturers. Potassium chlorate is an important ingredient of most\r\nmatches, and this use consumes a surprisingly large amount of potash.\r\nCertain varieties of glass, especially cut glass tableware (flint\r\nglass) and some optical glass, are made from potash, generally in the\r\nform known as glass-makers’ carbonate. Most soap is made from soda,\r\nbut potash (as caustic or hydroxide) is used for some of the finer\r\ngrades, such as shaving, toilet, and shampoo soaps, especially the\r\nliquid forms. Caustic potash has had a considerable use in laundries,\r\nand for the scouring or washing of wool. The old form of black powder\r\nwas made from potash as potassium nitrate or saltpeter; hence the\r\ncommonly assumed military importance of potash. Black powder, though\r\nnow largely superseded by modern high-explosive powders, still has a\r\nrelatively small though nevertheless important application in modern\r\nwarfare. There are other uses, which, though requiring a small total\r\namount, include some important requirements, among these being the\r\nmedicinal or pharmaceutical, tannery, dye, photographic, electroplate,\r\nand metallurgical needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe great deposits of potash in northern Germany underlie an extensive\r\narea in the Prussian provinces of Saxony, Hanover, and in the duchies\r\nof Anhalt and Brunswick. The most important mining regions lie in\r\nan area practically encircling the Harz Mountains, 75 to 150 miles\r\nsouthwest of Berlin, and 100 to 150 miles south to southeast of\r\nHamburg. This area is outlined more exactly on the accompanying index\r\nmap (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\nThe field originally opened at Stassfurt has since been explored\r\nby deep boring and developed by the sinking of mining shafts, with\r\nthe result that there has now been outlined an estimated reserve\r\nof 20,000,000,000 metric tons of crude potash salts, which at the\r\npresent rate of the world’s consumption should be sufficient to last\r\nalmost 2,000 years. Thus for all practical purposes the field may be\r\nconsidered as inexhaustible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Distribution of potash deposits in northern\r\nGermany.]\r\n\r\nIn 1904 another important and extensive deposit of water-soluble potash\r\nsalts was discovered by boring in the valley of the Rhine River in\r\nsouthern Alsace. Alsace, then in possession of Germany, has now been\r\nrestored to France. The deposit is in two essentially continuous beds\r\nthat underlie within accessible depth an area of 70 to 80 square miles\r\nof the flat bottom lands of the Rhine Valley. The beds are estimated\r\nto contain about 1,500,000,000 metric tons of crude potash salts,\r\nwhich average considerably richer in potash than the output of the\r\nnorth German deposits, and, being of simpler chemical composition, are\r\nmore readily refined. The mines opening these deposits are readily\r\naccessible to water transportation by way of the Rhine River and the\r\ncanals of the Rhine Valley. The distance to ocean ports is considerably\r\nlonger than it is from the north German deposits, being about 375\r\nmiles, as compared with 150 miles by canal and river boats from the\r\nlatter, but the amount of handling necessary to transport similar\r\ncargoes from the two districts seems to be about the same. The deposit\r\nin Alsace lies in an elliptical area centering about 5 miles northwest\r\nof the city of Mulhouse.\r\n\r\nSome potash has been produced from a deposit in Galicia, near Kalusz,\r\nsouth of Lemberg, from deposits reported to be of a type similar to\r\nthose of north Germany, but the field has never yielded even enough\r\npotash to satisfy the local demand, and is thought not to be large.\r\n\r\nDuring the war relatively small outputs of potash salts were obtained\r\nfrom many independent sources, in the United States, Abyssinia, Tunis,\r\nand other countries. Under stress of war necessities and the complete\r\nshutting off of other supplies, these outputs in the aggregate formed\r\na considerable amount. Much of the development probably will not be\r\npermanent, when strict competition with the potash from more available\r\nsources is renewed, but each of these fields and doubtless many others\r\ncontain the possibilities of development that may give the world\r\nsituation a new aspect at any time. Chief among the most immediate\r\nprospects for important development is a rather extensive field in\r\neastern Spain, near Barcelona. This field has not as yet produced on\r\na commercial scale. One estimate of the reserves in the Spanish field\r\nclaims a proved area of 13.5 square miles containing 200,000,000 tons\r\nof potassium oxide.\r\n\r\nThe nitrate deposits of Chile contain a small percentage of potash, and\r\nthis is being recovered separately from the sodium nitrate at several\r\nof the refineries. It has been estimated that a total production of\r\n240,000 tons of potassium oxide annually might be derived from this\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nMany different sources in the United States are yielding potash salts.\r\nThe largest known deposit of soluble potash in fairly concentrated\r\nform is at Searles Lake, California. This is a dried saline lake,\r\nnow represented by a bed of crystalline salts with a large amount of\r\nsaturated brine rich in potash. The body of salts carrying the brine\r\nunderlies an area of about 25 square miles and extends to an average\r\ndepth of 70 feet. It is estimated that the brine alone in this deposit\r\ncarries nearly 20,000,000 tons of potassium oxide, which would be\r\nenough potash to supply the needs of the country for about 60 years\r\nat the present normal rate. Numerous small lakes in western Nebraska\r\ncarry brines exceptionally rich in potash, and these are now yielding\r\na considerable production of potash fertilizer salts. No satisfactory\r\nestimate of the reserves in this field is available.\r\n\r\nUnder present operating conditions about one-third of the annual\r\nrequirements of the United States is recoverable from the cement mills.\r\nAbout 380,000 short tons of potash, most of which is volatilized, is\r\nannually charged into the blast furnaces of the country. The best\r\navailable estimates indicate that about 30,000 tons of potash have\r\nformerly gone to waste in molasses distillery slop, and-about 8,000\r\ntons in Steffens waste water at the beet-sugar refineries of the\r\ncountry. Kelp and alunite are available in quantities sufficient to\r\ncontinue to yield a substantial production. Enormous quantities of\r\nleucite lava, carrying 10 per cent. of potash in an insoluble silicate\r\nform; greensand carrying 6 to 7 per cent. of insoluble potash; sericite\r\nwith from 7 to 12 per cent., and feldspar with similar content, are\r\navailable as raw materials of production if satisfactory commercial\r\nprocesses can be developed. Thus potential supplies of potash in the\r\nUnited States are practically inexhaustible. The future of the American\r\npotash industry, therefore, depends on the development of processes or\r\nmethods of separation economical enough to permit the domestic product\r\nto compete with imported potash.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe potash deposits of northern Germany lie in the midst of a series\r\nof formations known as the Zechstein, the geologic age of which is\r\nPermian. Both the Alsatian and Spanish deposits are found in Oligocene\r\nTertiary rocks, although the deposits were not necessarily strictly\r\nsynchronous in origin. The Galician deposits are described as of lower\r\nMiocene (Tertiary) age. These are the principal known bedded deposits\r\nof potash in the world, for which as a class the distinction as to\r\ngeologic age seems to have a special significance. The association\r\nof potash with the large salt and gypsum deposits of the world seems\r\nfor some reason to have been exceptional in geologic history. But the\r\ndetermination that these somewhat analogous occurrences have been\r\nformed at various times and places is a good basis for expecting that\r\nsimilar deposits may yet be discovered elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN COMMERCIAL PRACTICE\r\n\r\nBefore the war the world’s consumption of potash was practically\r\nthe measure of the German production, the statistics of which are\r\navailable in considerable detail. In round numbers, Germany produced\r\nabout 10,000,000 metric tons of potash salts, averaging about 10\r\nper cent. of K₂O, of which she used more than 60 per cent. at home,\r\nand exported about 25 per cent. to the United States. For two years\r\na very small production from Alsace had been lumped with the rest.\r\nShortly after the outbreak of the war the German government placed an\r\nembargo on the export of potash, presumably in the hope of thereby\r\ninjuring crop production of the Allies, and possibly because of the\r\nsmall military significance that it has. The production of potash\r\nin Germany was continued, however, at practically the same rate as\r\nbefore the war, the portion formerly exported being distributed for\r\nfertilizer use at home. This naturally gave a tremendous stimulus to\r\nthe efforts of other countries to develop sources of potash. Although\r\nno huge natural resources comparable to the already known deposits\r\nwere discovered, the efforts nevertheless had a reasonable amount of\r\nsuccess, so that the world has not suffered in any vital way because\r\nof deprivation of potash. The cost of potash in the United States and\r\nits Allied countries increased to as much as ten times the pre-war\r\nprice, but the supply was sufficient to meet all of the most pressing\r\nneeds. Many possibilities for production from various sources have been\r\nopened, for which it is still too soon to predict the final outcome. It\r\nappears that a number of these new enterprises have entered the field\r\npermanently, although there will necessarily be some uncertainty during\r\nthe period of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe ceding of Alsace to France, which is discussed in a subsequent\r\nparagraph, undoubtedly entails the largest and most significant change\r\nin the commercial situation as regards the world market for potash.\r\nA possibility of production from the deposits in eastern Spain holds\r\nsimilar although more remote significance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe output of potash during 1917, summarized by countries according to\r\nthe best available data, is as follows:\r\n\r\nTABLE 65.--WORLD PRODUCTION OF POTASH IN 1917\r\n\r\n  -------------+--------------------------------+----------+-----------\r\n               |                                |Production|  Average\r\n               |                                |  (short  |content K₂O\r\n    Country    |        Source of data          |   tons)  |(per cent.)\r\n  -------------+--------------------------------+----------+-----------\r\n  Germany      |Kalisyndikat statistics.        | 9,853,171|  11.2\r\n  Alsace       |(Included under Germany.)       |          |\r\n  United States|U.

In 1918\r\nthere were 209 mines capable of producing, as indicated by the\r\nKalisyndikat list assigning quotas for anticipated production from the\r\nindividual mines for the year.\r\n\r\nMost of these mines are privately owned under a variety of laws in the\r\nseveral German states and provinces. Originally the developments are\r\nsaid to have taken place under various local regulations; for example,\r\nin Hanover the mining rights belonged to the property holders, in\r\nSaxony the prospecting rights were free and the mining concessions\r\nbelonged to the first discoverer of the deposits without regard to the\r\nowner of the surface soil, and in Anhalt mining was at first declared\r\nto be a state monopoly, which was later contracted to a few private\r\ncompanies. Some properties are, however, owned and operated by the\r\nstate. The Prussian government owns mines at Stassfurt, Bleicherode,\r\nand Vienenburg; the Duchy of Anhalt has large works at Leopoldshall;\r\nand the Duchy of Brunswick holds interest in some potash properties.\r\n\r\nTwo instances of participation by American concerns in the German\r\nindustry are known. The International Agricultural Corporation, an\r\nAmerican company organized in 1909, was for a time the owner of all\r\nthe capital stock of the Sollstedt Works in Germany. Later, one-half\r\ninterest in this American corporation was transferred to the Kaliwerke\r\nAschersleben, another German concern, under conditions which seemed\r\nto complicate the matter of ownership. The Virginia-Carolina Chemical\r\nCo., of Richmond, Virginia, is reported to have purchased a controlling\r\ninterest in the Einigkeit Works, presumably by a direct cash\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nUnder a law of the German Reichstag, known as the potash act of the\r\n25th of May, 1884, an obligatory control of the potash industry in\r\nGermany was ordained. A common agency, known as the Kalisyndikat, was\r\nestablished, to represent all of the mines, with power to control the\r\nopening of new mines, the output of each mine, and the selling prices\r\nof potash salts. The industry has thus become a trust re-enforced by\r\nthe German government, although the private ownership of individual\r\nproperties remains. This syndicate differs from an American syndicate\r\nin that it is formed for a limited period of time, in the present case\r\n5 years, and its working capital is small, only enough to provide\r\nfor the actual working needs of the organization. The object of the\r\nsyndicate is to prevent disastrous competition, to insure that the\r\nsupply will conform to the demand, and that reasonable profits may be\r\nobtained by producers.\r\n\r\nThe mines or works composing the potash syndicate, as with most mining\r\nsyndicates in Germany, may be either of the limited liability sort, the\r\nshares of which are not assessable, or those whose capital stock is\r\ndivided into shares called “kuxe,” which are assessable at anytime and\r\nare of unlimited liability. The shares of both kinds are dealt in on\r\nthe exchanges in the large cities of Germany.\r\n\r\nEach company that is a member of a German syndicate has its\r\nrepresentative on the board of management of the trust, and\r\nthis board fixes the quota of production allowed each mine, and\r\ngenerally administers the affairs of the entire combination under\r\nits constitution and by-laws (statuten).[156] The constitution and\r\nby-laws must be signed by each concern entering the syndicate and\r\nthe provisions therein contained strictly observed under penalties\r\nenforceable in courts of law.\r\n\r\n  [156] Abstract from Daily Consular and Trade Reports, No. 265, vol.\r\n  4, Nov. 11, 1911, p. 760.\r\n\r\nThe weak point in this form of organization is the dissension that\r\noften arises over the quotas allowed the different members. Each\r\ncompany wants as large an allotment as it can get. Upon the expiration\r\nof the life of a syndicate there is always uncertainty as to whether\r\nit will be renewed, owing to competition among the various constituent\r\nfirms.\r\n\r\nBefore the war, under the terms of the contracts of the five large\r\nfertilizer companies with the German potash syndicate, one-half of the\r\nmaximum discount allowed was deducted from the amount of the invoice\r\ncovering each shipment, and the remainder was paid to the buyer at the\r\nend of each half year, provided he made a statement in writing to the\r\nsyndicate to the effect that he had purchased his entire requirements\r\nof potash from the syndicate. Thus by allowing maximum discounts to\r\nthe large buyers, and preventing them from dealing in potash from\r\nany source except the syndicate, this provision aimed to stifle the\r\ndevelopment of any competitive sources of supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Alsace.=--The potash deposits of Alsace were developed under the\r\nGerman mining law for Alsace-Lorraine of December 16, 1843, amended\r\nJuly 14, 1908, with specific reference to potash. Since the armistice\r\nthe German mines have been operated under the sequestration régime,\r\nunder charge of the French military authorities, directed by the\r\nministry of industrial reconstruction in France. Now that the treaty of\r\npeace has been ratified by Germany, Alsace may be regarded as having\r\nformally and finally passed into the possession of France, and with\r\nthis naturally the political and commercial control of the Alsatian\r\npotash deposits. It remains therefore for the French Parliament to\r\ndetermine what the final disposition of the former German ownership of\r\nthese properties shall be, and questions such as nationalization or\r\nFrench-Alsatian control were being discussed in the summer of 1920.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the concessions in the Alsatian potash field had been\r\ngranted to German interests, the development was started by Alsatians,\r\nand two of the concessions are in French-Alsatian ownership. These\r\nhave not been and probably will not be altered, unless they are to\r\nenter some voluntary combination.\r\n\r\nAn agency for the sale and distribution of the Alsatian potash has been\r\narranged in the United States, and for the present at least the product\r\nis coming in direct competition with the salts from the older German\r\nmines.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spain.=--The potash deposits recently discovered in the provinces\r\nof Barcelona and Lerida, of Cataluña, in eastern Spain, are subject\r\nto special regulations of the Spanish government. A large area of\r\nconcessions already granted to private interests covers a considerable\r\npart of the field outlined by exploratory borings. Operations on\r\nthese concessions are permitted, but the state reserves the right to\r\nsubordinate the exploitation to the interests of the country, and\r\nimpose special conditions in favor of the consumption of the potash\r\nproduced in Spain. Recently, unexplored state lands have been opened,\r\nby royal decree, to bids for exploration and lease. The scheme follows\r\nin general the plan of governmental control of the German potash\r\nindustry. According to it, all concessions for the working and sale\r\nof salts are subject in many details to governmental control. Among\r\nother conditions, working must be continuous save in certain exempted\r\ncircumstances; the state shall fix annually the home and export prices,\r\nas well as the maximum and minimum quota for each mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Countries.=--Before the war, the Austrian potash syndicate,\r\nwhich consisted of the Austrian government and a group of capitalists,\r\ncontrolled the deposits near Kalusz, in Galicia. No specific\r\ngovernmental regulation is reported for the minor operations connected\r\nwith the production of potash in other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nMore than 90 per cent. of the potash handled in the world’s commerce\r\nis used as a fertilizer. The rest is used as a chemical in various\r\nindustries, chief among which are the manufacture of matches, certain\r\nkinds of glass and soap, and the better grades of black powder. The\r\nuses specifically mentioned in this paragraph are essential, as no\r\nsatisfactory substitutes are known.\r\n\r\nUp to 1914 practically all of the potash used in the world came\r\nfrom the deposits in northern Germany, which are substantially\r\ninexhaustible. Next in importance are the deposits of Alsace, which\r\ncontain enough potash to meet the world’s present demands for almost\r\n300 years. Other resources are known in Spain, Galicia, Abyssinia, the\r\nnitrate beds of Chile, and in deposits in the United States, but it is\r\ntoo early to predict with assurance what part they will play in the\r\nexpansion of the potash industry.\r\n\r\nGermany will no longer be able to maintain a world monopoly of the\r\npotash market. The passing of control of the important resources in\r\nAlsace from Germany to France foreshadows competition from recognized\r\nadequate sources of supply. There are many other possibilities, the\r\nmere potentialities of which are sufficient to restrain any tendency\r\nto unreasonable extortion by those who control the German fields.\r\nMoreover, attention has been so directed to the desirability of\r\ndeveloping independent sources, and so much able technical talent\r\nis now being devoted toward bringing successful issue from the many\r\nundertakings in progress, that it is very unlikely that this country,\r\nor any other, will in the future be dependent on one or two arbitrarily\r\nhandled monopolies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nNITROGEN\r\n\r\nBY CHESTER G. GILBERT\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF NITROGEN\r\n\r\nPlant life requires nitrogen and gets it in the normal cycle of events.\r\nBut when the occasion calls for stimulating the growth of plant life by\r\nfeeding, by soil fertilization in other words, nitrogen in available\r\nform is indispensable. Further down along the channels of food supply\r\nit exercises another and equally important function in providing the\r\nchemical (ammonia) around which the modern practice of refrigeration is\r\nbuilt. Likewise, the chemistry of explosives is basically the chemistry\r\nof nitrogen compounds. Nor is this all, for chemical operations in\r\ngeneral--hence research and industrial chemistry in general--involve\r\nthe employment of nitrogen compounds. Such, in brief, is its status. On\r\neach of three major counts, the interests of food production, of food\r\ndistribution, and of national defense, it is indispensable; and of no\r\nless consequence is the retinue of less conspicuous agencies serving\r\nthe interests of chemistry at every turn.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe development of fixed nitrogen sources is conditioned by three\r\nsimple chemical facts. With these three simple facts in mind the rest\r\nfollows largely as a matter of inference. The facts are:\r\n\r\nThat under all ordinary conditions of temperature and pressure, free\r\nnitrogen is a gas.\r\n\r\nThat it is extremely inert and indisposed to participate with other\r\nelements in the formation of chemical compounds.\r\n\r\nThat such combinations when they do occur are characteristically\r\nsoluble.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these three governing principles, along with its\r\nrelationship to organic matter, as alluded to under the preceding\r\ncaption, nitrogen has four habits of occurrence, worth considering as\r\nat least potential sources of supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Atmospheric Nitrogen.=--Being indisposed to participate in chemical\r\ncombinations, nitrogen in the course of world evolution was left\r\nlargely to itself; and since in the free state it is normally gaseous,\r\nit established its home in the atmosphere. Thus it comes about that\r\nthe atmosphere today is approximately four-fifths nitrogen gas, and\r\nafter all is said and done the atmosphere is bound to constitute the\r\ngreat source to which we must turn for our supplies. With a source\r\nso boundlessly ever-present, the question of supply at first glance\r\nlooks simple enough. But atmospheric nitrogen, it must be remembered,\r\nis nitrogen uncombined, and the demand is not for nitrogen itself\r\nbut for nitrogen-bearing compounds. Once in a state of combination,\r\nit may remain so indefinitely, and the form of combination may be\r\nchanged more or less readily to suit the demand. Before it can be\r\nput to use, however, it must be induced to surrender its gaseous\r\nfreedom and affix itself in some such state of combination. The free\r\nnitrogen must become fixed nitrogen--hence the terms fixed nitrogen,\r\nnitrogen fixation, and the like in common use. Toward this end it must\r\nbe induced to do what it has not seen fit to do of its own accord,\r\nand the very trait of aloofness responsible for the inexhaustible\r\nresources of atmospheric nitrogen stands as an obstacle opposing their\r\nutilization. The obstacle has not proven insuperable, as will appear\r\nlater; but it is sufficiently a source of trouble even to this day, so\r\nthat the fixed-nitrogen situation may with peculiar appropriateness be\r\ncharacterized as distinctly in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nitrate Ore Deposits.=--The disposition on the part of nitrogen to\r\ntake up its abode in the atmosphere has an obvious result in minimizing\r\nthe development of mineral nitrates. Atmospheric nitrogen is not\r\nentirely stagnant, however. Natural processes are constantly at work\r\neffecting substantial fixation. The processes are not obtrusively\r\nenergetic, as in the case of atmospheric oxygen, whose fixation\r\nprocesses constitute the ever-present phenomena of oxidation. Still, in\r\nvarious ways, the most prominent among which is undoubtedly a form of\r\nbacterial action, nitrification and the building up of nitrate minerals\r\neverywhere in the soil goes quietly forward, and their concentration\r\nin ore deposits of more or less plentiful occurrence is thus to be\r\nlooked for in the natural course of geologic events. In attempting to\r\ntrace their further course, however, we are confronted at the outset\r\nby the principle of solubility. The nitrate minerals are in the nature\r\nof soluble salts. They leach from the immediate environment in which\r\nthey form, just as do the soluble minerals in general. Mostly these\r\nlatter are carried in solution to the ocean, adding themselves to\r\nits salinity; but under exceptional conditions of topography, where\r\nthe drainage feeds into land-locked basins, the water finds itself\r\nentrapped with no avenue of escape except through evaporation. Here\r\nthe salts accumulate, become concentrated, and finally give rise to\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nThis, in outline, is the course set for the soluble mineral salts as\r\na class, and it is along this course that we must expect to trace the\r\ndevelopment of nitrate ore deposits. But the ocean, with its 3¹⁄₂ per\r\ncent. of salinity, has only traces of nitrate minerals; and the same is\r\ntrue for the waters of land-locked basins, in all the various stages\r\nof concentration. Their solubility is such that they can not have\r\nescaped in substantial form along the way. There is only one inference\r\nto be drawn. Evidently the inherent trait of aloofness is not lost to\r\nnitrogen when it does combine. The compounds do not survive for any\r\nlength of time, but undergo dissociation, releasing their nitrogen\r\nand returning it to the atmosphere even as other processes are slowly\r\nwithdrawing it from the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWith this the eternal cycle is closed for nitrogen, and closed without\r\napparent provision for any considerable side-tracking, such as would\r\nbe required in the building up of ore deposits. So much for the rule;\r\nnow as to the exceptions: Mostly they are of minor consequence. Pockety\r\nenrichments in the soil are common. Accumulations tend to build up\r\nin caves, and may even grow to be of consequence in a small way, as\r\nduring the Civil War, when they helped materially toward relieving the\r\nnitrogen troubles of the blockaded Confederacy. In arid country, too,\r\nthey not infrequently assume sufficient prominence to be of interest,\r\nespecially at the hands of the promoter. Finally, there are the Chilean\r\nnitrate fields, which far from being of minor consequence, go to the\r\nother extreme in catering to the needs of the entire world.\r\n\r\nThese occurrences, especially the last named, have served to keep\r\nalive the hope that others of economic importance await discovery.\r\nThe Chilean deposits alone among them all deserve more than passing\r\nnotice. The origin of these deposits is veiled in uncertainty. Just why\r\nor how the natural forces, which elsewhere as a matter of universal\r\nobservation have been seen to oppose both the formation of nitrogen\r\nsalts and the accumulation of such as do manage to form, should have\r\nfailed in this particular instance remains wholly conjectural. A\r\nconclusive explanation would be of the utmost value in determining\r\nthe likelihood of similar occurrences elsewhere. But none has been\r\nforthcoming, and nothing is to be gained to the present purpose from\r\nstopping to inquire into the plausibility of the various attempts that\r\nhave been made. Confronting us on the one hand are the evidences of a\r\nnitrogen cycle established, seemingly, without affording any visible\r\nloophole of opportunity for the accumulation of extensive deposits;\r\non the other hand stands the bare fact of enormous deposition. This\r\nfact of existence unquestionably carries with it the possibility of\r\nduplication elsewhere. However, the fact of occurrence merely suggests\r\nthe possibility, but does not determine the chances of recurrence.\r\nThese are recorded in the prevalence of the conditions requisite to\r\nextensive deposition. In the case of nitrogen they are unique beyond\r\ncomprehension, and the prospect of recurrence is to precisely the same\r\ndegree unlikely. Accordingly, to all practical purposes, a review of\r\nthe world’s nitrate ore deposits, both real and potential, resolves\r\nitself down to a review of the Chilean occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe Chilean nitrate fields lie in the arid valley basin to the east of\r\nthe lofty coast range and just south of the present Peruvian boundary\r\nline. They do not occur as a single expansive area of deposition, but\r\nas deposits scattered here and there along the desert land at the\r\nbases of the mountain slopes. The formation consists of a conglomerate\r\nor breccia of rock material from the adjacent slopes, cemented with\r\na mixture of soluble salts in which sodium chloride, common salt, is\r\nthe dominant member, with sodium nitrate ranking second. The formation\r\nis called _caliche_. It lies for the most part just below the surface\r\nof the ground and varies from a few feet to many feet in thickness.\r\nOnly in scattered patches is the caliche high enough in content of\r\nsodium nitrate to warrant treatment. These patches are sought out and\r\nexcavated, and the picked ore is loaded in carts, which haul it to the\r\nextraction plant for treatment. Here the soluble salts as a whole are\r\nextracted in solution, and the nitrate in turn is segregated from the\r\nother salts by crystallization. Aside from haulage, hand labor is used\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nThe caliche regarded as worth treating contains not less than 10\r\nper cent. nitrate and ranges up to 25 per cent. and over, with an\r\naverage of around 18 per cent. The product marketed is of two general\r\ngrades--the ordinary, listed as 95 per cent. nitrate, and the refined,\r\na guaranteed 96 per cent. nitrate, low in sodium chloride. The\r\ndeposits have been worked more or less consistently, and with steadily\r\nincreasing output, since about 1830. Their importance in the scheme of\r\nnitrogen supply may be gathered from Figures 16 to 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Organic Nitrogen.=--Another source of fixed nitrogen grows out of\r\nits relationship to life processes, and is consequent on the very\r\nrequirements of organized society which earlier it is called upon to\r\nassist in meeting. In other words, fixed nitrogen participates in the\r\nmaterial cycle of life. It enters into the material demands of life for\r\nfood, and it is yielded up among the material discards available to\r\nabsorption. All manner of residuum, animal and vegetable alike, affords\r\nat least a potential source of fixed-nitrogen supply. Some of these are\r\nin service; others for one reason or another are not. Prominent among\r\nthose in the former class are animal excreta, the so-called tankage\r\nfrom animal rendering plants, slaughter-house refuse, fish scrap, and\r\nvegetable-product refinery refuse. Most prominent among those still\r\nlargely potential are sewage and garbage disposal.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen from these organic sources does not appear on the market\r\nas such. Instead, the products enter in bulk into the make-up of\r\nfertilizer. They are of miscellaneous character, and only part of what\r\nis contributed collects to pass through industrial channels where\r\nits flow may be measured. The industrial flow goes on record and the\r\nrecords are available, but even here the nitrogen content has never\r\nbeen systematically computed, so the record is inadequate. For the\r\nrest, the portion that does not reach the channels of industry, there\r\nis nothing whatever in the way of data to go by. Taken all in all,\r\nthen, the significance of the organic nitrogen resources is largely\r\nconjectural. This is unfortunate. Approximate figures covering the use\r\nof organic nitrogen would be of value in various connections, as in\r\nthe interests of intelligent allocation in times of nitrogen shortage,\r\nas helping to determine the extent to which the growing demands of\r\nagriculture incident to the growth of population may be discounted from\r\nthe consequent expansion of scavenging opportunity, or as affording a\r\nbasis for estimating the very considerable influence of motorization\r\ntoward increasing the demand for chemically prepared fertilizers.\r\n\r\nAs things stand, all such questions of relationship lead only to\r\nprofitless speculation. Even the relative importance of the organic\r\nsources as a whole in the economics of nitrogen supply is uncertain.\r\nWhat they have to offer of undeveloped reserves, now taking the form of\r\nwasteful sanitation procedure, will be taken up later. Under existing\r\nconditions, it is probably fair to assume that 40 to 50 per cent. of\r\nthe nitrogen normally put to use in the United States is organically\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Carboniferous Deposits.=--Nitrogen in its organic relationships is\r\nbound up with carbon, of which organic matter is largely composed, and\r\nthe bond between the two is entirely disestablished only as the carbon\r\nitself loses its substantial form through oxidation. In consequence\r\nof this enduring alliance, nitrogen is characteristically present in\r\ncarboniferous deposits, a form of occurrence giving rise to still\r\nanother, a fourth type of nitrogen resource. Coal and oil-shale loom up\r\nas the outstanding representatives of this class. In each, the nitrogen\r\ncontent is variable, but amounts to 1 per cent. or over. With so low a\r\npercentage of nitrogen, it goes without saying that neither of these is\r\nto be regarded as a possible source of direct supply. The cost would\r\nbe prohibitive, even under the stress of the most extreme emergency.\r\nThe nitrogen in a coal bed or an oil-shale formation is as worthless\r\nas the iron in any ordinary rock. But coal has other uses, and so has\r\noil shale, or at least will shortly. The nitrogen does not have to\r\nbe extracted; it gets released incidentally, and when its release is\r\neffected under conditions that prevent its escape, the result is a\r\nproductive nitrogen resource. The nitrogen from this type of resource\r\nis in the form of ammonia, the relative importance of which is shown in\r\nFigures 16 to 18 and Table 66.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ASPECTS OF CONTROL\r\n\r\nSuch is the nature of the nitrogen resources. The resource situation\r\nas a whole is represented graphically in Figure 15. None other can\r\ncompare with it for inclusiveness. Its sources are animal, vegetable,\r\nmineral, and atmospheric, which is to say, universal; and out of this\r\nunparalleled diversity has grown an industrial development as complex\r\nas it is diversified, and, incidentally, in view of its bearing on food\r\nand munitions supply, as important as it is complex. The situation at\r\nbest can be but imperfectly grasped, for it has been but inadequately\r\nstudied. In transgressing all set rules of resource occurrence, it\r\ntransgresses the limits set for organized investigation. Geologists\r\nhave studied one phase of the situation, electrochemists another,\r\nsanitation experts another, and so on; and the various commercial\r\ninterests involved have seen to the giving of publicity where publicity\r\nwould do the most good.\r\n\r\nTABLE 66.--STATISTICS OF NITROGEN PRODUCTION\r\n\r\n  ----+-----------+--------------------------\r\n      |  Organic  |   Chemical nitrogen\r\n      | nitrogen  +-------------------------+\r\n      +-----------+          Sodium         |\r\n      |           |         nitrate         |\r\n      |   Dried   +---------+-----+---------+\r\n      |   blood;

Figures are thousands of tons.]\r\n\r\nBut an investigation working on the basis of geology alone can not cope\r\nwith the situation; neither can one on the basis of technology alone;\r\nnor one on the basis of organic chemistry, or bacteriology alone; nor\r\nyet one prepared to employ any or all of these means, but only with a\r\nview to some special end. Nor yet again does the discordant grinding\r\nof many axes make a noise from which it is possible to gather an\r\nadequate comprehension. The nitrogen situation has been inadequately\r\ntreated because it has been inadequately studied. It has been studied\r\npiecemeal, always through the medium of limited means or with some\r\nspecial end in view. It is not a series of technical problems in\r\ngeology, in bacteriology, in fixation, in munitions supply, and the\r\nlike. It has to do with a composite economic structure, building for\r\nthe dependence of society in peace and war alike. Until treated as\r\nsuch, the needs of the situation are bound to be inadequately met and\r\nits control a matter of perilous uncertainty. The present discussion\r\nmakes no pretense of supplying this deficiency or of doing much of\r\nanything more than to show the extent to which it exists.\r\n\r\nFigure 15 is designed to show not so much the scope of the resources\r\nas their composite functioning in the system of nitrogen supply. The\r\ninfluence of geography in the control of resources so universally\r\navailable is bound to be subordinate. True, it enables Chile to\r\nexercise monopolistic control over the mineral nitrate supply, but\r\nit leaves the way open for the development of others; and while\r\nacknowledging the fullness of our dependence, as shown in Figures 16 to\r\n18 and Table 66, we must not lose sight of the fact that it is so not\r\nof necessity, but because we have been content to leave it so rather\r\nthan undertake to develop supplies of our own. So, too, with political\r\ncontrol; what is gained in one direction is, potentially at least,\r\noffset by the possibilities opening up in others. Control of the sea\r\ngives a control over the mineral nitrate supply as absolute as that in\r\nChile’s territorial monopoly. Yet in the recent great war, Germany,\r\nwith her shipping obliterated at the outset, was not made to suffer\r\nmaterially from a nitrogen shortage. Britain’s supremacy of the sea\r\nwent for naught. In the years before the war the force due in season\r\nto exercise control over the nitrate supply served only to stimulate\r\nthe development of domestic potentialities, with the result that when\r\nthe test came Germany’s proved actually to be the more advantageous\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nSo it goes. Control over the nitrogen resources themselves is\r\nimpossible. They are too universally available. Their only\r\nsusceptibility to control is in the shaping of their development. This\r\nis too important a matter to be disregarded with impunity and left\r\nto develop without guidance. The modern nation that does so courts\r\nthe irrepressible disaster of a nation at war but bereft of the means\r\nnot only of waging war but of maintaining a food supply as well. From\r\nFigure 16 may be gathered the quality of attention given the matter of\r\ndomestic supply by the different nations immediately before and during\r\nthe war. Germany, it will be observed, heeded the call to give the\r\nmatter special attention well before the war and had an independent\r\nsystem of supply developed in readiness, drawing upon the atmosphere\r\nand coal-product nitrogen with the results already chronicled. Great\r\nBritain did not ignore the importance of nitrogen, but placed reliance\r\non her supremacy of the sea and paid little or no attention to\r\nshaping the course of developments. Nor did its importance go unheeded\r\nelsewhere abroad, and the foothold gained for fixation in France,\r\nItaly, Austria, Russia, and Japan was, it is safe to say, not wholly\r\nautomatic. The United States alone among the great nations up to the\r\noutbreak of hostilities in Europe in 1914 neglected to take any special\r\nprecautions whatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Nitrogen developments in the United States. 1.\r\nWartime expansion for munitions manufacture. 2.

Developments indicated for coke-oven recovery.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Nitrogen developments for the world,\r\n1900-1918.]\r\n\r\nThe war, when it came, far exceeded all expectations as to magnitude,\r\nand so in consequence did the demand for specially developed nitrogen\r\nsupplies. To meet the emergency, some could be deflected from\r\nagricultural channels, but nothing like what was required, for food\r\nwas just as important as munitions. The organic sources offered no\r\nhelp. Rather they were a hindrance; for organic nitrogen, broadly\r\nspeaking, comes as a by-product of sanitation, and as such develops as\r\nthe outgrowth of civilization’s refinements. There was a measurable\r\nresponse from the carboniferous sources, but these could not be made\r\nto meet the emergency, for, being of by-product order, the supply\r\nis determined not in response to the demand for nitrogen but for the\r\nmajor products. Dependence on the native mineral source in Chile was\r\nout of the question, or at least precarious for any country except\r\nGreat Britain. Accordingly, of the four great sources it remained\r\nfor atmospheric nitrogen to meet the emergency. Thus, the war in\r\nbringing the nitrogen situation emphatically to the fore, communicated\r\npractically the whole weight of its tremendous impetus to development\r\nin the one direction of fixation. The result is shown in Figure 18.\r\n\r\nRoused by the nightmare of war in 1914, even the United States awoke\r\nto the perils if not to the real needs of the domestic situation. It\r\nis a striking and highly significant fact that despite the fundamental\r\nimportance of nitrogen, the awakening found us absolutely without\r\nany formulated program of action, even military or agricultural, let\r\nalone anything of comprehensive economic scope. A hysterical effort at\r\nimprovising a program ensued. We were not yet in the war, and public\r\ninterest was just roused to the gullible stage. The opportunity for\r\nprivate pickings from public favors was too promising to go by the\r\nboard. The only prospect opening up lay in the direction of fixation\r\ndevelopments, and fixation in the hands of the promoter is one of the\r\nmost appealing propositions imaginable. Its major requirements are\r\nnitrogen and power. With the former inexhaustibly present in the air\r\nand the latter inexhaustibly available in the wasting waterpowers of\r\nthe country, nothing it would seem, could offer greater promise. Add\r\nto this the reflection that cheap nitrogen means cheap fertilizer, and\r\ncheap fertilizer means lowered cost of foodstuffs, and the proposition\r\nbroadcasted over the country is complete. Out of the confusion of\r\ninterests, public, political, and private, a program was finally\r\nevolved, following our entry into the war, calling for the erection of\r\na series of fixation plants with an aggregate producing capacity of\r\naround 85,000 tons of fixed nitrogen annually. For the present is must\r\nsuffice to say that the war ended before any of these had reached the\r\nproducing stage, and the United States, like Great Britain, depended on\r\nimports.\r\n\r\nThe charts comprising Figure 16 show the influence of the war in the\r\ndevelopment of nitrogen distributively among the countries concerned.\r\nThe Scandinavian developments, while actuated from wholly commercial\r\nmotives, were so largely influenced by the politically stimulated\r\nmarket that they may well enough be included in that general class\r\nof politically controlled developments. The same is true for the\r\nneutral countries in general. Figure 18, based on the best information\r\nobtainable, is designed to bring out the collective influence of\r\nthe war in contributing to the world’s supply. Organic nitrogen is\r\ndisregarded both because it involves too many uncertainties and because\r\nthe wartime emphasis was all in the direction of chemical nitrogen.\r\nThis figure takes into consideration only the actual production and\r\nleaves out what was in process of construction when the war ended.\r\nAccordingly, while in one respect it overrates the effect of the war\r\nby including strictly commercial operations that very possibly might\r\nhave transpired anyway, in another it underrates the situation by\r\ndisregarding developments like those in this country. The best that can\r\nbe done is to consider these as balancing each other, which, all things\r\nconsidered, is probably fair enough for all practical purposes. Taken\r\non this basis, the net effect of the war, it will be observed, was to\r\nswell the production of fixed nitrogen some 40 or 50 per cent. above\r\nthe figures indicated for the normal rate of expansion.\r\n\r\nThus the wartime shortage was made up; but all this is history. Now\r\nthat the war is over, the question arises as to whether the world\r\nis due to face the situation in reverse. In making ready for war,\r\nand finally in meeting its demands, has the world been building up\r\na 50 per cent. over-production beyond the needs of peace? Offhand,\r\nthe answer would seem to be in the affirmative, but the question\r\nis not one that can be answered offhand. Agriculture is capable of\r\nabsorbing an indefinite amount of nitrogen, and the war has wrought a\r\nlasting change in the agricultural situation. The changed agricultural\r\nconditions make room for much, perhaps for all, of the increment to\r\nnitrogen production. The development cannot be sustained, however,\r\non its present arbitrary preferential basis of political expediency.\r\nLeast of all can it be sustained on that basis in this country.\r\nNormally, we do not and can not be made to think in terms of war. The\r\nreason is evident enough, and its recurrent force is already apparent.\r\nDistasteful as the fact may be in some of its extremes of application,\r\nthe only rational procedure is to accept it and fashion our measures of\r\neconomic preparedness so that the normal activities of peace will keep\r\nour economic forces exercised and in trim for the test of war. It was\r\nrecognized all along before the war that without an assured source of\r\nnitrogen supply, our system of defense was hollow; but we succeeded in\r\nbuilding up no means of supply in direct response to political needs.\r\nWe managed to get comfortably started during the war, but it remains\r\nto be seen to what extent this artificially nourished development is\r\nfitted to withstand the bitter strife of competition ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL ASPECTS OF NITROGEN CONTROL\r\n\r\nFree nitrogen, it will be recalled, has no economic significance.\r\nTo be available in the industrial arts it must be in a state of\r\nchemical combination. The form of compound is of secondary importance,\r\nsince this may be modified more or less readily to suit the need,\r\nbut its value is conditioned in terms of its availability in the\r\nform of nitrogen compounds. In consequence, the several sources are\r\nclassifiable industrially under three heads:\r\n\r\nNatural compounds--nitrogen occurring naturally in the form of\r\nmarketable compounds.\r\n\r\nBy-product compounds--nitrogen rendered available incidentally in the\r\ncourse of operations otherwise directed.\r\n\r\nFixation compounds--nitrogen whose availability is dependent on special\r\nfixation treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Natural Compounds.=--Chile nitrate is the outstanding representative\r\nof the natural compounds. The guano industry, or what there is left of\r\nit, and a few other odds and ends of production from organic sources,\r\nbelong here as well, but their combined output is so relatively small\r\nthat the Chilean industry comprises what amounts to a monopoly of the\r\nnatural resources. It is not operated as such, however, but by private\r\ncapital, which owns and operates the oficinas, paying the Chilean\r\ngovernment a royalty or export tax amounting to about $11.20 per ton.\r\nBritish and Chilean interests share about equally in making up the far\r\ngreater part of the capital invested. The balance is largely German and\r\nAmerican. The total capitalization in 1909 amounted to approximately\r\n$134,000,000, representing an actual valuation of about $30,000,000.\r\nVarious efforts on the part of the commercial interests involved to\r\neffect combinations for the purpose of stabilizing production have\r\nbeen attempted, but have not been entirely successful, and the general\r\ntendency has all along been toward overproduction.\r\n\r\nThe operations, as already outlined on page 424, are crude, and the\r\ncost of production is correspondingly high, amounting to around $25 to\r\n$30 per ton at seaboard, inclusive of the $11 export tax. The nitrate\r\nis marketed largely through commission houses. The American situation\r\nis mostly in the hands of three companies, W. R. Grace & Co., E. I. du\r\nPont de Nemours Powder Co., and Wessel, Duval & Co. The magnitude of\r\nthe Chilean industry as a whole and its relative importance are shown\r\nin Figures 16 to 18 and Table 66.\r\n\r\n\r\n=By-product Compounds.=--To this class of compounds belong, with\r\nthe few minor exceptions already noted, the nitrogenous products of\r\norganic derivation as a whole, and those from carboniferous sources\r\nsuch as coal and oil shale. From the former source comes a miscellany\r\nof organic refuse resulting from activities dealing with animal,\r\nvegetable, and fish products, and carrying nitrogen in the form of\r\norganic ammoniates commonly left as such for use in agriculture. From\r\nthe latter the nitrogen recovered is all chemical nitrogen in the\r\nform of ammonia or ammonium salts, mostly ammonium sulphate, and is\r\navailable in all capacities.\r\n\r\nThe organic production is impossible of definite analysis from any\r\nangle. The lack of systematically compiled records, and back of that\r\nthe miscellaneous largely decentralized character of the output,\r\nalong with the fact that the producing costs are for the most part\r\nindistinguishable, leaves altogether too much to the imagination. Much\r\nof the supply is derived from connections of sanitation, especially of\r\nlocal sanitation, such as the rural practice, for which there is no\r\nmeasure whatever. Another prominent source of supply is represented in\r\nwhat is known as tankage, the refuse from animal-rendering plants; but\r\nhere too the issue is lost in the scattering of the production, the\r\nindefiniteness of composition, and the fact that not all of the product\r\nis used as a source of nitrogen, some of it going into the preparation\r\nof animal food. The same is true of cottonseed meal and various other\r\nless prominent forms of organic waste resulting from industrial\r\nactivities. Fish scrap and slaughter-house refuse from meat packing\r\nalso contribute prominently and at the same time rather more definitely\r\nto the supply of agricultural nitrogen; but even here adequate figures\r\nare not available. The Federal Trade Commission undertook to analyze\r\nthe 1913 consumption, with results given in the following table:\r\n\r\nESTIMATED CONSUMPTION OF NITROGEN IN COMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS FOR THE\r\nYEAR 1913\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n                     |Fertilizing|Consumption|  Content  |   Units\r\n        Materials    | substance |  (tons)   |(per cent.)|consumed[157]\r\n  -------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n  Nitrate of soda    |  Ammonia  |  260,000  |    18.0   |  4,680,000\r\n  Sulphate of ammonia|  Ammonia  |  130,000  |    25.0   |  3,250,000\r\n  Cyanamid           |  Ammonia  |   15,488  |    18.0   |    278,784\r\n  High-grade tankage |  Ammonia  |  210,000  |    10.5   |  2,205,000\r\n  Concentrated       |  Ammonia  |   18,351  |    14.5   |    266,090\r\n  Dried blood        |  Ammonia  |   40,000  |    17.0   |    680,000\r\n  Dried fish scrap   |  Ammonia  |   50,000  |    11.0   |    550,000\r\n  Cottonseed meal    |  Ammonia  |  660,000  |     7.5   |    950,000\r\n  -------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n    Total            |    ...    |    ...    |    ...    | 16,859,874\r\n  -------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n\r\n  [157] A unit is 1 per cent. of a ton, or 20 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis estimate, however, takes into account only the more strictly\r\nindustrial sources, leaving rural sanitation and the like out of the\r\nreckoning.\r\n\r\nAside from the conversion of organic ammoniates, which is practiced\r\non a large scale only in a few instances, notably that of the Paris\r\nsystem of sewage disposal, four general types of industrial operation\r\nfigure more or less in the production of by-product ammonia. They\r\ninclude coal distillation, bone carbonization, oil-shale distillation,\r\nand blast-furnace operations. The American production, however, is all\r\nderived from the first two types. Both the others are active producers\r\nabroad, especially in Scotland, but neither of them has as yet obtained\r\na foothold in this country. The American recovery in connection with\r\nbone carbonization is of minor consequence. Practically the whole\r\nsupply comes from gas works and by-product coking operations. Figure\r\n17, in the shaded area bearing the designation “ammonium sulphate\r\nproduction,” shows the magnitude and trend of the production from year\r\nto year since 1900.\r\n\r\nThe organic nitrogen recovered in all of the various by-product\r\nconnections taken together probably constitutes 40 to 50 per cent. of\r\nthe total supply. Coal product ammonia in this country adds another 12\r\nto 15 per cent. So over half of our supply is of by-product derivation.\r\nThe domestic output is supplemented in the case of the organic form by\r\nconsiderable importations from South America, and, until interfered\r\nwith by the war, small amounts of ammonium sulphate were imported\r\nannually from Europe. Essentially, however, the by-product supply is\r\nof domestic origin. Despite its magnitude, it occupies an anomalous\r\nsort of position industrially. It is recovered incidentally for what\r\nit is worth, and sold for what it will bring. The cost of production\r\nis largely charged off against the major operations with which its\r\nrecovery is associated, and the returns are credited in conformance,\r\nas a saving in the cost of the major operations. This is equally true\r\nwhether the source be that of the domestic animal on the farm, a coke\r\noven, or a packing house.\r\n\r\nThe industrial output is built up as a sequence to industrial\r\nconcentration. This is evidenced all down the line, notably in the\r\noutput of coke-oven ammonia from the steel industry and in that\r\nof organic ammoniates from the meat-packing industry. It is this\r\ninfluence of co-ordinated industrial concentration, along with the\r\ncall for the major operations, that controls the supply of by-product\r\nnitrogen; so the development and handling of the industrial output\r\ncomes naturally to be largely in the hands of trade combinations. Thus,\r\nthe coal-product ammonia situation is largely at the disposal of the\r\nBarrett Co., the tankage and other animal-product ammoniates gather for\r\ndisposal at the hands of the packing interests, and the nitrogenous\r\nfertilizers from cottonseed are for the most part prepared and marketed\r\nby interests subsidiary to the Cotton Oil Co.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing interests involved are concerned primarily in the\r\nmanufacture of other than nitrogen products. The by-product nitrogen\r\nrecovered has to compete for its market against what comes from the\r\nother two industrial classes of supply, and its price goes just\r\nlow enough to enable it to do so. The limits set in the incidental\r\ncharacter of the output leave no special incentive to carry the price\r\ncompetition further. Whatever additional latitude of advantage as\r\nto cost of production it possesses goes not to promoting a further\r\nreduction in the price of nitrogen but to lowering costs with reference\r\nto the major theme of production. Gas-house ammonia, for instance, does\r\nnot affect the nitrogen market so much as it does the cost of gas, and\r\nthe organic ammoniates recovered in connection with meat packing have\r\nnot lowered fertilizer costs so much as they have kept down the cost\r\nof meat to the consumer. Thus the by-product class of supply, though\r\nthe leading one in the point of magnitude, and by far the cheapest to\r\nproduce, has little to do with determining the price of nitrogen. The\r\nselling price of by-product nitrogen is determined by the price the\r\nproduct from competing sources brings. In this country it is controlled\r\nby the price of Chile nitrate, and not, as commonly imputed, by the\r\ntrade combinations that develop and handle the output.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fixation Compounds.=--Nitrogen has five general habits of combination:\r\nwith oxygen, giving rise to nitric acid and its retinue of nitrate\r\nsalts; with hydrogen, giving ammonia and the ammonium salts; with\r\ncarbon, to form cyanogen and the cyanides; with basic elements,\r\nyielding nitrides; and organically, in the form of organic ammoniates.\r\nVarious projects have been advanced for turning these to account in the\r\nfixation of atmospheric nitrogen. For the most part they have met with\r\nlittle or no practical success, but there are exceptions to the rule of\r\nfailure in all five directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Direct Oxidation--Arc Fixation._--Nitrogen does not oxidize at all\r\nreadily under any ordinary conditions, but its natural indisposition\r\nto combine with oxygen may be overcome by passing a mixture of the\r\ntwo gases through an electric arc. The atmosphere furnishes the\r\nnitrogen and oxygen ready mixed, so all that is needed in the way of\r\nraw materials is an abundant power supply. Arc fixation was developed\r\nin Norway, where the possibilities in the way of hydro-electric power\r\ngive the best setting to be found anywhere in the world. Efforts to\r\nintroduce it elsewhere have resulted unsatisfactorily, and arc fixation\r\nhas made relatively little headway, as may be deduced from Table 66\r\nand Figure 18. The reason is two-fold. So far, its use of power has\r\nproved uneconomical, and its product unsatisfactory. The former of\r\nthese two objections depends for its force on the demand for power,\r\nbut the latter is more decisive. The immediate end product is nitric\r\nacid, which is both difficult to transport and limited as to use. To be\r\nput in shape for agricultural use it must be neutralized in the form\r\nof a nitrate salt. Limestone is the only cheap neutralizing agent.\r\nThis gives a salt, calcium nitrate, which absorbs moisture, cakes,\r\nand is thus unsuited to the American agricultural practice of machine\r\ndrilling. An experimental plant near Seattle, Wash., aims to overcome\r\nthis difficulty by turning out its arc product in the form of sodium\r\nnitrate, but the project is of no commercial significance as it stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ammonia Fixation._--Nitrogen is no more disposed to combine of its\r\nown accord with hydrogen to give ammonia than with oxygen to give\r\nnitric acid. In the case of the Haber process, the only synthetic\r\nammonia process that has stood the test of industrial application, the\r\nnative indisposition to combine is overcome by subjecting a properly\r\nproportioned mixture of the two gases to heat and pressure in the\r\npresence of a catalyzer. This process was instituted in Germany shortly\r\nbefore the outbreak of the war, and as shown in Figure 16 and Table\r\n66 has developed steadily since then. Little seems to be known as to\r\nthe efficiency of the German Haber practice. Apparently, careful\r\nmanipulation is necessary to obtain results. This means a skilled\r\nattention, which is incompatible with mechanical volume production and\r\nis thus unsuited to American practice. What aims to be an adaptation\r\nto American conditions was worked out by the General Chemical Co., and\r\na plant with a rated capacity of 60,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia\r\nper day was projected at Sheffield, Ala., at the instance of the\r\nGovernment. The plant was completed, but before it could be tuned up\r\nfor actual production the war ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cyanide Fixation._--Nitrogen, in passing through a red-hot mixture of\r\nfinely divided soda ash, coke, and iron, reacts with the sodium and\r\ncarbon to give sodium cyanide. This principle of fixation is being\r\nextensively experimented with, but has not been developed commercially,\r\nexcept in a small plant with a rated daily capacity of 10 tons of\r\nsodium cyanide at Saltville, Va.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cyanamid Fixation._--Hot calcium carbide will absorb nitrogen,\r\nforming a compound of calcium, carbon, and nitrogen, according to\r\nthe formula Ca CN₂, known as cyanamid. The cyanamid process, based\r\non this reaction, has been extensively developed, far more so than\r\nany other of the various processes, as will be seen by referring to\r\nFigure 16 and Table 66. Offhand, it looks to be the most adaptable\r\nand consequently the most promising of the lot commercially. In this\r\nconnection, however, it is interesting to examine the several charts\r\nof its growth in the warring countries given in Figure 16. In none of\r\nthese is the showing indicative of a strong, healthy development. Worst\r\nof all is the case of Germany, with the contrast offered in the Haber\r\nand cyanamid charts. Until the war, cyanamid manufacture was unable to\r\nobtain a competitive foothold in the United States, although a small\r\nplant has been in operation at Niagara Falls in Canada for some years.\r\nThe problem it has faced is similar to that already chronicled for\r\narc fixation, in that it draws heavily on power in the preparation\r\nof the necessary carbide, and the cost of power in this country\r\nhas been prohibitive. Under the stress of the wartime demand for\r\nnitrogen, however, the Government contracted for the erection of three\r\nplants--one at Muscle Shoals, Ala., one near Toledo, Ohio, and one near\r\nCincinnati, Ohio, with a total rated capacity amounting to 220,000 tons\r\nof ammonium nitrate per year. The work on all three was well under way,\r\nbut none of the plants had reached the producing stage when the signing\r\nof the armistice brought the nitrate activities of the War Department\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitride Fixation._--The only process of any prominence aiming to fix\r\nnitrogen in the nitride form is one developed by the Aluminum Company\r\nof America. This has for its working principle the fact that a mixture\r\nof alumina and carbon, highly heated, will absorb nitrogen by reacting\r\nto give aluminum nitride. The nitride when heated with caustic soda\r\ngives its end product in the form of pure ammonia. The outstanding\r\ndifficulty encountered in applying this process commercially seems to\r\nbe that of providing a furnace capable of standing the temperature\r\nrequirements. At all events the process has not succeeded in making\r\ngood industrially.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bacterial Fixation._--The artificial attempts at fixation have been\r\ndirected almost wholly toward employing chemical principles. In view\r\nof the difficulties experienced and the uncertain value of the results\r\nas a whole, it is interesting and perhaps highly significant to\r\nreflect that after all, as indicated in Figure 15, inorganic chemical\r\nprinciples seemingly have little to do with developing the natural\r\nsupply, probably because of the activities of nitrifying bacteria.\r\nLittle attention has been given to the possibilities in this direction.\r\nThis is only natural so far as commercially actuated research is\r\nconcerned, since it does not lead in the definite direction of patent\r\nrights; but the failure to institute an adequate investigation\r\ngovernmentally can be attributed only to lack of comprehension with\r\nreference to the scope of the nitrogen issue as brought out under\r\n“General Aspects of Control” on pages 425 to 433. The subject has\r\nreceived just enough attention to show that bacterial fixation\r\nrepresents a tremendous field of grossly neglected possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND CHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nThe whole matter of fixation must be regarded as in process of\r\ndevelopment. True, it was instituted some fifteen or twenty years ago\r\nand has grown to represent the largest producing source of chemical\r\nnitrogen, with operations in practically all the important industrial\r\ncountries in the world and with responsible financial backing. But\r\nno one can examine the charts in Figure 16 without recognizing the\r\npremature, mushroom quality of the upgrowth, induced primarily in\r\nresponse to the political conditions leading to and through the war.\r\nThis is especially true for the American situation. When the war broke\r\nout, fixation here was confessedly still in the dependent stage of\r\nits development, unable in every effort it had made to stand alone\r\nindustrially. In the main, the developments that have transpired\r\nsubsequently have followed along pre-existing lines. In so far as they\r\nhave done so, little actual economic significance is to be attached to\r\nthem. For the rest, the new developments, all that can be said at this\r\njuncture is that they are disappointingly meager.\r\n\r\nJust one wartime achievement, the oxidation of ammonia, stands\r\nout as affording a worth that is unmistakably clear. The nitrogen\r\nsituation, it will be recalled, has two aspects, the military and the\r\nagricultural. The military focus is on nitric acid, and the readiest\r\nmeans of insuring a supply; the agricultural focus is on ammonium\r\ncompounds or their equivalent in neutral nitrogen salts and the most\r\neconomical means of supply. Here, then, is a parting of the ways to\r\nexpediency, and it is at this juncture that with military influences\r\nto the fore the nitrogen developments of the past few years were\r\nled off on an uneconomical tangent of military control. The Bureau\r\nof Mines, however, taking up the work of others, has perfected a\r\nsimple, effective means for oxidizing ammonia to nitric acid. This,\r\nbeyond question, is the most important contribution of the day. Its\r\nsignificance may perhaps best be brought out graphically in the\r\naccompanying sketch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAmmonia oxidation, it will be observed from the foregoing sketch, gives\r\na means of supplying the military requirement from the direct line\r\nof agricultural efficiency. From the strictly military viewpoint, it\r\nhas the objection of being a roundabout procedure. The dotted line of\r\ndirect military procedure, however, has no peace-time function, and\r\nconsequently cannot be maintained in time of peace in trim for war, but\r\nmust instead be built up expressly to meet wartime exigencies. We have\r\nhad an illustration of what this means in the way of time and money,\r\nand this one ought to suffice. The agricultural channel, once built up\r\non a basis of economic efficiency, is open at all times. At the most,\r\nall that is required is to keep an eye to the emergency needs in the\r\nway of oxidation equipment, a relatively simple matter. Thus, instead\r\nof the precarious procedure of trusting to luck which characterized our\r\npre-war attitude toward nitrogen on the one hand, or of attempting the\r\nimpossible in the way of maintaining a military program of industrial\r\nprocedure in time of peace on the other, all that is needed is a\r\nconstructive program devoted expressly to the interests of economic\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NITROGEN OUTLOOK\r\n\r\nThere is no import duty on nitrogen, nor is there likely to be any,\r\nfor nitrogen is an important cog in the mechanism of food supply, and\r\nthe peacetime emphasis, reversing the wartime order, is primarily on\r\ncheapness and only secondarily on the point of origin. Accordingly,\r\nlooking ahead, the American market conditions, once world trade is\r\nfully restored, are due to reflect the world conditions. As indicated\r\nin Figure 18, the sudden ending of the war, with its calling off of\r\nthe military requirement which had been building up steadily since\r\neven before the outbreak of hostilities in 1914, left the world with\r\na producing capacity 30 to 40 per cent. above normal. To what extent\r\nthis apparent overproduction, amounting to some half million tons of\r\nnitrogen, will prove real is impossible to foretell; not all of it\r\ncertainly, for under the stimulus of a food shortage the curve of\r\nnormal consumption will doubtless bend upward. On the other hand,\r\nhowever, there is the producing capacity of the plants not yet in\r\noperation to be taken into consideration. Whatever may be the capacity\r\nof agriculture to absorb from the surplus, it cannot be expected to\r\ntake up the full amount immediately or without special inducement.\r\nThe inference follows that price and production will come down, to\r\nstimulate and co-ordinate with the increase in demand. Where the\r\nmeeting point will be between the upcurve of demand and the downcurve\r\nof production it is impossible to predict. It is of interest, however,\r\nto figure in review on how the three types of industrial source, the\r\nnatural, the by-product, and the fixation types, are equipped for the\r\nvery evident strife of competition implied in the situation.\r\n\r\nWith the development of fixation, there have been a lot of unfounded\r\nstatements to the effect that the day of Chile nitrate is passing.\r\nWhenever a synthetic development comes to the fore, a peculiar fallacy\r\nof reasoning is indulged in which ignores the fact of inherent natural\r\nworth, disregards the inescapable cost of its duplication, and regards\r\nthe synthetic achievement as giving open sesame to the natural\r\ntreasure. By way of substantiation in the case of nitrogen, the cost\r\nof producing Chile nitrate is high, amounting to around $30 per ton.\r\nThis, however, is largely contributed to by the unsystematized crudity\r\nof the operations, by the high export tax, and by overcapitalization.\r\nBut these, it will be observed, are variable factors, susceptible of\r\nindefinite modification in keeping with the need. Chile nitrate has\r\nnever made any pretense of competing against by-product nitrogen,\r\nwith its advantages in the way of low incidental producing costs and\r\nproximity to the market. The discrepancy between the by-product supply\r\nand the total demand for nitrogen has all along comprised the field\r\nof opportunity opening to Chile nitrate. In this its only noteworthy\r\ncompetitor is the fixation industry.\r\n\r\nThe fixation sources are impossible of analysis on a definite basis\r\nof cost. Too many variable factors and uncertainties are involved.\r\nRepeated attempts have been made, but all they have served to bring\r\nout is that under certain conditions, as for instance of power supply,\r\nand for certain express purposes, one form of project has an apparent\r\nmargin of advantage over another, and vice versa for other conditions;\r\nbut that at best the cost of production, if not actually prohibitive,\r\nis dangerously close to the normal pre-war price of fixed nitrogen.\r\nBack of it all is the fact that fixation has to deal with the problem\r\nof overcoming the native chemical inertia of nitrogen, and the problem\r\nhas not yet been solved at all convincingly. Always the solution\r\nadvanced has called for some special measure of relief from industrial\r\ncompetition, whether natural, as in the case of the Scandinavian\r\npower supply, or political, as in the case of the American and German\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\nFixation has been widely heralded of recent years as due not only to\r\nemancipate the world from its dependence upon the Chilean source, but\r\nto reduce materially the cost of nitrogenous fertilizer, hence the\r\ncost of food production, to the marked betterment of living conditions\r\nas well. In its promise of political and economic betterment in one,\r\nit has claimed the attention of all. However, the claim of special\r\neconomic advantage coming from an industry barely, if at all, able to\r\nmeet conditions even as they are, has been overdrawn.\r\n\r\nThis does not aim to imply that there is nothing but failure ahead\r\nfor fixation in the test of competition. It has its possibilities of\r\ndevelopment into something commercially and economically as well as\r\npolitically worth while, but the existing hothouse order of upgrowth\r\nis unquestionably due for a lot of training down, and much that is\r\nworthless is as certainly due to go. The American developments have\r\na particularly inauspicious economic setting in the prevailing scale\r\nof costs. The only saving alternative for them would seem to be in\r\none form or another of federal provision for their continued support\r\non some such basis as that on which they were projected, and this is\r\nunlikely, for there is no apparent reason. True, lowered nitrogen costs\r\ntend to make for a lowering in the cost of foodstuffs, but so, for that\r\nmatter, would a lowering in the cost of agricultural implements, and\r\nany arguments that apply in the case of nitrogen apply as equally for\r\npotash, for phosphate, for agricultural implements, for coal--in fact\r\nfor industry in general.\r\n\r\nWith reference to by-product nitrogen the situation is very different.\r\nIn general, the by-product sources are of an order such that they\r\nwere not materially affected one way or the other by the war, and\r\nconsequently are not due to be materially affected in the process\r\nof readjustment, except in the case of coke-oven ammonia, where the\r\ntemporary slump in the steel industry will result in a temporary\r\nslump of probably 15 to 20 per cent. from the 1918 output. Of\r\nspecial significance in connection with what lies on beyond for the\r\nby-production of nitrogen is its relationship to the progress of\r\nindustrial co-ordination. The whole current trend of industrialism,\r\nas represented in integration, volume production, and the like, is\r\nactuated in the interests of co-ordination and the overcoming of\r\nlost motion; and nitrogen comes in for an important share in these\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the organic group of compounds, the outlook for\r\nthe future is as uncertain as are the actual conditions of today.\r\nThe centralized development of meat packing, of animal-rendering\r\nestablishments, and of cotton ginning gave rise in their time to\r\nhighly important recoveries of nitrogenous waste; but with the forward\r\nprogress of developments this usage in turn is giving way to a more\r\nadvanced order. Cottonseed as a fertilizer is giving place to a\r\ncottonseed-products industry; tankage as a fertilizer is giving place\r\nto the artificial compounding of animal food; horses, an important\r\ncontributor of agricultural nitrogen in times past, are yielding much\r\nof their place in the sun to the automotive engine. Meanwhile, with\r\nthe factor of dilution to be overcome, our sewage disposal is employed\r\nto pollute streams and destroy the fish supply instead of being put to\r\nuseful ends. So it goes. Developments are on foot that lead in both\r\ndirections, and there is no telling how the balance is due to shift.\r\nProbably the best guess is that relatively at least it will be downward\r\nrather than upward.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for by-product ammonia is more definite. Ammonia is the\r\nend point of material refinement; so here the nitrogen developments\r\nhold all they get, rather than go on to lose out again in a further\r\nrefinement of usage, as in the case of the organic group. The output\r\nhas increased consistently and rapidly, owing to the transition\r\nfrom beehive to by-product coking operations, to the progress of\r\ncentralization and co-ordination; in other words, with reference to\r\ncoke manufacture. Even now, less than half of the coal coked is treated\r\nin the retort oven; but the beehive oven is out of the line of progress\r\nand is due to be entirely displaced. Also, the industry is still\r\nexpanding as the process of transition, with its separate potentiality\r\nfor doubling the present output of coal-product ammonia, goes forward.\r\n\r\nSo far, the recovery of by-products in connection with the use of coal\r\nhas been confined in the one direction of coke making, along with the\r\nanalogous procedure of gas manufacture. But the development which\r\nhas thus started in the coke industry will not stop there. The loss\r\nof motion resulting from lack of co-ordination in the use of coal is\r\njust as great in other directions as in that of coke making, and the\r\nadvantages of integral usage may confidently be expected to assert\r\nthemselves. Already projects of the kind are coming under serious\r\ncontemplation in proposals such as those for furnishing gas to cities,\r\nfor employing by-product operations located at the mine in support of\r\nthe waning natural-gas supply, and for integrated heat, light, and\r\npower projects operating on coal with by-product recovery. Meanwhile,\r\nthe motor-fuel situation is suggestive of interesting developments\r\nahead. There is every reason to believe that the petroleum resources\r\ncan not continue to meet the growing demand, in fact, that the occasion\r\nfor support is already at hand. Whatever the nature of these supporting\r\ndevelopments, whether they take the form of a shale-oil industry or\r\nwhat, it seems certain they will usher in an important source of\r\nby-product nitrogen.\r\n\r\nFigure 17 summarizes the American situation with reference to chemical\r\nnitrogen, as does Figure 18 in less detail that for the world. Organic\r\nnitrogen is omitted, partly because of the lack of information, partly\r\nbecause the issues more directly involved in the situation as it stands\r\nare those of chemical nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nNitrogen, itself, is an inert gas of no particular use, but nitrogenous\r\ncompounds are necessary to agriculture, to refrigeration, to munitions\r\nmanufacture, and to the applications of chemistry in general. In the\r\nnative gaseous state, it makes up about four-fifths of the atmosphere,\r\nand combined it occurs as nitrate minerals, as organic compounds, and\r\nin carboniferous deposits. Atmospheric nitrogen is of use only after\r\nit has been artificially compounded or fixed, a proposition which the\r\nnatural inertness of nitrogen renders difficult and expensive. The\r\nonly mineral deposits of consequence are those comprising the nitrate\r\nfields of northern Chile. The organic resources include all manner of\r\nanimal and vegetable refuse. Coal-tar ammonia from retort-coke and gas\r\nmanufacture, along with some shale-oil ammonia, makes up practically\r\nthe whole supply derived from the carboniferous sources. This range of\r\nassociations, including animal, vegetable, mineral, and atmospheric\r\nsources, transgresses all established rules of resource occurrence,\r\nand consequently all regularly constituted research. As a result the\r\nnitrogen resources and their needs for attention have never been\r\ncomprehensively investigated. This became strikingly apparent when the\r\nwar, threatening swift disaster in the guise of a nitrogen shortage,\r\nshowed us up to be quite devoid of any systematic nitrogen program and\r\nprecipitated an hysterical effort to devise a makeshift one instead.\r\nThe atmosphere was found to provide the only independent source of\r\nsupply available on an emergency rating; so, following the lead of the\r\nEuropean countries, several plants for the fixation of atmospheric\r\nnitrogen were projected governmentally.\r\n\r\nIndustrially, the nitrogen sources may be classified as natural,\r\nby-product, and fixation. The natural supply is almost wholly in the\r\nform of sodium nitrate from the Chile nitrate deposits. These are\r\ncontrolled and operated by British, Chilean, German, and American\r\ncapital. The American imports are largely handled by three companies,\r\nwhose system of control is effected through the medium of shipping and\r\nwarehouse facilities.\r\n\r\nThe by-product sources include nearly all of the organic nitrogen\r\nused, and the nitrogen from coal and oil shale as well. The supply is\r\ngoverned as to magnitude by the progress of industrial co-ordination\r\nthrough the medium of centralization in the preparing of animal,\r\nvegetable, and coal products. Thus the development and marketing\r\nof the by-product supply tends naturally to gather to industrial\r\ncombinations. These, however, are natural developments, not\r\ndevelopments artificially created in the interest of price control. The\r\nprice of by-product nitrogen is controlled not by trade combinations,\r\nbut by the price of the product from other sources, which is to say,\r\nby the price of Chile nitrate. Beyond that, the advantages accruing in\r\nthe way of low-producing costs do not go wholly to commercial profit\r\nbut to the saving of costs with reference to the major production, as\r\nfor instance in the case of gas-works ammonia, which makes its chief\r\ncontribution toward lowering the price of gas to the consumer. The\r\nrapid development of fixation is attributable largely to political\r\ninfluences, activated by conditions leading to and through the war.\r\nThere are a number of projects for fixing nitrogen, but only three\r\nhave any genuine measure of industrial achievement to their credit,\r\nare fixation in Norway, Haber synthetic ammonia fixation in Germany,\r\nand cyanamid fixation in a number of places. Three of the four large\r\nAmerican plants are of the last-named order; the other is a synthetic\r\nammonia proposition. All four were contracted for by the Government,\r\nand so far as fixation can be said to have gained an industrial\r\nfoothold in the United States it is wholly in response to the dictates\r\nof political control.\r\n\r\nProbably rather less than half of the nitrogen consumed is organically\r\nassociated, and rather more than half of it chemically combined.\r\nPractically all of the organic nitrogen and around one-fourth of the\r\nchemical nitrogen is of domestic by-product derivation. So far, the\r\nbalance has been supplied from Chile nitrate, supplemented by small\r\nimports of guano, animal refuse, by-product ammonia, and cyanamid from\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nThere is no apparent likelihood of this adjustment being materially\r\naffected as an immediate outcome of developments with reference to\r\nfixation. These have shown themselves to be of the utmost political\r\nsignificance as affording an unlimited, independent source of nitrogen\r\nsupply. Their genuine economic significance at the present stage\r\nof enforced expansion, however, is questionable. In this country,\r\nespecially, the scale of costs gives an unpromising setting. The\r\nby-product sources growing out of centralized industrial co-ordination\r\nare in line with the trend of modern industrialism and may be looked\r\nto as assuring a steady increase in yield, especially if the process\r\nof industrial evolution in the direction of co-ordinated economic\r\nefficiency is adequately cultivated instead of being interfered with.\r\nIn this same connection the most significant accomplishment recorded\r\nfor nitrogen, lies in the working out of a means for the oxidation\r\nof by-product ammonia, thus rendering the growing by-product supply\r\navailable for the full range of nitrogen uses.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the economic and political aspects of the outlook\r\nahead, all else is obscured and lost to view in the pressing need for\r\na constructive program worked out on a comprehensive basis, in keeping\r\nwith the comprehensiveness of the resources themselves, with which to\r\nsupplant the uneconomical makeshift program brought into being by the\r\nwar. The program called for is one calculated to bring out, and bring\r\nout co-ordinately, the best there is in bacterial as well as chemical\r\nfixation, in the industrial by-product sources of organic and chemical\r\nnitrogen, and in the province of sanitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nPYRITE AND SULPHUR\r\n\r\nBY A. G. WHITE\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF PYRITE AND SULPHUR\r\n\r\nPyrite and sulphur are closely related in their most essential uses,\r\nand one material can in many cases be substituted for the other. The\r\nlargest and most important use of these minerals is in the manufacture\r\nof sulphuric acid, which is an essential material required for a very\r\nwide variety of purposes, including the production of acid phosphate\r\nfor fertilizer, the manufacture of modern high-power explosives, the\r\nrefining of petroleum, pickling of iron and steel, and for a vast\r\nnumber of chemical industries. The competition between pyrite and\r\nsulphur for this purpose has gone through several stages. With the\r\nlarge-scale development of Italian deposits sulphur was largely used\r\nfor acid manufacture. As the prices of sulphur were increased it became\r\ncheaper to use pyrite, which in many localities then displaced sulphur,\r\nfor this purpose. With the rapid expansion of the American production,\r\nand particularly with the tremendous increase in the capacity of\r\nsulphuric acid plants for war purposes, sulphur has again been very\r\nlargely used for the manufacture of acid. The prospects since the close\r\nof the war are that, due to the tremendous capacity of the sulphur\r\nmines of the United States, sulphur may continue to compete with pyrite\r\nin this use.\r\n\r\nProbably the second most important use of these materials is in the\r\nmanufacture of sulphite wood pulp. In Europe pyrite is largely used\r\nfor this purpose, while in the United States and Canada sulphur is the\r\nprincipal material used. For every ton of sulphite pulp manufactured,\r\nunder the best practice, about 250 pounds of sulphur is required. In\r\nthe United States and Canada about 175,000 tons of sulphur is used\r\nannually for this purpose, representing about 50 per cent. of the total\r\nsulphur consumption of these countries. There are also a number of\r\nother important purposes where sulphur is used rather than pyrite, the\r\nmost important of which are in the manufacture of agricultural sprays\r\nand insecticides, and in the hardening of rubber. Sulphur is a primary\r\ningredient of black powder, and considerable quantities are still used\r\nfor that purpose. While most of the explosives used in modern warfare\r\nrequire the use of sulphuric acid in their manufacture, they do not\r\nuse sulphur in its elemental form. There are many other minor chemical\r\nuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Substitutes for Sulphur and Pyrite.=--Because of the large deposits\r\nof sulphur now available, and of the extent and wide distribution of\r\npyrite deposits, and of the cheapness of both these materials, there\r\nare no adequate commercial substitutes for them. The increase of\r\nby-product acid, from the copper and zinc smelters and possibly the\r\nnickel smelters of Sudbury, might be considered as the most important\r\nfactors in replacing pyrite and sulphur. As a general thing, the\r\nfactors of cost and transportation are the governing ones rather than\r\nany present or probable scarcity of materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF PYRITE\r\n\r\nWhile pyrite is a very widely distributed mineral, there are relatively\r\nfew deposits which are of sufficient importance to enter into the\r\nworld’s commerce. This is generally due to the relatively small value\r\nof its sulphur content per ton, usually from 40 to 45 per cent. of\r\nrecoverable sulphur; which means that it takes almost 2¹⁄₂ tons of\r\npyrite to be equivalent to the ton of sulphur which competes with it\r\nfor many uses. Consequently pyrite seldom moves far, unless it is so\r\nsituated as to take advantage of cheap ballast rates where little other\r\nfreight is available for ships, or unless it carries important copper\r\nor gold values, which can be recovered after the sulphur content has\r\nbeen utilized. Many known deposits, such as those in Mexico and the\r\nWestern United States, remain undeveloped because of their distance\r\nfrom market. In countries such as Russia, France, Italy, Germany,\r\nSweden, Japan, and the Eastern United States production is absorbed\r\nby the local market. Spain and Portugal, the most important source\r\nof world supply, are favorably located to ship to near-by European\r\ncountries or to secure cheap ballast rates to the United States, and in\r\naddition much of the ore carries several per cent. of copper.\r\n\r\nNorway is second in export, with a high-grade pyrite carrying copper\r\nvalues, which is shipped to Sweden or across the Baltic to near-by\r\ncountries. Canada ships considerable pyrite to the near-by markets of\r\nthe United States, the Quebec product having copper values, while the\r\nproduct of Ontario takes advantage of boat shipments on the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spain and Portugal.=--The deposits of Spain and Portugal are the\r\nlargest and most important in the world, furnishing approximately\r\ntwo-thirds of the world supply. The district is essentially a unit,\r\nand the principal deposits occur in a zone extending from Rio Tinto,\r\nSpain, to San Domingo, Portugal. The combined annual production of iron\r\nand copper pyrites for the two countries is normally almost 4 million\r\nmetric tons, 90 per cent. of which is furnished by Spain and 10 per\r\ncent. by Portugal. About two-thirds of the total output carries copper\r\nvalues, which may be recovered before the pyrite is roasted for its\r\nsulphur value or after. When copper is to be recovered at the mine\r\nthe ore is leached by spreading it out in beds exposed to the weather\r\nand frequently stirring it and wetting it down. The copper goes into\r\nsolution and is precipitated on scrap iron, forming cement copper. The\r\nprocess takes about 3 years and the pyrite residue is shipped as washed\r\nore. The ore is compact and finely crystalline and carries from 48 to\r\n51 per cent. sulphur. Conservative estimates of ore reserves for the\r\ndistrict give it from 300 to 400 million tons, or enough to last for\r\none hundred years at the present rate of production. Consequently this\r\ndistrict is destined to long remain the chief pyrite-producing center\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Tinto Co. is the principal producer, contributing about\r\none-third of the total output of the whole district (Spain-Portugal).\r\nIt is owned by British and French capital. Mining is largely by\r\nopen-pit methods, and the company employs 25,000 men. The ore carries\r\nabout 2 per cent. copper, making this company the largest European\r\nproducer of that metal. The reserves are estimated as 250 to 300\r\nmillion tons, representing the major part of the whole district. The\r\nRio Tinto Co. furnishes about 60 per cent. of the 1,000,000 tons of\r\nSpanish pyrite normally imported by the United States.\r\n\r\nThe second principal producer is the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Mines\r\n(British), with about one-eighth of the total production. British\r\ncapital is predominant in the district as a whole, with the balance\r\nFrench and Spanish. Huelva, Spain, is the principal point of export,\r\nlocated from 30 to 40 miles from the mines. Under normal conditions\r\nthe pyrite moves at cheap ballast rates, and has been sold at from $6\r\nto $7 per long ton (12 to 16 cents per unit of sulphur), delivered in\r\nUnited States ports. Normally this Spain-Portugal district exported\r\none-quarter of its output to the United States, one-eighth to England,\r\none-eighth to Holland, one-eighth to Germany, and most of the balance\r\nto France and Belgium.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Norway and Sweden.=--Norway produces from 400 to 500 thousand tons\r\nof pyrite per year (about 8 per cent. of the world’s total), and her\r\noutput is steadily increasing. The ore usually carries from 1 to 3 per\r\ncent. copper and from 42 to 49 per cent. sulphur; and is free from\r\narsenic. Seven-eighths of the output is exported to Sweden, Germany,\r\nEngland and Russia. When Sweden’s import of sulphur (about 40,000 tons)\r\nwas cut off during the war, she changed the equipment of her cellulose\r\nplants to burn pyrite instead of sulphur and took about one-half of\r\nthe Norwegian output, since her own production of pyrite (about 30,000\r\ntons) was of minor importance.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian deposits are widely distributed from south of Bergen to\r\nthe extreme northern end of the peninsula. The ore is generally massive\r\ncupriferous pyrite, occurring in flat lenses in chlorite schists in\r\nareas of regional metamorphism. About 250,000 tons comes from the\r\nTrondhjem district, where the Lokken mines of the Orkla Mine Co. are\r\nthe largest producers.\r\n\r\nThe northern district is second in importance, with about 150,000 tons\r\nannual production, chiefly from the Sulitjelma mine at the Swedish\r\nfrontier, near the Polar Circle. In the eastern district the Fodal\r\nCopper & Sulphur Co. has a production of from 75,000 to 100,000 tons.\r\nNorway has sufficient known reserves to last for thirty years at the\r\npresent rate of production and probably for much longer. The largest\r\nreserves are in the Trondhjem district. Sweden is also reported to have\r\nlarge reserves, although there has been little development so far.\r\n\r\nThe commercial control of the mines is principally English and\r\nNorwegian. It was reported that mines with large reserves near Narvik\r\nwere owned by German interests, but were purchased by Swedish interests\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n=France.=--For many years France has produced about 300,000 tons\r\nof pyrite per annum, or about 5 per cent. of the world output. The\r\nprincipal deposits are at Sain-Bel, near Lyons, in the Department\r\nof Rhône. The product is high in sulphur. The known reserves are\r\nprobably from ten to twelve million tons. The output is used for home\r\nconsumption, and in the past was supplemented by the import of Spanish\r\npyrite, and Sicilian and United States sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Italy.=--In addition to her large sulphur production Italy has\r\nproduced a considerable quantity of pyrite, which has been used locally\r\nin the manufacture of sulphuric acid. Pyrite production was about\r\n300,000 tons before the war and increased to 400,000 tons in 1916, so\r\nthat Italy produces about 6 per cent. of the world output. The pyrite\r\ncontains about 45 per cent. of sulphur and a small part of it carries\r\ncopper values. The principal production comes from a district near\r\nFlorence, although a number of smaller mines are widely scattered.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Russia.=--Russia has large pyrite deposits located in a belt parallel\r\nto the eastern slope of the Ural Mountains. The Kyshtim and Sissert\r\ndistricts furnish the principal output. Reports indicate a good grade\r\nof pyrite with high sulphur content. The production has been in the\r\nneighborhood of 150,000 tons, or about 2 per cent. of the world total.\r\nProduction had been steadily increasing up to the time of Russia’s\r\neconomic collapse, but has been limited, due to the remote location\r\nof the deposits from the chief centres of consumption at Petrograd,\r\nMoscow, and Odessa. It is to be expected that Russia, after she regains\r\nher balance, will continue to import pyrite to a considerable extent,\r\nas she has done in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Germany, Austria and Hungary.=--The pre-war German production was from\r\n200,000 to 250,000 tons of pyrite per annum, or about 4 per cent. of\r\nthe world output. About two-thirds of the output comes from deposits\r\nnear Meggen. The pyrite is estimated to run about 43 per cent. sulphur.\r\nIt is reported that the pyrite output was largely increased during\r\nthe war, as Germany had been importing from 800,000 to 1,000,000 tons\r\nof pyrite. She continued to import some Norwegian pyrite, which is\r\nespecially desirable because of its recoverable copper content. Germany\r\nsecures a considerable amount of sulphuric acid as a by-product from\r\nzinc smelters, which helped to make up the deficiency in her sulphur\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nHungary normally produces about 100,000 tons of pyrite per annum,\r\nchiefly from the deposits of Schemnitz.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cyprus.=--An important deposit of cupriferous pyrite is under\r\ndevelopment in an old copper-mining region on the northwest coast of\r\nCyprus. Several million tons of ore are reported, containing a high\r\nsulphur content and high copper values. It is being developed on a\r\nlarge scale by the Cyprus Mines Corporation, representing United States\r\ncapital, and may be expected to become an important factor in pyrite\r\nexport.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The United States.=--The pre-war production of the United States was\r\nabout 350,000 long tons, or 6 per cent. of the world’s production,\r\ncompared to an import of about 1,000,000 tons. About 40 per cent.\r\nof the total was produced in Virginia and largely sold for use in\r\nacid-phosphate plants from Maryland to Georgia; about 25 per cent.\r\nwas produced in California and used for local acid manufacture in the\r\nvicinity of San Francisco; about 15 per cent. was produced in New York\r\nState; and the balance was scattered, coming as a by-product from coal\r\nmines in Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana, and from the zinc-mining region\r\nof southern Wisconsin. During the war, production was increased by\r\nabout 50 per cent., but with no discoveries which promise to greatly\r\nincrease the permanent production of the country. On the whole the\r\ndeposits are not of very high quality, averaging about 40 per cent.\r\nsulphur content. Very large reserves of pyrrhotite are located in\r\nwestern Virginia and eastern Tennessee, but have not been very\r\nextensively utilized. Large reserves of pyrite exist in Colorado,\r\nArizona, Utah and other western states, but are too far from the\r\nacid plants located in the East and South to compete. On the whole,\r\nthe scanty development of pyrite in the United States is due to the\r\ncompetition of high-grade Spanish pyrite coming in to the Atlantic\r\nports at cheap ballast rates; to the import of Canadian pyrite either\r\nto near-by points in New England or to the Great Lakes ports; to the\r\nlarge production of cheap sulphur from Louisiana and Texas, which\r\nhas monopolized the sulphite pulp trade; and to the recovery of\r\nby-product acid from copper and zinc smelters. The great increase in\r\nthe production of sulphur during and since the war is very likely\r\nstill further to curtail the market for pyrite. The production of\r\npyrite has been in the hands of American companies, several of the\r\nlarger operations being controlled by concerns either in the acid or\r\nfertilizer business.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canada.=--The production of pyrite in Canada has increased rapidly,\r\nparticularly during the war, to about 300,000 tons. This is due to an\r\nincreased export to the United States, principally to sulphuric-acid\r\nplants. The principal producing areas in Canada are: (1) The district\r\nin Quebec, not far north of the Vermont border, where there are two\r\noperating mines and a number of promising prospects. There are large\r\nore reserves and the ore carries considerable copper. The principal\r\nmines are controlled by American capital. (2) The Goudreau district,\r\nlocated some 40 miles north of Sault Ste. Marie, has large ore\r\nreserves, but of rather low grade. Thus far an American company is the\r\nprincipal producer. (3) The North Pine district near Graham, Ontario,\r\nand a considerable distance west of Port Arthur, has been a large\r\nproducer of good-grade pyrite. The principal producer was a subsidiary\r\ncompany of the General Chemical Co.\r\n\r\nThere is a large reserve of pyrrhotite, estimated at about 50,000,000\r\ntons, much of which will average over 25 per cent. sulphur, in\r\nconnection with the Sudbury nickel deposits. At present it is not\r\ncommercially important. There are considerable deposits of pyrites\r\nin various parts of British Columbia, but these are unimportant\r\ncommercially because of their distance from any available market.\r\nThe larger part of the Canadian product is controlled by American\r\ninterests, chiefly the American Chemical Co., whose headquarters are\r\nin New York City. A large part of the Canadian output is imported to\r\nthe United States through Chicago, Cleveland, and Buffalo; and by rail\r\nthrough Vermont, Boston and to New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cuba.=--An important pyrite property is being developed about twenty\r\nmiles from Cienfuegos, Province of Santa Clara, Cuba. It is reported\r\nas containing several million tons of good-grade ore, which will\r\naverage at least 40 per cent. sulphur and may contain a recoverable\r\ncopper content. The property is being developed by United States\r\ncapital, interests connected with the Davison Chemical Corporation,\r\nof Baltimore, Md., who are one of the largest producers of sulphuric\r\nacid on the Atlantic Coast. This property promises to be an important\r\nnear-by source of pyrite for the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mexico.=--Important pyrite deposits are known to exist in Mexico, but\r\nthey are of no present commercial importance because of inaccessibility\r\nand high freight rates, and unsettled political conditions. A large\r\ndeposit is reported about 30 miles inland in the State of Guerrero,\r\ncontaining several million tons of high-grade pyrite of approximately\r\n48 per cent. sulphur content and free from arsenic.\r\n\r\nThere is no prospect that Mexico will be of any immediate importance in\r\nthe world pyrite situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Japan.=--Japan has a small pyrite production of from 75,000 to 100,000\r\ntons per year, or about 1¹⁄₂ per cent. of the world output. Much of\r\nit carries copper values. The production comes from several scattered\r\nlocalities. The state has reserved the ownership of the original\r\nmineral rights, and the operators to whom they have been leased appear\r\nto be entirely Japanese. Japan consumes her pyrite for local purposes,\r\nand exports most of her sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SULPHUR\r\n\r\n\r\n=Italy and Sicily.=--Italy had practically a monopoly of the world’s\r\nsulphur supply until 1904, when large-scale production began in the\r\nUnited States. The importance of sulphur as a world mineral began with\r\nthe use of gunpowder in the fourteenth century. Considerable export\r\ntrade was early developed and has been of increasing importance since\r\n1830. Ninety per cent. of the Italian production has come from the\r\nIsland of Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe sulphur-bearing district of Sicily is a central belt running across\r\nthe island, extending about 100 miles east and west and 50 miles north\r\nand south. The richer deposits are scattered as irregular lenses or\r\nbasin-like bodies, in this extensive area. The deposits of commercial\r\nvalue are of sedimentary type, occurring as stratified beds or sheets\r\nin limestone, associated with gypsum and bituminous marl. There are\r\ngenerally three or four sulphur-bearing layers, separated by a few feet\r\nof barren rock. The average thickness of the sulphur beds is from 10 to\r\n15 feet, although in a few places they run as high as several hundred\r\nfeet. The sulphur occurs as incrustations, pockets, or thin bands\r\nintimately associated with the limestone. The average sulphur content\r\nof the ore mined is from 20 to 25 per cent., with a range from 8 to 50\r\nper cent.; and in a few places it reaches up to 90 per cent. Estimates\r\nas to the reserves of ore vary greatly, but seem to indicate that there\r\nis from 40 to 60 million tons of ore still unmined, which will average\r\nabout 23 per cent. of sulphur content.\r\n\r\nMining has been mostly by hand and the ore brought out on the backs of\r\nmen. A few mines had modern hoisting machinery and trams. The shortage\r\nof labor during the war has increased the introduction of modern\r\nappliances in some of the newer mines. With increasing depth the cost\r\nof mining has increased to the point where American sulphur can compete\r\nin European markets.\r\n\r\nThe methods of extracting the sulphur from the ore have also been\r\nextremely crude and wasteful, but in the last few years better types\r\nof ovens have been installed, giving a much higher recovery through\r\nimproved distillation and the use of superheated steam for melting the\r\nsulphur.\r\n\r\nThe sulphur industry of Sicily furnishes a notable example of an\r\nattempted commercial control which developed into a governmental\r\ncontrol of the industry. The recent history of the industry falls into\r\nthree periods. The first extends from 1875 to 1895 and is characterized\r\nby a rapid increase in production, from 200,000 to 400,000 tons a year,\r\nwith a corresponding decrease in selling price from $25 a ton to as low\r\nas $12 a ton. It was a period of overproduction, due to the ease with\r\nwhich shallow mining could be carried on and to the abundant supply of\r\ncheap labor available. These conditions resulted in the development\r\nof a great number of small mines, whose competition reduced prices.\r\nThe second period, from 1896 to 1906, begins with the formation of\r\nthe Anglo-Sicilian Sulphur Co., financed by English capital, which\r\nentered into a five-year agreement with the principal producers, which\r\nwas later extended for an additional five years. It was primarily a\r\nmarketing organization, formed by the union of Italian and English\r\ninterests to control production, stabilize the industry, and maintain\r\nprices. It eventually controlled from 75 to 85 per cent. of the\r\nindustry. All sulphur was purchased at about $16 per ton f.o.b. ship\r\nand the selling price remained practically stable during the ten-year\r\nperiod, at an average of $18 to $19 per ton. In spite of efforts to\r\nrestrict production, the annual output reached 550,000 tons during\r\nmost of this period. At the same time the higher prices maintained for\r\nsulphur had stimulated the use of pyrite as a substitute. In order\r\nto maintain prices under these conditions the excess production had\r\nto be purchased and stored, so that in 1906 a stock of over 500,000\r\ntons of sulphur had been accumulated in Sicily. Toward the end of\r\nthis period large-scale production began in the United States (1904).\r\nIn 1903 the United States produced less than 10,000 tons of sulphur\r\nand was Italy’s best customer, buying over 170,000 tons in that year.\r\nWithin three years the United States was producing more than enough\r\nto supply its own needs and was accumulating a large reserve stock.\r\nThe sudden loss of the American market and the threat of competition\r\nin other markets brought on a crisis in the Sicilian industry, which\r\nwas intensified by the large number (30,000) of people employed in the\r\nindustry. At the termination of the agreement with the Anglo-Sicilian\r\ncompany (July 31, 1906) steps were taken by the Italian government to\r\ncontrol the situation. The third period, from 1906 to the present,\r\nis one of government intervention and control of the industry. All\r\nthe producers were compelled to join a company called the “Consorzia\r\nObbligatoria per l’Industria Solfiefera Siciliana,” organized under\r\na law passed in the Italian Parliament. The organization was managed\r\nby a commission appointed by the government, and had complete control\r\nover exports and prices. All sulphur had to be sold at fixed price to\r\nthis organization. A minimum interest was guaranteed on the capital\r\ninvested; local freight rates on sulphur for export were reduced;\r\nsulphur stocks accumulated by the Anglo-Sicilian company were taken\r\nover; and a campaign of price-cutting was started in the American\r\nmarket, which resulted in a decrease of several dollars a ton in the\r\nselling price of sulphur. A market agreement was soon reached and\r\nprices recovered. A number of the smaller mines closed down and a law\r\nwas passed controlling and restricting the granting of new concessions.\r\nProduction declined to 350,000 tons in 1913. At the opening of the war\r\nthe principal United States producer was preparing to enter into more\r\nactive competition with Italian sulphur, particularly in the French\r\nmarkets. As a result of the war, Italian production dropped to only\r\n180,000 tons in 1917, largely due to labor shortage; about half of\r\nthe surplus stocks were used up, leaving only 160,000 tons on hand at\r\nthe end of 1917; and prices increased so that refined sulphur sold at\r\nabout $80 per ton and inferior grades at $55 per ton, f.o.b. Sicilian\r\nports. The increasing cost of producing sulphur, due to deeper mining\r\nand increased labor costs, will make it difficult to compete in the\r\nEuropean markets with the greatly expanded production of the cheaper\r\nAmerican article.\r\n\r\nSulphur has been produced in several districts in the Italian\r\npeninsula, particularly Romagna, Marches, Campania and Calabria. The\r\nyield from these districts has been decreasing in recent years and has\r\ngenerally been only from 25,000 to 30,000 tons. The sulphur content of\r\nthe ores ranges from 20 to 30 per cent. The deposits are of limited\r\nextent and are being mined at greater depths. The production has been\r\nlargely used for local agricultural purposes, in preparations for use\r\nagainst vine diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The United States.=--Until 1904, the production of sulphur in the\r\nUnited States was considerably less than 10,000 tons per year and the\r\nbulk of our requirements had to be met by import from Sicily. From 1904\r\nto 1914 the United States produced enough for its own use and at the\r\nend of this period was supplying Canada, had begun to actively enter\r\nthe French and German market, and in addition had accumulated a reserve\r\nstock, in the hands of the producers, of approximately one million long\r\ntons. Figures recently made public in connection with litigation over\r\npatent rights show that half of this stock was accumulated in a single\r\nyear, 1912, when production reached 790,000 long tons, of which only\r\n300,000 tons was marketed and the balance of 490,000 tons went into\r\nstorage. The United States production has exceeded that of Italy since\r\n1912, although the sales have been less, because sulphur was being\r\nwithdrawn from stocks in Italy while stocks in the United States were\r\nbeing increased. The net effect of the war was a four-fold increase in\r\nthe amount of sulphur sold in the United States, without any reduction\r\nin stocks; while in Italy production fell off 50 per cent. and stocks\r\non hand were reduced by the same percentage.\r\n\r\nFrom 98 to 99 per cent. of the United States production has come from\r\nthe Gulf Coast region of the states of Louisiana and Texas. A number\r\nof other localities in West Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, and\r\nNevada have surface deposits, usually of limited extent, which have\r\nbeen worked on a small scale, but have declined in importance with the\r\ndevelopment of the better-grade and more accessible deposits of the\r\nGulf Coastal region.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of sulphur in the Gulf Coast region is in connection\r\nwith a peculiar formation known as “Saline Domes” or “Mounds.” Over\r\ntwenty of these domes have been located, scattered in an area 200\r\nmiles long, extending through western Louisiana and eastern Texas, and\r\ngenerally within 50 miles of the Gulf of Mexico. Commercial deposits\r\nof petroleum, sulphur, and salt have been developed in connection with\r\nthese domes, but so far not more than one of the minerals has been\r\ndeveloped to commercial degree in a single dome. Sulphur was discovered\r\nwhen drilling was being carried on for oil. So far, three domes have\r\nbeen developed for sulphur, namely that owned by the Union Sulphur\r\nCo. at Sulphur, La. (1903), that owned by the Freeport Sulphur Co. at\r\nFreeport, Texas (1912), and that of the Texas-Gulf Sulphur Co. near\r\nMatagordo, Texas (1919). Two other domes are under exploration and a\r\nnumber of others may possibly contain sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe sulphur occurs at a depth of 300 to 1,200 feet and is associated\r\nwith limestone and underlain by gypsum. The surface area of the\r\nproducing domes varies from 200 to 1,500 acres. Exploration is done\r\nby drilling at a cost of $200,000 to $300,000, and the cost of a\r\ncomplete plant is several million dollars. The sulphur cannot be mined\r\nby shafts, due to the quicksands and the poisonous gases encountered.\r\nThe deposit at Sulphur, Louisiana, remained unworked for almost 40\r\nyears after its discovery before a satisfactory process was developed\r\nto mine it. This is known as the “Frasch Process” and consists of the\r\nsinking of wells to the sulphur deposit, each well being lined with a\r\n10 to 12 in. pipe. Smaller pipes are placed inside, so that superheated\r\nwater can be brought in contact with the sulphur ore, which is melted\r\nand forced to the surface by compressed air. The sulphur on cooling\r\nis ready for market and is over 99 per cent. pure. Each of the three\r\nplants in operation is equipped with a boiler capacity of over 20,000\r\nh.p. for superheating the water, and requires about a million and a\r\nquarter barrels of fuel oil per year. The origin of these domes is\r\nbelieved to be due to deep-seated igneous intrusions, resulting in\r\nthe alteration of gypsum and the crystallization of salt and sulphur,\r\nwhich has caused an upbowing of the strata. Because of the nature of\r\nthe formation and the irregularity of the deposits it is impossible to\r\naccurately estimate the reserves of sulphur.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of two new plants since 1912, the United States now\r\nhas a sulphur-producing capacity of about 1¹⁄₄ million tons per year,\r\nor four times the normal sales before the war. If an outlet is to be\r\nfound for this excess sulphur, it must compete with pyrite in the\r\ndomestic market or with Sicilian sulphur in the European markets. In\r\nthe latter part of 1919 prices of $14 to $15 per ton f.o.b. mines were\r\nquoted, which indicated that an effort was being made to secure part of\r\nthe acid trade which formerly used pyrite.\r\n\r\nThere is no element of political control in the United States sulphur\r\nindustry, beyond the temporary measures taken during the war in\r\nlicensing export and allocation of consumption. The commercial control\r\nis entirely in the hands of American companies. The Union Sulphur\r\nCo. has been endeavoring to prevent the use of the improved “Frasch\r\nProcess” by the other companies which are competing with it. If the\r\nclaim of infringement of patent rights should be sustained, it would\r\ngive the Union company control of the situation similar to that which\r\nit had before the development of the two newer companies, and might\r\nresult in the restriction of output and maintenance of prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Japan.=--Japan takes third rank in the production of sulphur, although\r\nit is of minor importance, compared to either the United States or\r\nItaly. The production of sulphur in Japan has slowly increased from\r\n15,000 long tons in 1900 to 60,000 tons in 1913, or about 7 per cent.\r\nof the world output. The domestic consumption is very small and about\r\n90 per cent. of the output was exported, chiefly to Australia, the west\r\ncoast of the United States and Canada, and to China and India. During\r\nthe war the output increased to a maximum of about 100,000 tons, but\r\nin 1918 production was considerably curtailed by the great advance in\r\nfreight rates to Australia, which had been purchasing about one-half of\r\nthe Japanese output.\r\n\r\nThe sulphur occurs in surface deposits of limited extent and seldom\r\nreaches 100 feet in thickness. The deposits are generally of the\r\nsolfataric type and occur in the numerous areas of volcanic activity.\r\nThe majority of the productive areas are nearly circular in outline,\r\nand indicate that they were formed by deposition in crater lakes. In\r\nsome cases they are stratified and overlain by fine brown clayey or\r\ntufaceous material derived partly from the surrounding rocks and partly\r\nfrom the sulphur itself. Other deposits of minor importance may have\r\nbeen produced by impregnation. The ore mined runs from 50 to 60 per\r\ncent. sulphur. Deposits below 40 per cent. sulphur are seldom worked.\r\n\r\nApproximately two-thirds of the production has come from the\r\nsouthwestern section of the Island of Hokkaido. Four mines average\r\nabout 10,000 tons production each per year, and the remainder of the\r\nproduction comes from 10 to 12 smaller operations, ranging from the\r\nvicinity of Mount Daiton, in Taiwan (Formosa), to the Kurile Islands.\r\n\r\nThere is no accurate estimate of ore reserves available. One of the\r\nmost important mines was estimated as containing several million tons\r\nof 50 per cent. ore. The reserves are probably sufficient to maintain\r\npresent production for many years. The lack of shipping facilities has\r\nhandicapped production, and there seems little likelihood that the\r\nrelative importance of Japan in the sulphur industry will increase to\r\nany great extent.\r\n\r\nThe sulphur mines are all operated by Japanese. The state reserves\r\nthe right of original ownership of all minerals, except a few placer\r\ndeposits. Right of working is granted to Japanese companies or\r\nindividuals according to priority of application. The mining law,\r\nhowever, acknowledges the rights of any corporation organized by aliens\r\nunder Japanese law.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Great Britain.=--Great Britain has an estimated annual by-product\r\nrecovery of from 30,000 to 40,000 tons of elemental sulphur. The\r\nprocess of recovery is known as the Chance-Claus process, and is\r\napplied in connection with the Le Blanc soda process. It is based upon\r\nthe decomposition of calcium sulphate in vat waste by means of carbon\r\ndioxide, and the recovery of sulphur from the sulphuretted hydrogen gas\r\nthus generated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Countries.=--The production of sulphur outside of the United\r\nStates, Italy and Japan is of minor importance.\r\n\r\nNorthern _Chile_ has a small production of sulphur from the volcanoes\r\nof Tacora and Chupiquina. The reserves are estimated as quite large,\r\nbut the high elevation (14,000 to 20,000 ft.) and poor transportation\r\nhave restricted production to local uses in the vineyard districts of\r\nChile. The production as reported had gradually increased to about\r\n6,000 tons in 1913 and is reported to have doubled since then.\r\n\r\n_Spain_ produces about 10,000 tons of sulphur annually, from low-grade\r\ndeposits located in the neighborhood of Almeria. The larger figures\r\noften reported are in terms of low-grade ore mined.\r\n\r\n_Austria_ is credited with a production of from 10 to 15 thousand tons\r\nof crude sulphur ore, probably representing only 2 or 3 thousand tons\r\nof actual sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe largest sulphur mine in _Mexico_ is located at Cerritos, 25 miles\r\nsouth of Guadalcazar, San Luis Potosi. Fifteen years ago it was\r\npurchased by an American company, the Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co.\r\nIt was later leased to German interests. The small output of a few\r\nthousand tons was shipped to Germany before the war. There are a number\r\nof deposits in San Luis Potosi in addition to the one at Cerritos.\r\n\r\nIt has been reported several times that a British company was about\r\nto operate the sulphur deposits of the Mexican volcano, Popocatepetl,\r\nnear Mexico City. Statements regarding the deposits in the volcano are\r\nconflicting, but investigations indicate that their magnitude has been\r\nmuch exaggerated. Many other deposits occur in connection with local\r\nvolcanic areas, but so far are of little economic value because of\r\ninaccessibility.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of deposits of sulphur in the Aleutian Islands\r\n(_Alaska_), probably containing considerable sulphur, but partially\r\ncovered by glaciers and difficult of access. It is doubtful whether\r\nthey could be developed in the face of the competition of the cheap\r\nsulphur from the coastal plain district of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nNo very far-reaching changes in practice are likely to occur in the\r\nnear future. The exhaustion of the surface sulphur deposits in Italy\r\nand the necessity for deep mining is making necessary improvement and\r\ninstallation of more modern methods there. Improved methods in the\r\nrefining of sulphur are also being installed whereby the losses under\r\nthe old _calcarone_ method will be largely eliminated. The consumption\r\nof sulphur for sulphite wood pulp can be considerably reduced by the\r\ngeneral utilization of the improved practice which is already used\r\nby the best plants. In localities where pyrite is available this\r\nmaterial may be used in the pulp industry to replace sulphur. In case\r\ncompetition develops between the three large sulphur companies in\r\nthe United States, and the price of sulphur is considerably reduced,\r\nit may result in the use of this material to a larger extent in the\r\nsulphuric-acid industry. The sulphur burners can be installed much\r\nmore quickly and cheaply than the furnaces required to roast pyrite,\r\nand after once being installed the amount of labor and care required\r\nin their operation is less. The increased recovery of sulphuric acid\r\nas a by-product from copper and zinc smelters will probably represent\r\nan increasing factor in competition with acid made either from pyrite\r\nor sulphur. The further increase of this source in the United States\r\nis handicapped by the location of many of the copper smelters in the\r\nwest, at long distances from the market for sulphuric acid, which is\r\nlargely in the eastern and southern states. New processes are being\r\nexperimented with, for the production of elementary sulphur from these\r\nsulphur fumes. If these are successful on a large scale, material\r\nfrom this source may supply any future markets located in the west,\r\nand might compete with the Japanese sulphur which has formerly been\r\nimported in our Pacific Coast States.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL OF SULPHUR AND PYRITE\r\n\r\nThe political control of the important sulphur deposits of the world\r\nprimarily corresponds to the countries in which they are located. In\r\nthe case of the United States, the deposits are controlled by private\r\ncompanies. As a strictly war measure, control was exercised over the\r\nallocation and distribution of the output. In Italy the government\r\nhad assumed control of the output and marketing of sulphur. This was\r\nlargely brought about by the competition of American sulphur and\r\nthe consequent depression of the Italian industry. In 1906 what was\r\nknown as the Consorzia Obbligatoria was organized under a law passed\r\nby the Italian Parliament, which provided that this company should\r\nbe administered by a royal commissioner appointed by the Italian\r\ngovernment. Under this law producers were obliged to sell their\r\noutput to this company, which had control of prices and exports. In\r\n1910 restrictions on the granting of new concessions were made. The\r\narguments recently presented for the continuance of government control\r\nwere the increasing foreign competition, the large war increase in\r\nUnited States production, the minor increase of Japanese production and\r\nthe possibilities of developments in northern Africa. The intent of\r\nthis governmental control of the industry is to combine and regulate\r\nthe efforts of individual producers in order to effectively meet future\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL OF SULPHUR AND PYRITE\r\n\r\nBefore 1906 the Italian deposits were largely controlled by the\r\nAnglo-Sicilian Sulphur Co., representing English capital, but since\r\nthat time, when the Italian government undertook to control the\r\nindustry, the commercial control has been primarily Italian.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the commercial control of sulphur output is in the\r\nhands of three companies, one of which started producing just about the\r\ntime of the outbreak of the European war and another whose production\r\nwas just beginning in 1919. So far as is known, there is no combination\r\namong these three interests. The Union Sulphur Co., which was the first\r\nand principal producer, controls certain patents covering the “Frasch\r\nProcess.” During the war period an agreement was entered into by which\r\nalleged infringement of patents was not pushed. Since the close of the\r\nwar it remains to be seen to what extent the patent rights involved may\r\naffect the production of the other two companies, the Freeport and the\r\nTexas Gulf, which in general use a similar process.\r\n\r\nThe production of sulphur in Japan is commercially controlled by\r\nJapanese interests.\r\n\r\nAn American company, the Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co., owns a\r\nsulphur deposit in Mexico, which was leased, before the war, to German\r\ninterests. Several other deposits in Mexico and South America were\r\nreported as controlled by German interests, but thus far the production\r\nfrom all these sources has been relatively of minor importance and\r\nthere is no immediate prospect of any great change.\r\n\r\nThe significant factor of commercial control in the pyrite situation is\r\nthe large investment of British capital in the Spanish deposits and to\r\na less extent the investment of French capital. United States capital\r\ncontrols the principal pyrite developments in Canada, Cuba, Mexico and\r\nCyprus. English, French and Swedish capital is invested in Norway.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE PRINCIPAL POWERS\r\n\r\nThe _United States_ is the most favorably situated of any nation in its\r\nsupply of sulphur. In the years preceding the European war it produced\r\nabout one-half the world’s supply. Since that time its production has\r\nincreased several fold and it is now the dominating factor in the world\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe relative position of _Italy_, which was formerly of equal\r\nimportance with the United States, is declining. Her cost of production\r\nis increasing, and American sulphur will enter into keen competition\r\nwith the European markets. The resources of _Japan_ are comparatively\r\nsmall and the larger part of her production has been exported. The\r\npost-war conditions will probably curtail the markets for Japanese\r\nsulphur, and there is no likelihood of any increase in Japan’s\r\nposition. England, France and Germany must primarily rely upon other\r\ncountries for their supply of both pyrite and sulphur. _England_\r\nsecures a part of her sulphur supply from a by-product source known as\r\nthe Chance-Claus process, which produces from 30 to 40 thousand tons\r\nannually. In addition she secures large amounts of pyrite from Spain.\r\n_France_ produces some local pyrite, but imports large quantities\r\nof this material from Spain; and before the outbreak of the war\r\nwas securing increasing amounts of sulphur from the United States.\r\n_Germany_ and _Austria_ have some resources in pyrite and probably had\r\nconsiderable stocks of sulphur at the opening of the war. It has been\r\nstated that in order to secure her needs of these materials Germany was\r\nforced to use expensive processes, to reduce the sulphur content of\r\ngypsum, to expand her pyrite production, and to increase the output of\r\nsmelter acid. Under normal conditions she will probably have to return\r\nto imports of pyrite from Norway and Sweden, or sulphur from the United\r\nStates and Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nGOLD\r\n\r\nBY JOHN E. ORCHARD\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF GOLD\r\n\r\nThe physical properties of gold and the difficulties connected\r\nwith obtaining it have made gold through all the ages one of the\r\nmost precious of the metals. Because of its luster, its color, and\r\nits indestructibility, it was shaped by primitive man into rings,\r\nbracelets, and other ornaments. These same properties, together with\r\nits divisibility, early led to the use of gold as a trading counter,\r\nand in all but the most primitive societies it has been regarded as a\r\nmeasure of value and a medium of exchange. The earliest known reference\r\nto gold is a reference to its use in trade, and is contained in an\r\nedict of Menes of Egypt (perhaps 3800 B. C.) fixing the ratio of the\r\nvalue of gold to silver at 2¹⁄₂ to 1.\r\n\r\nAs a medium of exchange gold is used in a variety of forms. The\r\nprimitive trader accepted and gave ornaments of gold in exchange\r\nfor commodities. In mining camps, gold dust and nuggets have been\r\nthe circulating medium. In a settled community under a government\r\npossessing the confidence of the governed, gold coined into counters of\r\nconvenient denominations by the government is accepted without question\r\nin all transactions. For the settlement of balances in international\r\ntrade, gold bullion is used, its value being determined by weight.\r\nToday practically all nations are on a gold standard, and even those on\r\na silver standard in domestic trade have adopted the gold standard for\r\nforeign trade.\r\n\r\nBut gold, though it has many excellent qualities, is one of the\r\nheaviest of metals, and carrying it on the person is inconvenient,\r\nespecially in amounts sufficient for large transactions. Also, through\r\nconstant handling, gold wears away and coins deteriorate in value.\r\nAccordingly a large part of the coins or the gold bullion is kept in\r\nthe national treasury or in the vaults of a bank, and some form of\r\npaper currency is used as the circulating medium. Upon this reserve of\r\ngold, seen only by a few employees of the government or bank, who have\r\nno ownership in it, is built an intricate system of credits and trade.\r\n\r\nIt is true that little gold is in actual circulation and that for\r\ndomestic trade mediums of exchange secured only in part by gold are\r\nbeing used in increasing amounts. Even international exchange is\r\nno longer on the gold standard, but this situation is undoubtedly\r\ntemporary and with the improvement in financial conditions in Europe\r\ngold will be restored to its position as foundation of trade and\r\nfinance, national and international. The circulating medium, whatever\r\nits nature, must be freely convertible, and credit, to remain sound,\r\nmust be founded upon an adequate gold reserve.\r\n\r\nIt has been officially estimated that between the years 1492 and 1894\r\nthe world’s production of gold equaled about $8,000,000,000. Of this\r\namount a little less than $4,000,000,000 was held as gold reserve in\r\n1894, the remainder having been lost or absorbed in the arts or in\r\nthe manufacture of jewelry. Since 1894 the consumption of gold in\r\nthe arts has been between $50,000,000 and $100,000,000 annually, or\r\nfor the 27 years about $2,100,000,000 out of a total production of\r\n$9,000,000,000--almost 25 per cent.[158]\r\n\r\n  [158] JENNINGS, HENNEN: “The Gold Industry and Gold Standard,” 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL OCCURRENCE\r\n\r\nGold is widely distributed, both geographically and geologically. It\r\nis found in about 60 countries in all parts of the world and occurs in\r\nrocks of all ages, from Archean to Quaternary, often in association\r\nwith other metals, as silver, copper, tellurium, lead, and iron.\r\n\r\nGold deposits may be broadly classified as lodes and placers. Lode\r\ndeposits are also known as vein or quartz deposits; and in them the\r\ngold is found with silica or quartz in irregular masses, strings,\r\nscales, plates, and crystals, or more often in microscopic particles in\r\nthe sulphide minerals or the gangue. Much the same methods are used for\r\nextracting the ore as are used in mining silver, lead, or zinc.\r\n\r\nPlacer or alluvial deposits are sedimentary beds of gravel or sand in\r\nwhich the particles of gold, washed from the mother lode, have been\r\nconcentrated by the action of water. Most of the placer deposits lie in\r\nthe open, along the bed of a river, but some are covered by a sheet of\r\nlava or other non-productive rock. The gold occurs as scales, grains,\r\nslugs or nuggets. A number of large nuggets have been found, the\r\nlargest being the Australian “Welcome Stranger,” weighing 2,520 ounces\r\nand valued at about $42,000. Usually, however, the particles of gold\r\nare minute.\r\n\r\nPlacer deposits are worked by one of the following methods, depending\r\non the nature and richness of the alluvium: sluice mining, hydraulic\r\nmining, dredging, or drift mining.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of what has been called the modern era of gold\r\nmining, beginning with the discovery of gold in California in 1848,\r\nmost of the world’s annual production came from placer deposits.\r\nDe Launay estimates that from 1848 to 1875 placers contributed 87\r\nper cent. In more recent years, with the exhaustion of the easily\r\ndiscovered and the easily worked placer mines, the proportion has\r\ndecreased and at present it is probably not more than 10 per cent.\r\nToday the great gold mines of the world are lode mines. The world’s\r\ndeepest gold mine has attained a vertical depth of 5,900 feet.\r\n\r\nAfter making all allowances for further discoveries, students of the\r\nsubject are of the opinion that the world’s gold production has already\r\nreached its zenith and that a decline may be expected.[159]\r\n\r\n  [159] The above discussion of the geological occurrence of gold is\r\n  based mainly on “The Gold Industry and Gold Standard” and other\r\n  articles by HENNEN JENNINGS, consulting engineer, U. S. Bureau of\r\n  Mines.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCommercially important mines are found in every continent, and there\r\nare few regions on the earth’s surface that do not contain deposits\r\nprofitably worked now or formerly. The distribution of gold has played\r\nan important part in the settlement of new lands, notably California,\r\nwestern Canada, Alaska, Mexico, Australia, and South Africa, and will\r\nundoubtedly greatly influence the future movements of peoples. Yet\r\nalthough gold is distributed thus widely, $323,950,000, or over 75 per\r\ncent. of the total amount of gold produced in 1917, came from four\r\ncountries, Transvaal, United States, Australia and Russia.\r\n\r\nThe outputs of the chief producing countries are given in Table 67 and\r\nFigure 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--Although at present surpassed by the Transvaal,\r\nthe United States formerly led the world as a producer of gold. It\r\nis estimated that this country since 1792 has contributed about\r\n$3,913,000,000 to the gold supply of the world, a little less than 25\r\nper cent. of the total produced, and an output greater than that of any\r\nother nation.[160] The United States first became an important producer\r\nin 1850, following the discovery of gold in California. Previous to\r\nthat time some gold was mined in the Appalachian states, the total\r\nprobably reaching $50,000,000.\r\n\r\n  [160] Report of the committee appointed by the Secretary of the\r\n  Interior to study the gold situation.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 the output of the United States was $101,035,000, the highest\r\nmark so far reached. Since that year there has been an annual drop of\r\nabout $8,000,000 in output. The yield in 1918 was $68,646,700 and in\r\n1919, $58,488,800.\r\n\r\nDuring the past four years, eight states, California, Colorado, Alaska,\r\nSouth Dakota, Nevada, Arizona, Montana, and Utah, have produced more\r\nthan 90 per cent. of the gold mined in the United States.\r\n\r\nTABLE 67.--GOLD PRODUCTION OF THE PRINCIPAL PRODUCING COUNTRIES,\r\n1880-1917[161]\r\n\r\n

chief producing\r\ncountries, 1880-1917, based on reports of the Director of the Mint.]\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of gold in a mill race at Coloma, Eldorado County,\r\n_California_, by J. A. Marshall in 1848, the history of modern gold\r\nproduction began. The great rush to California followed and the state\r\nbecame the leading gold-producing region of the world. The output for\r\n1860 amounted to $45,320,000, as compared with a total output of only\r\n$1,000,000 for the remaining states. For many years the gold production\r\nof California has been declining, the total yield in 1917 amounting to\r\nonly $20,000,000, a decrease of almost $2,000,000 from the output of\r\n1916. About three-fifths of the output comes from lode mines and the\r\nremainder from placers.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years _Colorado_ was the leading gold-producing state,\r\nprincipally because of the output from Cripple Creek, Teller County,\r\nwhich was from 1893 to 1908 the leading gold camp in the United States.\r\nRecently the output has fallen below that of California. Over half of\r\nthe yield of the state in 1916 came from Teller County.\r\n\r\nThe earliest discovery of gold in _Alaska_ was probably about 1849\r\nalong the shores of Cook Inlet. In 1879 the gold-quartz veins near\r\nSitka were discovered, and a year later the placers of Juneau. The\r\ndiscovery of the gold placers in the valley of the Yukon was made in\r\n1886 and of those in the Klondike in 1896. Most of the Alaskan output\r\nis obtained from placer deposits, the richest being in the Seward\r\nPeninsula near Nome and in the Yukon basin. The largest producing lode\r\nmines have been those near Juneau; of these the Treadwell was for long\r\nthe greatest gold mine in the world, but it is now inactive. During the\r\npast few years the working of large low-grade disseminated deposits of\r\nthe Treadwell type near Juneau has been undertaken on a scale hitherto\r\nundreamed of, but thus far these ventures (Alaska Gold and Alaska\r\nJuneau mines) have not been financially successful.\r\n\r\nThe gold-producing area of _South Dakota_ is confined to an area of\r\nless than 100 square miles, lying in the Black Hills. The gravels of\r\nWhitewood and Deadwood gulches were first washed in 1875, and in 1876\r\nthe famous Homestake lodes were discovered. At present about 94 per\r\ncent. of the total output of the state is controlled by one company,\r\nthe Homestake Mining Co., the largest producing company in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nFollowing the exhaustion of the famous Comstock lode, demarcated in\r\n1851, _Nevada_ was of little importance as a gold-producing state until\r\nthe discovery of the rich deposits of Tonopah in 1900. At present\r\npractically all the gold obtained in the state comes from the vein\r\ndeposits of Tonopah and Goldfield. Divide is a newly developed camp\r\nbetween these two.\r\n\r\nThere are three main auriferous areas in _Arizona_: the vicinity of\r\nBisbee and Tombstone, Cochise County; the Oatman district, Mohave\r\nCounty; and the Verde district, Yavapai County. Arizona was one of the\r\nfew states to show a larger output in 1917 than in 1916. The United\r\nEastern mine, a new property opened in 1913 in the Oatman district of\r\nMohave County, produced heavily and was responsible for the increase.\r\nThe gold output of Cochise and Yavapai counties is obtained largely\r\nfrom copper ore.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixties and seventies, _Montana_ was second only to\r\nCalifornia in its yield of placer gold. The most famous placers were\r\nthose of Bannack and Alder Gulch and later Helena. Much of the present\r\noutput is obtained as a by-product from copper ores.\r\n\r\nFew mines in _Utah_ are worked exclusively for their gold content, the\r\ngreater part of the yield of the state being derived from copper and\r\nlead ores.\r\n\r\nGold is also mined in _Idaho_, _New Mexico_, _Oregon_, and\r\n_Washington_. Small amounts were produced in 1917 in a number of\r\nthe Appalachian states. Before the discovery of gold in California,\r\npractically all of the gold coined in the United States mint came\r\nfrom the mines of _Virginia_, _Maryland_, _Alabama_, _Georgia_, and\r\nthe _Carolinas_, but since the Civil War their output has not been\r\nimportant. The gold production of the _Philippine Islands_ in 1917\r\namounted to $1,404,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canada.=--The total gold yield of Canada in 1900 amounted to\r\n$28,000,000, but with the exhaustion of the placer deposits it\r\ndeclined to $8,382,000 in 1907. With the development of vein deposits,\r\nproduction increased steadily from this low point, and reached\r\n$19,235,000 in 1916, and $15,272,992 in 1917, placing Canada sixth in\r\nthe list of gold producers. Three provinces, Ontario, British Columbia,\r\nand the Yukon Territory, yield most of the gold, the remaining\r\nprovinces producing less than 1 per cent. of the total.\r\n\r\nMore than one-half of the Canadian production comes from the Porcupine\r\ndistrict in Temiskaming, _Ontario_, developed in 1912. Other producing\r\ndistricts, though of minor importance, are Kirkland Lake and Munro\r\nTownship, also in Temiskaming, and Long Lake, near Naughton, Sudbury\r\ndistrict.[165]\r\n\r\n  [165] “Production of Copper, Gold, Lead, Nickel, Silver, Zinc, and\r\n  Other Metals in Canada, 1916.” Canadian Department of Mines, Mines\r\n  Branch, 1917.\r\n\r\nAt one time most of the gold output of _British Columbia_ was derived\r\nfrom placers, chiefly from those in the Atlin and Cariboo districts,\r\nbut less than 5 per cent. came from that source in 1917. The main lode\r\nmining districts are West Kootenay and Yale, in the southern part of\r\nthe province.[166] Gold production in 1917 amounted to about half of\r\nthe total for 1916.\r\n\r\n  [166] “Production of Copper, Gold, Lead, Nickel, Silver, Zinc, and\r\n  Other Metals in Canada, 1917.” Canadian Department of Mines, Mines\r\n  Branch, 1919.\r\n\r\nGold has been known in the _Yukon Territory_ since 1869 and the\r\ndeposits have been actively worked since 1881. The greater part of the\r\nplacers of Forty-mile River and all of Sixty-mile River are within\r\nCanadian jurisdiction. In 1897 came the discovery of the Klondike. Gold\r\nproduction reached its height in Yukon Territory in 1900, when the\r\noutput was 1,077,649 fine ounces, valued at $22,000,000. Practically\r\nall of the 1917 production was derived from placer deposits.\r\n\r\nGold was mined in _Quebec_ as early as 1823, but Canada was of little\r\nimportance as a gold-producing region prior to the discovery of the\r\nBritish Columbia placers in 1857. Gold deposits of little economic\r\nvalue are still worked in _Quebec_, _New Brunswick_, _Nova Scotia_,\r\nand _Newfoundland_. Prospecting and development work in _Manitoba_,\r\n_Saskatchewan_, and _Alberta_ indicate that these provinces may become\r\nimportant producers of gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mexico.=--For many years Mexico ranked fourth among the gold-producing\r\ncountries of the world, being surpassed only by the Transvaal, the\r\nUnited States, and Australasia. Revolutions and bandit warfare have\r\nseriously interfered with mining operations since 1911, and the output\r\nof gold in 1917 was little more than one-third of the normal annual\r\nyield. With the establishment of a stable government, able to protect\r\nforeign investments, Mexico will no doubt regain its former position.\r\n\r\nA large part of the gold output of Mexico is obtained as a by-product\r\nfrom lead, silver, zinc, and copper ores. The only true gold-mining\r\ndistrict is the El Oro district of the states of _Mexico_ and\r\n_Michoacan_. The chief producing mines are the Esperanza, El Oro,\r\nMexico Mines of El Oro, and Dos Estrellas. In 1906 the Esperanza was\r\nconsidered, in respect to both actual output and profits earned,\r\nthe most productive gold mine in the world. Since then it has been\r\nsurpassed by mines of the United States and the Transvaal. Another\r\nfamous gold mine of Mexico, the Dolores, situated in western\r\n_Chihuahua_, yields ore whose silver content is almost equal in value\r\nto the gold. _Lower California_, _Sonora_, _Durango_, _Hidalgo_, _San\r\nLuis Potosi_, _Guanajuato_, and _Chiapas_ are all gold-producing states.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Central America.=--At the time of the discovery of America, the\r\nSpanish were attracted to the region now included in the states of\r\nCentral America by reports of fabulously rich mines and of the wealth\r\nof the Indians. A number of expeditions were sent out in search of the\r\ngold and some rich mines were discovered and worked. Gold is still\r\nproduced in Central America, but the total amount is small, being\r\nless than 1 per cent. of the world total in 1913. _Honduras_ is the\r\nrichest of the states in production and _Nicaragua_ ranks second, the\r\nprincipal centers of the gold-mining industry being in the Departments\r\nof Matagalpa and Chontales, and in the district of Cabo Gracias and\r\nPrinzapolka.[167]\r\n\r\n  [167] U. S. Commerce Reports, Supplement 34_a_, 1915, p. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICA\r\n\r\nSouth America was also an important source of gold during the years\r\nfollowing the discovery of America. The early conquerors obtained\r\ngold by plundering the temples, churches, and even the graves of the\r\nnatives. Following the conquest, the Spaniards by means of their slaves\r\nsystematically searched much of the continent for gold deposits. About\r\n15 per cent. ($2,266,000,000) of all the gold produced between 1492 and\r\n1917 came from South America.\r\n\r\nToday South America is of little importance as a gold producer, the\r\ncombined yield of all the countries for 1913 being about 2.5 per cent.\r\nof the world total. The great bulk of the South American production\r\nhas so far been alluvial gold. With the establishment of more stable\r\ngovernments and the improvement of transportation facilities it is\r\nlikely that the production of South America will increase.\r\n\r\nAccording to Maclaren[168] the gold fields of South America are\r\ndisposed in three somewhat sharply separated areas. The chief area is\r\nthat extending the length of the Andes from the Isthmus of Panama to\r\ncentral _Chile_ and including the deposits of Colombia. The second area\r\nis contained in a well-marked petrographic and metallographic province\r\nextending across the rearland of the Guianas and including also the\r\nmines of _Venezuela_ and northern _Brazil_. The third area is contained\r\nin the province of Minas Geraes, Brazil. Some gold is obtained from\r\n_Chile_, _Argentina_, _Bolivia_, _Peru_, _Ecuador_, and _Uruguay_.\r\nThe chief gold-bearing areas of _Colombia_ are Choco, the Department\r\nof Antioquia, and the district lying between the Cauca and Magdalena\r\nrivers. Fairly rich deposits have also been found in Colombia near the\r\nEcuadorian border.[169]\r\n\r\n  [168] MACLAREN, J. MALCOLM: “Gold: Its Geological Occurrence and\r\n  Geographical Distribution, 1908,” p. 619.\r\n\r\n  [169] U. S. Commerce Reports, Supplement 42_b_, 1915, p. 12.\r\n\r\nThe principal mines of _Brazil_ are the St. John del Rey mine, and the\r\nmines owned by the Ouro Preto Gold Mines of Brazil, Ltd., both in the\r\nState of Minas Geraes. The former mine is said to be the deepest in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPE\r\n\r\nAlthough Europe in the past has played an important part in the\r\nproduction of gold, very little is mined at the present time. Previous\r\nto the discovery of America, much of the gold in use came from the Alps\r\nand from _Hungary_. Deposits were also worked in _England_, _Ireland_,\r\n_Wales_, _Spain_, and _Germany_.\r\n\r\nThe only gold mines in Europe of any present economic importance are\r\nin the former empire of _Austria-Hungary_, _France_, and the Urals\r\nof _Russia_. In the south of France gold has been produced along the\r\nstreams flowing from the Pyrenees, and also in the eastern provinces.\r\nAt present only three mines are in operation, which in 1911 produced\r\n2,554 kilograms of gold. The Hungarian deposits are very old, as they\r\nwere worked by the Romans 2,000 years ago. Most of the producing mines\r\nof today are in Transylvania. Russia is credited with producing 5.8\r\nper cent. of the world total in 1913. A small part of this production\r\ncame from the Urals of European Russia, chiefly as a by-product from\r\nother ores, but the greater part was obtained in Siberia. The Siberian\r\ndeposits are discussed below, under Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nASIA\r\n\r\nSince the decline in the Mexican production, Russia ranks fourth among\r\nthe gold-producing countries. Most of the output comes from _Siberia_,\r\nwhich has long been a source of gold, the mines of the Altai Mountains\r\nbeing considered among the oldest in the world. The production of gold\r\nin Siberia from 1830 to date has been estimated by Russian authorities\r\nat approximately $1,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nMaclaren[170] has divided the auriferous areas of the country into\r\ntwo distinct regions, the eastern and western. About four-fifths of\r\nthe country’s production is derived from the former region, which\r\nextends in one fairly narrow auriferous belt from Lake Baikal to the\r\nsouthwestern shores of the Sea of Okhotsk.\r\n\r\n  [170] MACLAREN, J. MALCOLM: “Gold: Its Geological Occurrence and\r\n  Geographical Distribution,” p. 210.\r\n\r\nA number of dredges have been operated in the Ural district. The most\r\npromising property is the Riderlinsky, east of Omsk. In the southern\r\nUrals, most of the mines produce copper, pyrite, or zinc, the gold\r\nby-product making the profits. The Ridder mine, in the Altai Mountains,\r\nis the best-known lode mine in Siberia.\r\n\r\nPlacers are located along the Manchurian frontier on the Onon and Amur\r\nrivers. They are among the most important in Siberia and have produced\r\nover $100,000,000 in gold. The deposits of Irkutsk along the Lena River\r\nare the most important deposits so far exploited in Siberia and are\r\nprobably the richest placers ever discovered. The district produces\r\nabout one-third of the Siberian output. The placers are at present\r\nabout worked out as drift mines, but will continue to produce with the\r\ninstallation of dredges.\r\n\r\nMany engineers believe that Siberia is the richest remaining potential\r\nsource of gold in the world. It has been estimated that the country\r\nwill produce in the future, say in the next 30 or 40 years, about\r\n$6,000,000,000. The unsettled political conditions have greatly\r\ninterfered with mining. Many of the mines were taken over by the\r\nBolshevists, and although it is unlikely that any attempt at systematic\r\nmining will be made, they will probably be robbed of the richer exposed\r\nore before they can be recovered by the owners.\r\n\r\n_India_ has long been regarded as a land of riches. Philologists have\r\nproved, to their own satisfaction, that Ophir, the source of the stores\r\nof gold of Solomon, was located there. In the deserts of northern\r\nIndia lived the gold-digging ants, described by the Greek historians\r\nand later writers and as yet unexplained. Present facts do not bear out\r\nlegend and tradition. In 1913 India contributed only 2.6 per cent. of\r\nthe world’s total production of gold, an amount hardly proportionate\r\nto the extent of the country. The land offers to the prospector an\r\nextremely uninviting field. It has been carefully prospected and\r\nits deposits have been worked assiduously for at least twenty-five\r\ncenturies by a people possessing great patience and considerable mining\r\nskill.[171] The principal modern producing gold mines of India are in\r\nthe Kolar field, where the main reef carries five large mines along its\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\n  [171] MACLAREN, J. MALCOLM: “Gold: Its Geological Occurrence and\r\n  Geographical Distribution,” p. 238-240.\r\n\r\n_Japan_ was one of the chief contributors to the stream of gold that\r\npoured into Europe during the sixteenth century. Portuguese and Dutch\r\ntraders came to the islands to exchange European products for the gold\r\nmined by thousands of natives. The Japanese finally revolted against\r\nthis domination of their trade and expelled the last of the Portuguese\r\nin 1624. A few Dutch were permitted to remain and to trade through\r\ncertain ports, but under most humiliating conditions. Between the years\r\n1601 and 1764, it is estimated that about 3,763,572 ounces of gold\r\nwas exported from Japan. At the present the annual gold production of\r\nJapan, including Formosa, is about $6,000,000.\r\n\r\nMost of the gold-quartz veins of Japan have been worked for many\r\ngenerations and only the poorer sulphide zones remain.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Formosa, which was acquired by Japan in 1895, had been\r\nrepresented by early European travelers as a storehouse of untold\r\nriches. Not until 1890 were the sites of the old workings rediscovered,\r\nthe discovery of flakes of gold during the construction of a railway\r\nprecipitating a rush of Chinese miners to the island.[172]\r\n\r\n  [172] “Mining in Japan, Past and Present,” the Bureau of Mines,\r\n  Department of Agriculture and Commerce, Japan, 1909, pp. 17 and 64.\r\n\r\nThe total output of gold in _Chosen_ (_Korea_) in 1914 approximated\r\n$5,000,000, but at present the output is declining because of the\r\nabnormal rise in the price of chemicals and materials necessary for\r\nmining. The yield for 1918 will probably not exceed $3,500,000, 60 per\r\ncent. of which will be obtained from three mines operated by foreign\r\ncapital. The chief gold-quartz mines of Chosen are included in the\r\nAmerican concession at Unsan in North Pyong-an Province, northwestern\r\nKorea. From these mines is derived about half of the annual gold\r\nproduction of Chosen. Korea also contains a large number of placer\r\ndeposits, mostly small, that have been extensively mined by Koreans.\r\nThe placer deposits of the Unsan district have not yet been worked, but\r\nthose of the Chiksan district are being exploited by the Japanese.[173]\r\n\r\n  [173] U. S. Commerce Reports, February 26, 1914.\r\n\r\nThe small, scattered gold deposits of _China_, both vein and placer,\r\nare worked almost exclusively by the Chinese, as none has been\r\ndiscovered of sufficient richness to attract foreign capital. On the\r\nIsland of Hainan, southeast of the mainland, the Chinese government is\r\noperating mines.\r\n\r\nExploration work carried on in China up to the present does not\r\nindicate that the country will ever become an important producer\r\nof gold. Even in the provinces contributing most of the present\r\noutput--Manchuria, Yunnan, and Szechuen--the gold industry gives little\r\npromise of growth. During the years 1911, 1912, and 1913, 700 streams\r\nwere examined in the last two provinces and gold was found in 430, but\r\nin no case in sufficient quantity to pay for working.\r\n\r\nThere have been many rumors concerning the gold deposits of the vast\r\nand unexplored territory of Tibet since the very earliest expeditions\r\nto that country but the field is still closed to modern enterprise\r\nand even to careful scientific examination. Despite previous reports,\r\nit has been stated by the geologist accompanying a British expedition\r\nabout 10 years ago that the mineral value of Tibet was not easily\r\napparent. Near the frontier of the State of Bhutan there are many\r\ncolonies of gold washers. The Tibetan gold is found in nuggets as\r\nwell as in spangles and dust, but the Tibetans are said to be careful\r\nto leave the nuggets intact, or to replace them if disturbed, under\r\nthe belief that they are living and are the parents of the spangles\r\nand dust, or the roots from which new gold grows, which latter would\r\ndisappear were the lumps removed.[174]\r\n\r\n  [174] U. S. Commerce Reports, February 26, 1914.\r\n\r\n_Siam_, _Burma_, _Indo-China_, and the _Federated Malay States_ at\r\npresent contribute only a small part of the gold production of Asia.\r\nExploration and prospecting are proceeding actively and the results\r\nto date are favorable. Future developments may substantiate the\r\nstatements of the ancient writers and cartographers that there was\r\nmuch gold in this region. Gold and other minerals are known to exist\r\nin _Afghanistan_, but with the exception of a gold mine near Kandahar,\r\nin charge of a European, the mineral resources are almost entirely\r\nundeveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFRICA\r\n\r\nSince 1905 _South Africa_, including Transvaal, Cape Colony, and Natal,\r\nhas been the leading gold producer of the world, a position that\r\nwould have been attained several years earlier had not the Boer War\r\ninterfered. In 1917, gold valued at $186,255,000, or nearly half of the\r\nworld’s output, was produced, the greater part being derived from the\r\nWitwatersrand, or Rand, near Johannesburg, Transvaal. Production in\r\n1918 fell to $174,068,000.\r\n\r\nGold was first discovered in the _Transvaal_ in 1870, but production\r\nwas not important previous to the discovery of gold on the farm\r\nLanglaagte, Witwatersrand, in 1885. The mines are spread along a belt\r\nextending some 62 miles from Randfontein on the west to Holfontein\r\non the east. This belt contains the largest deposit of gold that has\r\never been found in one place, and its gold content probably equals\r\nthat of all the other known gold fields of the world combined. The ore\r\nis not exceptionally high grade, but can be economically treated in\r\nlarge quantities. The deposit, it has been estimated, may represent\r\n$3,000,000,000 to $4,000,000,000 from about 40 square miles, of which\r\nabout half had been extracted by 1916.\r\n\r\nGold occurs both in vein and placer deposits in _Natal_ and _Cape\r\nColony_, but the output is small.\r\n\r\n_Rhodesia_, in seventh place in 1913, has developed rapidly in recent\r\nyears as a producer of gold and now outranks Mexico. According to\r\nPortuguese records, gold was mined in Rhodesia as early as 1788.\r\nThe discovery in 1866 of ancient ruins and of ancient gold mines at\r\nZimbabwe gave rise to the hypothesis that Rhodesia was the Ophir of\r\nthe Scriptures. Although numerous attempts were made to open the gold\r\nfields, no measure of success was obtained until 1891, and only during\r\nthe present century has the true character of the Rhodesian gold-quartz\r\nveins been recognized. The settlement of the country and the\r\ndevelopment of the mines is the result of the efforts of Cecil Rhodes\r\nand the Charter Company.\r\n\r\nThe gold is widely distributed and most of the mines are small. The\r\nfuture of the country as a gold producer would seem to depend upon the\r\noperation of the lower-grade ore bodies by large companies. The Shamva\r\nmine is a conspicuous example.\r\n\r\n_West Africa_, especially the Gold Coast, is the only region of Africa,\r\nother than the Transvaal and Rhodesia, producing gold in important\r\nquantities. The output of the British West Africa colonies in 1917\r\namounted to about $7,500,000. The unhealthful climate of the region\r\nwill probably prevent for some years any extensive mining operations by\r\nwhite men.\r\n\r\nGold mines are also worked in _Abyssinia_, _Belgian Congo_, _Egypt_,\r\n_French East Africa_, the former _German East Africa_, _Madagascar_,\r\nand the _Sudan_, but the total annual production from all these\r\ncountries is little more than $2,000,000. The rock carvings and the\r\nhieroglyphics of ancient Egypt indicate that northern Africa and the\r\nregion along the Nile River were important sources of the gold of the\r\nancient world.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRALASIA\r\n\r\nFor many years Australasia was a close rival of the United States as\r\na gold producer, frequently outranking this country. Since 1903 there\r\nhas been a rapid decline, and Australasian production in 1917 was less\r\nthan one-half the production of the United States. However, Australasia\r\nstill ranks third and produced 11.3 per cent. of the world’s output in\r\n1913 and about 8.3 per cent. in 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australia.=--Gold was discovered in Australia in 1839 and perhaps\r\neven as early as 1823. Fearing the unsettling effect of gold-seeking\r\non the progress of the colony, the government authorities kept these\r\nearly discoveries a secret for a number of years. In 1851, however, a\r\nminer recently returned from California, discovered gold near Bathurst,\r\nin New South Wales, and a rush similar to the Californian rush\r\nbegan. Discoveries in other parts of the country followed. The vein\r\ndeposits of Australia occur in two distinct areas, well separated both\r\ngeographically and geologically. The first includes the gold fields\r\nof the west and northwest and the other lies along the great Eastern\r\nCordillera of Australia and stretches northward from Tasmania through\r\nVictoria, New South Wales, and Queensland.\r\n\r\nFor many years _Victoria_, the smallest of the states, was the largest\r\nproducer of gold, and up to 1908 had produced about half of the total\r\noutput of the commonwealth. Among the earlier returns were some of the\r\nlargest nuggets known. With the discovery in 1892 of the sensational\r\nfield of Coolgardie, in Western Australia, a state previously believed\r\nto be without mineral wealth, Victoria dropped to second place.\r\nKalgoorlie is the chief town and center of the gold-mining area in\r\nWestern Australia.\r\n\r\n_Queensland_ ranks next to Victoria. A disastrous rush occurred in\r\n1858, and 15,000 to 20,000 men were left starving on the banks of the\r\nFitzroy River. The men were rescued by steamers sent by the governments\r\nof New South Wales and Victoria. A few years later alluvial gold was\r\nfound near Peak Down, Clermont, to the present day the principal placer\r\nregion of Queensland. Charters Towers, the present leading field of the\r\nstate, was discovered in 1872. The Mount Morgan mine is an isolated\r\nmine lying not far from the scene of the ill-fated rush of 1858. It is\r\nby far the most productive mine of Queensland, both in gold and copper.\r\n_New South Wales_, although the first Australian state to yield gold\r\nin any important quantity, now ranks fourth. _Tasmania_ and _South\r\nAustralia_ produce only a small amount of gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n=New Zealand.=--In 1852, the year following the rich discoveries in\r\nAustralia, gold dust and gold enclosed in quartz were found in New\r\nZealand, about 40 miles from Auckland, but this discovery proved to be\r\nof little importance. Ten years later the rich placers of Gabriel’s\r\nGully were discovered, a discovery which attracted a rush from the\r\nAustralian fields. The gold fields of New Zealand may be divided\r\ninto three well-defined and well-separated areas: the Huaraki gold\r\nfield, which contains valuable vein deposits but no placers; the West\r\nCoast area, in which the vein and alluvial occurrences are of equal\r\nimportance; and the Otago area, in which the auriferous alluvial\r\ngravels are important and the few known quartz veins have little\r\neconomic value.\r\n\r\nSome gold is produced in other parts of Australasia, notably in the\r\n_British_ and _Dutch East Indies_, and in _British New Guinea_.\r\nDeposits of little importance are reported in _New Caledonia_, the\r\n_Fiji Islands_, and in the former _German New Guinea_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBABLE CHANGES IN KNOWN GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE\r\n\r\nSpecific predictions regarding changes in the geographical distribution\r\nof the sources of the world’s gold seem valueless. During the last\r\nfew years the gold production of the principal fields has decreased.\r\nAside from any decline due to the war and the attending scarcity of\r\nlabor and high mining costs, it seems probable that the gold output\r\nof the world has reached its zenith and that further decline is to be\r\nexpected unless new ore bodies are added to known reserves or unless\r\nsome revolutionary method of extracting gold from the low-grade ores is\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nAlthough the leading fields, South Africa, the United States,\r\nand Australia, seem to have reached or passed their period of\r\ngreatest output, there are a number of fields in unsettled and\r\nunexplored regions of the world which may be expected to show\r\nincreased production. The possibilities of Siberia have already been\r\nmentioned, and it is the opinion of many engineers that this region\r\nwill eventually rival South Africa. South America has produced an\r\nenormous quantity of gold, chiefly alluvial, and is expected to yield\r\nan increased output in the future. The future of South Africa is\r\nproblematical.\r\n\r\nDuring the last half century the greatly increased gold production has\r\nbeen due largely to the exploitation of the low-grade properties, this\r\nbeing made possible by improvements in mining and metallurgy. It seems,\r\nhowever, that this development has reached a point where excessive\r\nlabor costs prevent the use of ores of a still lower grade.\r\n\r\nIn general, therefore, the gold output of the world may be expected\r\nto remain static or to decline, at least until the level of prices is\r\nso changed that it is considered profitable to expend capital in the\r\nprospecting and developing of regions hitherto unexplored.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe political control may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n                       Percentage of\r\n          Country     1913 production\r\n  British Empire           62.9\r\n  United States            19.3\r\n  Russia and Siberia        5.8\r\n  Japan                     1.8\r\n  France                    1.4\r\n  Belgium                   0.2\r\n  Central Power             0.55\r\n  Mexico                    4.2\r\n  Other Countries           3.7\r\n\r\n_Great Britain_ controlled politically 62.9 per cent. of the 1913\r\nproduction, through state sovereignty over the Transvaal, Australia,\r\nRhodesia, Canada, and India. Other British possessions contributing\r\nsmall amounts to the world output are British Honduras, British Guiana,\r\nBritish West Africa, British New Guinea, New Zealand, British East\r\nIndies, Egypt, and the British Isles. All gold produced in the British\r\nEmpire must be sent to England.\r\n\r\nThe _United States_ controlled politically 19.3 per cent. of the 1913\r\noutput, practically all of which came from continental United States.\r\nThe Philippine Islands and Porto Rico produced small amounts.\r\n\r\n_Russia_ is one of the principal contributors to the world’s gold\r\nsupply, producing 5.8 per cent. of the 1913 output. Most of this 5.8\r\nper cent. came from the mines of Siberia, and the political control\r\nof that region is still unsettled. _Mexico_, with an output equal\r\nto 4.2 per cent. of the world total, was the largest producer among\r\nthe neutral powers during the war. _France_ controlled 1.4 per cent.\r\nof the world total, a third coming from the mines in France and the\r\nremainder from the French colonies in South America and Africa. _Japan_\r\ncontrolled 1.8 per cent., 1 per cent. coming from the Japanese islands\r\nand Formosa, and the remainder from Korea. The rest of the 1913\r\nproduction, amounting to about 4 per cent., was widely scattered, and\r\nwas controlled by a number of nations of South America, Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nIt should be pointed out that although Great Britain and the United\r\nStates control politically the important producing fields of the\r\npresent, all of which seem to have reached their maximum output, the\r\ncontrol of the fields expected to be important producers in the future\r\nis in different hands.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, particularly during its later months, most of the\r\nbelligerent nations and some of the neutrals placed restrictions on\r\nthe exportation of gold, either as bullion or in manufactured form. In\r\nnormal times gold is allowed to flow freely between nations, as needed\r\nto settle international trade balances.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe commercial control of the gold resources of the world is shown in\r\nTable 68 and in Figure 20. In examining the table and the diagram the\r\nreader should remember that the figures and percentages are at best\r\nonly estimates. Most gold mines are owned by companies whose shares\r\nare bearer’s shares; these are bought and sold in the stock markets of\r\nmany financial centers. Today the control may be in the hands of one\r\ngroup, tomorrow in the hands of another. Because of this ever-changing\r\nownership, it is difficult to determine the nationality of the\r\ncommercial control, particularly when there is any attempt to conceal\r\nthe nationality of the capital invested. Table and diagram, however,\r\nare believed to be approximately correct. The information upon which\r\nthey are based was obtained from mining manuals, the reports of mining\r\ncompanies, the reports of consular agents in the various countries, and\r\nby personal interviews with mining engineers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Political and commercial control of the gold\r\nproduction of the world.]\r\n\r\nTable 68 may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL OF GOLD RESOURCES\r\n\r\n                   Percentage of\r\n     Country      1917 production\r\n  British Empire      63.0\r\n  United States       23.0\r\n  France               5.6\r\n  Russia               2.1\r\n  Japan                1.7\r\n  China                0.84\r\n  Belgium              0.5\r\n  Brazil               0.07\r\n  Germany              0.81\r\n  Mexico               0.21\r\n  Unclassified         1.9\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that political control and commercial control\r\nare closely identical in the case of the British Empire and the United\r\nStates. French control is much more important commercially than\r\npolitically. In other countries, little domestic capital is available,\r\nand political control is much greater than commercial control.\r\n\r\nCommercial control, if different from political control, joins in a\r\ntest of strength with it in periods of emergency or unrest, with the\r\nresult that the stronger subdues the weaker. As regards governments\r\nthat are strong and stable enough, the recent war has demonstrated\r\nthat the elimination of foreign capital invested in a country is easy.\r\nThe United States and Great Britain, in particular, have taken over a\r\ngreat number of companies formerly owned by German interests. Where the\r\ngovernment is not so strong, however, the commercial control, backed\r\nin many instances by the more vigorous home governments from which the\r\ninvested capital comes, wins the day, and political events are thus\r\ndetermined, even to the extent of overturning the weaker government.\r\nThus the overturning of the Boer government and the birth of British\r\nSouth Africa was the result of the clash between British commercial\r\ncontrol and Boer political control.\r\n\r\nThe question of the control of gold stocks is discussed in the report\r\nof the gold committee of the Department of the Interior.[175] The\r\ncontrol of stocks in 1916 is shown graphically in Figure 21 and is\r\ndiscussed more in detail in the section following, “Position of Leading\r\nCommercial Nations.”\r\n\r\n  [175] Report of the committee appointed by the Secretary of the\r\n  Interior to study the gold situation.\r\n\r\nThe gold mines of the _United States_ are controlled mainly by American\r\ncapital. A few of the mines are predominantly British, and shares in\r\nother mining companies are undoubtedly held in London, but the total\r\nproduction controlled by Great Britain is small. It has been estimated\r\nthat in recent years 95 per cent. of the annual output was controlled\r\nby Americans and the remainder by British.\r\n\r\nOver half of the gold mined in _Canada_ comes from the Province of\r\nOntario, chiefly from the Porcupine district. In 1917 and 1918, the\r\nHollinger mine, owned by the Hollinger Gold Mines, Ltd., was the main\r\nproducer. It is one of the greatest gold mines in the world, having\r\npaid over $9,000,000 in dividends up to the end of 1918. The control of\r\nthe company is held in the United States. Another mine of importance in\r\nthe Porcupine district is the McIntyre, owned by the McIntyre Porcupine\r\nMines, Ltd., also American. In the Province of British Columbia, the\r\ngreatest producing camp is Rossland, operated by the Consolidated\r\nMining & Smelting Co., controlled by United States and Canadian\r\ncapital. It has been estimated that about two-thirds of the gold mines\r\nof Canada are controlled by United States capital and the remaining\r\none-third by British capital, including Canadian.\r\n\r\nTABLE

Later figures not available.\r\n\r\nThe gold mines of _Mexico_ are owned by British, American and French\r\ncapital in the order named. The principal mining companies of the El\r\nOro district, the leading gold district of the republic, are El Oro\r\nMining & Railway Co., Ltd., Esperanza, Ltd., and the Dos Estrellas\r\nMining Co. British capital controls El Oro Mining & Railway Co., Ltd.,\r\nand 51 per cent. of the shares of Esperanza, Ltd., the remaining 49 per\r\ncent. being controlled by Americans. The French have been acquiring\r\ncontrol of mining properties in El Oro district in recent years. They\r\nnow own Dos Estrellas Mining Co., and the Mexico Mines of El Oro, Ltd.\r\nBoth companies were previously controlled in London. The Dolores mine,\r\nin the western part of the State of Chihuahua, one of the famous gold\r\nmines of Mexico, is owned by the Mines Company of America, an American\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Stocks of gold in banks, public treasuries and\r\nin circulation in principal countries of the world in 1916.]\r\n\r\nIn the State of Durango, the gold mines, most of which also produce\r\nsilver, are owned by the American Smelting & Refining Co. (American),\r\nthe Bacis Gold & Silver Mines Co. (British), and the Inde Gold\r\nMining Co. (American). Most of the gold-silver mines of the State\r\nof Guanajuato have been developed by American capital. The State of\r\nSinaloa is becoming a gold-producing region; the Palmarito mines of\r\nthe Mocorito district and the Minas de Tajo at Rosario are owned by\r\nAmerican interests. Gold is found in the copper ores of Sonora. Most\r\nof the mines of the district are controlled by Americans.\r\n\r\nThe mines of Chihuahua, Hidalgo, and Zacatecas are primarily silver\r\nmines but their ores carry some gold. In Chihuahua, American capital is\r\nprobably predominant, with British ranking second. During recent years,\r\nGerman interests, through the American Metal Co. and its subsidiaries,\r\nhave been acquiring control of properties in Chihuahua and in other\r\nparts of Mexico. German capital is also invested in Zacatecas, the main\r\ncompany being controlled by A. Goerz & Co., Ltd. The mines of the State\r\nof Hidalgo, the leading silver-producing district of Mexico, are owned\r\nby American, British and Mexican capital.\r\n\r\nThe gold mines of _Central America_[177] are of some importance at\r\npresent, and production may increase somewhat in the future. The mines\r\nare owned for the most part by American and British capital, in the\r\norder named. Subsidiaries of the United Fruit Co., and the Tonopah\r\nMining Co., both American, operate properties in Costa Rica and\r\nNicaragua.\r\n\r\n  [177] “Investments in Latin America and the British West Indies,”\r\n  Special Agent Series No. 169, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic\r\n  Commerce, U. S. Department of Commerce, 1918.\r\n\r\nIn _Colombia_, the leading gold-producing country of South America,\r\nmost of the large companies are British, the most important being the\r\nPato Mines, the Nechi Mines, and the Frontino and Bolivia Mines. A\r\nBelgian company, the Platinum & Gold Concessions of Colombia, Ltd., and\r\na French company, the San Antonio Gold Mines Co., Ltd., have recently\r\nacquired gold-mining concessions. American capital is also invested in\r\nthe industry.\r\n\r\nThe two most important mining companies of _Brazil_, the St. John del\r\nRey Mining Co., Ltd., and the Ouro Preto Gold Mines of Brazil, Ltd.,\r\nare under British management. Some French capital is interested in the\r\nlatter property. Most of the mines of _French Guiana_ are controlled by\r\nFrench companies. In the remaining South American countries gold mining\r\nis of comparatively little importance. Production is controlled largely\r\nby British and American capital.\r\n\r\nThe foreign capital invested in the mines of _Siberia_ and _Russia_ is\r\nmainly British, though Germany is known to have been much interested\r\nin the industry. Some Russian capital, especially that furnished by\r\nthe large Russian banks, was invested in Siberian mining properties.\r\nThe mining laws of the old Russian Empire provided that mineral\r\nproperties could be held both by foreign and Russian companies under\r\nconcessions or leases granted by the crown or under leases from Russian\r\nestates. In many cases foreign capitalists formed holding companies to\r\nacquire a controlling interest in a Russian company in whose name the\r\nproperty was held and operated. Most of these holding companies had\r\ntheir main offices in London and most of the directors were British\r\ncitizens. Control was apparently British. The shares of the companies\r\nwere bearers’ shares, however, and were traded in extensively on the\r\nPetrograd exchange.\r\n\r\nThe most important gold-mining district of Siberia is in the Province\r\nof Irkutsk, on the Lena River. A Russian company, the Lenskoie Gold\r\nIndustrial Co., has been operating the principal properties of this\r\ndistrict since 1863. The directors of the company are Russian Jews.\r\nA British company, the Lena Goldfields, Ltd., held 70 per cent. of\r\nthe shares of the Lenskoie Co., but in 1917 completed the sale of\r\n51,000 shares of stock to a Petrograd group including the Imperial\r\nForeign Corporation, Ltd., and the Russian and English Bank. The Lena\r\nGoldfields, Ltd., now owns less than 10 per cent. of the Lenskoie stock.\r\n\r\nA pyrite-copper mine yielding enough gold as a by-product to make the\r\nprofit is located in the government of Perm, southern district of the\r\nUral Mountains, and is owned by the Kyshtim Mining Works, a Russian\r\ncompany controlled by the Kyshtim Corporation, Ltd., of London. The\r\ncompany holds a large concession, including forests, farms, and mineral\r\nland. The control of the Kyshtim Corporation is apparently British.\r\n\r\nThe Tanalyk Corporation is controlled by practically the same interests\r\nas those controlling the Kyshtim Corporation and was organized to\r\nacquire entire control of the South Urals Mining & Smelting Co. The\r\nproperty of the company, situated in the County of Orsk, Orenburg\r\ngovernment, southern Urals, is only a prospect and has not been fully\r\ndeveloped. It includes a total area of 28,350 acres of timber and\r\nmineral land. The ore contains copper, gold, and silver, the copper\r\ncontent being the most valuable. During 1917, the shares held in\r\nthe Kyshtim Mining Works and the South Urals Mining & Smelting Co.\r\nwere vested in the Canadian Development Corporation, Ltd., a company\r\nregistered in Canada, probably for the purpose of escaping the high\r\nBritish income taxes. The transfer involved no change of control, as\r\nthe two British holding companies, the Kyshtim Corporation and the\r\nTanalyk Corporation, Ltd., control the Canadian company.\r\n\r\nThe Kolchan placer property, in the Okhotsk mining province of Eastern\r\nSiberia, has been leased, for a royalty based on the gross output\r\nof gold, by the Orsk Goldfields, Ltd., a British company, from the\r\nRusso-Asiatic Bank. The Orsk Goldfields, Ltd., originally controlled a\r\ngold-mining property in the Province of Orenburg, southern Urals, but\r\nabandoned the lease and option.\r\n\r\nA great deal of gold is produced in Siberia as a by-product of copper,\r\nlead, and zinc mines. The control of these mines is much the same\r\nas the control of the above-mentioned gold properties--British with\r\nRussian shareholders, chiefly representative of Russian banks.\r\n\r\nJapanese control is being expanded, especially in eastern Siberia.\r\nIt was reported in the Japanese press, in November, 1918, that the\r\nJapanese special financial mission was planning the establishment of\r\na Japan-Russian partnership enterprise similar to the Japan-China\r\nIndustrial Association for the purpose of obtaining from the Russian\r\nauthorities rights in the Siberian mining and forest areas and of\r\nexploiting the natural resources of Siberia. It was proposed that\r\namong the investors in the partnership should be included Russian\r\ncapitalists, the South Manchurian Railway, the East Asia Development\r\nCo., the Japan-China Mercantile Association, and capitalists of the\r\nEntente countries.\r\n\r\nPractically all of the output of _India_ comes from the mines of the\r\nKolar reef of Mysore. There are six large producing companies, as\r\nfollows: Champion Reefs Mining Co., of India, Ltd.; Gold Fields of\r\nMysore and General Exploration, Ltd.; Mysore Gold Mining Co., Ltd.;\r\nNundydroog Co., Ltd.; Balaghat Gold Mining Co., Ltd.; and Ooregum Gold\r\nMining Co. of India, Ltd. The companies are all British and are owned\r\nby closely connected interests. Other operating companies in India are\r\nthe Hutti (Nizam’s) Gold Mines, Ltd., of Hyderabad, southern India; and\r\nthe Northern Anantapur Gold Mines, Ltd., and Jibutil (Anantapur) Gold\r\nMines, Ltd., Madras Presidency, all being British companies.\r\n\r\nIn _Japan_ the state reserves to itself the right of original\r\nownership in all ores, and grants to individuals or companies the\r\nright to work the deposits. Under the law of 1890, a foreigner was\r\ndisqualified from working a mine and was not permitted to become a\r\nmember of a mining establishment, so that the right of working mines\r\nwas exclusively reserved for Japanese subjects. By an amendment of\r\nthe mining regulations in 1900, business establishments organized by\r\nJapanese or foreigners or by both are now permitted to work mines,\r\nprovided such establishments are placed under Japanese laws. A bill was\r\nrecently introduced into the Japanese Parliament proposing to grant the\r\nprivilege of mining and property rights to foreigners. Japanese capital\r\nhas almost complete control of the gold mines of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe principal gold mines are owned by the following companies:\r\nTanak Chobei (Formosa), Mitsubishi & Co. (Sado), Shimadzu Tadashige\r\n(Satsuma), Fujita & Co. (Rikuchu and Formosa), Kimura Kintaro\r\n(Formosa), and Ushio Gold Mine Co. (Satsuma).\r\n\r\nThe most valuable of the mineral concessions of _Chosen_ (Korea),\r\nincluding gold, are in the hands of foreign companies, the majority\r\nof which are American. The Oriental Consolidated Mining Co., an\r\nAmerican company, controls the Unsan mines in North Pyong-an Province,\r\nnorthwestern Korea, the most important gold-producing property of the\r\ncountry. The concession includes 600 square miles on the Anju River and\r\nhas about 21 years to run, with the option of renewal for 15 years.\r\nThe operating company pays $15,000 annually to the Korean government.\r\nOre reserves were estimated on July 1, 1916, at 852,000 tons, valued at\r\n$4,823,000.\r\n\r\nThe Chiksan mines, in South Choonchong Province, are also managed by\r\nAmerican capital. The Suan mines, in Whanghai Province, were originally\r\ncontrolled by a British company but have been leased to an American\r\ncompany. An Italian company owns mines in North Pyong-an Province, and\r\na British company is operating in North Choonchong Province. A German\r\ncompany owned mines, not in full working order, in North Pyong-an\r\nProvince, but the properties have doubtless been seized by the Japanese\r\ngovernment. Japanese and Korean miners own and operate the smaller\r\nmines of the country, the output of which has decreased greatly during\r\nrecent years.\r\n\r\nAlthough the gold output of _China_ in 1917 amounted to $3,600,000,\r\nthe deposits are small and widely scattered and are owned and operated\r\nalmost exclusively by the native miners. Some of the larger mines have\r\nbeen financed by the governments of the provinces. In some provinces\r\nthe owners of mining property are not permitted to seek investments\r\nof foreign capital unless they are unable to finance the property\r\nwithin the province. Prospecting has been carried on in many parts\r\nof the country in recent years, but no deposits have been discovered\r\nsufficiently promising to attract foreign investors. In view of their\r\nactivity in developing the other natural resources of China, it is\r\nprobable that the Japanese will attempt to control the industry should\r\nany important deposits be discovered.\r\n\r\nIn the _Transvaal_ all minerals belong to the government and not to the\r\nowners of the surface of the land. When gold, or any other mineral, is\r\ndiscovered, a part of the territory (less than half) is reserved for\r\nthe owner of the land, another part for the discoverer of the mineral,\r\nand the remainder is open to location. At present the ownership of\r\nmineral lands is being retained by the government. The right to exploit\r\nthe mineral wealth is granted on a lease to the highest bidder, the\r\nbids being based upon a percentage of profits, graded according to\r\nworking costs and grade of ore. A tax of 10 per cent. on profits,\r\nallowing for amortization of capital, is levied on all gold-mining\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nBefore the war, practically all the gold mines of the Witwatersrand\r\nwere controlled by British and German capital. The first American\r\ncompany entered the field in 1917 and some French capital has also\r\nbeen invested. The German position was strong, as the German companies\r\ncontrolled half, and perhaps more, of the capital invested in gold\r\nmines. The report of the South African Custodian of Enemy Property\r\nissued early in 1918 showed that no less than 26,000 enemy shareholders\r\nin gold, coal, and other mining concerns in the Union owned stock to\r\nthe aggregate nominal value of $37,500,000. As gold is by far the most\r\nimportant mineral of the Transvaal, it is probable that the greater\r\npart of this German capital was invested in gold mines. The enemy firms\r\nwere wound up or went into voluntary liquidation, and enemy shares in\r\nmining corporations to the face value of $24,000,000 were taken charge\r\nof by the Custodian of Enemy Property.[178]\r\n\r\n  [178] “Engineering and Mining Journal,” May 11, 1918, p. 888.\r\n\r\nThe control of the gold mines of the Transvaal is centered in the\r\nfollowing six companies: Central Mining & Investment Corporation,\r\nthe Consolidated Mines Selection Co., Johannesburg Consolidated\r\nInvestment Co., the Consolidated Goldfields of South Africa, the Union\r\nCorporation (formerly Ed Goerz & Co.), and the General Mining & Finance\r\nCorporation. The last two companies were absolutely German before the\r\nwar. The Central Mining & Investment Corporation controls probably 50\r\nper cent. of the output of the district. American capital is interested\r\nin the Consolidated Mines Selection Co. Another American company, the\r\nAnglo-American Corporation of South Africa, Ltd., was registered at\r\nPretoria on September 25, 1917, with an issued capital of £1,000,000.\r\nThe immediate object of the corporation is to participate in tendering\r\nfor leases of certain Far East Rand gold-mining areas.[179]\r\n\r\n  [179] U. S. Commerce Reports, December 15, 1917, p. 1033.\r\n\r\nIt has been reported that French capital controls about 10 per cent. of\r\nthe annual output. For many years the majority of the mining engineers\r\nin the Transvaal were Americans.\r\n\r\nThe Germans had not only acquired a considerable control through the\r\ninvestment of capital in mining properties, but they also exercised\r\ncontrol through their trade in mine supplies. Orenstein-Arthur\r\nKoppel Co. had established an important trade in rails, mine trucks,\r\nand similar supplies, and continued to do business even after the\r\nbeginning of the war. Soon after the sinking of the Lusitania, a mob\r\ndestroyed the offices of the company in Johannesburg and burned a stock\r\nof much-needed supplies. At the outbreak of the war it was feared\r\nthat there might be serious obstacles in the way of the gold-mining\r\nindustry continuing a normal course, because of the possible difficulty\r\nin obtaining enough of the cyanide, mercury, and zinc used in gold\r\nextraction, much of which had been previously supplied by Germany. The\r\nnecessary materials were obtained from other sources, however.\r\n\r\n_Rhodesia_ is controlled by the British South African Co., organized\r\nby Cecil John Rhodes, for whom the colony was named. The company is\r\nentirely British; it is the government, levies the taxes, administers\r\nthe laws, and controls the mining industry. Companies and individuals\r\nare permitted to locate mining claims much the same as they are in\r\nCalifornia. The Goldfields Rhodesian Development Co., which has\r\nlarge Rhodesian mining interests, is an offshoot of the Consolidated\r\nGoldfields of South Africa. It is safe to say that the gold mines\r\nof Rhodesia are owned and worked entirely by British capital. A\r\npercentage tax is levied on the output of the gold mines.\r\n\r\nIn _Australia_, before the war, much the same conditions existed as in\r\nSouth Africa. The large gold-mining companies were seemingly British;\r\ntheir headquarters were either in Australia or in London and their\r\ndirectors and managers were British. It is certain, however, that a\r\nconsiderable amount of German capital was invested in the companies.\r\nAmong the important producing companies are the Associated Gold Mines\r\nof Western Australia, Great Boulder Proprietary Mines, Ltd., Golden\r\nHorseshoe Estates Co., Ltd., Ivanhoe Gold Corporation, Ltd., all of\r\nWestern Australia; the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Co., of Queensland; the\r\nMount Boppy Gold Mining Co., and the Mount Lyell Mining & Railway Co.,\r\nLtd., of Tasmania.\r\n\r\nThrough the vigorous action of the Australian prime minister, William\r\nM. Hughes, German capital was expelled early in the war from all\r\nthe industries of the commonwealth, including gold, lead, and zinc\r\nmines, smelters and refineries, and buying organizations. In January,\r\n1916, to safeguard the financial position of the commonwealth, the\r\nprime minister issued decrees providing that no new flotations of\r\ncompanies or increases in the capital of existing companies would be\r\nallowed without the consent of the treasurer of the commonwealth;\r\nthat companies incorporated in Australia would have three months to\r\ndiscontinue the holding of their shares by persons of enemy nationality\r\nor origin, whether naturalized or not; and that in the future no\r\ntransfers of shares to persons of enemy nationality or origin would be\r\npermitted.[180]\r\n\r\n  [180] U. S. Commerce Reports, February 21, 1916, p. 733.\r\n\r\nThe remaining countries of the world are of little importance as gold\r\nproducers; hence a discussion of the commercial control of their\r\nmines would be of little value. In most of them the mining properties\r\nare owned and operated by domestic capital, the former Empire of\r\nAustria-Hungary being one exception to this general statement. Prior to\r\nthe war, British capital controlled gold mines in Transylvania.\r\n\r\nThe ownership of smelters and reduction plants has little influence\r\nupon the commercial control of the gold industry. Most of the large\r\ngold-mining companies have their own refineries at the mines, and\r\nsmelter control is therefore identical with mine control. Some gold is\r\nproduced as a by-product in the smelting of lead, silver, and copper,\r\nparticularly in the United States, where the smelters are controlled\r\nalmost entirely by American capital. Further discussion of the\r\ncommercial control of smelters and refineries will be found in Chapters\r\nXIV, XV, and XXX.\r\n\r\nThe control of secret processes and patents is of less importance in\r\nthe commercial control of the gold-mining industry than that of any\r\nother mineral. The industry is peculiar in that the price of gold is\r\nalways fixed and there is no competition for a market. Control of\r\nan improved method of extracting or refining gold might enable one\r\ncompany to reduce mining and refining costs and thus insure a larger\r\nprofit, but giving the improved process to a second company would not\r\nnecessarily reduce the profits of the company that had discovered it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF LEADING COMMERCIAL NATIONS\r\n\r\nThe _United States_ controlled politically through state sovereignty\r\n19.3 per cent. of the gold production in 1913, ranking next to Great\r\nBritain. Commercial control was somewhat greater, amounting to\r\napproximately 23 per cent. of the 1917 production. The mines of the\r\nUnited States are owned almost exclusively by Americans, and American\r\ncapital is invested in many foreign fields. Over half, perhaps as\r\nmuch as two-thirds, of the mines of Canada are owned by United States\r\ncorporations. The largest of the Korean companies are owned or managed\r\nby American capital. Two American companies were established recently\r\nin the Transvaal. Probably 30 to 40 per cent. of the gold produced in\r\nMexico in normal times comes from the United States owned mines. The\r\nproduction of Central and South America, although at present relatively\r\nunimportant, is largely controlled by Americans.\r\n\r\nAlthough outranked in production by Great Britain, the United States\r\ncontrols by far the largest stocks of gold coin and bullion of any\r\nnation. In 1916 there was in the banks, the national treasuries, and in\r\ncirculation in the United States $2,299,454,000, or almost twice the\r\namount possessed by any other nation. In 1918 this amount had increased\r\nto $3,050,000,000. The monetary reserve probably exceeds the total\r\ngold output of the United States since the recording of statistics of\r\nproduction began.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the national debt of the United States is\r\nlow as compared with the debts of the other principal nations, the\r\nfinancial system of this country is on a relatively sound basis. When\r\nthe time comes to redeem the outstanding bonds and other forms of\r\nindebtedness that have accrued during the war, the United States will\r\nundoubtedly be in a more favorable position than any of the other\r\nbelligerents.\r\n\r\nThe stocks of gold in the chief gold-producing countries in 1916 are\r\nshown diagrammatically in Figure 21.\r\n\r\n_Great Britain_ is the leading gold-producing nation of the world.\r\nThe British Empire controlled politically 62.9 per cent. of the 1913\r\nproduction, and British commercial control approximated 63 per cent.\r\nAn insignificant amount of gold is produced in the British Isles, but\r\nthe empire includes such important gold producers as South Africa,\r\nAustralia, Rhodesia, India, and Canada. British capital also controls\r\ngold mines in Siberia, in Mexico, in South America, and in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nDespite the large political and commercial control exercised by the\r\nBritish, the gold stocks of the British Empire have been much smaller\r\nthan those of the United States and in 1916 were surpassed by those of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe lands under French control produce little gold, the output in 1913\r\nbeing only 1.4 per cent. of the world’s total production. Less than\r\n0.5 per cent. came from _France_ itself and the remainder was obtained\r\nfrom French Guiana and Madagascar. French capital has not stopped at\r\nnational boundaries, however, and has been invested in many of the\r\nprincipal fields, as is shown by the fact that commercial control\r\namounted to 5.6 per cent. of the 1917 production. In Mexico at least\r\n10 per cent. of the capital controlling gold mines is French, and\r\nthe amount is steadily increasing. In South America--particularly in\r\nColombia, and Dutch and French Guiana--some of the large companies are\r\nFrench, but most of the gold controlled commercially by the French\r\ncomes from the Transvaal. It has been estimated that French interests\r\ncontrol about 10 per cent. of the production of South Africa since\r\nGerman control has been eliminated. The gold reserve of France was\r\nlarge before the war and ranked second to that of the United States in\r\n1916. It is now (1920) reduced to very small proportions.\r\n\r\nAlthough _Russia_, with Siberia, is one of the most promising potential\r\nsources of the future gold supply and produced 5.8 per cent. of the\r\ntotal in 1913, Russian capital seemingly controls only a small part\r\nof the gold production of the world. The British are most active in\r\nSiberia, and French interests are known to have acquired property\r\nthere. So far as is known, Russian capitalists control no gold deposits\r\nin foreign countries. In 1916 the gold reserve in Russian banks,\r\ntreasuries, and in circulation amounted to $1,058,000,000, but it is\r\nnot known what has become of this stock since the Bolshevists have been\r\nin control. At present the total is probably much smaller.\r\n\r\n_Japan_ controls only a small part of the gold output of the world,\r\neither politically or commercially. Some gold is obtained from Japan\r\nand Formosa, all of which is probably under Japanese financial control.\r\nThe output of Korea, claimed by the Japanese as a part of their empire\r\nsince 1910 and at present attempting to secure its independence, is\r\ncontrolled by Americans and other nationalities. The smaller mines\r\nare owned by Japanese, but the larger concessions were granted to\r\nforeigners by the old Korean government prior to 1910. Gold stocks of\r\nJapan were estimated at $143,128,000 in 1916. By December 26, 1918,\r\nthey had increased to $225,820,000. In addition Japanese had on deposit\r\nin London, New York, and Paris a total of about $550,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe gold production controlled, either politically or commercially, by\r\n_Germany_ and the countries of the former empire of _Austria-Hungary_\r\nis relatively insignificant, amounting in both cases to less than 1 per\r\ncent. Germany has produced annually in its European territory a little\r\nover $100,000, and its only colony yielding an appreciable amount was\r\nGerman East Africa, lost during the war. The mines of Austria-Hungary\r\nhave been important in the past, but they are now very old and in 1913\r\nproduced only 0.5 per cent. of the world’s total production. It is\r\nunderstood that one of the largest operating companies in Transylvania\r\nbefore the war was British.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe principal and most essential uses of gold are as a measure of value\r\nand a medium of exchange. Gold is also used in dentistry, and in the\r\narts for jewelry, gilding, and other forms of ornamentation. In an\r\nemergency other materials can be substituted for the latter uses, but\r\nany considerable substitution for the principal uses would involve\r\nradical changes in our monetary and financial system.\r\n\r\nGold is found in rocks of all geological ages from Archean to\r\nQuaternary, and also in minute quantities in ocean water. Only the more\r\nconcentrated deposits can be worked profitably. It is believed that\r\nthe production from the present main deposits has reached its zenith,\r\nbut further important discoveries will probably be made in the Arctic\r\nregions, in the tropics, or in other regions hitherto unexplored by\r\nman. Siberia, South America, and perhaps China are the most promising\r\nregions, as the more settled lands have been already thoroughly\r\nprospected.\r\n\r\nGold is widely distributed geographically. It is found in all parts\r\nof the world and commercially important mines are worked in every\r\ncontinent. Over 75 per cent. of the total annual output of the world\r\ncomes from four countries, the Transvaal, the United States, Australia,\r\nand Russia. Other important producers are Rhodesia, Mexico, Canada,\r\nIndia, West Africa, and New Zealand. Little gold is produced in Europe\r\nor in South America. The deposits of the former continent, at one\r\ntime important, are becoming exhausted. With improved transportation\r\nfacilities and with further exploration work, the production of South\r\nAmerica is expected to increase materially.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain controls politically over 60 per cent. of the annual gold\r\nproduction of the world, through state sovereignty over South Africa,\r\nAustralasia, Rhodesia, Canada, and India. The United States ranks\r\nsecond, controlling about 20 per cent. Russia controls about 6 per\r\ncent. and Mexico 4 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent. is controlled\r\nby many countries, among them being Japan, France, Belgium, and the\r\nCentral Powers.\r\n\r\nThe extent of British political and commercial control is almost\r\nidentical, British interests controlling over 60 per cent. of the\r\nproduction and owning in addition to the mines in the empire, property\r\nin Siberia, South and Central America, Mexico, and the United States.\r\nUnited States interests control financially about 23 per cent. of the\r\nworld’s production. The Korean deposits are predominantly American\r\nowned. United States capital is also invested in Canada, Mexico,\r\nCentral and South America, and recently in the Transvaal. Although the\r\ngold controlled politically by France is of little importance, French\r\ninterests control commercially about 5.6 per cent. of the total annual\r\nproduction, owning mines in the Transvaal, in Mexico, and in Central\r\nand South America.\r\n\r\nBefore the war, German interests had extensive holdings in South Africa\r\nand Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nSILVER\r\n\r\nBY F. W. PAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF SILVER\r\n\r\nThe chief and essential use of silver is as money. This form of\r\nconsumption takes place mainly in India and China, where silver serves\r\nas a basis for the settlement of foreign exchange balances. In China,\r\nsilver is the money standard of the country. In India a gold standard\r\nis used, but from time immemorial the natives have hoarded silver and\r\ninvested their savings in silver coins and ornaments rather than making\r\nuse of banks, bonds or other securities. Silver is used for subsidiary\r\ncoinage in all countries, but such coins in Europe and the United\r\nStates can normally be replaced to a considerable extent by paper, as\r\nthey circulate at more than their intrinsic value. In Mexico, Peru, and\r\nother silver-producing countries silver money is extensively used.\r\n\r\nA large amount of silver is used in the arts. To a small degree such\r\nconsumption is for photographic or chemical work but mainly for the\r\nproduction of jewelry and luxurious household wares. The use of silver\r\njewelry in India is intimately related to silver hoards, the bank\r\nbalance of the natives. Such hoards are now mainly coin, however,\r\nbecause coin has become of more stable value than ornaments since India\r\nadopted the gold standard. Before 1914 it was estimated by the Director\r\nof the United States Mint that two-thirds of the new silver annually\r\nproduced went into the arts. In 1912, however, coinage absorbed over\r\nhalf of the 224,310,000 ounces produced by the world. During the war\r\nthe payment by the Allies for goods purchased in the Orient diverted\r\nenormous stores of silver to India and China. In Europe greater amounts\r\nof silver coin were needed under war conditions. Moreover, the large\r\nissues of paper money make corresponding increases in the number of\r\nsilver coins desirable. In 1915 only 20 per cent. of the world’s silver\r\nwas used in the arts; in 1916, 15 per cent. was so used, the balance\r\nbeing coined.\r\n\r\nThe importance of silver for essential uses during the war is best\r\nindicated by the fact that old dead stocks of silver coin, United\r\nStates dollars in the Treasury, Manila dollars, etc., had to be called\r\ninto service. A stage not reached was the melting down of silver plate\r\nand ornaments. This stage was reached in Germany in the case of gold\r\nand probably of silver, just as the United States had begun to adopt\r\nsuch a program to obtain platinum. During 1916 our exports of silver\r\nexceeded $210,000,000, surpassing by $58,000,000 the total copper\r\nexports for the same period.\r\n\r\nAs long as the centuries-old customs of India and China fail to change,\r\nsilver must be considered as ranking with gold as an essential money\r\nmetal of intranational and international trade.\r\n\r\nThe large use of silver in the arts, in the period 1900 to 1914, a use\r\nnaturally considered as entirely a luxury, leads to emphasis upon the\r\nnon-essential character of silver consumption as a whole. When the\r\nEuropean war broke out, prices for silver, in common with most metals\r\nand other commodities, declined. But silver did not increase in price a\r\nfew months later, as did base metals. It was not until the end of 1915\r\nthat silver sold as high as before the war, and during the early part\r\nof the war it sold so low that producers felt discouraged and regarded\r\nsilver as, in the main, an article of luxury.\r\n\r\nOn the other side is the fact that coinage of silver in Europe\r\nincreased tremendously in 1914 and 1915, although it did not seem to\r\noffset fully the curtailment in manufacture of silverware and jewelry.\r\nThis need for coinage continued during the war at an accelerated rate,\r\njust as did the demands for munitions and men. The “silver bullet” was\r\nimportant in Europe, but still more essential in bringing supplies\r\nfrom the Far East to the battle fronts. This fact is confirmed by the\r\nadvance in the price of silver to substantially twice the pre-war\r\nquotation, and had a price not then been fixed the advance would\r\nprobably have been greater. The normal annual silver production of\r\nthe world is around 159,000,000 ounces, whereas the actual demand for\r\nsilver during 1918 exceeded 500,000,000 ounces.\r\n\r\nAll silver used in the arts by no means represents consumption in\r\nluxuries. Silver enters the essential chemical and photographic\r\nindustries to a considerable degree. At least one-third of the silver\r\nconsumed in the arts before the war represented jewelry used in India,\r\nand this use is much more a form of investment by the natives than it\r\nis in Europe and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe United States Treasury Department has been much concerned over the\r\ndeclining output of gold. Priorities during the war were granted to the\r\ngold industry to place it in the position of a preferred war industry.\r\nSilver cannot be considered as being in a different position, although\r\nsilver producers received priorities more as producers of base metals\r\nand gold than of silver alone.\r\n\r\nThe credit and finance of the world is greatly helped by maximum gold\r\nproduction, but of little less importance is a large supply of silver,\r\nfor although gold has become the general standard of money, silver is\r\nstill, as throughout man’s history, one of the two precious or money\r\nmetals. It is at least a crutch to aid gold.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the world silver ranks equal with or as more important\r\nthan gold for a money standard. Elsewhere, in countries where paper\r\ncurrency is freely accepted by sellers, it is not an essential money\r\nmetal, _e.g._, in the United States. However, silver with gold helps to\r\nsupport the credit and standing of paper money in Europe today, and in\r\ncountries with less elaborate financial systems it directly replaces\r\nand so conserves gold.\r\n\r\nSilver then is considered to be an essential metal of the world’s\r\nfinance, trade, and industry. It belongs with the group of vital\r\nmineral raw materials and can not be classed with diamonds or other\r\nnon-essential mineral products.\r\n\r\nThe unlimited mining and production of silver cannot be considered as\r\nan end in itself, as Spain found out in the days of the conquerors. But\r\nthe present silver production is not in excess of the real needs. In\r\nfact there may be expected to be a great shortage of capital because of\r\nthe great destructive effects of the world war. Silver production adds\r\nto the stock of money, increases confidence in financial conditions\r\nand furnishes, with and subsidiary to gold, a basis for credit. In the\r\nimmediate future a maximum silver production may be of as great or\r\ngreater importance to the world than ever before.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nAbout one-half of the silver output of the world is obtained as a\r\nby-product in the winning of other metals, notably lead and copper.\r\nSuch production comes from deposits of all geologic ages. The silver\r\nobtained from high-grade silver ores associated with minor amounts of\r\ngold or base metals is now derived chiefly from Tertiary deposits.\r\nPre-Cambrian deposits are of some importance, _e.g._ Cobalt, Ontario;\r\nbut the Tertiary is the great source of silver ores.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican mines, which are by far the most important as producers of\r\nsilver ores, are associated with Tertiary volcanic rocks. A similar\r\nassociation occurs to the south, in Central America, Peru, and Bolivia.\r\nThe deposits of the United States, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, and Montana,\r\noccur under similar conditions. This is also true of the chief\r\nworked-out deposits of recent silver-mining history--the Comstock Lode.\r\n\r\nA great deal of silver has been mined in Europe in the past, chiefly\r\nfrom rich silver deposits which are now largely exhausted. Geologic\r\nconditions here are obscure, because the mining was completed so long\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mexico and the Rocky Mountain-Andes Cordillera will be\r\nthe chief region for the mining of rich silver ores. The pre-Cambrian\r\nareas of Canada may continue to be of some importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nA generalized table of normal outputs is as follows:\r\n\r\nTABLE 69.--PRESENT NORMAL OUTPUT OF SILVER\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------+----------+---------------+-------------\r\n              Country         |By-product|Straight silver|\r\n                              |  silver  |   deposits    |   Notes\r\n  ----------------------------+----------+---------------+-------------\r\n  Western Hemisphere:         |          |               |\r\n    Mexico and Central America|12,000,000|   60,000,000  |Tertiary\r\n    Peru and Bolivia          |10,000,000|    5,000,000  |Tertiary\r\n    Chile                     | 2,000,000|            ...|Miscellaneous\r\n    United States             |       ...|   23,000,000  |Tertiary\r\n    United States lead ores   |24,000,000|            ...|Miscellaneous\r\n    United States copper ores |23,000,000|            ...|Miscellaneous\r\n    Canada                    |     ...  |   21,000,000  |Pre-Cambrian\r\n    Canada                    | 4,000,000|            ...|Miscellaneous\r\n                              +----------+---------------+\r\n      Total Western Hemisphere|75,000,000|  109,000,000  |\r\n  Eastern Hemisphere:         |          |               |\r\n    Spain                     |       ...|    4,500,000  |\r\n    Austria and Turkey        |       ...|    3,000,000  |\r\n    India                     | 5,000,000|            ...|Burma\r\n    Australia                 |16,000,000|            ...|Broken Hill\r\n    Japan                     | 7,000,000|            ...|\r\n    Miscellaneous             | 2,000,000|    1,500,000  |\r\n                              +----------+---------------+\r\n      Total Eastern Hemisphere|30,000,000|    9,000,000  |\r\n  ----------------------------+----------+---------------+-------------\r\n\r\n                         SUMMARY\r\n\r\n                     Total output,  Percentage of\r\n                        ounces      total output\r\n  Rich silver mines  118,000,000         53\r\n  By-product silver  105,000,000         47\r\n                     -----------        ---\r\n    Total            223,000,000        100\r\n\r\nMexico, the great center for rich silver mines, is now producing less\r\nthan one-half of its normal output, due to the unsettled political\r\nand social conditions. In 1907 the Mexican production declined to\r\n31,000,000 ounces, a loss of over 50 per cent. Consequently in 1917 the\r\nworld’s silver output was only 170,000,000 ounces; and of this amount\r\nmore than one-half was derived as a by-product in refining other metals.\r\n\r\nA striking feature of the distribution of silver deposits is the large\r\nnumber of great producing areas in Mexico and the western United\r\nStates.

The Rocky Mountain-Andes output\r\nshould be maintained relatively at the proportion shown above--Mexico\r\nbeing back to normal in this assumption. This Rocky Mountain-Andes\r\nproduction is all, or substantially all, associated with Tertiary\r\nigneous rocks.\r\n\r\nThe above figures allow in part for the increase in Indian output from\r\nthe new Burma mines.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if silver production will be materially increased in\r\nthe next few years by improvement in metallurgy, milling, or mining\r\nmethods. Silver production is perhaps unique in that a great part of\r\nthe output, produced as a by-product, comes on the market at a rate\r\ndetermined more by the volume of lead and copper production than by\r\ncurrent quotations for silver. Also rich silver mines when discovered\r\ncan be operated at a large profit per ounce. However, high prices for\r\nsilver will stimulate that part of the production which comes from\r\nsilver mines proper.\r\n\r\nThe world’s production increased over one-third during the period of\r\n1904 to 1913. At the same time prices had declined even below the\r\n1893-1894 figures. The increased output was due to production from the\r\nUnited States and from Canada.\r\n\r\nIndependent of price, the Cobalt discovery poured silver on the market.\r\nIndependent of price, the increased lead and copper of the United\r\nStates poured by-product silver on the market.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that discoveries of new silver deposits or enlarged\r\nand improved base-metal mining operations are the factors that will\r\ninfluence silver output. Changes in methods of silver recovery and even\r\nchanged silver prices have no tremendous effect. Even the big drop in\r\nsilver prices in the early nineties was accompanied by no decrease in\r\nsilver production. Instead there was an increase.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe silver output of the world is divided among the various political\r\ngroups as shown in Table 71:\r\n\r\nTABLE 71.--PRODUCTION OF SILVER IN 1917 AND 1913\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------+----------------+-----------+----------\r\n                                |      1917      |   1913    |   1913\r\n                                |   production   |production |percentage\r\n             Country            |    (ounces)    | (ounces)  | of total\r\n  ------------------------------+----------------+-----------+----------\r\n  United States                 | 71,740,000     | 66,801,000|   30.0\r\n  British Empire (chiefly Canada|                |           |\r\n   and Australia)               | 34,001,000     | 50,429,000|   22.6\r\n  France                        |    235,000     |    521,000|    0.2\r\n  Italy                         |    450,000     |    424,000|    0.2\r\n                                +----------------+-----------+----------\r\n                                |106,426,000     |118,175,000|   53.0\r\n  Japan                         |  6,922,000     |  4,716,000|    2.1\r\n  Peru                          | 11,000,000     |  8,351,000|    3.7\r\n  Central America               |  2,369,000     |  2,135,000|    1.0\r\n  Bolivia                       |  2,434,000     |  2,410,000|    1.1\r\n  Russia, Greece, etc.          |  1,000,000     |  1,000,000|    0.4\r\n  Mexico                        | 31,214,000     | 70,704,000|   31.7\r\n  Chile                         |  1,673,000     |  2,000,000|    0.9\r\n  Spain                         |  4,500,000     |  4,232,000|    1.9\r\n  Germany, Austria              |  1,500,000 plus|  7,195,000|    3.2\r\n  Turkey                        |                |  1,509,000|    0.7\r\n  Miscellaneous                 |  1,700,000     |    700,000|    0.3\r\n                                +----------------+-----------+----------\r\n    Total                       |170,038,000     |223,126,000|  100.00\r\n  ------------------------------+----------------+-----------+----------\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\n\r\n=Through Ownership of Mines.=--The production of silver in the\r\nUnited States is all controlled by United States capital. One-third\r\nis controlled by lead-mining interests, one-third by copper-mining\r\ninterests, and the remaining third by silver miners. Moreover,\r\nUnited States capital owns Mexican mining property normally capable\r\nof producing over half of that country’s output. Central American\r\nproduction and the by-product silver of Peru are similarly controlled.\r\nAbout one-quarter of the Canadian production comes from properties\r\nowned in the United States. In all, the capital of the United States\r\ncontrols over half of the yearly output of silver throughout the world.\r\n\r\nMost of the Canadian and all of the Australian, Indian, and African\r\nsilver is controlled by British capital, as is one-quarter of the\r\nMexican production and some from Bolivia, Peru, and Chile. In all,\r\nGreat Britain controls a third of the world’s output.\r\n\r\nGermany probably controls close to 10 per cent. of the world’s silver\r\nproduction. A part of this is produced locally, but the main German\r\ncontrol is in Mexico, the mines owned by Mexicans being taken as, in\r\nthe main, German properties.\r\n\r\nMines owned by Japanese, Spanish, French, or Chilean capital are\r\nresponsible for substantially all the remaining 5 per cent. of the\r\nworld’s silver output.\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL CONTROL THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF MINES\r\n\r\n     Capital          1913 output,\r\n                 percentage controlled\r\n  United States           52\r\n  British                 33\r\n  German                  10\r\n  Japanese                 2\r\n  Spanish                  2\r\n  French, etc.             1\r\n                         ---\r\n                         100\r\n\r\n\r\n=Through Ownership of Reduction Plants.=--As would be expected from\r\nthe geographic location of the silver deposits, the United States and\r\nMexico are the centers of silver smelting and refining. Important\r\nsilver-smelting interests are as follows\r\n\r\n               Company                   Situation of smelters\r\n\r\n  The American Smelting & Refining Co.  United States and Mexico\r\n  The United States S., R. & M. Co.     United States and Mexico\r\n  The International Smelting Co.        United States\r\n  Anaconda Copper Mining Co.            United States\r\n  Consolidated Mining & Smelting Co.    Canada\r\n  Compañia Metalurgica Mexicana.        Mexico\r\n  Compañia Metalurgica de Torreon.      Mexico\r\n  Compañia Minera de Peñoles.           Mexico\r\n\r\nThrough ownership of reduction plants, the United States exercises\r\ncontrol over a somewhat larger share of the world’s silver than it\r\ndoes through mine ownership. Much of the Canadian and Mexican as well\r\nas most of the South and Central American silver production enters the\r\nUnited States either as refined bullion or as ore and base bullion.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that control through reduction plants is about as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nUnited States, ⁴⁄₇; Mexico, ¹⁄₇; Canada, ¹⁄₁₄; Europe and Asia, ³⁄₁₄.\r\n\r\nAs regards silver, this type of control is not at all powerful.\r\nSilver-bearing materials can bear a high transportation charge as\r\nsoon as the first process of freeing from gangue has been completed.\r\nConsequently, ownership of mines, rather than of reduction plants, is\r\nthe vital factor of control over silver resources, so far as production\r\nis concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Through Trade Combinations.=--The world’s output of silver is\r\ncontrolled by the London market. To a small extent this may be due to a\r\ntrade combination; to a large extent it is due to the relations of the\r\nLondon market with consumers.\r\n\r\nFour firms form the London silver market. Silver prices are fixed daily\r\nin London, and this “fixed” quotation controls the price of the metal\r\nin every important financial center throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThere are three refineries in London that handle practically the whole\r\nof the silver bullion that comes on the London market. No silver can\r\nbe bought or sold in London unless assayed by one of the four official\r\nassayers to the Mint, Bank of England, etc. Silver treated by the\r\nLondon refineries and certain bars from European government refineries\r\nare exceptions to this rule.\r\n\r\nThe London refineries produce silver of the fineness ⁹⁹⁶⁄₁₀₀₀ to suit\r\nthe Indian market. Other silver current in the London market has a\r\nfineness of ⁹⁹⁹⁄₁₀₀₀.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Benjamin White: “The care taken to safeguard the\r\nreputation of the London silver market, the high standing of the firms\r\nthat comprise it, and the confidence built up by the methods and\r\npractices adopted to protect the interests of buyer and seller alike,\r\nprovide a strong guarantee that in the future, as well as in the past,\r\nsilver will find its business center in London.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Through Relations with Consumers--England’s Control of Silver.=--As\r\nalready indicated, India and China are the great consumers of silver.\r\nFor the five years preceding 1914, fully 40 per cent. of the world’s\r\nsilver output was shipped from London to those two countries, which,\r\nwith a combined population of over 700,000,000, represent the buying\r\nside of the world’s silver market, just as North America represents the\r\nselling side.\r\n\r\nSince 1914 the capacity of these countries to absorb silver has\r\nsteadily increased and in 1918 it was mainly a question of where the\r\nsilver could be obtained. Current production was inadequate to meet the\r\ndemands, and old stocks of the precious metal were of necessity put on\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nThe world’s silver business consists in getting the metal from the\r\nAmericas to the East. Why send it via London, exposing the precious\r\nmetal to greater marine hazards and losing interest while in transit?\r\nThe main reason is that the chief trade of China and India with western\r\nnations is with England, and the great banking houses that finance this\r\ntrade are in London. These banks purchase silver in London to adjust\r\nexchange balances. Funds to purchase such silver usually originate in\r\nLondon, whether from bills on London, loans from London banks or in\r\nother ways. In addition, London has been the center of the world’s\r\nfinance and foreign trade, and also the center from which the mail\r\nsteamers, the swiftest and cheapest routes to the principal consumers\r\nof silver, have radiated.\r\n\r\nWhen the submarine became a menace the United States shipped silver\r\ndirect from San Francisco to India and China. A large part of the\r\nUnited States production was thus diverted from London, and in 1918\r\nexports of silver from London were far below normal. However, the\r\nofficials of the American Smelting & Refining Co., refiners of over\r\none-third of the world’s silver output, say that they do not expect\r\nthese conditions to continue. The established business of the London\r\nsilver trade, and, of more importance, the relationship between\r\ncommercial London and the silver-consuming countries, will no doubt\r\nquickly re-establish the normal status of London--importer of American\r\nsilver, exporter of the silver needed in the Far East.\r\n\r\nThe American refiner or silver producer is glad to have a steady and\r\nbroad market for his silver, such as is furnished by the four London\r\nfirms. Smelting interests and mines are able to dispose of their\r\nproduct through London; otherwise they would have to deal with brokers\r\nor banks in the Far East. The London firms keep in close touch with the\r\nbig bullion dealers of Bombay, Calcutta, and other cities, which are\r\nthe centers from which silver is distributed throughout India. Silver\r\nfor the Indian imperial coinage, however, is purchased in London by the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Through the Pittman Act in the United States.=--The above silver trade\r\nflow-sheet has recently (1920) been materially changed by the program\r\nof the Government of the United States to purchase domestic silver at\r\n$1 an ounce. If the world price for silver remains below this figure,\r\nall American silver will be absorbed by the Government for about four\r\nyears, or until the 207,000,000 ounces specified in the Pittman Act are\r\nbought. If silver, however, should rise above $1 the flow to market as\r\nsketched above would be resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Position of China and Japan.=--Chinese foreign exchange rates depend\r\nto a large extent on the price of silver. All importers or exporters\r\ndealing with China must deal in the silver market. Although copper\r\n“cash” is the basis of Chinese currency, silver is the standard legal\r\ntender for transactions involving large amounts, and weights of silver\r\nare used as units. Fineness and weight of Chinese coins are manipulated\r\nso that coins issued by the silver-producing states, _e.g._, Mexican\r\ndollars (two varieties), British dollars, Spanish dollars, etc., are\r\nprized by the Chinese because they are uniform in value.\r\n\r\nJapan produces considerable silver, a great deal coming from her\r\nelectrolytic copper refineries. Gold is the money standard and silver\r\nis not used extensively in the arts. Consequently Japan produces more\r\nthan enough silver to satisfy local consumption. The government is\r\nalive to the importance of silver in connection with all dealings with\r\nChina. In 1918, Japanese banks bought up Chinese silver supplies,\r\npaying prices in excess of all other traders. It is believed that\r\nAmerican silver has been flowing into Japan via China and that Japan\r\nseeks to control the Chinese silver market. A large silver reserve is\r\nbeing built up in Japan. On account of the international importance of\r\nthe whole Chinese problem, Japanese activity in silver should be noted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nSilver is used both for money and in the arts, the former use being\r\nthe more important and more essential. In some countries, especially\r\nthose producing silver in large amounts, it is the money standard,\r\neither alone or with gold. In other countries on a gold standard,\r\nsilver is used for subsidiary coinage. In India and China it is used\r\nfor the settlement of foreign trade exchange balances. Normally about\r\ntwo-thirds of the silver produced annually is used in the arts, mainly\r\nfor the manufacture of jewelry and luxurious household wares, though\r\nsome is consumed in the photographic, chemical, and other essential\r\nindustries. During the war more silver went into coinage and less\r\ninto the arts than formerly, as the large issues of paper money made\r\ncorresponding increases in the number of silver coins desirable.\r\nLarge amounts have been exported to the Far East. The war has shown\r\nthat silver should still be considered an essential metal of the\r\nworld’s finance and trade, despite the increasing amounts consumed in\r\nnon-essential uses.\r\n\r\nAbout one-half of the silver output of the world is obtained as a\r\nsecondary product in the mining of other metals, notably lead and\r\ncopper, from deposits of all geologic ages. The high-grade silver ores\r\nare derived chiefly from Tertiary deposits, and it is probable that in\r\nthe future Mexico and the Rocky Mountain-Andes region will be the chief\r\nsources of ores of this type.\r\n\r\nOf the total world silver production over 80 per cent. comes from\r\nthe mines of the Western Hemisphere. For many years Mexico was the\r\nleading silver-producing country of the world, but the unsettled\r\npolitical conditions have so interfered with mining operations that the\r\nproduction for 1917 was less than a half of that for 1911 or 1912. The\r\nUnited States, a close second to Mexico in pre-revolutionary years, now\r\noccupies the leading position. Canada and Central and South American\r\ncountries also produce important quantities of silver. In the Eastern\r\nHemisphere, Australia is the leading silver producer. Smaller amounts\r\nare contributed by Spain, Austria, Turkey, India, and Japan.\r\n\r\nChanges in practice of silver recovery and even silver prices have\r\nlittle influence on silver production. It will be stimulated rather\r\nby discoveries of new silver deposits or by enlarged and improved\r\nbase-metal milling operations.\r\n\r\nThe principal silver deposits of the world are controlled politically\r\nby the United States, Mexico, and Great Britain, the three nations\r\ncontrolling about 85 per cent. of the total production in 1913. United\r\nStates capital controls the entire silver output of the United States,\r\nand mines producing half of the Mexican output, one-fourth of the\r\nCanadian output, and much of that of the Central and South American\r\ncountries, in all something over one-half of the world’s normal silver\r\nproduction. Great Britain controls probably one-third of the world\r\nproduction, chiefly in Canada, Australia, India, Africa, and Mexico.\r\nGerman capital owns probably one-tenth, located partly in Germany but\r\nmainly in Mexico. The remaining silver deposits of the world are owned\r\nby Japanese, Spanish, and French capital. Ownership of reduction plants\r\nis not a powerful form of control in the case of silver. The United\r\nStates owns about four-sevenths of the total smelting and refining\r\ncapacity of the world, the remaining three-sevenths being controlled\r\nlargely by German, British, and Mexican capital.\r\n\r\nAlthough the greater part of the silver produced each year comes from\r\nNorth and South America, the world’s silver market is located in London\r\nbecause of the close relations between English business interests and\r\nIndia and China, the chief consumers of the metal.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government, however, will (1920) purchase all\r\nAmerican silver offered at $1 per ounce, up to 207,000,000 ounces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nPLATINUM\r\n\r\nBY JAMES. M. HILL\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF PLATINUM\r\n\r\nIn past discussion of the uses of platinum some confusion has resulted\r\nfrom the lack of appreciation that all commercial platinum is not the\r\npure metal. The pure metal is required for chemical work of all sorts,\r\nbut for other uses the iridium alloys are used. Electrical platinum\r\ncontains 15 to 50 per cent. iridium, but averages 25 per cent., and\r\njeweler’s platinum carries about 10 per cent. iridium. Palladium,\r\nanother of the platinum group metals, is also of importance, chiefly\r\nin the form of palladium-gold alloys, which can be used to replace\r\nplatinum in the dental and jewelry industries. Rhodium, one of the\r\nrarer elements of crude platinum, has a limited use in electrical\r\npyrometers. Osmium and ruthenium, the remaining members of the platinum\r\ngroup, appear to have little use, though osmium, when properly used,\r\ncan be employed as a substitute of iridium to harden platinum alloys.\r\n\r\nThe essential uses of platinum metals are in the chemical and\r\nelectrical industries, and probably the dental industry should be\r\nclassed as essential. Pure platinum is required in the chemical\r\nindustry for catalysers in the manufacture of sulphuric acid (about\r\n75,000 ounces now in use in the United States) and in the manufacture\r\nof nitric acid from ammonia. For the sulphuric-acid industry, platinum\r\nchloride is the primary material containing platinum. Asbestos or\r\nanhydrous magnesium sulphate soaked in platinum chloride, and then\r\nbaked to drive off the chlorine, forms what is known as “contact\r\nmass,” which is charged into the chambers of contact acid plants. Very\r\nfine-mesh platinum gauze is used for the catalyser in nitric-acid\r\nplants. Some gauze used for this purpose has a reinforcing edge of\r\nplatinum-iridium wire. Pure platinum utensils of various kinds,\r\nincluding crucibles, dishes, tongs, and triangles, are required in\r\nevery chemical laboratory. It is possible to substitute palladium-gold\r\nalloys, or even gold, nickel, nichrome, and silica, for some utensils,\r\nbut no substitutes have yet been found which will entirely replace\r\nplatinum chemical ware.\r\n\r\nPlatinum-iridium alloys have been used extensively by the electrical\r\nindustry, but substitutes are constantly being developed. Tungsten,\r\nmolybdenum, and nickel-chrome alloys are the principal substitutes\r\nused so far, but their use has not done away with the necessity of\r\nplatinum in the industry. The principal use of platinum-iridium alloys\r\nin electrical work is in contact points, and the proportion of iridium\r\nnecessary in the alloys is directly dependent on the intensity of\r\nthe current passing through the contacts and the speed at which the\r\ncontacts move. Probably the largest consumption of platinum alloy is in\r\nthe manufacture of telephone and telegraph equipment, including sending\r\nand receiving instruments, switch boards and relays. There is also a\r\nlarge consumption of platinum for contacts in magnetos used for various\r\nkinds of internal-combustion engines. Automobile makers are, however,\r\ndeveloping starting systems that do not require platinum, so we can\r\nhope for a lessening future demand from that quarter.\r\n\r\nPlatinum has an important use in dentistry, though in emergencies\r\npalladium-gold alloys have been used as substitutes. Seemingly,\r\nhowever, the substitutes are not entirely satisfactory, and it may be\r\nnecessary to go back to platinum for certain dental uses. The chief\r\nuses are for pins for crown work, pins for fastening artificial teeth\r\nto plates, and foil for making molds of cavities in which to bake\r\nporcelain fillings. For the time being, the palladium-gold substitutes\r\ncan be used and perhaps they will be developed so that the use of pure\r\nplatinum in the future may not be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe non-essential use of platinum metals is in jewelry, and it seems\r\ncertain that this misuse of platinum metals must be stopped in order\r\nthat industrial development may continue. It is estimated that for a\r\nnumber of years 50 per cent. of the platinum consumed in the world went\r\ninto jewelry. A large part of platinum-mounted jewelry is in private\r\nownership, and as the value of the metal in a jewel is approximately 35\r\nper cent. of the total cost, it is evident that it would be difficult,\r\nif not impossible, in case of necessity to recover more than a small\r\nproportion of the large quantity of platinum that is in the form of\r\njewelry.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe relative importance of the platinum-producing countries of the\r\nworld can best be judged by the past output, which is shown in the\r\nfollowing table,[181] and graphically in the chart.\r\n\r\n  [181] HILL, J. M.: “Platinum and Allied Metals,” U. S. Geol. Survey,\r\n  “Mineral Resources, 1916,” Pt. 1, 1917, p. 3.\r\n\r\nThe platinum field of Russia is in the Ural Mountains, north of\r\nEkaterinburg. In Colombia, South America, the chief production of\r\nplatinum has come from the headwater streams of the San Juan River,\r\nwhich enters the Pacific near Buena Ventura; some platinum is found in\r\nthe upper reaches of the Atrato River, which enters the Caribbean Sea\r\nnear the east end of Panama. A small amount of platinum and osmiridium\r\nhas come from New South Wales and some osmiridium from Tasmania. Some\r\nof the placers in southwestern Oregon and northern California carry\r\nplatinum as well as gold. Platinum has recently been determined in\r\nconcentrates from several localities in Alaska and Canada, and is known\r\nin some placers in Borneo and India.\r\n\r\nTABLE 72.--ESTIMATED WORLD’S PRODUCTION OF CRUDE PLATINUM, 1909-1917\r\n\r\n(In troy ounces)\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n        Country               | 1909  | 1910  |  1911 |  1912 |  1913 |\r\n  ----------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  Borneo and Sumatra          |    500|    200|    ...|    ...|    200|\r\n  Canada                      |     30|     30|     30|     30|     50|\r\n  New South Wales and Tasmania|    440|    332|    470|    778|  1,500|\r\n  Russia                      |264,000|275,000|300,000|300,000|250,000|\r\n  United States               |    672|    390|    628|    721|    483|\r\n                              +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n    Totals                    |271,642|285,952|313,128|313,529|267,233|\r\n  ----------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------+-------+-------+------+------\r\n        Country               |  1914 |  1915 | 1916 | 1917\r\n  ----------------------------+-------+-------+------+------\r\n  Borneo and Sumatra          |  [182]|  [182]| [182]| [182]\r\n  Canada                      |     30|    100|    60|    80\r\n  New South Wales and Tasmania|  1,248|    303|   222| [182]\r\n  Russia                      |241,200|124,000|63,000|50,000\r\n  United States               |    570|    742|   750|   605\r\n                              +-------+-------+------+------\r\n    Totals                    |260,548|143,145|89,932|82,685\r\n  ----------------------------+-------+-------+------+------\r\n\r\n  [182] No basis for estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF PLATINUM\r\n\r\nPractically all of the platinum metals produced in the world to date\r\nhave been derived from placer deposits, though a little platinum and\r\npalladium have been obtained as a by-product from the electrolytic\r\nrefining of copper and nickel matte.\r\n\r\nThe platinum placers of the world are so definitely related to\r\nintrusive basic igneous rocks, including pyroxenites, peridotites and\r\ndunites, that there is practically no question of the origin of the\r\nmetal. In fact, in British Columbia, Spain, and Russia platinum has\r\nbeen found in place in these types of rocks, and it is reported that\r\nowing to the great value of platinum at present, a project is on foot\r\nto crush and wash certain of the bodies of dunite in Russia.\r\n\r\nPlatinum is not found in all placers derived from basic rocks, but so\r\nfar as known it is rarely found in placers derived from other types\r\nof rocks. Prospecting for platinum placers therefore resolves itself\r\nfirst into a search for deposits of gravel derived in a large part\r\nfrom pyroxenite, peridotite, and dunite. Chromite is a characteristic\r\nheavy constituent of platinum sands and in some deposits can be\r\nrecovered as a by-product in mining. Olivine is also present in\r\nconsiderable amounts. Magnetite and ilmenite are ordinarily present in\r\nthe concentrates from platinum placers, but are more characteristic of\r\nplacers in which gold is the most valuable constituent.\r\n\r\nA large amount of prospecting has been done in Russia and Spain, based\r\non the theory of origin outlined above. Much of this prospecting\r\nhas been successful in locating platiniferous placers, but many of\r\nthese recent discoveries do not seem to be of commercial worth. It is\r\nnot possible to foretell whether placers derived from basic igneous\r\nrocks will be productive. The most that can be told is that certain\r\nplacers derived from these rocks hold the greatest promise for the\r\nsearcher for platinum. Platinum is such a rare metal and is found\r\nin such small quantities in its mother rock that it is necessary to\r\nhave certain physiographic conditions present to predicate commercial\r\ndeposits. Most important of these conditions is extremely prolonged or\r\nvery rapid weathering of the primary deposits. In the Russian field,\r\nrock-weathering has been in progress for great geologic time; on the\r\nother hand, in Colombia, South America, the period of weathering seems\r\nto have been relatively short, but so rapid that the same result has\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, platinum is not found in commercial quantities in gravels\r\nthat have not been reconcentrated, and the richer deposits of the world\r\nseem to be the results of repeated reconcentrations of platinum-bearing\r\nmaterial. Crude or placer platinum is not pure metal, but contains,\r\nbesides other metals of the platinum group, more or less iron, nickel,\r\nand copper. Russian crude platinum is ordinarily sold on the assumption\r\nthat it contains 83 per cent. platinum metals; Colombian crude, 85 per\r\ncent. platinum metals. Some placer platinum, so-called, carries a large\r\nproportion of osmiridium. Thus the Oregon and California crude platinum\r\ncarries from 25 to 45 per cent. iridium, and Tasmanian platinum is\r\nreally nearly pure osmiridium.\r\n\r\nThe following analyses of Russian,[183] Colombian,[184] and\r\nAmerican[184] platinum serve to illustrate the wide divergence of metal\r\ncontent of crude platinum.\r\n\r\nTABLE 73.--ANALYSES OF CRUDE PLATINUM FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------+--------------------\r\n              North America[183]        | South America[183]\r\n  --------+------+------+------+--------+------+--------+----\r\n          | Cali-| Cali-|      |British |Colom-|Colom-|Colom-\r\n          |fornia|fornia|Oregon|Columbia|  bia |  bia |  bia\r\n  --------+------+------+------+--------+------+------+------\r\n  Pt.     | 85.50| 63.30| 51.45|  72.07 | 86.20| 86.16| 80.00\r\n  Ir.     |  1.05|  0.70|  0.40|   1.14 |  0.85|  1.09|  1.55\r\n  Rh.     |  1.00|  1.80|  0.65|   2.57 |  1.40|  2.16|  2.50\r\n  Pd.     |  0.60|  0.10|  0.15|   0.19 |  0.50|  0.35|  1.00\r\n  Os.     |   ...|   ...|   ...|    ... |   ...|  0.97|\r\n  Io₃[186]|  1.10| 22.55| 27.30|  10.51 |  0.95|  1.19|  1.40\r\n  Au.     |  0.80|  0.30|  0.85|    ... |  1.00|   ...|  1.50\r\n  Fe.     |  6.75|  6.40|  4.30|   8.59 |  7.80|  8.03|  7.20\r\n  Cu.     |  1.40|  4.25|  2.15|   3.39 |  0.60|  0.40|  0.65\r\n  Sand.   |  2.95|   ...|  3.00|   1.69 |  0.40|   ...|  4.35\r\n  --------+------+------+------+--------+------+------+------\r\n          |101.15| 99.40|100.25| 100.15 |100.25|100.35|100.15\r\n  --------+------+------+------+--------+------+------+------\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------+\r\n                  Oceania[185]             |\r\n  --------+------+--------+---------+------+\r\n          |Borneo|N.

The principal placer deposits rich\r\nin platinum are in the central Urals, in the Perm government, near\r\nNishni-Tagilsk, Nishni-Turinsk, and Verkhoturshi. The richer deposits\r\nare on the eastern slope of the mountains, principally on the Iss\r\nand Veeya tributaries of the Tura River of the Obi drainage. Several\r\nimportant placers are found on the west slope of the mountains on the\r\nheadwaters of the Chusovaia and Kama rivers of the Volga drainage.\r\nNear Nishni-Tagilsk platiniferous placers occur both on the Taguil, a\r\ntributary of the Obi, and on the Martian, a headwater stream of the\r\nVolga drainage. In these placers platinum is the predominant metal,\r\nbut gold is also found. The greater part of the output in the past has\r\nbeen by hand-washing, but of recent years much of the ground has been\r\nreworked by dredges, though it is still safe to say that over 75 per\r\ncent. of the output is from hand labor. It is hardly practicable in a\r\nreport of this sort to discuss in detail the individual deposits, even\r\nwere the information at hand. The best information available can be\r\nsummarized as follows: most of the platinum has undoubtedly originated\r\nfrom the disintegration of dunitic, pyroxenitic, or peridotitic rocks.\r\nThe period of weathering has been very long and there have been many\r\nchanges in the drainage systems, which have now reached maturity.\r\nThe stream grades are low; the inter-stream relief is relatively\r\nslight. The platinum has probably been reconcentrated many times and\r\nis at present won principally from present valley gravels, though the\r\npay channels do not always follow the present river channels. Some\r\nbench-ground representing old river channels is worked, particularly in\r\nthe Nishni-Tagilsk region. The pay gravels ordinarily rest on bed-rock,\r\nthough concentration on clay beds forming false bed-rock is fairly\r\ncommon. The pay dirt ranges from a few inches to as much as 6 feet in\r\nthickness. It has few large boulders, but has considerable clay in many\r\nplaces. The overburden ranges from 2 to 16 feet in thickness, averaging\r\n8 to 10 feet. It consists of a thick basal portion of practically\r\nbarren gravel and sand, or clay and sand lenses interlayered with\r\ngravel, which is overlain by 2 to 3 feet of clay sand and vegetable\r\nmatter similar to the “muck” of the Alaskan mines.\r\n\r\nIn shallow ground, up to 3 feet deep, mining is carried on by open-cut\r\nmethods; in the deeper ground shafts and drifting have been employed.\r\nFor the deposits in river channels crude hand dredges were and still\r\nare used for raising the gravels. About 35 more or less modern dredges\r\nwere engaged in platinum mining prior to the war. Clay is so generally\r\nfound in the gravels that specially designed machines have been used to\r\nsave the platinum and the newer dredges have special devices to cope\r\nwith this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Colombia.=--The platinum district of Colombia covers the upper waters\r\nof the Atrato and San Juan rivers in the Choco district of northwestern\r\nColombia. Platinum is known as far north as Bete, on the Atrato, and in\r\nmany of the tributaries of the San Juan which enter from the east. Most\r\nof the platinum exported from Colombia has come from the Condoto River,\r\na headwater stream of the San Juan. It is stated that in this stream\r\nthe platinum constitutes about 75 per cent. of the precious metal in\r\nthe gravel. On the Atrato the platinum content is lower, ranging from 5\r\nto 15 per cent. Platinum and osmiridium also occur in the streams south\r\nof the San Juan drainage, which enter directly into the Pacific, though\r\nlittle authentic data concerning them are available.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Tulio Ospina,[189] Director of the School of Mines,\r\nMedellin, Colombia, platinum is found widespread in conglomerates which\r\ncover an extensive area in the Atrato and San Juan basins. The metal\r\nhas been reconcentrated in the present stream channels from which the\r\nmajor output of platinum comes. According to the statements of various\r\nobservers, there are places on the interstream areas in which platinum\r\nhas been concentrated. These areas are, from all accounts, old stream\r\nchannels. The primary platinum deposits evidently are to be looked\r\nfor on the west slope of the western ridge of the Andes, though no\r\nliterature which gives detailed information on the geology of this\r\nrange has been found. Peridotite, dunite, and other basic igneous rocks\r\nare represented in the platiniferous gravels.\r\n\r\n  [189] Proceedings Second Pan-American Scientific Congress, vol. 8,\r\n  1917.\r\n\r\nThere is almost no information upon which to base an estimate as to the\r\npossible reserves of platinum in Colombia. Little has been published\r\non the subject that gives good data on the geology of the country, but\r\nfrom all accounts it seems safe to assume that Colombia holds much\r\npromise and should be more carefully prospected. Over 90 per cent. of\r\nthe platinum mined in Colombia is won by natives, mostly women, who\r\nraise the gravel in _calabaches_ and wash the gravels in _bateas_.\r\nThe dry season is utilized, for then the low places in the river are\r\nmore exposed. There is one dredge in operation in Colombia at present,\r\nthough other dredging operations have been tried, which, for various\r\ncauses, were not successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canada.=--A small quantity of platinum is produced each year by the\r\nplacer operations on the Tulameen River, in _British Columbia_. The\r\nmetal was derived from a mass of peridotite and dunite, which outcrops\r\nwest of the main drainage. The gravels of this area are apparently\r\nvery deep, but the platinum is found in the upper 8 to 20 feet, in\r\npart concentrated on a false bed-rock. Recent information indicates\r\nthe possibility of dredging a considerable acreage of gravels on the\r\nTulameen in the vicinity of Princeton. Reports were current during 1917\r\nof discoveries of platiniferous placers further north in the Canadian\r\nRockies, but no definite information concerning the size or value of\r\nthe deposits is available.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater part of the yearly output of platinum and palladium\r\nof Canadian origin is a by-product of refining the nickel ores of the\r\nSudbury district, _Ontario_. That a far greater production of both\r\nmetals from this source is possible has been shown by the Royal Ontario\r\nNickel Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n=United States.=--Crude platinum is won in California, Oregon, and\r\nWashington. The dredges at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in\r\n_California_ produce a large part of the placer platinum output of\r\nthe United States, principally because of the great yardage handled\r\nrather than because of any particular concentration of platinum in the\r\ngravels derived from the Mother Lode belt. In northern California the\r\nKlamath and Trinity rivers, particularly the Hay Fork of the Trinity,\r\ncarry platiniferous gravels. In southwestern _Oregon_ platiniferous\r\ngravels have been found at several places on the Illinois and Rogue\r\nrivers. Along the beach from Bandon, Oregon, to Eureka, California,\r\nplatinum occurs with the black sands and has been won at a number of\r\nmines located both on the present strand line and on ancient elevated\r\nbeaches. In the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon and in the Strawberry\r\nRange south of John Day River a few placers have been worked which\r\ncarried platinum. In _Washington_, particularly on the south fork of\r\nLewis River, near Yacolt, platinum has been found, and it is reported\r\non the beaches from the Straits of Juan de Fuca south.\r\n\r\nAll of the platinum-bearing placers in the United States are closely\r\nassociated with chromiferous serpentine derived from peridotites or\r\npyroxenites. The concentration of the platinum has not been great\r\nand the original quantity was not large, so none of the areas seems\r\ncapable of much production. Most of the crude platinum from the Pacific\r\nCoast placers carries considerable osmiridium. As stated before,\r\nthe great bulk of the platinum won in the United States is from the\r\ndredging fields at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains from Butte\r\nto Stanislaus County. The gravels in these fields are the result\r\nof several reconcentrations, but their platinum content can not be\r\nconsidered high. In practically all of the other stream placer areas\r\nthe gravels have not been subject to such extensive reconcentration,\r\nand in some places recent gravels carry platinum. The beach deposits\r\nare the result of repeated concentration. The platinum and gold are\r\nexcessively small, flaky, and difficult to separate from the heavy\r\nsands; they are concentrated in the dark bands of sand caused by tidal\r\nand wave concentration. The lenses are rarely over one foot thick\r\nand taper out in short distances. Correct estimates of reserves are\r\nconsequently almost impossible.\r\n\r\nWithin the past few years a little platinum has been won from widely\r\nscattered localities in _Alaska_, chiefly Dime, Bear, and Sweepstake\r\nCreek placers in eastern Seward Peninsula; the Boob Creek placers,\r\nTolstoi district, Lower Yukon; and the beach deposits of Kodiak Island.\r\nPlatinum also occurs in the Upper Kahiltna drainage, north of Anchorage.\r\n\r\nCopper ores rich in palladium are produced at the Rambler mine,\r\n_Wyoming_, from the Salt Chuck Mine, _Alaska_, and from the Boss mine,\r\nin _Nevada_. At the two former mines the ore is associated with basic\r\nigneous rocks; in the latter mine the ore bodies are in dolomite. The\r\noft-repeated reports of platinum in certain sandstones exposed near\r\nthe Bright Angel trail in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, _Arizona_,\r\nand in certain shale beds in Chester County, _Pennsylvania_, have not\r\nbeen verified, though in June, 1918, the United States Platinum Co. was\r\norganized to work the deposits in Arizona.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Australia.=--Platinum and osmiridium have been won in small quantities\r\nfrom Queensland, New South Wales, and Tasmania. Platinum is also\r\nreported from New Zealand. The greater production has been from the\r\nosmiridium-bearing gravels of the Savage River drainage in the Bald\r\nHills mining district in the northwestern part of _Tasmania_. Little\r\nhas been published concerning the extent of these gravels, which were\r\nderived from the weathering of a series of sediments intruded by basic\r\nigneous rocks.\r\n\r\nIn _New South Wales_, beach deposits much like those of California and\r\nOregon are found from Beachy Head north past Clarence and Richmond\r\nrivers into Queensland. Commercial exploitation of these deposits\r\nseems to have had the ups and many downs of similar undertakings on\r\nour West Coast. Some platinum was obtained from an old buried channel\r\nin the Platina or Fifield district in central New South Wales, where\r\npay gravel 6 to 10 feet thick lies under an overburden of 20 to 80\r\nfeet. The water supply was not in sufficient quantities to warrant\r\nlarge-scale operations. The channel seems small and has been mined\r\nabout as far as is commercially possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spain.=--What may prove to be commercial placer deposits have been\r\nfound in the Sierra Ronda, in southern Spain, about 50 miles northwest\r\nof the port of Malaga. The deposits have been discussed in some detail\r\nby Duparc.[190] Apparently the gravels have not been rearranged by\r\nnature many times, the concentration of platinum is not great, and it\r\nis problematical whether extensive development will be warranted.\r\n\r\n  [190] DUPARC, LOUIS, and GROSSETT, AUGUSTINE: “Etude comparée des\r\n  gîtes platiniferes de la Sierra de Ronda et de l’Oural”: Soc. Phys.\r\n  et Hist. Nat. Geneve, Mem., t. 38, fasc. 5, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Countries.=--A small amount of platinum is produced as a\r\nby-product from gold dredges on the Irawadi River, in _India_, and from\r\nthe tin dredges in the _Dutch East Indies_. Unconfirmed reports have\r\nbeen received of discoveries of platinum in southern _Siberia_, at\r\nvarious places in _Mexico_, and from several localities in _Ecuador_\r\nand _Peru_. Platinum is known to occur in some of the streams as well\r\nas in certain of the gold deposits of the Minas Geraes district of\r\n_Brazil_.\r\n\r\nIn southwestern _Borneo_ platinum occurs in the Tanath-Laut district.\r\nSeveral Russian writers have given information on this region.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBABLE CHANGES IN KNOWN GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE\r\n\r\nAt present the Russian platinum fields are practically idle. The\r\ndredges are for the most part not running and the industry is\r\ndisorganized. It will require considerable expense and several months’\r\ntime to rehabilitate the Russian platinum industry. The known deposits\r\nof the Russian field are becoming exhausted, and the reserves of known\r\nplatiniferous gravels are stated by Duparc to have a life of 12 years,\r\nbased on the pre-war rate of production; or, stated differently, the\r\nknown deposits are capable of producing between 3,000,000 and 3,600,000\r\nounces of platinum before they are exhausted.\r\n\r\nColombia seems to have large reserves of unworked platinum-bearing\r\nground, though so little detailed information is available that it is\r\nunsafe to predict their future. It is safe, however, to point out that\r\nall reports indicate that careful prospecting in the Choco district\r\nwill probably be repaid by the discovery of considerable areas of\r\nplatinum-bearing ground.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian deposits hold some promise of future production. Several\r\nrecent discoveries of platinum along the Rocky Mountains in British\r\nColumbia, from the Tulameen to the Stikeen, indicate that further\r\nsearch may be rewarded. If reports are true, there is a considerable\r\narea on the Tulameen, Willow and Peace rivers which can be dredged for\r\nthe recovery of gold and platinum. The most important Canadian platinum\r\nreserves are in the Sudbury nickel deposits, but present metallurgical\r\npractice will have to be changed to obtain the maximum output of\r\nplatinum and palladium from these ores.\r\n\r\nIn the United States there does not seem to be hope for a considerable\r\nincrease in the output of platinum; in fact, it may be that the\r\nproduction will be materially less when the new refineries for the\r\ntreatment of Sudbury ores are completed in Canada. The placer deposits\r\ncarrying platinum are for the most part relatively small; many of those\r\nin northern California and Oregon can not be worked economically and\r\nfew are available for dredging. As the gold-dredging field along the\r\nbase of the Sierras becomes exhausted, the output of platinum in this\r\ncountry will decline in proportion, barring the discovery of new ground\r\nand deposits of gravel richer in platinum than those now known.\r\n\r\nThe various Australian platinum deposits do not seem particularly\r\npromising, as regards production, with the possible exception of the\r\nBald Hill dredging field, in Tasmania. The Fifield deposits seem to\r\nbe nearly exhausted and the beach deposits in New South Wales and\r\nQueensland are too low grade and the valuable minerals are too erratic\r\nin distribution to appear of much commercial interest.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish deposits have not yet been sufficiently explored to\r\ndetermine their extent, but published reports do not seem to indicate\r\nthat they will prove very large or particularly rich.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nAs Table 74 shows, _Russia_ has political control of approximately 90\r\nper cent. of the world’s supply of platinum. It seems probable that\r\n_Canada_, in the nickel ore of the Sudbury district and in the known\r\nplacers in the Tulameen and Barkersville districts, has control of the\r\nthird largest reserve of platinum. The deposits under the political\r\ncontrol of the _United States_ in Alaska and on the Pacific Coast\r\nare relatively insignificant. _Great Britain_ naturally controls the\r\nplatinum in her colonial possessions, Australia, Tasmania, and India.\r\nThe output of the _Dutch East Indies_, from Borneo and Sumatra, is\r\nrelatively small, although there is a possibility that the production\r\nfrom these countries may be increased. _Spain_ may, perhaps, control\r\na small output of platinum, though it does not seem probable that\r\nthe production from this country will ever be large. A large area in\r\nthe Sierra Ronda Mountains has been set aside by the government for\r\nfurther prospecting under the auspices of the government, and it seems\r\nreasonable to believe, judging from the general mineral policy of\r\nSpain, that in the event of the proving of commercial deposits they\r\nwill be worked under government auspices rather than by private persons.\r\n\r\nAlthough the deposits in _Colombia_ are politically controlled by that\r\ncountry, they are, nevertheless, owned largely by American interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\n\r\n=Through Ownership of Mines.=--Prior to the war, French commercial\r\ninterests practically dominated the platinum industry of _Russia_,\r\nthrough the operations of the Compagnie Internationale du Platine. This\r\ncompany not only had extensive mining holdings but also had contracts\r\nwith the two largest independent Russian platinum producers, namely,\r\nthe Shouvaloff and Demidoff companies, for their entire output. The\r\ncontracts were suspended by the French company shortly after the\r\ndeclaration of war and may not be remade. There are, however, two\r\nRussian companies which are more or less independent of French control\r\nand there are a large number of small miners and peasants who know\r\nno allegiance to any particular buying concern. It appears that at\r\nleast 75 per cent. of the platinum production of Russia is (or was,\r\nprevious to the Bolshevist domination) controlled by the following\r\ncompanies: Compagnie Internationale du Platine (French), Shouvaloff’s\r\ncompany (Russian), Demidoff company (Russian), Nicolo-Pavdinski company\r\n(Russian), and the Platina company (Russian). During 1914 these\r\ncompanies were operating approximately 35 dredges in the platinum\r\nfield, though from the best reports now available it does not seem\r\nthat more than two or three of the dredges were at work during 1917.\r\nThe reader should realize, however, that the production from dredges\r\nhas always been relatively small, as compared with the output made\r\nby other methods. It is estimated that about 80 per cent. of the\r\nplatinum won from the Russian placers is recovered by hand labor by\r\nlessees (starateli) who contract to dispose of their production to the\r\ncompanies owning the ground and pay a royalty for the privilege of\r\nworking. Since the war the peasants and miners are virtually in control\r\nof all the mines and the original operators have little to do with\r\noperation or management.\r\n\r\nThe most important platinum-bearing placers in _Colombia_ are\r\ncontrolled by American financial interests. The General Development\r\nCo., of New York, through two subsidiary companies, controls a large\r\narea in the headwater region of the San Juan River, particularly\r\non the Condoto River. Recently these interests have organized the\r\nSouth American Gold & Platinum Co. The Quito Mining Co. controls a\r\nconsiderable acreage on the Quito River between Quibdo and Istimina.\r\nThere are other small American holdings in the vicinity of Negua,\r\non the Atrato drainage, and on the Tamana and Sipi, on the San Juan\r\ndrainage. Late in 1917 a British company was organized for the\r\ndevelopment of extensive holdings on the Opogodo River, in the upper\r\nSan Juan drainage. If the present conditions are not changed by special\r\nlegislation in Colombia it would seem that American financial interests\r\nwill continue to dominate the Colombia platinum field.\r\n\r\nThe platinum deposits of the _United States_ are apparently largely in\r\nthe hands of small holders, who are citizens of this country. A few\r\nof the large dredges in California, which are producing platinum as a\r\nby-product, are, in part, owned by British capital.\r\n\r\nApparently the beach deposits in _Australia_ (in New South Wales and\r\nQueensland) are worked in a small way by local capital, as are the\r\ndeposits near Platina and Fifield. The Tasmania deposits are controlled\r\nby local capital.\r\n\r\nAs to _Canada_, it is understood that a large part of the gravel\r\narea of the Tulameen River, near Princeton, British Columbia, is\r\ncontrolled by American capital. A few claims on the upper Tulameen\r\nare controlled by Canadian capital. An American company has recently\r\nbeen organized for the purpose of exploiting certain prospective areas\r\nin the Barkersville region, in north-central British Columbia, and\r\nit is understood that Canadian capital has rather extensive holdings\r\non the Peace River, in northern British Columbia, which are reported\r\nto contain considerable quantities of platinum. The nickel deposits\r\nof Ontario, which have a considerable prospective value as producers\r\nof both platinum and palladium, are operated by the Mond Nickel Co.,\r\nunder British control, and the International Nickel Co., under American\r\ncontrol. However, the Canadian government is regulating the operations\r\nof both of these companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Through Ownership of Reduction Plants.=--It is a peculiar fact that\r\nwhile the larger part of the Russian crude platinum is sold through a\r\nFrench company, nevertheless _England_ has refined the greater part\r\nof the output of Russia. The Johnson Matthey Co., of London, is the\r\nlargest platinum refiner in England. Prior to the war this company\r\nis said to have refined about 70 per cent. of the Russian platinum\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nIn _Germany_ the chief platinum refiner is W. C. Heraeus, of Hanau.\r\nThis company is said to be owned chiefly by Dr. Heraeus and the estate\r\nof Heinrich Heraeus. The firm of F. Eisennad & Co., at Offenbach,\r\na small platinum refiner, was acquired by Heraeus’ interests just\r\nprior to the war. G. Seibert, of Hanau, also refines platinum, the\r\noperations being financed by the Seibert Bros., and the Deutsche Gold\r\nund Silberscheidenanstalt, of Frankfort. According to Russian figures,\r\nabout 25 per cent. of the Russian output was refined by Germany and\r\npresumably a large part of the work was done by Heraeus. Heraeus\r\ninterests without doubt predominate the platinum-refining industry of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe chief platinum refiner of _France_ is Quenessen, de Belmont,\r\nLegendre et Cie., which is controlled by the estate of MM. Desmoutis\r\nand Lamaire. Other small refineries are the Lyon Allemand, the Credit\r\nLyonnais, Herique Marrett & Bonnin, and Hesse Fils, all of Paris.\r\nApparently the first company is the controlling factor in the French\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nIn the _United States_ the platinum industry is controlled by Baker\r\n& Co., American Platinum Works, Irvington Smelting & Refining Works,\r\nHanovia Chemical Co., and Charles Englehard. There are several\r\nindependent platinum refiners in the United States, though their\r\ncombined output is less than a quarter of the domestic industry. These\r\nare J. Bishop & Co., Malvern, Pennsylvania; Wilson Co., Newark, New\r\nJersey; Belais & Cohn, New York City; Kastenhuber & Lehrfeld, New York\r\nCity, and Goldsmith Bros., Smelting & Refining Co., New York City\r\nand Chicago, which are operated financially by American capital. The\r\nRossler & Hasslacher Chemical Co., of New York City, also refines some\r\nplatinum.\r\n\r\nPrior to the war there was more or less interlocking of the interests\r\nof Johnson and Matthey of London, Quenessen of Paris, Heraeus of Hanau,\r\nand Baker & Co. of New York. It is generally conceded that prior\r\nto the war Heraeus actually controlled the American interests now\r\ndominated by Englehard. However, when war was declared these various\r\ncompanies, by interchange of their stock, were separated, so that it\r\nnow appears that German money is no longer interested in the English,\r\nFrench, or American platinum industry. It is probable, however, that\r\nboth the English and French companies still hold stock in the American\r\ncompany, though the control of the American interests is now held by\r\nCharles Englehard through ownership of the majority of the stock of the\r\ncompanies mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that there were two government-owned platinum refineries\r\nin Russia prior to the war, though apparently they handle only a very\r\nsmall quantity of the platinum produced in Russia and no platinum from\r\nany foreign countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE WORLD AS REGARDS PLATINUM\r\n\r\nAs explained above, owing to the location of the chief\r\nplatinum-producing regions, Russia has been the source of practically\r\nall of the world’s platinum, though commercially the French controlled\r\nthe marketing of the bulk of the Russian output. Since 1914 practically\r\nno platinum has been exported and what little did get out came mostly\r\nto the United States. The situation of the various countries can be\r\nsummarized as follows:\r\n\r\n_Russia_ normally used little of her own platinum, exporting\r\nit to England, Germany, and France. The country had almost no\r\nplatinum-refining capacity, the industry being controlled by French\r\nand Russian capital with more or less German influence. Since the war\r\nthe platinum mines have not been extensively worked and in fact their\r\nproduction has decreased greatly. Any accumulated stocks of platinum\r\nthat may have been in Russia probably found their way into Germany and\r\ninto Allied lands.\r\n\r\nBefore the war _Germany_ refined about 25 per cent. of the Russian\r\nproduction of platinum; she has no deposits within her own territory.\r\nShe had built up great chemical and electrical industries, which\r\nrequired large stocks of platinum, and probably was in a fair position\r\nwith regard to the metal when war was declared. It seems probable that\r\nthere is a shortage of platinum in Germany at present, for any great\r\nexpansion of either chemical or electrical industries.\r\n\r\n_France_ through her control of the bulk of the Russian output was\r\nin position to have accumulated considerable stocks of platinum, and\r\nthat she did so is indicated by the fact that the government did not\r\nundertake any regulation of the platinum industry until early in 1918,\r\nand it does not appear that any great expansion of the chief industries\r\nrequiring platinum was necessitated.\r\n\r\nAbout 70 per cent. of the Russian, probably half of the Colombian, and\r\nall of the Australian and Indian platinum was sold in _England_ prior\r\nto the war. It is believed that not all of this was refined in England,\r\nfor considerable amounts of crude platinum were exported from England\r\nto the United States; however, large stocks of the platinum metals\r\nwere on hand in England when war was declared. England had to build a\r\ngreat chemical industry during the war, and quickly used what reserves\r\nshe had, so that the government early in the war saw the necessity of\r\ncontrolling the use of platinum metals.\r\n\r\nThe _United States_ has been and will continue to be dependent on\r\nforeign platinum. At present all of the Colombian platinum is coming\r\nto this country. When we entered the war the stocks of platinum in the\r\nUnited States were about 50 per cent. of the normal, and as we had\r\nto build large chemical and electrical industries, those stocks were\r\nrapidly exhausted.\r\n\r\n_Colombia_ has no platinum refineries; apparently she has use for none\r\nof the output of her mines. Before the war her crude platinum was\r\nshipped to England and the United States for refining, but at present\r\nit is all coming to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nAbout 90 per cent. of the crude platinum produced annually has come\r\nfrom the Ural Mountains, Russia. The deposits of next importance are\r\nsituated in Colombia, South America. Small amounts are produced in\r\nCanada (chiefly as a by-product in the refining of nickel ore), in New\r\nSouth Wales, Tasmania, the United States, Dutch East Indies, India and\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nThe political control of the platinum deposits of the world corresponds\r\nto geographical distribution. Russia and Colombia control the principal\r\ndeposits, and the United States, Great Britain, Holland, and Spain the\r\nminor ones.\r\n\r\nPrior to the war, a French company had extensive holdings in Russia,\r\nand in addition had contracts with two Russian platinum producers for\r\ntheir entire output. These contracts were canceled shortly after the\r\ndeclaration of war. The remaining deposits of the Russian fields are\r\ncontrolled by two independent Russian companies and by a large number\r\nof small miners. At present the peasants and miners are virtually\r\nin control of the mines and the owners have little to do with their\r\noperation or management.\r\n\r\nThe principal platinum-bearing placers of Colombia are controlled by\r\nAmerican interests. A British company was organized recently to develop\r\nholdings in the upper San Juan drainage. With the exception of a few of\r\nthe large dredges of California, owned in part by British capital, the\r\nplatinum deposits of the United States are owned by American citizens.\r\nThe platinum deposits of Australia are probably held for the most part\r\nby British capital.\r\n\r\nAmerican capital controls a large part of the platinum gravel area\r\nof British Columbia. A few claims are controlled by Canadians. The\r\ncompanies operating the nickel deposits of Ontario, from which platinum\r\nis produced as a by-product, are American and British.\r\n\r\nAbout 75 per cent. of the Russian platinum has been refined in England\r\nand most of the remainder in Germany. Before the war there was an\r\ninterlocking of the interests of the platinum refiners of the United\r\nStates, Germany and Great Britain, which has been broken as far as\r\nGermany is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nWHO OWNS THE EARTH?\r\n\r\nBY J. E. SPURR\r\n\r\nLet us glance over the preceding studies one by one and see what\r\nsalient features each one contains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUEL MINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Petroleum= is of the utmost present importance and its future\r\nimportance will be even greater. Recently 98 per cent. of the world’s\r\nproduction has been contributed by the following countries in this\r\ngeneral order of importance: The United States, Russia, Mexico, Dutch\r\nEast Indies, Roumania, India, Persia, and Galicia. It is believed that\r\nthe region around the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico will be of\r\nincreasing importance, as will also the Persian and Mesopotamian fields.\r\n\r\nUnited States capital is supreme in the commercial control of the\r\npetroleum industry in the Western Hemisphere; while British and\r\nBritish-Dutch interests easily dominate the petroleum situation in the\r\nEastern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nCommercial control of petroleum is determined mainly through ownership\r\nby operating companies of lands, leases, or concessions. State\r\nownership is rare, although in Argentina the petroleum industry is\r\nowned and operated by the state. The British government controls by\r\ndirect ownership of a majority of the voting stock, the Anglo-Persian\r\nOil Co., which gives it a monopoly of the Persian field, through the\r\nconcession of an area of 500 square miles from Persia to the company,\r\nand closes the field to the enterprise of the United States or other\r\nnations; moreover through ramifications of this company, the British\r\ngovernment is extending its hold to other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the _United States_ the commercial control of the petroleum industry\r\nis in the hands of the “Standard Oil Group.” British and British-Dutch\r\ncompanies in the United States control a production of about 11,000,000\r\nbarrels a year, out of a total of 335,000,000. In the important region\r\nof Mexico, which now takes second place in production, the commercial\r\ncontrol is entirely in the hands of foreigners: American interests\r\ncontrol 65 per cent. and British and Dutch interests 32 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern Hemisphere, the productive field of the _Dutch East\r\nIndies_ is under absolute control of British-Dutch interests, the Royal\r\nDutch-Shell Syndicate. Prospecting licenses and concessions are granted\r\nonly to Dutch subjects and to Dutch companies, and this, with the\r\neconomic monopoly of the controlling British-Dutch interests, prevents\r\nforeign enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe absolute and exclusive control of the great oil fields of _Persia_\r\nand _Mesopotamia_ by the British government will be confirmed and\r\nextended by the extension of the British Empire over those portions of\r\nthe Turkish Empire which she won by force of arms.\r\n\r\nIn _Russia_ the commercial control of the great petroleum industry\r\nseems to be British, the predominant interests being British,\r\nFranco-British, and British-Dutch (Royal Dutch-Shell Syndicate). The\r\nprincipal producing areas in Russia are or were till recently under\r\nBritish military control.\r\n\r\nThe production of _India_ (Burma) is entirely in British hands.\r\n\r\n“The general policy of the British Empire seems to be to control all\r\noil development and restrict operations by foreign capital.” Such\r\nrestrictions by government regulations exist in Australia, Canada,\r\nIndia, Barbados, British Guiana, British Honduras, Trinidad and other\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nIn the oil industry, then, we have a remarkable and striking division\r\nof the world’s wealth between the two great Anglo-Saxon nations,\r\nAmerica and Great Britain. No mineral lends itself so readily as oil\r\nto transportation and hence to commercial control. According to the\r\npresent production, American interests are largely in excess. However,\r\nthe British control of the great fields of the Eastern Hemisphere,\r\nmany of them only partly developed, together with her growing hold in\r\nthe Western Hemisphere, indicates the likelihood that the British grip\r\nof the world’s oil resources and production may in the future become\r\npredominant.\r\n\r\nStriking phases of the situation are that in the case of Great Britain\r\nthe government and the oil monopolies are united, so that to all\r\nintents and purposes the control being obtained is by the British\r\ngovernment direct; while in the United States the control is in the\r\nhands of purely commercial interests, operating without the control,\r\nassistance, or sympathy of the government. American companies may\r\nnot own and operate oil lands in the British Empire, in the French\r\npossessions, or the Dutch colonies, but there are no American\r\nrestrictions on foreign ownership or operation.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Great Britain, furnishing her petroleum and oil bunkering\r\nstations all over the world, and assuring her control of the seas, will\r\nfurther immensely increase her already extensive world domination.\r\n\r\nThe United States has no such program of imperial expansion, but\r\nshe has her Monroe Doctrine, which is to a mild degree an assumed\r\nprotectorate over the Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coal.=--Next let us take up coal, among the most important of all\r\nminerals--source of power, light, and heat, and smelter of iron\r\nand other metals. Here again, as in oil, we find the United States\r\nwonderfully endowed by nature. She is credited with reserves of\r\n3,527,000 million tons out of a total 7,909,000 million in the world,\r\nor practically half of the whole world’s supply. As the world’s coal\r\nreserves are large, the high-grade varieties, so situated as to have\r\ncheap transportation, are of most immediate importance. Great Britain\r\nhas such coal close to seaboard, and so, until the war, controlled\r\nthe export trade all over the world. The industries of America leave\r\nher little coal for export, and her coal is farther from seaboard.\r\nThe efforts of Germany before the war to build up a coal-export trade\r\nwere hindered by the long rail haul; and these deposits are now being\r\nhanded over to France. Besides France, Great Britain, and the United\r\nStates, only Canada, Australia, and China have sufficient reserves\r\nfor extensive export trade. Of these countries, China is the one most\r\nlikely to increase exports, on account of nearness to the coast, and\r\ngood quality of coal.\r\n\r\nAlthough the coals of the United States are not so close to the coast\r\nas in England, they not only constitute by far the largest reserves, as\r\nabove stated, but are also most immediately available, owing to their\r\nshallow depth and the good railway transportation facilities.\r\n\r\nNo natural substance is so universally used, and so necessary to every\r\nindividual, as coal, and hence every individual feels a natural right\r\nto it, and believes that it should be available at a minimum cost.\r\nThis has resulted in several countries in the nationalization of the\r\ncoal industry, as in parts of Chile, Bulgaria, Prussia, and Australia.\r\nIn other countries, as in parts of the United States, the government\r\nretains the ownership of coal lands, leasing them to private operators.\r\nIn England the present conditions point toward the nationalization of\r\nthe coal industry. In France the coal lands belong to the government,\r\nwhich gives concessions for their operation, and receives a royalty or\r\nrental and a percentage of the net earnings of the operator.\r\n\r\nAlthough the United States is pre-eminent among the world’s\r\nnationalities as regards coal, England has the advantage of having\r\nadequate supplies scattered all over the world, in her colonies of\r\nAustralia, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa, Rhodesia, and\r\nBorneo.\r\n\r\nUnlike petroleum, coal is a mineral which does not lend itself readily\r\nto control by commercial combination. The mining and marketing of coal\r\nis a simple matter, requiring relatively little skill or equipment,\r\nso that it is a business open to everybody; and the vast extent of\r\ncoal lands assures a multitude of owners. Therefore the effect of the\r\ncontrol of coal on the world’s commerce and history is almost entirely\r\na matter of political control. Organization among producers exists\r\nin various countries, as in the case of the anthracite industry of\r\nthe United States, but this does not as a rule extend to a central\r\nownership, nor does it usually extend to foreign countries.\r\n\r\nIn coal, then, as well as in petroleum, we find the two dominating\r\nnations are the great Anglo-Saxon powers, England and the United\r\nStates. The United States mines about 40 per cent., or two-fifths of\r\nthe world’s annual production, while the British Isles have produced\r\none-fifth of the production, making them second only to the United\r\nStates. In neither case have the respective governments in the past\r\nattempted to control the mining and the sale of coal, but in England,\r\nat least, it is likely that some form of joint control, participated in\r\nby the government and the miners, will come.\r\n\r\nThe methods of mining necessary for maximum production of British\r\ncoal mines during the war resulted in putting the mines in such poor\r\ncondition that it will be a year or two before they can supply all of\r\nthe former British export trade. The demands of British workmen for\r\nshorter hours (resulting in decreased production) will hinder still\r\nfurther a resumption of large exports. One of the important phases\r\nof this, to England and America alike, is the South American trade.\r\nEngland has always supplied this market, but the United States will\r\nprobably do so for the present, and should take care to do so if she\r\ndesires South American trade, and on the commercial theory of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine. Up till recently, the United States has exported by\r\nsea only about 4 per cent. of her production, whereas England sent out\r\n25 per cent. Our own expanding industries have provided an ample market.\r\n\r\nAside from America and England, there is no dominating factor in the\r\nfuture control of the coal industry in the lands surrounding the\r\nAtlantic Ocean. Germany was a strong factor before the war, but the\r\nloss to France of the Saar coal district, and the possible loss, to\r\nPoland, of the Dombrova field, in Silesia, will deprive her of her\r\nimportance; and the division among several nations of these resources\r\nwill prevent any one of them from becoming a world’s factor in the coal\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIn the lands about the Pacific Ocean, however, the most important\r\nfuture factor is the coal fields of China. No country except the United\r\nStates has larger reserves of high-grade coal ready for development\r\nand not far from ocean transport. It is likely that the Japanese may\r\nattempt this development and the fostering of an export trade in the\r\nOrient. The high-grade coals of the United States are remote from the\r\nPacific Ocean, and could only be available for Pacific trade by the\r\nlong route of the Panama Canal. It is not unlikely, therefore, that\r\nChinese coal may in the future be supplied to our own Pacific ports by\r\nthe Japanese at a less price than American coal can be put there, and\r\nthat through this development Japan may be able to dominate the Pacific\r\ntrade, as England has dominated that of the Atlantic and the Pacific in\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STEEL AND FERRO-ALLOY MINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Iron.=--The iron supplies for the world’s consumption have been\r\nobtained principally from four countries: the United States, Germany,\r\nFrance, and Great Britain. More than one-third of the total production\r\nhas come from the United States, and of the American output about\r\n85 per cent. has come from the Lake Superior district, which alone\r\nproduces annually over 30 per cent. of the world’s total. Next in\r\nimportance to the United States have been Germany and France, and about\r\n80 per cent. of the production of these two countries has come from the\r\nLorraine fields on the border. The annual output of these fields has\r\nbeen 25 per cent. of the world’s production, or nearly as much as the\r\nLake Superior district.\r\n\r\nLinked with the coal industry as it is, no world-wide or even national\r\nmonopolies of iron ore have been attempted. The greatest single\r\ncommercial organization in the world is the United States Steel\r\nCorporation, with a total annual capacity (in 1913) of over 17 million\r\ntons of pig iron, or about half of the total American production. But\r\nthis organization is not a monopoly, and there are a large number of\r\npowerful independent companies. In France and Germany no dominating\r\norganizations have been noted. In England up to the time of the war the\r\niron industry was controlled by middlemen, and the manufacturers were\r\ninsufficiently organized. To meet this condition (page 86) the British\r\nBoard of Trade Committee advised a consolidation of iron interests.\r\n\r\nExtension of commercial control by the dominant iron-producing nations\r\nto the ore reserves and to the iron industry of foreign countries, so\r\nestablishing that commercial penumbra of empire which is so apt to\r\ndeepen into actual sovereignty, is, however, much more marked in the\r\ncase of iron than of coal, though less significant than in the case of\r\noil. The control by ownership of great iron fields in South America by\r\nEngland and the United States, and the extension of Japanese control\r\nof iron-ore reserves in China, are the most significant features of\r\nthis situation. In France, even before the war, Germany controlled over\r\none-third of the iron and steel business. With the passing of German\r\nLorraine to France, it is likely that much German capital will remain.\r\n\r\nJapan has an iron and steel industry which, although small as compared\r\nwith that of the United States, Germany, and Great Britain, and the\r\nother leading iron and steel manufacturing countries, is rapidly\r\nexpanding. Blast furnaces, steel-making furnaces, and steel mills are\r\nbeing erected in Japan and in Korea, Manchuria, and China by Japanese\r\ninterests. Japan is still very far from supplying her own consumption\r\nof iron and steel, which is a million and a half tons annually.\r\n\r\nIn brief, as regards the world’s iron and steel, the United States has\r\na greatly preponderant position, which it will tend to increase, with\r\nthe desirable tendency of drawing North and South America more closely\r\ntogether. In Europe, France and Germany are oddly yoked in the control\r\nof the second greatest steel industry in the world. In the future\r\ngreat arena of the Pacific, Japan is patiently building up her steel\r\nindustry, with far-reaching Oriental vision. Coal mines and an iron\r\nblast furnace are included in the German “rights” recently acquired by\r\nJapan. Will Japan return Shantung? Did Germany return Alsace Lorraine?\r\nIn her forward-looking plans, Japan has two national rivals--England\r\nand America. She has a vast fertile field to work in, except for these\r\n(especially England)--all of eastern Asia. She has a great disorganized\r\nnation which is no longer a rival--but a field whereon to feed and grow\r\nstronger--Siberia and Russia.\r\n\r\nIn the train of steel, and next after the problems of coal and iron,\r\ncome a number of less-known and less-abundant metals--the ferro-alloys,\r\nmetals that alloy with iron to make steels of special hardness or\r\ntoughness, or with some other special quality. Relatively inconspicuous\r\nas they are, they are indispensable in the industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manganese.=--Manganese is far more than a ferro-alloy. It is\r\nessential in the manufacture of all open-hearth process and Bessemer\r\nprocess steel, which make up 99 per cent. of the total United States\r\nproduction, for it acts as a remover of the carbon which makes the\r\ndifference in quality between steel and cast iron. For this purpose it\r\nis mixed with the iron in the form of alloys. One of these is high in\r\nmanganese--ferromanganese--and one low--spiegeleisen.\r\n\r\nThe principal manganese fields are those of Russia, India, and\r\nBrazil, which are so large and readily available for exploitation and\r\ntransportation to markets that there is little prospect that they\r\nwill be displaced as the principal sources of the world’s supply for\r\nmany years. In contrast with the situation regarding other important\r\nminerals, most manganese deposits throughout the world are owned by\r\nresidents of the countries in which they occur. This is due to the\r\nsuperficial and irregular character of the oxide deposits (the only\r\nones as a rule of high enough grade to find a market) and the simple\r\nnature of the mining and washing of ores, which does not require much\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe United States is poorly provided with high-grade manganese ores,\r\nand hence has always been and will always be a heavy importer. Previous\r\nto the war, the supplies were mostly drawn from Russia and India;\r\nand during the war from Brazil, in addition to an increased domestic\r\nproduction under the stimulus of high war prices. England, France, and\r\nGermany--in fact the whole industrial world--have the same sources of\r\nsupply. There is little necessity of sharp competition, leading to\r\ncommercial combinations, or of strict governmental control, since the\r\nproductive capacity of the principal deposits is very large, and far\r\nexceeds the world’s demand for steel making.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chromite.=--Next in importance in the ferro-alloy group of metals\r\nis chromium, found in nature on a commercial scale only as the oxide\r\n_chromite_. Chrome is used extensively in the steel industry and the\r\nleather industry--in the former for making a specially tough steel (and\r\nalso a refractory lining for iron furnaces); in the latter, for tanning.\r\n\r\nChromite is found in many countries, but in most (as in the United\r\nStates and Canada) in small and scattered deposits, easily exhausted.\r\nThe largest and most important sources of supply are in the French\r\ncolony of New Caledonia, in the South Pacific; in Rhodesia, in Africa;\r\nin Asia Minor; and in the Ural Mountains, Russia. Up to 1830 the Ural\r\nregion supplied the world’s chromium; from 1830 to 1870, the Eastern\r\nUnited States (Maryland and Pennsylvania) became the chief source;\r\nfrom 1870 to about 1900 the scene of chief activity shifted to Asia\r\nMinor; and since then New Caledonian and Rhodesian ores have occupied\r\nthe world’s markets. New Caledonian ore is produced with cheap labor,\r\nand the deposits are near the coast; and the Rhodesian deposits are\r\nlarge and rich. High prices during the war, due to lack of shipping,\r\nbrought about a great increase of production in the Pacific States of\r\nthe United States; but with a return to normal conditions this region\r\ncannot survive competition, unless especially protected by legislation.\r\n\r\nIn normal times, the United States consumes more than one-third of\r\nthe world’s annual consumption of chromite, but depends upon foreign\r\nsources--Rhodesia and New Caledonia. During the war, deposits of\r\nlimited extent in Brazil and Cuba were drawn on, as well as Canadian\r\nand domestic ores. So far as developed, however, the Western Hemisphere\r\nis relatively poor in chromite deposits. The chrome industry in the\r\nUnited States is highly centralized, the Electrometallurgical Company\r\nhaving an almost absolute monopoly of the ferrochrome industry, and\r\nbeing probably the largest producers of ferrochrome in the world,\r\nand the Mutual Chemical Company having a great preponderance in the\r\nchemical chrome industry.\r\n\r\nThe chromite supply of the world is therefore at present essentially a\r\nmonopoly controlled by British-French capital, and the great supplies\r\noccur in the colonies of England and France.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nickel.=--The position of nickel is rather unusual, in that workable\r\ndeposits are rarely met with, and deposits of great importance are\r\nconfined to a few places. The only really commercially important\r\ndeposits are those of Sudbury, in Canada, and of New Caledonia;\r\nalthough small deposits of workable ore have been mined in Norway, and\r\nnickeliferous and chromiferous iron ore occurs in Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of Sudbury are relatively far more important than\r\nthose of any other field. Therefore Great Britain (through Canada)\r\npossesses by all means the largest and most important nickel deposits,\r\namounting practically to an exclusive control. Previously American\r\ncapital exerted a dominant commercial control over the nickel\r\nindustry, through its ownership of the largest ore reserves and its\r\ncontrol of smelting and refining plants in the United States. One of\r\nthese American companies has also the second largest holdings in New\r\nCaledonia. The British government plainly has taken means to overcome\r\nthis commercial domination. A large company has gone into business at\r\nSudbury, in which the British government has the controlling interest.\r\nThe government has also brought about the transfer of the refining\r\noperations of the International Nickel Company from New Jersey to\r\nOntario, so that the entire industry will be confined to Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tungsten.=--The greatest tungsten-producing region is that of eastern\r\nAsia; the region of the United States and Mexico second; that of\r\nBolivia and neighboring countries in South America third; and fourth\r\ncomes the province of Portugal, Spain, and Italy. There seem to be no\r\nvery large and concentrated tungsten deposits; and nearly all of those\r\nworked give signs of being easily exhausted. There may be therefore a\r\nworld tungsten shortage in the future. Possibly Bolivia will prove to\r\nbe the most durable field.\r\n\r\nAs to the commercial control, it is entirely in British hands, and this\r\nthrough the active policy of the British government. Actual control\r\nis obtained through the ferrotungsten makers, to whom the ores go for\r\ntreatment. On this basis the commercial control in 1917 was: British\r\n14,606 tons; American 9,479 tons; Japanese 1,165 tons; French 1,057\r\ntons; and Germany 360 tons.\r\n\r\nAmerican capital controls the tungsten deposits within its own borders\r\nand in Mexico, and is largely interested in Bolivia and China. Before\r\nthe war Germany controlled probably half the tungsten output, the other\r\nhalf being divided among the United States, England and France. At the\r\npresent time, the control through ownership of mines and smelters is as\r\nfollows: Great Britain 54 per cent.; United States 35 per cent.; Japan\r\n4 per cent.; France 4 per cent.; and Germany 1 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Vanadium.=--Vanadium is an important ferro-alloy metal. Vanadium steel\r\nhas great toughness and torsional strength, and is used in automobile\r\nparts, gun barrels, and the like. Chromium-vanadium steels have an\r\nextensive market.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most important deposits of vanadium in the world are\r\nin Peru, and until recently were controlled by the American Vanadium\r\nCompany (an American firm), which has a concession from the Peruvian\r\ngovernment. Otherwise the most important deposits are found in\r\nsouthwest Colorado, and were till very lately controlled by the Primos\r\nChemical Company, of Pennsylvania. The American Vanadium Company had an\r\nabsolute world monopoly of vanadium products and ferrovanadium, until\r\nthe entrance into the field of the Primos company. Quite recently the\r\nholdings of both these companies have been taken over by the Vanadium\r\nCorporation, allied to the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Antimony.=--Antimony has a relatively restricted use in peace-time,\r\nbut war creates (for the manufacture of shrapnel) a vastly increased\r\ndemand. Under normal circumstances the supply is far in excess of the\r\ndemand. China has long been the most important source of supply, and\r\nis likely so to continue. France and Algeria are also producers, as is\r\nMexico; and other countries produce under the stimulus of high prices.\r\nThe United States, as well as Canada, has relatively small reserves\r\nand normally small production. In the early part of the European war,\r\nhowever, in 1915 and 1916, countries like Bolivia, Mexico, Australia,\r\nthe United States, Peru, Burma, and Spain contributed important\r\namounts; but none of these will be important factors at the usual low\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nPrior to the war, England was the chief antimony-smelting center of the\r\nworld. Ores from all over the world were there treated, and the British\r\nbrands were considered purer than others, and virtually monopolized the\r\nworld’s markets, including those of the United States. During the great\r\ndemand in 1915 and 1916, British interests completely controlled the\r\nBolivian industry. Until 1914 one of the principal English companies\r\nheld contracts for the production of the Wah Chang Company, the most\r\nimportant antimony producers in China; but in 1914 this company\r\nestablished an independent selling agency in the United States. This\r\ntends to transfer the control of the antimony market from England to\r\nChina. With all her vast mineral resources, China has been able to\r\nobtain an important position in the world’s markets with regard to but\r\nfew metals. Of these antimony is the most striking example. Since 1908\r\nover 50 per cent. of the world’s total antimony production has come\r\nfrom China.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Molybdenum.=--The use of molybdenum in steel making is as yet almost\r\nin the experimental stage, but it is likely to become important. It is\r\nvaluable in electric work.\r\n\r\nUp to about 1916 practically all the molybdenum ore (molybdenite, a\r\nsulphide of molybdenum) came from Australia and Norway. Shortly after\r\nthe opening of the war, the molybdenite in Canada became prominent;\r\nand later the United States came to the fore as a producer. At present\r\nthe United States can probably produce as much if not more molybdenum\r\nthan all the rest of the world put together, principally from the great\r\nnewly discovered deposits at Climax, Colorado. Before this development,\r\nGreat Britain was the largest producer, in Australia and Canada. Both\r\nthe British and the Canadian governments have been much interested in\r\nthe development of the Canadian molybdenum, and the Canadian government\r\nhas built a mill for the concentration of the ores. Prior to the war,\r\nthe German-controlled American Metal Company, a branch of the German\r\n“metal octopus,” obtained, through a subsidiary, a large share in the\r\ncontrol of the Climax deposits; and the Primos Chemical Company, which\r\nhad strong German connections before the war, produced ferromolybdenum\r\nfrom ore from its own mine at Empire, Colorado. This, together with\r\nthe great interest taken by Germany and German capital in molybdenum\r\nelsewhere, led to the rumor of attempted German control of American\r\nmolybdenum.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Uranium.=--Uranium is valuable for the manufacture of special steel,\r\nalthough only used in small quantities. It is of extraordinary interest\r\non account of its association with radium, both being obtained\r\nprincipally from the minerals carnotite and uraninite (including\r\npitchblende). Radium is used in medicine, and for luminous paint.\r\nThe only regions which have yet produced large amounts of radium and\r\nuranium on a commercial scale are in the United States and Austria. At\r\nthe present time the United States is producing several times as much\r\nas all other countries combined.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Zirconium.=--Zirconium is used in electric lighting, and experiments\r\nhave been made with zirconium steel. During the war it was at one time\r\nthought to be of unusual value as a ferro-alloy. Zirconium occurs\r\nin nature as the mixed oxide and silicate, baddeleyite, and as the\r\nsilicate zircon. The baddeleyite deposits, having a higher percentage\r\nof zirconium, will probably become the chief source of the metal. It\r\noccurs in commercial quantities only in Brazil. Zircon deposits are\r\nfound in Brazil, and also in India; and a deposit of minor note occurs\r\nin the United States (Florida).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Thorium and Mesothorium.=--With zirconium must be considered monazite,\r\na mineral which is the source of thorium and mesothorium. Thorium\r\nnitrate is used in the manufacture of Welsbach mantles for gas burners;\r\nmesothorium is a by-product of its manufacture from monazite, and is\r\na radioactive substance used as a substitute for radium in making\r\nluminous paints and for therapeutic purposes. The zircon minerals\r\nand monazite typically occur together in river or beach sands. Like\r\nthe zirconium minerals, monazite comes mainly from Brazil and India;\r\nalthough it has in the past been mined successfully in the United\r\nStates, the industry is now extinct.\r\n\r\nThe thorium nitrate industry of the United States is closely controlled\r\nby two companies, the American Welsbach Company, and the Lindsay Light\r\nCompany. During the war they furnished thorium nitrate also to England\r\nand France, thus exercising a world-wide control.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAJOR NON-FERROUS METALS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Copper.=--The United States stands out predominantly as the world’s\r\ngreat copper producer, producing in 1917 60 per cent. of the world’s\r\noutput. No other country produces one-sixth as much as the United\r\nStates. American capital controls (in part through control of refining)\r\n78 per cent. of the world’s production.\r\n\r\nGermany has been one of the largest consumers of copper, though not\r\na large producer. Because of this, German interests have in the past\r\nsecured a considerable control over copper supplies, as well as\r\nthose of lead, zinc, and other metals, through refining and selling\r\ncontracts with mining companies. Such control does not as a rule extend\r\nto ownership of mines or smelters. Thus for many years companies\r\naffiliated with the great German Metal Combine (Metallgeselschaft)\r\nwere influential in the copper business of the United States. There\r\nwere three of these companies in the United States, the American Metal\r\nCompany, L. Vogelstein & Co., and Beer-Sondheimer & Co. Recently the\r\nfirst two have consolidated; and all were Americanized during the war.\r\n\r\nThe commercial control of the copper in the world, as based on\r\nownership of mines, is, in even figures: United States capital, 69 per\r\ncent. (entirely in the Western Hemisphere); British capital, 13 per\r\ncent. (in both hemispheres, but mainly in the Eastern); Japanese, 8\r\nper cent. (entirely domestic); German, 6 per cent.; and French, 2 per\r\ncent. It will be noted that of the present production three-quarters\r\ncomes from the Western Hemisphere (North and South America) and only\r\none-quarter from the rest of the world. It is probable that this is\r\na fair index of the relative wealth. The future production of South\r\nAmerica will probably increase more rapidly than that of North America,\r\nwhich was earlier developed. It is necessary for the permanent control\r\nof the copper situation by the United States that American capital\r\nshould continue to be foremost in the development of South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lead.=--The United States is the largest producer of lead in the world\r\nand has large resources. Next to the United States, in the order named,\r\ncome Australia, Spain, Germany, and Mexico. Three powers--the United\r\nStates, British Empire, and Spain--produce 76 per cent. of the total;\r\nand of these the United States and Great Britain produce 60 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature about the lead industry is the fact that as\r\nthe German system of far-reaching commercial control under government\r\nauspices--through smelting, refining, and selling--was destroyed,\r\nthis system was at once adopted by the British and French. In other\r\nwords, they found that the German plan had been so effective that they\r\nnot only blocked it permanently so far as their own countries were\r\nconcerned, but organized similar commercial-political combinations\r\nwhich should not only take care of all their own lead business, but,\r\nlike the German organization, should reach out into other countries.\r\nThe German combination still remains active outside the territory of\r\nthe former Allies.\r\n\r\nOf all the great lead-producing powers the United States is the only\r\none which does not possess a government-controlled lead monopoly.\r\nThreatened commercial world monopolies of lead, as of other minerals,\r\nhave therefore, through the revival of nationalistic spirit due to the\r\nwar, given place to national-commercial monopolies by three powers\r\n(Germany, France, and Great Britain), each intended to become as\r\nworld-wide as possible, and thus competitive with each other and with\r\nthe purely commercial organizations of the American lead industry.\r\nIn England this movement has taken the form of a British Metals\r\nCorporation (covering not only lead but other metals). The British\r\nTreasury is represented on the Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nIn France, the nationalist movement has resulted in the formation of\r\nconsortiums or trade monopolies for each industry, organized under\r\ngovernment auspices. That of the mineral industry is the Société\r\nMinerais et Metaux. The official announcement states that this society\r\nis organized under the auspices of the French government, in order\r\nto group the French metal producers, operating both at home and\r\nabroad, into a co-operative association for the purchase and sale of\r\nmetallurgical products.\r\n\r\nIn America, the principal commercial factor is the American Smelting &\r\nRefining Co., dominating the market through its control of reduction\r\nplants, although it controls directly only one-third the production.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Zinc.=--Zinc and lead are commonly associated in mineral deposits,\r\nso that their geological and geographical distribution is nearly\r\nidentical. Of the world’s production of zinc, the United States\r\nproduces 35 per cent., Germany 25 per cent., Australia 15 per cent.,\r\nand Italy 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nUp to the outbreak of the war in 1914, the position of zinc was extreme\r\namong the metals, in that political control or state sovereignty\r\nexercised only a minor effect upon the industry. “Economic factors,”\r\nsays our author, “made ineffective any control not international in\r\nscope. A very large percentage of the zinc ores of the world were\r\ntransported from the country of production to another for treatment,\r\nin some cases even being re-exported.” During the war, however,\r\npolitical control was largely invoked to strengthen and restore\r\ncommercial control to the chief belligerent nations. This movement was\r\nparticularly marked in the British Empire, where there now exists,\r\nas above noted in the paragraphs discussing lead, a joint political\r\nand commercial control. Alien interests were eliminated by government\r\naction, and the government retained a share in the control through\r\ninterests in marketing organizations or financial participation in\r\ntreatment works.\r\n\r\nIn the zinc industry, as in that of its closely associated metals,\r\ncopper and lead, the ownership or control of reduction plants, and\r\nmore particularly marketing organizations, have been more important in\r\ndetermining commercial control than state sovereignty or commercial\r\nownership of mines. In recent years the marketing organizations became\r\nworld-wide and completely dominated the industry. The ambition of\r\nGerman commercial interests to control the metal markets and resources\r\nof the world was more nearly realized in the case of zinc than of any\r\nother metal.\r\n\r\nIn France, as noted above in the case of lead, a government-controlled\r\nmetal marketing organization has been formed for the same\r\npurpose--protection and advantage in competition. However, British\r\ndomination of the European zinc industry seems certain. Only the\r\nAmerican industry remains untouched by close organization under\r\ngovernment auspices. Should Germany lose Silesia, she will probably\r\nbecome a small factor in the zinc industry. With so many doors closed\r\nin her face by the British and French political and commercial\r\ncombinations, there should be governmental precautions taken by the\r\nAmerican Government that she should not re-establish herself in the\r\nUnited States, nor so far as possible (following out to its logical\r\nconclusion the Monroe Doctrine) in the rest of North and South America.\r\n\r\nNote that in the zinc industry, as well as in every other industry,\r\nJapan is rapidly expanding, and having reached the limit of her own\r\nresources, her field of growth is in Korea, China, and Siberia.\r\nJapan’s present zinc-smelting capacity is greater than her domestic\r\nconsumption, and much greater than the domestic ore supply; and ore is\r\nimported from China, Siberia, Indo-China, and Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tin.=--Tin belongs to a group of minerals that are classifiable\r\ntogether by the fact that they are not of widespread distribution,\r\nbut are found in really commercial quantity only on a few spots\r\nof the globe, and yet are absolutely necessary for our industrial\r\ncivilization. Such also are chromium, platinum, potash salts, nitrates,\r\nand nickel. Of this political-commercial group, tin is an important\r\nmember. It is noteworthy of this group that the United States is not\r\nthe lucky holder of the first prize in any of these cases. In the case\r\nof chromium, it is mainly the French and British colonies, of platinum\r\nit is Russia and Colombia, of potash salts it is Germany, of nitrates\r\nit is Chili, of nickel again the British and French colonies, and in\r\nthe case of tin it is southeastern Asia and Bolivia.\r\n\r\nThe United States produces less than one-fifth of 1 per cent. of its\r\nrequirements, and its control of foreign tin resources through mine\r\nownership is negligible. On the other hand, the United States consumes\r\nover half the tin of the world, and is the largest manufacturer and\r\ndistributor of tin products. The tin-mining and smelting industry of\r\nthe world is dominated by Great Britain.\r\n\r\nTin is used in the manufacture of tin plate, in solder, brass, and many\r\nother essential uses, and no satisfactory substitute is available. In\r\nwar as well as peace, tin cans are as necessary as rifles. Aluminum\r\nis the most likely possible substitute for tin in containers, and the\r\nUnited States controls the aluminum industry. About 68 per cent. of\r\nthe tin is produced at present from southeastern Asia and neighboring\r\nislands, 21 per cent. from Bolivia, 4 per cent. from Nigeria and South\r\nAfrica, and 3 per cent. from England. The Bolivian production will\r\nprobably tend to increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mercury.=--Mercury, or quicksilver, is a mineral of some importance,\r\nalthough by far not in the class of the last four discussed above. It\r\nis useful for drugs and chemicals; as a detonator for high explosives;\r\nas a pigment; for treating gold and silver ores; and for many other\r\nuses. The greatest quicksilver deposits in the world are in Spain. The\r\nUnited States comes second. The important Idria mine, near Trieste,\r\nformerly Austrian, but at last accounts in possession of Italy, takes\r\nthird place. The production from the rest of the world is small. Spain,\r\nItaly, and the United States, therefore, divide the production and\r\nthe control through state sovereignty. The great mine of Spain, the\r\nAlmaden (the greatest in the world), is also owned and worked by the\r\nSpanish government. The Spanish government contracts, on the basis\r\nof competitive proposals, with the successful bidder for the sale\r\nof quicksilver for a term of ten years. For a number of successive\r\nperiods, the contract has been awarded to the Rothschilds of London. By\r\nthis arrangement the market is controlled in London; and during the war\r\nthe sale was taken over by the British government. The control of the\r\nmarketing of the product of this mine enables those in control to fix\r\nthe price of quicksilver in the world’s markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aluminum.=--An important metal at present, and one bound to be\r\neventually still more important, is aluminum. While one of the\r\nprincipal constituents of all rocks, in the form of silicates, its\r\nrelease from that combination is so difficult that it has not been\r\nsolved on a commercial scale. Since there is much more aluminum\r\nthan iron in the earth’s compounds, however, there will never be a\r\nshortage, if cost is disregarded. Commercial aluminum is manufactured\r\nfrom the oxide, bauxite. Bauxite is also used directly as an abrasive\r\nand also as a refractory. The largest bauxite deposits are controlled\r\npolitically by the United States and France, with the British Empire in\r\na favorable prospective position. The aluminum works of the world are\r\ncontrolled by Great Britain, France, and Germany, and also Switzerland,\r\nItaly, and Norway. The aluminum industry of the United States and\r\nCanada is practically in the hands of one company, the Aluminum\r\nCompany of America, which also holds interests in South America and\r\nother countries. The French producers of aluminum have effected a\r\ncentral organization through the incorporation of a selling company,\r\nL’Aluminium Française. The British Aluminium Company is the sole\r\nproducer in England, and controls the Irish deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NON-METALLIC MINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Emery and Corundum.=--Abrasives are essential and important in the\r\nindustries. Chief, perhaps, in the group of natural abrasives are\r\nemery and corundum, which are superior in hardness to other abrasives\r\nsuch as quartz, tripoli, garnet, and pumice. They are used in grinding\r\nand polishing metals--chiefly iron and steel--and glass. Commercially\r\nimportant deposits of emery and corundum are located in the\r\nAppalachian region of the United States, on the islands of the Grecian\r\nArchipelago (especially Naxos), in Asia Minor, India, Madagascar, and\r\nSouth Africa. There is little control other than that inherent in state\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Magnesite.=--Magnesite is a mineral of some importance, used mainly\r\nin metallurgical operations and as a refractory material for lining\r\nfurnaces; also for the manufacture of a cement for flooring. Magnesite\r\nis not a rare mineral, and deposits are widespread. Productive and\r\ncommercial deposits are located in the United States (California and\r\nWashington), Canada, Mexico (Lower California), Venezuela, Austria,\r\nGermany, Spain, Greece, and other countries. Not rare enough to be the\r\nsubject of great combinations, the interesting international feature of\r\nthe trade is that which centers in the United States. Until recently\r\nlarge magnesite deposits were not known in the United States, but in\r\nthe last few years vast deposits have been developed in California\r\nand Oregon. Previous to the war, the deposits of Austria were mainly\r\ndrawn on by consumers in the Eastern United States, and during the war\r\nCanadian magnesite was mainly used. American firms own considerable\r\ninterests in the deposits in Austria, and probably in some of those in\r\nCanada, Mexico and Venezuela.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Graphite.=--Graphite is used for crucibles for steel and brass making,\r\nfor foundry facings, pencils, shoe polish, as a lubricant, etc.\r\nCrystalline graphite only is used for crucibles. The supply of this\r\nfor American consumption was one of the problems of the war. Of the\r\ncrystalline graphite deposits, it is believed that those of the French\r\ncolony of Madagascar will, on account of their richness--if competition\r\nis free--supplant American and German deposits; the deposits of Ceylon\r\nare regarded as on the wane. Amorphous graphite will probably come\r\nfrom Austria, Mexico and Korea. The deposits of the United States are\r\nextensive but of low grade.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mica.=--Mica is an essential mineral, especially in electrical work.\r\nOne of the commonest minerals of nearly all rocks, it becomes valuable\r\nonly when it occurs in crystals or sheets of large size, which are of\r\ncomparatively rare occurrence, being found only in certain pegmatite\r\ndikes. India, Canada, and the United States produce about 98 per cent.\r\nof the sheet mica of the world. Brazil, Argentina, and the former\r\nGerman East Africa are becoming important. India produces 65 per cent.\r\nof the total world production; the United States only 15 per cent.\r\nBrazilian mica is expected to be of much greater importance in the\r\nfuture than in the past, although India will doubtless retain its\r\nposition as the most important producer.\r\n\r\nThe British Empire controls 75 per cent. of the sheet-mica production.\r\nBefore the war, Germany had obtained a large measure of commercial\r\ncontrol in Indian mines, and by virtue of her dominant position in\r\nthe electrical industry, threatened to control the mica market of the\r\nworld. The United States is now the largest consumer; but as the\r\nimportant development of the electrical industry in England during the\r\nwar places it in the position formerly occupied by Germany and Austria,\r\nit requires a larger supply of the mica from India, and this may lead\r\nto a permanent British control. London is the distributing center for\r\nIndian mica, and London prices regulate the market. During the war\r\nIndian mica was controlled by the British government and allotted to\r\nthe Allied nations at fixed prices. A permanent British monopoly of the\r\nmica market can probably best be obviated by the development of the\r\nBrazilian field by American electrical manufacturers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Asbestos.=--Asbestos is an essential mineral, on account of its\r\nincombustibility and insulating qualities, together with its fibrous\r\nstructure, which enables it to be spun or woven into ropes and\r\nfabrics; and on this account it has a wide and varied use. There are\r\nmineralogically three kinds of asbestos--chrysotile, crocidolite, and\r\nanthophyllite--the last being, as a rule, of non-spinning quality.\r\nChrysotile is the most valuable commercially: crocidolite, or blue\r\nasbestos, will not bear high temperature like the other varieties,\r\nand on account of its low fusibility is useful for electric welding.\r\nTherefore, the main asbestos problem centers about the deposits of\r\nhigh-grade chrysotile, especially as the supplies of anthophyllite\r\nasbestos are abundant, and with its restricted uses, ample for an\r\nindefinite period. The most important deposits of chrysotile asbestos\r\nare in Quebec, Canada, but large deposits are also worked in Russia and\r\nRhodesia.\r\n\r\nThe United States is by far the largest manufacturer of asbestos\r\nproducts in the world, but produces only a small fraction of the\r\nnecessary materials. The presence of the deposits in Canada, however,\r\nprovides the American industry with an ample supply. British companies\r\nhold exclusive control of the production of South Africa, Australasia,\r\nand Italy: of these, South Africa includes the Rhodesian deposits\r\nof chrysotile, which are among the most important in the world.\r\nAltogether, the British Empire is in a dominating position, controlling\r\nabout 88 per cent. of the annual asbestos production of the world and\r\napproximately 70 per cent. of the estimated reserves. Canada is in the\r\nlead of all countries, supplying about 85 per cent. of the world’s\r\nproduction. Should the British policy as to other mineral industries be\r\ncarried out in the case of asbestos we may expect action on the part of\r\nthe British or Canadian government to transfer the center of asbestos\r\nmanufacture from the United States to Canada or England.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FERTILIZER MINERALS\r\n\r\nWe have above touched on four great groups of minerals--the fuel\r\nminerals, the steel and ferro-alloy minerals, the major non-ferrous\r\nminerals, and the non-metallic minerals. Next comes a group by\r\nitself--the fertilizer minerals or elementary substances, chief among\r\nwhich are phosphate rock, potash, nitrates, and sulphur and sulphuric\r\nacid. All of these appear essential to the re-invigorating of the soil\r\nas successive crops are removed, and so to securing a permanency of its\r\noriginal productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Phosphate Rock.=--Phosphate rock is a natural substance which is used\r\nmainly as an ingredient of fertilizers, being finely ground and used\r\ndirectly. Large quantities are also used for making phosphoric acid and\r\nphosphorus, the latter being used in matches, etc. Phosphate rock is a\r\nbedded or sedimentary deposit containing phosphate of lime; phosphate\r\nof lime also occurs as nodules in stream beds. Another type of deposit\r\ncommonly classed as phosphate rock is the porous coral or limestone\r\nof tropical islands, permeated with phosphate leached from guano. The\r\nphosphate rock deposits of present commercial importance are located\r\nin the United States, Algeria, Tunis, and Egypt, the United States\r\npossessing by far the largest reserves. The United States has also the\r\nlargest industry of production. Politically the principal deposits are\r\ncontrolled by the United States, France (Tunis and Algeria) and Great\r\nBritain (Egypt). The commercial control of the deposits of the United\r\nStates is mainly in the hands of Americans, although German and French\r\ninterests own some of the hard-rock deposits. The deposits of Algeria\r\nand Tunis are controlled by two companies, one British and the other\r\nItalian. Germany will be without a source of supply under her own\r\ncontrol now that her colonies have been forfeited.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will be seen that there is no probability of a world\r\ncontrol or monopoly of phosphates. The United States is in a position\r\nto command the market unless nationalistic legislation in the various\r\ncountries is enacted to protect and advance their own industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Potash.=--Potash is a most important fertilizer, over 90 per cent.\r\nof all potash used being so employed, the remainder going into the\r\nmanufacture of explosives and glass, and into the chemical industry.\r\n\r\nUp to 1914 practically all the world’s supply of potash came from\r\nthe great natural rock-salt deposits of Stassfurt, Germany. Next in\r\nimportance come the deposits of Alsace, containing sufficient to\r\nsupply the world’s present demands for 300 years. Large undeveloped\r\ndeposits exist in northeastern Spain. Germany made active practical\r\nuse of her natural potash wealth in erecting a government monopoly,\r\nwhich supplied the world. This advantage was made much of in her plans\r\nfor further political and commercial conquest, and in the writings of\r\nthe vainglorious Teutons. In potash, they openly boasted, they had an\r\nall-powerful commercial weapon which would oblige other nations to\r\nsupply in exchange raw materials such as Germany needed, as cotton and\r\ncopper from the United States. With her political collapse, however,\r\nher commercial potash monopoly has also gone. The vast deposits of\r\nAlsatian potash have gone to France, and while German potash may still\r\nperhaps be produced and sold more cheaply, the Alsatian deposits will\r\nact as a check. A commercial combination between the two, and including\r\nthe Spanish deposits, is, however, not at all out of the question.\r\nPotash is one of the commonest elements in the earth, and in the United\r\nStates there is an abundant supply but it is largely in the form of\r\nsilicates, and so more difficult and expensive to extract than from the\r\nsoluble natural salts of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nitrates.=--Nitrates are essential in an extraordinary degree, in\r\nvarious ways: as fertilizer, and so essential to food and life; as\r\nthe source of ammonia, and therefore necessary to the modern system\r\nof food refrigeration; as an essential ingredient in explosives, and\r\nthus indispensable for the national defense. Just as potash is one\r\nof the commonest elements of the earth, so nitrogen is one of the\r\ncommonest elements of the air, of which it constitutes four-fifths. It\r\nshould not, therefore, be hard to get; but to isolate it and catch it\r\nin usable form--in technical terms, to “fix” it--is difficult, slow\r\nand expensive. Nature has not done much toward “fixing” nitrogen in\r\nher mineral supplies; and although it is constantly being “fixed” in\r\nanimal and vegetable organisms, it is largely soon returned to the\r\natmosphere as ammonia or in other forms, or, being in the form of\r\nsoluble salts, is leached from the soil and carried away, either to\r\nbe transformed again to the atmosphere, or, rarely, to be accumulated\r\nunder arid conditions by evaporation into mineral deposits. For some\r\nhitherto unexplained reason, only in Chili have mineral deposits of\r\nimportance thus been formed; and the Chilean deposits have till lately\r\nsupplied the world, giving Chile even a far more exclusive position as\r\nregards nitrates than was held by Germany as regards potash; but there\r\nhas never been any monopolistic control of the Chilean nitrate supply.\r\nBesides this mineral source, and the obtaining of nitrogen from the air\r\nby fixation, important sources of fertilizer nitrogen are contained\r\nin organic matter--refuse vegetable or animal remains, or animal\r\nexcreta--and also from coal, as a by-product of coke manufacture.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the war, Germany anticipated being deprived of Chilean\r\nnitrate by developing fixation and by-product processes, through which\r\nshe supplied herself during the war. Other countries have not been so\r\nthorough. During the war, the danger of the United States being cut off\r\nfrom supplies of Chilean nitrates by the German submarine campaign,\r\nled to the Government projecting and starting four large and expensive\r\nplants for nitrogen fixation. They were unfinished when the war closed.\r\n\r\nAbout five-eighths or less of the nitrogen consumed has been from\r\nvarious organic sources, including the by-production from coke making.\r\nBy-product nitrogen in the United States is estimated at around\r\none-eighth of the entire supply. The remaining three-eighths has been\r\nfurnished largely by Chilean nitrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRECIOUS METALS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gold.=--In the group of precious metals, gold is of the most\r\nimportance, mainly as the time-honored and unreplaceable measure of\r\nvalue and medium of exchange. This position it has sometimes shared\r\nwith silver, but no country has ever refused to thus recognize gold.\r\n\r\nGold is found all over the world, but the British Empire produces\r\n60 per cent. of it, while the United States produces 20 per cent.\r\nPolitical and commercial control are nearly identical in the case of\r\ngold, which is easily reduced to the metal state and thenceforth passes\r\ncurrent, requiring no selling agencies. Due to the commerce brought on\r\nby the war, the United States now has a larger gold reserve than any\r\nother nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Silver.=--“Silver,” says our author, “is used both for money and in\r\nthe arts, the former use being the more important and more essential.\r\nIn some countries, especially those producing silver in large amounts,\r\nit is the money standard, either alone or with gold. In other countries\r\non a gold standard silver is used for subsidiary coinage. In India and\r\nChina it is used for the settlement of foreign trade exchange balances.”\r\n\r\nIn countries with elaborate financial systems, where paper currency is\r\nfreely accepted, as in the United States and Europe, it is not such an\r\nessential money metal; but in other countries it directly replaces and\r\nconserves gold. On this account silver is not an article of luxury,\r\nbut an essential. The coinage of silver increased in Europe as the war\r\nprogressed, and was essential in bringing supplies from the Far East to\r\nthe battle fronts. While the normal annual silver production is around\r\n159,000,000 ounces, the demand during 1918 exceeded 500,000,000 ounces.\r\nSilver production adds to the stock of money, increases confidence\r\nin financial conditions, and furnishes, with and subsidiary to gold,\r\na basis for credit. About half of the world’s silver output is as a\r\nby-product of the production of other metals, notably lead and copper;\r\nand accordingly the production of silver is largely independent of the\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nOf the world’s total silver production, over 80 per cent. comes from\r\nthe mines of the Western Hemisphere. For many years Mexico was the\r\nleading producer, until all its industries became disorganized by\r\nrevolution. The United States, always a close second, is now in a\r\nleading position. Canada, Central America, and South America are\r\nimportant.

As based\r\nupon the territorial and commercial control of the fundamental\r\nminerals, it appears that the earth is owned by the two great\r\nAnglo-Saxon nations, the United States and the British Empire: the\r\nformer by destiny and good fortune and without political plan or\r\npolicy, in that such a vast store of mineral wealth was found in the\r\ngreat sparsely populated wilderness of America which it occupied;\r\nthe latter through the imperial policy of Britain, developed through\r\nhundreds of years by the need of extending commerce and the flag into\r\nfar-off lands to supplant the slender resources of its own limited\r\nislands. Of the two, the United States is rather in the lead, and\r\npossesses and controls more of the world’s mineral wealth than any\r\nother nation; but Great Britain is a close second.\r\n\r\nRapid changes occur, however, in these days, and the future must be\r\ninspected. The imperial policy of expansion and increasing political\r\ncontrol has become a tradition and an instinct with Great Britain; she\r\nlearned since the loss of her American colonies to give full autonomy\r\nto her more intelligent colonies, so that she strengthens her dominion\r\nthereby, and persistently goes on her way putting more and more of the\r\nearth under the British flag. The wealth and resources of the United\r\nStates being so far greater than its necessities, foreign problems have\r\nresolved into occasional questions of self-protection; and from this\r\ncondition a directly resulting theory has sprung, of non-interference\r\nin the rest of the world. Like China, we declare ourselves apart from\r\nthe world, and simply ask to be left alone, in consideration of which\r\nwe agree to leave the world alone. Our Monroe Doctrine as originated\r\nis part of that theory--we wanted the world to leave all the Americas\r\nalone, but took no responsibility for the Americas otherwise--a selfish\r\nand one-sided position.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which we cling to this doctrine is stupid and\r\nineffective: while we have conceived of it only as applying to\r\nmilitary or political encroachment, we have overlooked the modern\r\nphase of commercial conquest. Thereby we gain the suspicion of our\r\nLatin-American neighbors, who accordingly welcome more gladly European\r\nor Japanese rather than American capital; and thus we encourage the\r\nvery encroachments we have thought to prevent. We should either abandon\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine entirely, or define it also in terms of political\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as regards our great industries, and, more specifically, our\r\nmineral industries, we have never had any definite policy; our troubles\r\nand problems were purely internal, and the Government’s efforts were\r\nlargely directed to preventing such solidarity of any one industry that\r\nits power should be too great, although American organizing genius\r\nfirst successfully developed these colossal business combinations,\r\nrising without government support. England, too, and France, with\r\ntheir democratic traditions, tended to resist the overwhelming power\r\nof great business organizations, as leading to the destruction of\r\nequal opportunity and threatening the power of the state. It remained\r\nfor Germany, pressing impudently toward the conquest of the world, to\r\nsee the advantage of combining the powers of the state with those of\r\nbusiness monopolies, as a means of regulating industry at home and\r\noverpowering other nations. Thus the old question of the union or\r\nseparation of Church and State becomes one of Business and State.\r\n\r\nThe success of this plan of German penetration was most clearly and\r\ndisagreeably brought home to the British mind, as well as to the French\r\nand the American perception, by the war, and during the war England\r\ntook under government control her mineral industries more definitely\r\nand systematically than did we. Moreover, perceiving the success of\r\nthe German system as a means of penetration and as a method against\r\ncompetitors, she has adopted it, there being a striking tendency to\r\nput her key industries under syndicates, unions, cartels, or trusts\r\ncontrolled directly by the state.\r\n\r\nA system of state socialism thus takes the place of the freedom of\r\nindividual competition. As regards the mineral industries, much the\r\nsame action has been taken by France. But in America, dropping all the\r\nproblems and half-learned lessons of the war, we return to the _status\r\nquo ante_. If this difference continues, it is certain that British\r\ncontrol of the earth--whereby we mean its minerals--will eventually\r\npreponderate. As far as we are concerned, we should perhaps rather see\r\nit in the hands of Great Britain than of any other power, but must we\r\nnot decide upon our own course as a rich and populous nation of an\r\nincreasingly close-packed but seething and yet unorganized globe?\r\n\r\nOur statesmen, newspapers, and financiers proclaim to the world that we\r\nintend to take the lion’s share of the world’s shipping and commerce.\r\nEngland says nothing, but puts her government directly behind her own\r\nindustries, while the American Government still holds aloof from them.\r\nNationalism has been revived in Europe, and especially in England and\r\nFrance, as the result of the struggle to prevail against the intense\r\nGerman nationalistic spirit, which all but subjugated a world drifting\r\ncomfortably into internationalism. It is conceivably a step backward, a\r\nreversion, but what attitude shall America take? The British and French\r\nnationalism need not disquiet us so much as that of the Japanese, still\r\nmore intense and purposeful, and working with the same German tools\r\n(not invented in Germany, but in America, but, like most German arts,\r\nsuccessfully copied and utilized), now adopted by England and France\r\nin self-defense. America also has had a rebirth of nationalism, quite\r\nnecessary in the existing state of affairs.\r\n\r\nAs the case now stands, the United States largely predominates in\r\nthe petroleum industry, with 71 per cent. of the world’s production\r\nin 1917; England, far behind, is in a way to overtake us with giant\r\nstrides under her new system. In the basic necessities of coal and\r\niron, the United States also leads. The second place in the steel\r\nindustry, held by Germany, was presumably lost as a result of the war,\r\nand probably passes to England, already second in coal and with her\r\niron industries in charge of a government-controlled syndicate for\r\npurposes of protection and expansion.\r\n\r\nIn copper, the United States is far away in the lead, with England a\r\nlong second, and in lead, also, with half the world’s production, with\r\nEngland second. Before the war England and Germany were about tied for\r\nsecond place, and the latter was rapidly drawing ahead through her\r\nstate-controlled commercial methods; but the war will set her back\r\ngreatly. In zinc, the United States had the greatest production (32 per\r\ncent.) before the war, slightly more than Germany (28 per cent.), but\r\nGerman methods gave it the preponderance of actual commercial control.\r\nThe result of the war will restore the commercial supremacy to the\r\nUnited States, and the importance of England will increase. In silver,\r\nthe United States now leads in production and in both territorial\r\nand commercial control, and, by her commercial control over Mexican\r\nproduction, controls one-half of the world’s output, with Great Britain\r\na strong commercial second, having nearly 40 per cent. of it.\r\n\r\nIn the production of the important mineral, sulphur, the United\r\nStates is far in advance of the world, with 65 per cent. of the\r\nworld’s production in 1916. Italy is second, Japan third, and England\r\nis practically unrepresented. Phosphate rock is dominated, both\r\nterritorially and commercially, by the United States, but there are\r\nother supplies for England, and France has abundance in her own\r\nterritory. Vanadium is commercially controlled by the United States,\r\nalthough territorially by Peru. Molybdenum has very lately come to be\r\ncontrolled by the United States, with Great Britain, formerly first,\r\nnow second. In uranium and radium the United States also has first\r\nplace, with Austria a long second. The aluminum industry is strongest\r\nin the United States, although very important also in France.\r\n\r\nIn the following, however, Great Britain has control: the important\r\n“key industry” of tin, where her territorial control is one-half and\r\nher commercial control absolute, whereas the United States is not\r\nrepresented; in the important nickel industry, by territorial control\r\nof 80 per cent., and by a commercial control that is now probably\r\npredominant over the strong American interests, as a result of an\r\nactive government policy; in tungsten, where she controls territorially\r\nthe greatest production (34 per cent.), and where she has commercial\r\nsupremacy, controlling 54 per cent. (1917), the United States being\r\nsecond, with a commercial control of 35 per cent. (although its\r\nterritorial control is only 17 per cent., about equal to that of\r\nBolivia).\r\n\r\nIn manganese, Russia nominally leads, with 36 per cent. commercial\r\ncontrol (55 per cent. of the world’s production in 1913); but under\r\npresent conditions the effect is to give England the lead, with\r\nthe United States in a position of minor importance. In chromium,\r\nGreat Britain and France control through a syndicate, in which the\r\nBritish interest is in the majority, and the United States occupies\r\na subordinate position with regard to both these countries. In gold\r\nproduction the British Empire controls 63 per cent.; the United States\r\n23 per cent. In graphite in 1913 the British Empire was second to\r\nAustria-Hungary. It will now take the first place, and the United\r\nStates will be a competitor. In asbestos, the British Empire produces\r\n87 per cent. and controls commercially 63 per cent. of the world’s\r\ntotal, the United States being negligible in production, but second in\r\ncommercial control (of Canadian asbestos). Mercury, territorially, is\r\nmainly in the hands of Spain, but the industry is actually dominated\r\nby England, under selling arrangements. Antimony has long been\r\ncontrolled by England, but control may revert to China, which means the\r\npossibility of its becoming Japanese. Mica, essential for electrical\r\nwork, is controlled by Great Britain.\r\n\r\nOnly a few minerals remain in which most of the industry is not in the\r\nhands of either the United States or England: potash, formerly a German\r\nmonopoly, and now divided between Germany and France, with Germany\r\nlikely predominant; and mineral nitrates, in Chilean territory, with no\r\nmarked national commercial control other than that of Chile.\r\n\r\nBoth America and England are strong in their grip on the world’s\r\nmineral industries--England much stronger than before the war and with\r\na freshly set purpose to expand. A combination of these two countries\r\nwould amount to a practical world control of minerals, and, with\r\nFrance, a little stronger control. This much for the present, but\r\nuncertain quantities loom shadowy, in the destiny of Russia, the future\r\nof Asia, and the progress of Japan. Japan is intently embarking on a\r\ncourse toward the domination of Asia, politically and commercially.\r\nHer present position is not so significant as the consideration of\r\nher rapid progress, the knowledge of the rich field in which she is\r\nto work, and a study of her militaristic methods, which remind one of\r\nthose of Germany. Japan holds to no ally that will not (temporarily)\r\naid her in her forward march, and in the weakness of Russia, China, and\r\nKorea she sees her opportunity. The war to her was an unmixed blessing.\r\nShe took no chances, and seized enormous advantages.\r\n\r\nThere are three great figures of nations which seem to have been\r\ndestined to be, in these times, of critical importance to the United\r\nStates: in the past Germany; in the present, Great Britain; in the\r\nfuture, Japan. The German question was settled in the only possible\r\nway; for England the only sane solution is a closer-knit alliance; and\r\nfor Japan, watchfulness and friendly intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Africa\r\n    Asbestos in, 394\r\n    Bauxite and aluminum in, 350\r\n    Chrome in, 114\r\n    Copper in, 246\r\n    Copper, exports to United States, 249; copper production, 246, 249\r\n    East Africa\r\n      Mica in, 383\r\n    Emery and corundum in, 359\r\n    Gold in, 473\r\n    Magnesite in, 368\r\n    North Africa\r\n    Copper in, 248\r\n    Phosphate in, 405\r\n    South Africa\r\n      Gold in, 473; gold, financial control, 488\r\n      Mica in, 384\r\n    Tin in, 323\r\n    West Africa\r\n      Copper in, 248\r\n      Gold in, 474\r\n\r\n  Alaska.

Some of the\r\n  tables may be illegible on small screens or in narrow windows.\r\n\r\n  Spelling, capitalisation and hyphenation as used in the source\r\n  document (including the errors and inconsistencies in company,\r\n  geographic and proper names, titles of publications, etc.) have not\r\n  been corrected or standardised, except as mentioned under Changes made\r\n  below. Results of calculations in tables are given in this text\r\n  as they appear in the source document, even though they appear to\r\n  contain occasional calculation and/or rounding off errors or are\r\n  based on incomplete or contradictory data.\r\n\r\n  Page 50, Table 7, table row Austria: the remark in the last column\r\n  may be better suited for the row Hungary.\r\n\r\n  Page 278, Footnote [132] Percentage of mean of totals used in a\r\n  and b: a and b refer to the columns with footnotes [130] and [131]\r\n  respectively.\r\n\r\n  Pages 508 and 510, Tables 72 and 74: these tables are (almost)\r\n  identical in the source document as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Changes made\r\n\r\n  Tables and illustrations have been moved out of text paragraphs;\r\n  footnotes have been renumbered sequentially and moved to directly\r\n  under the paragraph where they are referenced.\r\n\r\n  In several of the tables data have been aligned more consistently\r\n  than in the source document. Some tables have been split or otherwise\r\n  re-arranged to fit the available width. These tables have been split\r\n  so that it is straightforward to recombine them into single tables.\r\n\r\n  Some obvious minor typographical and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected silently.\r\n\r\n  Page ix: Platinum, by James H.
