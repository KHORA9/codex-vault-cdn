He had, to\r\nuse his own expression, ‘sate in eight Parliaments without having taken\r\npart in any great debate,’ when remarkable events suddenly impelled him\r\nto advance and occupy not only a considerable but a leading position\r\nin our public affairs. During three years, under circumstances of great\r\ndifficulty, he displayed some of the highest qualities of political\r\nlife: courage and a lofty spirit; a mastery of details which experience\r\nusually alone confers; a quick apprehension and a clear intelligence;\r\nindomitable firmness; promptness, punctuality, and perseverance which\r\nnever failed; an energy seldom surpassed; and a capacity for labour\r\nwhich was perhaps never equalled. At the very moment when he had\r\novercome many contrarieties and prejudices; when he had been most\r\nsuccessful in the House of Commons, and, sustained only by his own\r\nresources, had considerably modified the legislation of the government\r\nwhich he opposed on a measure of paramount importance; when the nation,\r\nwhich had long watched him with interest, began to congratulate itself\r\non the devotion of such a man to the business of the country, he was in\r\nan instant taken from us. Then it was that, the memory of the past and\r\nthe hope of the future blending together, all men seemed to mourn over\r\nthis untimely end, and there was that pang in the public heart which\r\naccompanies the unexpected disappearance of a strong character.\r\n\r\nWhat manner of man this was, who thus on a sudden in the middle term of\r\nlife relinquished all the ease and pleasure of a patrician existence to\r\nwork often eighteen hours daily, not for a vain and brilliant notoriety,\r\nwhich was foreign alike both to his tastes and his turn of mind, but for\r\nthe advancement of principles, the advocacy of which in the chief scene\r\nof his efforts was sure to obtain for him only contention and unkindly\r\nfeelings; what were his motives, purposes and opinions; how and why\r\ndid he labour; what were the whole scope and tendency of this original,\r\nvigorous, and self-schooled intelligence; these would appear to be\r\nsubjects not unworthy of contemplation, and especially not uninteresting\r\nto a free and political community.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of treating cotemporary characters and events has been\r\never acknowledged; but it may be doubted whether the difficulty is\r\ndiminished when we would commemorate the men and things that have\r\npreceded us. The cloud of passion in the first instance, or in the\r\nother the mist of time, may render it equally hard and perplexing to\r\ndiscriminate.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that the most authentic and interesting\r\nhistories are those which have been composed by actors in the\r\ntransactions which they record. The cotemporary writer who is personally\r\nfamiliar with his theme has unquestionably a great advantage; but it is\r\nassumed that his pen can scarcely escape the bias of private friendship\r\nor political connection. Yet truth, after all, is the sovereign passion\r\nof mankind; nor is the writer of these pages prepared to relinquish his\r\nconviction that it is possible to combine the accuracy of the present\r\nwith the impartiality of the future.\r\n\r\nLord George Bentinck had sat for eighteen years in Parliament, and,\r\nbefore he entered it, had been for three years private secretary to Mr.\r\nCanning, who had married the sister of the Duchess of Portland. Such a\r\npost would seem a happy commencement of a public career; but whether\r\nit were the untimely death of his distinguished relative, or a natural\r\nindisposition, Lord George--though he retained the seat for King’s\r\nLynn, in which he had succeeded his uncle, the late governor-general of\r\nIndia--directed his energies to other than parliamentary pursuits. For\r\nsome time he had followed his profession, which was that of arms, but\r\nof late years he had become absorbed in the pastime and fortunes of the\r\nturf, in which his whole being seemed engrossed, and which he pursued on\r\na scale that perhaps has never been equalled.\r\n\r\nLord George had withdrawn his support from the government of the Duke of\r\nWellington, when the friends of Mr. Canning quitted that administration;\r\nand when in time they formed not the least considerable portion of the\r\ncabinet of Lord Grey, he resumed his seat on the ministerial benches. On\r\nthat occasion an administrative post was offered him and declined; and\r\non subsequent occasions similar requests to him to take office were\r\nequally in vain. Lord George, therefore, was an original and hearty\r\nsupporter of the Reform Bill, and he continued to uphold the Whigs in\r\nall their policy until the secession of Lord Stanley, between whom and\r\nhimself there subsisted warm personal as well as political sympathies.\r\nAlthough he was not only a friend to religious liberty, as we shall have\r\noccasion afterwards to remark, but always viewed with great sympathy\r\nthe condition of the Roman Catholic portion of the Irish population, he\r\nshrank from the taint of the ultra-montane intrigue. Accompanying\r\nLord Stanley, he became in due time a member of the great Conservative\r\nopposition, and, as he never did anything by halves, became one of\r\nthe most earnest, as he certainly was one of the most enlightened,\r\nsupporters of Sir Robert Peel. His trust in that minister was indeed\r\nabsolute, and he has subsequently stated in conversation that when,\r\ntowards the end of the session of ‘45, a member of the Tory party\r\nventured to predict and denounce the impending defection of the\r\nminister, there was no member of the Conservative party who more\r\nviolently condemned the unfounded attack, or more readily impugned the\r\nmotives of the assailant.\r\n\r\nHe was not a very frequent attendant in the House. He might be counted\r\non for a party division, and when, towards the termination of the\r\nMelbourne ministry, the forces were very nearly balanced, and the\r\nstruggle became very close, he might have been observed, on more\r\nthan one occasion, entering the House at a late hour, clad in a\r\nwhite great-coat, which softened, but did not conceal, the scarlet\r\nhunting-coat.\r\n\r\nAlthough he took no part in debate, and attended the House rather as a\r\nclub than as a senate, he possessed a great and peculiar influence in\r\nit. He was viewed with interest, and often with extraordinary regard,\r\nby every sporting man in the House. With almost all of these he was\r\nacquainted; some of them, on either side, were his intimate companions\r\nand confederates.\r\n\r\nHis eager and energetic disposition; his quick perception, clear\r\njudgment, and prompt decision; the tenacity with which he clung to his\r\nopinions; his frankness and love of truth; his daring and speculative\r\nspirit; his lofty bearing, blended as it was with a simplicity of manner\r\nvery remarkable; the ardour of his friendships, even the fierceness\r\nof his hates and prejudices--all combined to form one of those strong\r\ncharacters who, whatever may be their pursuit, must always direct and\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nNature had clothed this vehement spirit with a material form which was\r\nin perfect harmony with its noble and commanding character. He was tall\r\nand remarkable for his presence; his countenance almost a model of manly\r\nbeauty; the face oval, the complexion clear and mantling; the forehead\r\nlofty and white; the nose aquiline and delicately moulded; the upper\r\nlip short. But it was in the dark-brown eye, which flashed with piercing\r\nscrutiny, that all the character of the man came forth: a brilliant\r\nglance, not soft, but ardent, acute, imperious, incapable of deception\r\nor of being deceived.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had not much sustained his literary culture, and of late\r\nyears, at any rate, had not given his mind to political study, he had\r\nin the course of his life seen and heard a great deal, and with profit.\r\nNothing escaped his observation; he forgot nothing and always thought.\r\nSo it was that on all the great political questions of the day he had\r\narrived at conclusions which guided him. He always took large views\r\nand had no prejudices about things, whatever he might indulge in as\r\nto persons. He was always singularly anxious to acquire the truth, and\r\nwould spare no pains for that purpose; but when once his mind was made\r\nup, it was impossible to influence him.\r\n\r\nIn politics, he was a Whig of 1688, which became him, modified, however,\r\nby all the experience of the present age. He wished to see our society\r\nfounded on a broad basis of civil and religious liberty. He retained\r\nmuch of the old jealousy of the court, but had none of popular\r\nfranchises. He was for the Established Church, but for nothing more,\r\nand was very repugnant to priestly domination. As for the industrial\r\nquestion, he was sincerely opposed to the Manchester scheme, because\r\nhe thought that its full development would impair and might subvert our\r\nterritorial constitution, which he held to be the real security of our\r\nfreedom, and because he believed that it would greatly injure Ireland,\r\nand certainly dissolve our colonial empire.\r\n\r\nHe had a great respect for merchants, though he looked with some\r\ndegree of jealousy on the development of our merely foreign trade. His\r\nknowledge of character qualified him in a great degree to govern men.\r\nand if some drawbacks from this influence might be experienced in his\r\ntoo rigid tenacity of opinion, and in some quickness of temper, which,\r\nhowever, always sprang from a too sensitive heart, great compensation\r\nmight be found in the fact that there probably never was a human being\r\nso entirely devoid of conceit and so completely exempt from selfishness.\r\nNothing delighted him more than to assist and advance others. All the\r\nfruits of his laborious investigations were always at the service of\r\nhis friends without reserve or self-consideration. He encouraged them\r\nby making occasions for their exertions, and would relinquish his own\r\nopportunity without a moment’s hesitation, if he thought the abandonment\r\nmight aid a better man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     _The Protection Problem_\r\n\r\nTHERE was at this time a metropolitan society for the protection of\r\nagriculture, of which the Duke of Richmond was chairman, and which\r\nhad been established to counteract the proceedings of the Manchester\r\nconfederation. It was in communication with the local Protection\r\nsocieties throughout the country; and although the adhesion to its\r\nservice by the parliamentary members of the old Conservative party had\r\nbeen more limited than might have been expected, nevertheless many\r\ncounty members were enrolled in its ranks, and a few of the most eminent\r\nwere actively engaged in its management. In this they were assisted by\r\nan equal number of the most considerable tenant-farmers. In the present\r\nstate of affairs, the council of the Protection Society afforded the\r\nearliest and readiest means to collect opinion and methodize action; and\r\nit was therefore resolved among its managers to invite all members of\r\nParliament who sympathized with their purpose, though they might not be\r\nmembers of their society, to attend their meeting and aid them at the\r\npresent crisis with their counsel.\r\n\r\nA compliance with this request occasioned the first public appearance\r\nof Lord George Bentinck, as one of the organizers of a political\r\nparty,--for he aspired to no more. The question was, whether a third\r\npolitical party could be created and sustained,--a result at all times\r\nand under any circumstances difficult to achieve, and which had failed\r\neven under the auspices of accomplished and experienced statesmen. In\r\nthe present emergency, was there that degree of outraged public feeling\r\nin the country, which would overcome all obstacles and submit to any\r\ninconveniences, in order to ensure its representation in the House of\r\nCommons? It was the opinion of Lord George Bentinck that such was the\r\ncase; that if for the moment that feeling was inert and latent, it was\r\nan apathy which arose from the sudden shock of public confidence, and\r\nthe despair which under such circumstances takes possession of men;\r\nthat if it could be shown to the country, that the great bulk of the\r\nConservative party were true to their faith, and were not afraid, even\r\nagainst the fearful odds which they would have to encounter, to proclaim\r\nit, the confidence and the courage of the country would rally, and the\r\nparty in the House of Commons would find external sympathy and support.\r\n\r\nWith these views it became of paramount importance that the discussion\r\non the government measure should be sustained on the part of the\r\nProtectionists with their utmost powers. They must prove to the country,\r\nthat they could represent their cause in debate, and to this end all\r\ntheir energies must be directed. It would be fatal to them if the\r\ndiscussion were confined to one or two nights, and they overborne by\r\nthe leading and habitual speakers. They must bring forward new men; they\r\nmust encourage the efforts of those now unrecognized and comparatively\r\nunknown; they must overcome all reserve and false shame, and act as\r\nbecame men called upon to a critical and leading part, not by their\r\narrogance or ambition, but by the desertion and treachery of those to\r\nwhose abilities they had bowed without impatience and reluctance. There\r\nwas a probability of several vacancies immediately taking place in\r\ncounties where the seats were filled by converts, but men of too\r\nscrupulous an honour to retain the charge which they had sought and\r\naccepted as the professors of opinions contrary to those which now\r\nreceived their mournful adhesion. The result of these elections would\r\ngreatly depend upon the spirit and figure of the party in the House of\r\nCommons, in their first encounter with the enemy.\r\n\r\nThese views, so just and so spirited, advanced with high-bred\r\nearnestness by one rarely met in political turmoils, and enforced with a\r\nfreshness and an affable simplicity which were very winning, wonderfully\r\nencouraged those to whom they were addressed. All seemed touched by the\r\nflame which burned in the breast of that man, so lofty in his thoughts\r\nbut so humble in his ambition, who counselled ever the highest deeds,\r\nand was himself ever prepared to undertake the humblest duties.\r\n\r\nThe business of this day was notable. Calculations were made of those\r\nwho might be fairly counted on to take a part in debate; some discussion\r\neven ensued as to who should venture to reply late at night to the\r\nminister; a committee was appointed to communicate with all members on\r\neither side supposed to be favourable to the principle of Protection to\r\nthe labour of the country; a parliamentary staff was organized, not only\r\nto secure the attendance of members, but to guard over the elections;\r\nfinally, the form of the amendment to the government measure was\r\ndiscussed and settled, and it was agreed that, if possible, it should be\r\nmoved by Mr. Philip Miles, the member for the city of Bristol, and\r\nwho had the ear of the House not merely from the importance of his\r\nconstituency, and seconded by Sir William Heathcote, the member for the\r\ncounty of Hampshire, a country gentleman of great accomplishments, and\r\nso highly considered by both sides that he was very generally spoken of\r\nas a probable successor to the chair.\r\n\r\nAll was furnished by this lately forlorn party except a leader, and even\r\nthen many eyes were turned and some hopeful murmurs addressed towards\r\nLord George Bentinck, who in the course of this morning had given such\r\nvarious proofs of his fitness and such evidence of his resource. But he\r\nshook his head with a sort of suppressed smile, a faint blush, and an\r\nair of proud humility that was natural to him: ‘I think,’ he said, ‘we\r\nhave had enough of leaders; it is not in my way; I shall remain the last\r\nof the rank and file.’\r\n\r\nSo little desirous, originally, was Lord George Bentinck to interfere\r\nactively in that great controversy in which ultimately he took so\r\nleading a part, that before the meeting of Parliament in 1846 he begged\r\na gentleman whom he greatly esteemed, a member of the legal profession,\r\nand since raised to its highest honours, to call upon him at Harcourt\r\nHouse, when he said that he had taken great pains to master the case\r\nof the protective system; that he was convinced its abrogation would\r\nultimately be very injurious to this country; but although, both\r\nin point of argument and materials, he feared no opponent, he felt\r\nconstitutionally so incapable of ever making a speech, that he wished\r\nto induce some eminent lawyer to enter the House of Commons, and avail\r\nhimself of his views and materials, which he had, with that object,\r\nreduced to writing. He begged, therefore, that his friend, although a\r\nfree-trader, would assist him, by suggesting a fitting person for this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the name of a distinguished member of the bar, who had\r\nalready published a work of merit, impugning the principles of the new\r\ncommercial system, was mentioned, and this learned gentleman was applied\r\nto, and was not indisposed to accept the task. A mere accident prevented\r\nthis arrangement being accomplished. Lord George then requested his\r\nfriend to make some other selection; but his adviser very sensibly\r\nreplied, that although the House of Commons would have listened with\r\nrespect to a gentleman who had given evidence of the sincerity of his\r\nconvictions by the publication of a work which had no reference to\r\nParliament, they would not endure the instance of a lawyer brought into\r\nthe House merely to speak from his brief; and that the attempt would be\r\nutterly fruitless. He earnestly counselled Lord George himself to make\r\nthe effort; but Lord George, with characteristic tenacity, clung for\r\nsome time to his project, though his efforts to accomplish it were\r\nfortunately not successful.\r\n\r\nSome of the friends of Lord George Bentinck, remembering his\r\ninexperience in debate, aware of the great length at which he must\r\nnecessarily treat the theme, and mindful that he was not physically\r\nwell-qualified for controlling popular assemblies, not having a strong\r\nvoice, or, naturally, a very fluent manner, were anxious that he should\r\nnot postpone his speech until an hour so late; that an audience, jaded\r\nby twelve nights’ discussion, would be ill-attuned to statistical\r\narguments and economical details. But still clinging to the hope\r\nthat some accident might yet again postpone the division, so that\r\nthe Protectionists might gain the vote of Mr. Hildyard, who had been\r\nreturned that day for South Notts, having defeated a cabinet minister,\r\nLord George remained motionless until long past midnight. Mr. Cobden\r\nhaving spoken on the part of the confederation, the closing of the\r\ndebate was felt to be inevitable. Even then, by inducing a Protectionist\r\nto solicit the Speaker’s eye, Lord George attempted to avert the\r\ndivision; but no supporter of the government measure, of any colour,\r\nadvancing to reply to this volunteer, Bentinck was obliged to rise.\r\nHe came out like a lion forced from his lair. And so it happened, that\r\nafter all his labours of body and mind, after all his research and\r\nunwearied application and singular vigilance, after having been at his\r\npost for a month, never leaving the House, even for refreshment, he\r\nhad to undertake the most difficult enterprise in which a man can well\r\nembark, with a concurrence of every disadvantage which could ensure\r\nfailure and defeat. It would seem that the audience, the subject, and\r\nthe orator, must be equally exhausted; for the assembly had listened for\r\ntwelve nights to the controversy, and he who was about to address them\r\nhad, according to his strange habit, taken no sustenance the whole day;\r\nit being his custom to dine after the House was up, which was very\r\noften long after midnight, and this, with the exception of a slender\r\nbreakfast, rigidly restricted to dry toast, was his only meal in the\r\nfour-and-twenty hours.\r\n\r\nHe had been forced to this regimen, from food exercising a lethargic\r\ninfluence over him; so that, in addition to some constitutional weakness\r\nin his organ, he usually laboured, when he addressed the House, under\r\nthe disadvantage of general exhaustion. And this was, no doubt, a\r\nprincipal cause of that over-excitement and apparently unnecessary\r\nenergy in his manner of speaking, of which he was himself perfectly,\r\nand even painfully, conscious. He was wont to say, that before he could\r\nspeak he had to make a voice, and, as it were, to pump it from the very\r\ncore of his frame. One who took a great interest in his success once\r\nimpressed on him the expediency of trusting entirely to his natural\r\nvoice and the interest and gravity of his matter, which, combined\r\nwith his position as the recognized leader of a great party, would be\r\nadequate to command the attention of his audience; and he subsequently\r\nendeavoured very often to comply with this suggestion. He endeavoured\r\nalso very much to control his redundancy of action and gesture, when\r\nthat peculiarity was pointed out to him with the delicacy, but the\r\nsincerity, of friendship. He entirely freed himself from a very awkward\r\nfeature of his first style of speaking, namely, the frequent repetition\r\nof a sentence, which seemed at first a habit inveterate with him; but\r\nsuch was his force of will, that when the necessity of ridding himself\r\nof this drawback was properly pointed out to him, he achieved the\r\ndesired result. No one bore criticism more gently and kindly, so long as\r\nit was confined to his personal and intellectual characteristics, for he\r\nwas a man absolutely without vanity or conceit, who thought very humbly\r\nof himself, in respect of abilities, and deemed no labour too great to\r\nachieve even a slight improvement. But though in these respects the very\r\nchild of simplicity, he was a man of almost unexampled pride, and chafed\r\nunder criticism, when his convictions or his conduct were questioned. He\r\nwas very tenacious of his opinion, almost inexorable; and it required\r\na courage nearly equal to his own, combined with a serene temper,\r\nsuccessfully to impugn his conclusions.\r\n\r\nNot, therefore, excited by vanity, but sustained by self-respect, by\r\nan overpowering feeling that he owed it to himself and the opinions he\r\nheld, to show to the world that they had not been lightly adopted and\r\nshould not be lightly laid aside, Bentinck rose, long past the noon of\r\nnight, at the end of this memorable debate, to undertake an office\r\nfrom which the most successful and most experienced rhetoricians of\r\nParliament would have shrunk with intuitive discretion. But duty scorns\r\nprudence, and criticism has few terrors for a man with a great purpose.\r\nUnshaken by the adverse hour and circumstances, he proceeded to\r\naccomplish the object which he had long meditated, and for which he was\r\nfully prepared.\r\n\r\nReminding the House, while he appealed to their indulgence, that, though\r\nhe had had the honour of a seat for eight parliaments, he had never once\r\nventured to trespass on its time on any subject of great debate, he\r\nat once took a clear and comprehensive ground of objection to the\r\ngovernment scheme. He opposed it not only because he objected to the\r\ngreat change contemplated with respect to the agricultural interest,\r\nbut, on principle, to the entire measure, ‘a great commercial\r\nrevolution, which we are of opinion that the circumstances of the\r\ncountry do not by any means require.’\r\n\r\nNoticing the observation of the Secretary at War, that the agricultural\r\ninterest, in submitting to this great change, might now accept it with\r\nhonour, instead of its being eventually extorted by force, he happily\r\nretorted, that vicious as he thought the measure, he should feel it\r\ndeprived of half its vice if it could be carried without loss of honour,\r\ndamage to reputation, and forfeiture of public character to a vast\r\nnumber of gentlemen now present. And he proceeded to show among other\r\ntestimonies, by an appeal to the distinct language of the speech from\r\nthe throne on the dissolution of 1841, that ‘every member who occupied a\r\nseat in this House was returned pledged either to oppose or maintain the\r\nprinciple of protection to national industry.’\r\n\r\nAdverting to the new position, that the experience of the last\r\nthree years justified the reversal of the system which the existing\r\nadministration had been summoned to office to uphold, he wisely\r\nremarked, that ‘the country will not be satisfied with three years’\r\nexperience of any system. Three years’ experience is not sufficiently\r\nextensive to afford a proper criterion by which we may decide the\r\nfailure or success of any description of policy whatsoever.’\r\n\r\nNoticing that the minister had more especially founded ‘his present\r\nbelief in doctrines contrary to those which he had heretofore uniformly\r\nmaintained,’ by the assumption that the price of corn would not be more\r\nreduced than the price of cattle and other commodities affected by the\r\ntariff of 1842, and also by the results of previous experiments in the\r\ninstances of silk and wool, Lord George ‘accepted his challenge’\r\non these grounds, and proceeded in great detail to investigate these\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nThe House listened with great attention for full two hours, during\r\nwhich he treated these subjects. This attention no doubt was generally\r\naccorded because it was felt due to the occasion, and, under the\r\ncircumstances, to the speaker; but those who, however contrary might\r\nbe the results at which they had arrived, had themselves deeply entered\r\ninto these investigations, recognized very soon that Bentinck was\r\nmaster of his subject. Sir Robert Peel looked round very often with that\r\nexpression of appreciation which it was impossible for his nature to\r\nrefuse to parliamentary success, even when the ability displayed was\r\nhostile to his projects. The minister, with reference to the wool trade,\r\nhad dwelt on the year 1842, when prices were much depressed, while they\r\nhad greatly rallied in 1844, when the importation of foreign wool had\r\nrisen from forty-five to sixty-five millions of pounds; and he had drawn\r\na triumphant inference that the increase of importation and the increase\r\nof price were in consequence of the reduction of the duty. This instance\r\nhad produced a great effect; but Lord George showed the House, by a\r\nreference to the tables of 1836, that the importation of foreign wool\r\nhad then risen to sixty-five millions of pounds, and that large foreign\r\nimportation was consistent with high prices to the domestic grower. Nor\r\nwas he less successful about the foreign cattle. He reminded his friends\r\non the Treasury bench how strenuously, previously to the introduction of\r\nthe tariff of 1842, they had urged upon their agricultural friends that\r\nno foreign cattle could enter under their regulations, and that\r\nthe whole object of the change was to strengthen the hands of the\r\nagricultural interest, as regarded more essential protection, by\r\nremoving the odium of a nominal protection: ‘Convinced by my right\r\nhonourable friends, in 1842, that their tariff would be as inoperative\r\nas it has proved, I gave my cordial support to the measure.’\r\n\r\nPerceiving that the House began to be wearied with the details of\r\nthe silk trade, which he had investigated with extraordinary zeal, he\r\npostponed until the specific vote in committee his objections to the\r\nreduction of the timber duties. The fact is, he had so thoroughly\r\nmastered all these topics, that his observations on each of them would\r\nhave themselves formed a speech of sufficient length and interest. But\r\nhe successfully checked any interruption by what may be fairly styled\r\nhis dignified diffidence.\r\n\r\n‘I trust the House will recollect that I am fighting the battle of a\r\nparty whose leaders have deserted them; and though I cannot wield my\r\nweapons with the skill of the right honourable gentleman on the Treasury\r\nbench, I trust the House will remember the emergency which has dragged\r\nme out to intrude upon their indulgence.’\r\n\r\nAnd again, when he announced that he was now about to investigate the\r\npretext of ‘famine in the land,’ and some impatience was exhibited, he\r\ndrew up and said, ‘I think, having sat eighteen years in this house, and\r\nnever once having trespassed on its time before in any one single\r\ngreat debate, I may appeal to the past as a proof that I duly weigh the\r\nmeasure of my abilities, and that I am painfully conscious of my proper\r\nplace in this house.’\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to resist such appeals from such a person, even at\r\nthree o’clock in the morning; and diffident, but determined, he then\r\nentered into what was, perhaps, the most remarkable portion of his\r\nspeech--an investigation of what was the real position of the country\r\nwith respect to the supply of food in the past autumn and at the present\r\nmoment. Having shown from the trade circulars that, far from there being\r\nat present ‘a wheat famine,’ the stocks in the granaries in bond were\r\nmore than double in amount to what they were in the year 1845, ‘a year\r\nadmitted by all to be a year of extraordinary abundance,’ he proceeded\r\nto the Irish part of the question: ‘I beg leave to say, that though this\r\ndebate has now continued for three weeks, I am the first gentleman\r\nwho has at all entered into the real state of the case as regards the\r\nallegation of a potato famine in Ireland, upon which, be it remembered,\r\nis founded the sole case of her Majesty’s ministers for a repeal of the\r\ncorn laws.’\r\n\r\nAnd this was very true. The fact is, though the Protectionist party had\r\nmade a most unexpected and gallant defence, no one was really prepared\r\nfor the contest except Bentinck. Between the end of November and the\r\nmeeting of Parliament, he had thrown all the energies of his passionate\r\nmind into this question. He had sought information on all points\r\nand always at the fountain-head. He had placed himself in immediate\r\ncommunication with the ablest representatives of every considerable\r\ninterest attacked, and being ardent and indefatigable, gifted with\r\na tenacious memory and a very clear and searching spirit, there was\r\nscarcely a detail or an argument connected with his subject which was\r\nnot immediately at his command. No speeches in favour of the protective\r\nsystem have ever been made in the House of Commons compared with his in\r\ndepth and range of knowledge; and had there been any member not\r\nconnected with the government, who had been able to vindicate the merits\r\nof British agriculture as he did when the final struggle occurred, the\r\nimpression which was made by the too-often unanswered speeches of the\r\nManchester confederation would never have been effected. But the great\r\nConservative party, exhausted by the labours of ten years of opposition,\r\nthought that after the triumph of ‘41 it might claim a furlough. The\r\ndefence of their cause was left entirely to the ministers of their\r\nchoice; and ministers, distracted with detail and wearied with official\r\nlabour, are not always the most willing or the most efficient champions\r\nof the organic principles of a party.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, with respect to the disease in the Irish potato, had\r\nlargely referred to the statements of the inspectors of police. Lord\r\nGeorge wanted to know why the reports of the lieutenants of the Irish\r\ncounties were not given. Being well-informed upon this head, he asked\r\nthe government to produce the report of Lord Duncannon, the lord\r\nlieutenant of Carlow; especially that of his noble father, the earl of\r\nBes-borough, lord lieutenant of Kilkenny. ‘Is there any man in England\r\nor in Ireland whose opinion, from his business-like habits, his great\r\npractical knowledge, and the warm and affectionate interest which for\r\na long period of years he has taken in everything which concerns the\r\ninterests of Ireland, especially of the Irish peasantry--is there\r\nany man whose opinion would have greater weight? The opinion of Lord\r\nBes-borough on an Irish subject, the lieutenant of an Irish county, and\r\nhimself long a cabinet minister? Well, sir, I am assured that, having\r\ntaken the utmost pains to investigate this matter, Lord Besborough has\r\nmade an elaborate report to the Irish government. Well, then, I\r\ndesire to know why Lord Besborough’s report to the Irish government\r\nis suppressed? Is it because that report would not assist the present\r\npolicy of her Majesty’s government?’\r\n\r\nHe alleged the names of many other individuals of high station who\r\nhad officially reported on the subject to the government: of Lord\r\nCastlereagh, the lieutenant of Down, a member of the House; of Lord\r\nde Vesci, whose son was sitting for the Queen’s County, over which his\r\nfather presided in the name of the queen. A murmur ran round the House,\r\nthat it would have been as well if these reports had been produced.\r\n\r\nThe last portion of this argumentative harangue referred to the most\r\nimportant division of the subject. Bentinck met it boldly, without\r\nevasion; nor was there any portion of his address more interesting, more\r\nsatisfactory, and more successful. ‘I now come,’ he said, ‘to the great\r\nchallenge, which is ever and anon put forth by the Anti-Corn Law League,\r\nand now by their disciples, her Majesty’s ministers. How are we, they\r\nask, with our limited extent of territory, to feed a population annually\r\nand rapidly increasing at the rate of three hundred thousand a-year,\r\nas generally stated by the member for Stockport--a rate increased by my\r\nnoble friend, the member for the West Riding, to a thousand a day, or\r\nthree hundred and sixty-five thousand a year?’\r\n\r\nHe first proved in a complete manner that, from the year 1821 to the\r\nyear 1844, the population of the country had increased at the rate of\r\nless than thirty-two per cent., while the growth of wheat during the\r\nsame period had increased no less than sixty-four per cent. He then\r\nproceeded to inquire why, with such an increased produce, we were still,\r\nas regards bread corn, to a certain extent, an importing nation? This he\r\naccounted for by the universally improved condition of the people, and\r\nthe enlarged command of food by the working classes. He drew an animated\r\npicture, founded entirely on the representations of writers and public\r\nmen adverse to the Protective System, of the superior condition of the\r\npeople of ‘England, happy England,’ to that of other countries: how they\r\nconsumed much more of the best food, and lived much longer. This was\r\nunder Protection, which Lord John Russell had stigmatized, in his\r\nletter, ‘the bane of agriculture.’ ‘In the history of my noble friend’s\r\nillustrious family,’ he continued, ‘I should have thought that he would\r\nhave found a remarkable refutation of such a notion.’ And then he drew a\r\nlively sketch of the colossal and patriotic works of the Earls and\r\nDukes of Bedford, ‘whereby they had drained and reclaimed three\r\nhundred thousand acres of land drowned in water, and brought them\r\ninto cultivation, and thus converted into fertile fields a vast morass\r\nextending over seven counties in England.’ Could the system which had\r\ninspired such enterprise be justly denounced as baneful?\r\n\r\nTo show the means of the country to sustain even a much-increasing\r\npopulation, and that those means were in operation, he entered into one\r\nof the most original and interesting calculations that was perhaps\r\never offered to the House of Commons. Reminding the House that in the\r\npreceding year (1845) the farmers of England, at a cost of two millions\r\nsterling, had imported two hundred and eighty thousand tons of guano, he\r\nproceeded to estimate what would be the effect on the productive powers\r\nof the land of that novel application. Two hundred thousand tons, or, in\r\nother words, four million hundred-weight, were expended on the land\r\nin 1845. Half of these, he assumed, would be applied to the growth of\r\nwheat, and the other half to the growth of turnips preparatory to the\r\nwheat crop of the ensuing year. According to the experiments tried and\r\nrecorded in the Royal Agricultural Journal, it would seem that by the\r\napplication of two hundred-weight of guano to an acre of wheat land, the\r\nproduce would be increased by one quarter per acre. At this rate, one\r\nhundred thousand tons, or two million hundred-weight of guano would add\r\none million quarters of wheat to the crop, or bread for one year for\r\none million of people. But as he was very careful never to over-state\r\na case, Lord George assumed, that it would require three hundred\r\nhundredweight of guano to an acre to produce an extra quarter of wheat.\r\nAccording to this estimate, one hundred thousand tons of guano, applied\r\nto the land in 1845, must have added six hundred and sixty-six thousand\r\nsix hundred and sixty-six quarters of grain to the wheat crop, or, in\r\nother words, bread for six hundred and sixty-six thousand six hundred\r\nand sixty-six additional mouths. ‘And now for turnips,’ he continued.\r\nThe Norfolk authorities whom he quoted have in like manner proved that\r\ntwo hundred-weight of guano will add ten tons per acre to the turnip\r\ncrop. But again, for fear of exaggeration, he supposed that three\r\nhundred-weight would be requisite to create such increased fertility. In\r\nthis case, two million hundredweight of guano would add six million six\r\nhundred and sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty tons to the natural\r\nunmanured produce of the crop. Now it is generally considered that one\r\nton of Swedes would last twenty sheep three weeks, and that each sheep\r\nshould gain half a pound of meat per week, or one pound and a half in\r\nthree weeks; thus twenty sheep feeding on one ton of turnips in three\r\nweeks should in the aggregate make, as the graziers say, thirty pounds\r\nof mutton. But to be safe in his estimate, he would assume that one ton\r\nof turnips makes only half this quantity. ‘Multiply, then,’ exclaimed\r\nBentinck with the earnest air of a crusader, ‘six million six hundred\r\nand sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty by fifteen, and you have no\r\nless than ninety-nine million nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand and\r\nnine hundred pounds of mutton as the fruits of one hundred thousand tons\r\nof guano; which, at ninety-two pounds per man--the average Englishman’s\r\nallowance--affords meat for one million eight hundred and sixty thousand\r\nnine hundred and fifty-five--nearly two million of her Majesty’s\r\nsubjects.’\r\n\r\nThis is a specimen of those original and startling calculations to\r\nwhich the House was soon to become accustomed from his lips. They were\r\nreceived at first with astonishment and incredulity; but they were never\r\nimpugned. The fact is, he was extremely cautious in his data, and no\r\nman was more accustomed ever to impress upon his friends the extreme\r\nexpediency of not over-stating a case. It should also be remarked of\r\nLord George Bentinck, that in his most complicated calculations he never\r\nsought aid from notes.\r\n\r\nWe have necessarily only noticed a few of the traits of this remarkable\r\nperformance. Its termination was impressive.\r\n\r\n‘We have heard in the course of these discussions a good deal about an\r\nancient monarchy, a reformed House of Commons, and a proud aristocracy.\r\nSir, with regard to our ancient monarchy, I have no observation to make;\r\nbut, if so humble an individual as myself might be permitted to whisper,\r\na word in the ear of that illustrious and royal personage who, as\r\nhe stands nearest, so is he justly dearest, to her who sits upon the\r\nthrone, I would take leave to say, that I cannot but think he listened\r\nto ill advice, when, on the first night of this great discussion, he\r\nallowed himself to be seduced by the first minister of the crown to\r\ncome down to this House to usher in, to give _éclat_, and as it were\r\nby reflection from the queen, to give the semblance of the personal\r\nsanction of her Majesty to a measure which, be it for good or for evil,\r\na great majority at least of the landed aristocracy of England, of\r\nScotland, and of Ireland, imagine fraught with deep injury, if not ruin,\r\nto them\r\n\r\n--a measure which, not confined in its operation to this great class,\r\nis calculated to grind down countless smaller interests engaged in the\r\ndomestic trades and, interests of the empire, transferring the profits\r\nof all these interests--English, Scotch, Irish, and Colonial\r\n\r\n--great and small alike, from Englishmen, from Scotchmen, and from\r\nIrishmen, to Americans, to Frenchmen, to Russians, to Poles, to\r\nPrussians, and to Germans. Sir, I come now to the reformed House of\r\nCommons; and as one who was a party to that great measure, I cannot but\r\nfeel a deep interest in its success, and more especially in that\r\nportion of it which extended the franchise to the largest and the most\r\nrespectable body in the kingdom--I mean the landed tenantry of England;\r\nand deeply should I regret should any large proportion of those members\r\nwho have been sent to Parliament to represent them in this House,\r\nprove to be the men to bring lasting dishonour upon themselves, their\r\nconstituencies, and this House, by an act of tergiversation so gross\r\nas to be altogether unprecedented in the annals of any reformed\r\nor unreformed House of Commons. Sir, lastly, I come to the “proud\r\naristocracy.” We are a proud aristocracy, but if we are proud, it is\r\nthat we are proud in the chastity of our honour. If we assisted in ‘41\r\nin turning the Whigs out of office, because we did not consider a\r\nfixed duty of eight shillings a quarter on foreign corn a sufficient\r\nprotection, it was with honesty of purpose and in single-mindedness we\r\ndid so; and as we were not before the fact, we will not be accomplices\r\nafter the fact in the fraud by which the Whig ministers were expelled\r\nfrom power. If we are a proud aristocracy, we are proud of our honour,\r\ninasmuch as we never have been guilty, and never can be guilty, of\r\ndouble-dealing with the farmers of England--of swindling our opponents,\r\ndeceiving our friends, or betraying our constituents.’\r\n\r\nThe division was called. The West-India interest, notwithstanding\r\nthe amendment was moved by the member for Bristol, deserted the\r\nProtectionists. Deaf to the appeals, and the remonstrances, and the\r\nwarnings of Lord George, one of their leading members replied, with\r\na smile of triumphant content, that ‘they had made a satisfactory\r\narrangement for themselves.’ How satisfactory did the West-Indians find\r\nit four months subsequently? All the shipping interest deserted the\r\nland. They were for everything free, except navigation; there was no\r\ndanger of that being interfered with; ‘it rested on quite distinct\r\ngrounds--national grounds.’ They were warned, but they smiled in\r\nderisive self-complacency. Lord George Bentinck lived to have the\r\nWest-India interest and the shipping interest on their knees to him,\r\nto defend their perilled or to restore their ruined fortunes; and with\r\ncharacteristic generosity and proud consistency, he undertook the task,\r\nand sacrificed his life in the attempt.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these terrible defalcations, when the numbers were\r\nannounced, at nearly four o’clock in the morning, the majority had\r\nnot reached those three magical figures supposed necessary, under the\r\ncircumstances, to success. In a house of five hundred and eighty-one\r\nmembers present, the amendment of the Protectionists was defeated only\r\nby ninety-seven; and two hundred and forty-two gentlemen, in spite of\r\ndesertion, difficulty, and defeat, still maintained the ‘chastity of\r\ntheir honour.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     _The Irish Question_\r\n\r\nIN THE meantime, besides the prolonged and unforeseen resistance of the\r\nProtectionists, there were other and unexpected causes at work which\r\nequally, or perhaps even more powerfully tended to the fulfilment of the\r\nscheme of delay, which Lord George Bentinck had recommended his friends\r\nto adopt and encourage.\r\n\r\nIn the latter months of the year 1845, there broke out in some of the\r\ncounties of Ireland one of those series of outrages which have hitherto\r\nperiodically occurred in districts of that country. Assassination and\r\ncrimes of violence were rife: men on the queen’s highway were shot from\r\nbehind hedges, or suddenly torn from their horses and beaten to death\r\nwith clubs; houses were visited in the night by bodies of men, masked\r\nand armed--their owners dragged from their beds, and, in the presence\r\nof their wives and children, maimed and mutilated; the administration of\r\nunlawful oaths, with circumstances of terror, indicated the existence of\r\nsecret confederations, whose fell intents, profusely and ostentatiously\r\nannounced by threatening letters, were frequently and savagely\r\nperpetrated.\r\n\r\nThese barbarous distempers had their origin in the tenure of land in\r\nIreland, and in the modes of its occupation. A combination of causes,\r\npolitical, social, and economical, had for more than a century unduly\r\nstimulated the population of a country which had no considerable\r\nresources except in the soil. That soil had become divided into minute\r\nallotments, held by a pauper tenantry, at exorbitant rents, of a class\r\nof middlemen, themselves necessitous, and who were mere traders in land.\r\nA fierce competition raged amid the squalid multitude for these strips\r\nof earth which were their sole means of existence. To regulate this\r\nfatal rivalry, and restrain this emulation of despair, the peasantry,\r\nenrolled in secret societies, found refuge in an inexorable code. He who\r\nsupplanted another in the occupation of the soil was doomed by an occult\r\ntribunal, from which there was no appeal, to a terrible retribution. His\r\nhouse was visited in the night by whitefeet and ribbonmen--his doom was\r\ncommunicated to him, by the post, in letters, signed by Terry Alt, or\r\nMolly M’Guire, or he was suddenly shot, like a dog, by the orders of\r\nCaptain Rock. Yet even these violent inflictions rather punished than\r\nprevented the conduct against which they were directed. The Irish\r\npeasant had to choose between starving and assassination. If, in\r\ndeference to an anonymous mandate, he relinquished his holding, he and\r\nthose who depended on him were outcasts and wanderers; if he retained or\r\naccepted it, his life might be the forfeit, but subsistence was secured;\r\nand in poor and lawless countries, the means of living are more valued\r\nthan life. Those who have treated of the agrarian crimes of Ireland\r\nhave remarked, that the facility with which these outrages have been\r\ncommitted has only been equalled by the difficulty of punishing them. A\r\nmurder, perpetrated at noonday, in the sight of many persons, cannot be\r\nproved in a court of justice. The spectators are never witnesses; and it\r\nhas been inferred from this, that the outrage is national, and that the\r\nheart of the populace is with the criminal. But though a chief landlord,\r\nor a stipendiary magistrate, may occasionally be sacrificed, the great\r\nmajority of victims are furnished by the humblest class. Not sympathy,\r\nbut terror, seals the lip and clouds the eye of the bystander. And this\r\nis proved by the fact that while those who have suffered have almost\r\nalways publicly declared that they were unable to recognize their\r\nassailants, and believed them to be strangers, they have frequently, in\r\nconfidence, furnished the police with the names of the guilty.\r\n\r\nThus, there is this remarkable characteristic of the agrarian anarchy\r\nof Ireland which marks it out from all similar conditions of other\r\ncountries: it is a war of the poor against the poor.\r\n\r\nBefore the rapid increase of population had forced governments to study\r\npolitical economy and to investigate the means of subsisting a people,\r\nstatesmen had contented themselves by attributing to political causes\r\nthese predial disturbances, and by recommending for them political\r\nremedies. The course of time, which had aggravated the condition of the\r\nIrish peasantry, had increased the numbers, the wealth, and the general\r\nimportance of those of the middle classes of Ireland who professed the\r\nRoman Catholic faith. Shut out from the political privileges of the\r\nconstitution, these formed a party of discontent that was a valuable\r\nally to the modern Whigs, too long excluded from that periodical share\r\nof power which is the life-blood of a parliamentary government and the\r\nsafeguard of a constitutional monarchy. The misgovernment of Ireland\r\nbecame therefore a stock topic of the earlier Opposition of the present\r\ncentury; and advocating the cause of their clients, who wished to become\r\nmayors, and magistrates, and members of the legislature, they argued\r\nthat in the concession of those powers and dignities, and perhaps in\r\nthe discreet confiscation of the property of the Church, the only cures\r\ncould be found for threatening notices, robbery of arms, administering\r\nof unlawful oaths, burglary, murder, and arson.\r\n\r\nYet if these acts of violence were attributable to defective political\r\ninstitutions, why, as was usually the case, were they partial in their\r\noccurrence? Why were they limited to particular districts? If political\r\ngrievances were the cause, the injustice would be as sharp in tranquil\r\nWexford as in turbulent Tipperary. Yet out of the thirty-two counties\r\nof Ireland, the outrages prevailed usually in less than a third. These\r\noutrages were never insurrectionary: they were not directed against\r\nexisting authorities; they were stimulated by no public cause or\r\nclamour; it was the private individual who was attacked, and for a\r\nprivate reason. This was their characteristic.\r\n\r\nBut as time elapsed, two considerable events occurred: the Roman\r\nCatholic restrictions were repealed, and the Whigs became ministers.\r\nNotwithstanding these great changes, the condition of the Irish\r\npeasantry remained the same; the tenure of land was unchanged, the modes\r\nof its occupation were unaltered, its possession was equally necessary\r\nand equally perilous. The same circumstances produced the same\r\nconsequences. Notwithstanding even that the Irish Church had been\r\nremodelled, and its revenues not only commuted but curtailed;\r\nnotwithstanding that Roman Catholics had not only become members of\r\nParliament but even Parliament had been reformed; Irish outrage became\r\nmore flagrant and more extensive than at any previous epoch--and the\r\nWhigs were ministers.\r\n\r\nPlaced in this responsible position, forced to repress the evil, the\r\ncauses of which they had so often explained, and which with their\r\ncooperation had apparently been so effectually removed, the Whig\r\ngovernment were obliged to have recourse to the very means which they\r\nhad so frequently denounced when recommended by their rivals, and that,\r\ntoo, on a scale of unusual magnitude and severity. They proposed for\r\nthe adoption of Parliament one of those measures which would suspend the\r\nconstitution of Ireland, and which are generally known by the name of\r\nCoercion Acts.\r\n\r\nThe main and customary provisions of these Coercion Acts were of\r\nsevere restraint, and scarcely less violent than the conduct they were\r\nconstructed to repress. They invested the lord lieutenant with power\r\nto proclaim a district as disturbed, and then to place its inhabitants\r\nwithout the pale of the established law; persons out of their dwellings\r\nbetween sunset and sunrise were liable to transportation; and to secure\r\nthe due execution of the law, prisoners were tried before military\r\ntribunals, and not by their peers, whose verdicts, from sympathy or\r\nterror, were usually found to baffle justice.\r\n\r\nThese Coercion Acts were effectual; they invariably obtained their end,\r\nand the proclaimed districts became tranquil. But they were an affair\r\nof police, not of government; essentially temporary, their effect was\r\nalmost as transient as their sway, and as they were never accompanied\r\nwith any deep and sincere attempt to cope with the social circumstances\r\nwhich produced disorder, the recurrence of the chronic anarchy was\r\nmerely an affair of time. Whether it were that they did not sufficiently\r\napprehend the causes, or that they shrank from a solution which must\r\nbring them in contact with the millions of a surplus population, there\r\nseems always to have been an understanding between the public men\r\nof both parties, that the Irish difficulty should be deemed a purely\r\npolitical, or at the utmost a religious one. And even so late as 1846,\r\nno less a personage than the present chief secretary, put forward by\r\nhis party to oppose an Irish Coercion Bill which themselves had loudly\r\ncalled for, declared that he could not sanction its penal enactments\r\nunless they were accompanied by the remedial measures that were\r\nnecessary, to wit, an Irish Franchise Bill, and a Bill for the amendment\r\nof municipal corporations!\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Robert Peel, in 1841, after a memorable opposition of ten\r\nyears, acceded to office, sustained by all the sympathies of the\r\ncountry, his Irish policy, not sufficiently noticed amid the vast and\r\nurgent questions with which he had immediately to deal, was, however, to\r\nthe political observer significant and interesting. As a mere matter of\r\nparty tactics, it was not for him too much to impute Irish disturbances\r\nto political and religious causes, even if the accumulated experience\r\nof the last ten years were not developing a conviction in his mind, that\r\nthe methods hitherto adopted to ensure the tranquillity of that country\r\nwere superficial and fallacious. His cabinet immediately recognized\r\na distinction between political and predial sources of disorder.\r\nThe first, they resolved into a mere system of agitation, no longer\r\njustifiable by the circumstances, and this they determined to put down.\r\nThe second, they sought in the conditions under which land was occupied,\r\nand these they determined to investigate. Hence, on the one hand, the\r\nO’Connell prosecution: on the other, the Devon commission.\r\n\r\nThis was the bold and prudent policy of a minister who felt he had\r\nthe confidence of the country and was sustained by great parliamentary\r\nmajorities; and when the summoner of monster meetings was convicted, and\r\nthe efficient though impartial manner in which the labours of the land\r\ncommission were simultaneously conducted came to be bruited about, there\r\nseemed at last some prospect of the system of political quackery of\r\nwhich Ireland had been so long the victim being at last subverted. But\r\nthere is nothing in which the power of circumstances is more evident\r\nthan in politics. They baffle the forethought of statesmen, and control\r\neven the apparently inflexible laws of national development and decay.\r\n\r\nHad the government of 1841 succeeded in its justifiable expectation of\r\nterminating the trade of political agitation in Ireland, armed with all\r\nthe authority and all the information with which the labours of the land\r\ncommission would have furnished them, they would in all probability have\r\nsuccessfully grappled with the real causes of Irish misery and misrule.\r\nThey might have thoroughly reformed the modes by which land is holden\r\nand occupied; have anticipated the spontaneous emigration that now rages\r\nby an administrative enterprise scarcely more costly than the barren\r\nloan of ‘47, and which would have wafted native energies to imperial\r\nshores; have limited under these circumstances the evil of the potato\r\nfamine, even if the improved culture of the interval might not have\r\naltogether prevented that visitation; while the laws which regulated the\r\ncompetition between home and foreign industry in agricultural produce\r\nmight have been modified with so much prudence, or, if necessary,\r\nultimately repealed with so much precaution, that those rapid and\r\nstartling vicissitudes that have so shattered the social fabric of\r\nIreland might altogether have been avoided.\r\n\r\nBut it was decreed that it should be otherwise. Having achieved the\r\nincredible conviction of O’Connell, by an Irish jury, the great culprit\r\nbaffled the vengeance of the law by a quirk which a lawyer only could\r\nhave devised. As regards his Irish policy, Sir Robert Peel never\r\nrecovered this blow, the severity of which was proportionably increased\r\nby its occurrence at a moment of unprecedented success. Resolute not to\r\nrecur to his ancient Orangeism, yet desperate after his discomfiture of\r\nrallying a moderate party around his ministry, his practical mind,\r\nmore clear-sighted than foreseeing, was alarmed at the absence of all\r\ninfluences for the government of Ireland. The tranquillity which might\r\nresult from a reformed tenure of the soil, must, if attainable, be\r\na distant blessing, and at present he saw only the obstacles to its\r\nfulfilment--prejudiced landlords, and the claims and necessities of\r\npauper millions. He shrank from a theory which might be an illusion. He\r\nrequired a policy for the next post and the next division. There was\r\nin his view only one course to take, to outbid his predecessors as\r\nsuccessfully in Irish politics as he was doing in taxes and tariffs. He\r\nresolved to appropriate the liberal party of Ireland, and merge it into\r\nthe great Conservative confederation which was destined to destroy so\r\nmany things. He acted with promptitude and energy, for Sir Robert Peel\r\nnever hesitated when he had made up his mind. His real character was\r\nvery different from his public reputation. Far from being timid\r\nand wary, he was audacious and even headstrong. It was his cold and\r\nconstrained demeanour that misled the public. There never was a man who\r\ndid such rash things in so circumspect a manner. He had been fortunate\r\nin early disembarrassing himself of the Orange counsellors who had\r\nconducted his Irish questions when in opposition; vacant judgeships\r\nhad opportunely satisfied the recognized and respectable claims of\r\nMr. Serjeant Jackson and Mr. Lefroy; and so Sir Robert Peel, without\r\na qualm, suddenly began to govern Ireland by sending it ‘messages of\r\npeace.’\r\n\r\nThey took various forms; sometimes a Charitable Bequests Act virtually\r\nplaced the Roman Catholic hierarchy in friendly equality with the\r\nprelates of the Established Church; sometimes a ‘godless college’\r\ncalled forth a moan from alarmed and irritated Oxford; the endowment\r\nof Maynooth struck wider and deeper, and the middle-classes of England,\r\nroused from their religious lethargy, called in vain to the rescue of\r\na Protestantism betrayed. But the minister was unshaken. Successful\r\nand self-sufficient, impressed with a conviction that his government\r\nin duration would rival that of a Walpole or a Pitt, and exceed both\r\nin lustre, he treated every remonstrance with imperious disdain. He had\r\neven accustomed his mind to contemplate an ecclesiastical adjustment\r\nof Ireland which would have allied in that country the Papacy with the\r\nState, and have terminated the constitutional supremacy of the Anglican\r\nChurch, when suddenly, in the very heat of all this arrogant fortune,\r\nthe mighty fabric of delusion shivered and fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nAn abused and indignant soil repudiated the ungrateful race that had\r\nexhausted and degraded its once exuberant bosom. The land refused\r\nto hold those who would not hold the land on terms of justice and of\r\nscience. All the economical palliatives and political pretences of\r\nlong years seemed only to aggravate the suffering and confusion. The\r\npoor-rate was levied upon a community of paupers, and the ‘godless\r\ncolleges’ were denounced by Rome as well as Oxford.\r\n\r\nAfter a wild dream of famine and fever, imperial loans, rates in\r\naid, jobbing public works, confiscated estates, constituencies\r\nself-disfranchised, and St. Peter’s bearding St. James’s in a spirit\r\nbecoming Christendom rather than Europe, time topped the climax of Irish\r\nmisgovernment; and by the publication of the census of 1851, proved that\r\nthe millions with whose evils no statesmen would sincerely deal,\r\nbut whose condition had been the pretext for so much empiricism, had\r\ndisappeared, and nature, more powerful than politicians, had settled the\r\n‘great difficulty.’\r\n\r\nEre the publication of that document, the mortal career of Sir Robert\r\nPeel had closed, and indeed several of the circumstances to which we\r\nhave just alluded did not occur in his administration; but the contrast\r\nbetween his policy and its results was nevertheless scarcely less\r\nstriking. It was in ‘45 that he transmitted his most important ‘message\r\nof peace’ to Ireland, to be followed by an autumnal visit of her Majesty\r\nto that kingdom, painted in complacent and prophetic colours by her\r\nprime minister. The visit was not made. In the course of that autumn,\r\nten counties of Ireland were in a state of anarchy; and, mainly in\r\nthat period, there were 136 homicides committed, 138 houses burned, 483\r\nhouses attacked, and 138 fired into; there were 544 cases of aggravated\r\nassault, and 551 of robbery of arms; there were 89 cases of bands\r\nappearing in arms; there were more than 200 cases of administering\r\nunlawful oaths; and there were 1,944 cases of sending threatening\r\nletters. By the end of the year, the general crime of Ireland had\r\ndoubled in amount and enormity compared with the preceding year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     _The Cure for Irish Ills_\r\n\r\nLORD GEORGE BENTINCK had large but defined views as to the policy which\r\nshould be pursued with respect to Ireland. He was a firm supporter of\r\nthe constitutional preponderance allotted to the land in our scheme of\r\ngovernment, not from any jealousy or depreciation of the other great\r\nsources of public wealth, for his sympathy with the trading classes\r\nwas genuine, but because he believed that constitutional preponderance,\r\nwhile not inconsistent with great commercial prosperity, to be the best\r\nsecurity for public liberty and the surest foundation of enduring power.\r\nBut as reality was the characteristic of his vigorous and sagacious\r\nnature, he felt that a merely formal preponderance, one not sustained\r\nand authorized by an equivalent material superiority, was a position not\r\ncalculated to endure in the present age, and one especially difficult to\r\nmaintain with our rapidly increasing population. For this reason he was\r\nalways very anxious to identify the policy of Great Britain with that\r\nof Ireland, the latter being a country essentially agricultural; and he\r\nalways shrank from any proposition which admitted a difference in the\r\ninterests of the two kingdoms.\r\n\r\nLiberal politicians, who some years ago were very loud for justice to\r\nIreland, and would maintain at all hazards the identity of the interests\r\nof the two countries, have of late frequently found it convenient\r\nto omit that kingdom from their statistical bulletins of national\r\nprosperity. Lord George Bentinck, on the contrary, would impress on his\r\nfriends, that if they wished to maintain the territorial constitution of\r\ntheir country, they must allow no sectarian considerations to narrow the\r\nbasis of sympathy on which it should rest; and in the acres and millions\r\nof Ireland, in its soil and its people, equally neglected, he would have\r\nsought the natural auxiliaries of our institutions. To secure for our\r\nIrish fellow-subjects a regular market for their produce; to develop\r\nthe resources of their country by public works on a great scale; and\r\nto obtain a decent provision for the Roman Catholic priesthood from the\r\nland and not from the consolidated fund, were three measures which he\r\nlooked upon as in the highest degree conservative.\r\n\r\nWhen the project of the cabinet of 1846 had transpired, Lord George at\r\nonce declared, and was in the habit of reiterating his opinion, that ‘it\r\nwould ruin the 500,000 small farmers of Ireland,’ and he watched with\r\ngreat interest and anxiety the conduct of their representatives in\r\nthe House of Commons. It was with great difficulty that he could bring\r\nhimself to believe, that political liberalism would induce the members\r\nfor the south and west of Ireland to support a policy in his opinion so\r\nfatal to their countrymen as the unconditional repeal of the corn laws;\r\nand, indeed, before they took that step, which almost all of them\r\nhave since publicly regretted and attempted to compensate for by their\r\nsubsequent votes in the House of Commons, the prospect of their conduct\r\nfrequently and considerably varied.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of St. Germans, the chief secretary of the Lord Lieutenant,\r\nintroduced the Coercion Bill to the House of Lords on the 24th of\r\nFebruary, and, considering the exigency, and the important reference\r\nto it in the speech from the throne, this step on the part of the\r\ngovernment was certainly not precipitate. It was observed that the\r\nstrongest supporters of the measure in the House of Lords on this\r\noccasion were the leaders of the Whig party. Lord Lansdowne, ‘so far\r\nfrom complaining of the Government for bringing forward the measure at\r\nso early a period of the session, was ready to admit, that after the\r\ndeclaration of her Majesty, a declaration unhappily warranted by\r\nfacts known to many of their lordships, every day was lost in which an\r\neffectual remedy was not at least attempted to put an end to a state\r\nof society so horrible.’ Lord Clanricarde ‘gave his ready assent to the\r\nbill;’ and even Lord Grey, ‘though he regretted the necessity for this\r\nmeasure, was of opinion that the chief secretary had established a\r\nsufficient case for arming the executive government with some additional\r\npowers.’ When, therefore, at the end of the month of March, Lord George\r\nBentinck was invited to attend a meeting of his friends, held at the\r\nhouse of Mr. Bankes, to consider the course which should be adopted\r\nby the Protectionist party with respect to the Coercion Bill, it was\r\nassumed, as a matter of course, that the coalition of the government\r\nand the Whigs must secure the passing of the measure, even if the\r\nProtectionists were disposed, for the chance of embarrassing the\r\nministry, to resist it; and of course there was no great tendency in\r\nthat direction. Men are apt to believe that crime and coercion are\r\ninevitably associated. There was abundance of precedent for the course,\r\nwhich seemed also a natural one.\r\n\r\nIn less than a century there had been seventeen coercive acts for\r\nIreland, a circumstance which might make some ponder whether\r\nsuch legislation were as efficacious as it was violent. However,\r\nassassination rife, Captain Rock and Molly M’Guire out at night, Whigs\r\nand Tories all agreed, it was easy to catch at a glance the foregone\r\nconclusion of the meeting. One advantage of having a recognized organ of\r\na political party is, that its members do not decide too precipitately.\r\nThey listen before they determine, and if they have a doubt, they\r\nwill grant the benefit of it to him whose general ability they have\r\nacknowledged, and to whom they willingly give credit for having viewed\r\nthe question at issue in a more laborious and painful manner than\r\nthemselves. Without a leader, they commit themselves to opinions\r\ncarelessly and hastily adopted. This is fatal to a party in debate; but\r\nit often entails very serious consequences when the mistakes have been\r\ncommitted in a less public and responsible scene than the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, there was only one individual who took any\r\nconsiderable lead in the management of the party who ventured to suggest\r\nthe expediency of pausing before they pledged themselves to support an\r\nunconstitutional measure, proposed by a government against which they\r\nwere arrayed under circumstances of urgent and unusual opposition. The\r\nsupport of an unconstitutional measure may be expedient, but it cannot\r\nbe denied that it is the most indubitable evidence of confidence. This\r\nsuggestion, though received with kindness, elicited little sympathy, and\r\nLord George Bentinck, who had not yet spoken, and who always refrained\r\nat these meetings from taking that directing part which he never wished\r\nto assume, marking the general feeling of those present, and wishing to\r\nguide it to a practical result advantageous to their policy, observed\r\nthat the support of the Coercion Bill by the Protectionists, ought to be\r\nmade conditional on the government proving the sincerity of their policy\r\nby immediately proceeding with their measure; that if life were in\r\nsuch danger in Ireland as was officially stated, and as he was bound\r\nto believe, no Corn or Customs’ Bill could compete in urgency with the\r\nnecessity of pressing forward a bill, the object of which was to arrest\r\nwholesale assassination. He was, therefore, for giving the government\r\na hearty support, provided they proved they were in earnest in their\r\ndetermination to put down murder and outrage in Ireland, by giving a\r\npriority in the conduct of public business to the measure in question.\r\n\r\nThis view of the situation, which was certainly adroit, for it combined\r\nthe vindication of order with an indefinite delay of the measures for\r\nthe repeal of the protective system, seemed to please every one; there\r\nwas a murmur of approbation, and when one of the most considerable of\r\nthe country gentlemen expressed the prevalent feeling, and added that\r\nall that was now to be desired was that Lord George Bentinck would\r\nkindly consent to be the organ of the party on the occasion, and state\r\ntheir view to the House, the cheering was very hearty. It came from the\r\nhearts of more than two hundred gentlemen, scarcely one of whom had a\r\npersonal object in this almost hopeless struggle beyond the maintenance\r\nof a system which he deemed advantageous to his country; but they wished\r\nto show their generous admiration of the man who, in the dark hour of\r\ndifficulty and desertion, had proved his courage and resource, had\r\nsaved them from public contempt, and taught them to have confidence in\r\nthemselves. And after all, there are few rewards in life which equal\r\nsuch sympathy from such men. The favour of courts and the applause\r\nof senates may have their moments of excitement and delight, but the\r\nincident of deepest and most enduring gratification in public life is to\r\npossess the cordial confidence of a high-spirited party, for it touches\r\nthe heart as well as the intellect, and combines all the softer feelings\r\nof private life with the ennobling consciousness of public duty.\r\n\r\nLord George Bentinck, deeply moved, consented to become the organ of the\r\nProtectionists in this matter; but he repeated in a marked manner his\r\nprevious declaration, that his duty must be limited to the occasion: he\r\nwould serve with them, but he could not pretend to be the leader of a\r\nparty. In that capacity, however, the government chose to recognize him,\r\nand there occurred in consequence, very shortly after this meeting, a\r\nscene in the House of Commons, which occasioned at the time a great deal\r\nof surprise and scandal. The Secretary of the Treasury, in pursuance\r\nof one of his principal duties, which is to facilitate by mutual\r\nunderstanding the conduct of public business in the House of Commons,\r\napplied to Lord George Bentinck, confessedly at the request of Sir\r\nRobert Peel, to ‘enter into some arrangement’ as to the conduct of\r\npublic business before Easter. The arrangement suggested was, that if\r\nthe Protectionists supported the Coercion Bill, which it was the wish\r\nof Sir Robert Peel should be read a first time before Easter, the third\r\nreading of the Bill for the Repeal of the Corn Laws should be postponed\r\nuntil after Easter. The interview by appointment took place in the Vote\r\nOffice, where the Secretary of the Treasury ‘called Lord George aside’\r\nand made this proposition. Lord George stated in reply, ‘what he\r\nbelieved to be the views of the party with whom he served,’ and they\r\nwere those we have already intimated. The ‘arrangement’ was concluded,\r\nand it was at the same time agreed that certain questions, of which\r\nnotice had been given by Lord John Russell, relative to the progress\r\nof these very measures, should be allowed by the Protectionists to pass\r\n_sub silentio_. This ‘pledge,’ made by the noble lord for himself and\r\nhis friends, was ‘scrupulously observed.’ Nevertheless, after all this,\r\na letter arrived from the Secretary of the Treasury, addressed to the\r\nnoble lord, stating that the secretary ‘had not been authorized in\r\nsaying as much as he had said,’ and requesting that the conversation\r\nwhich had taken place might be considered private. Upon this, Lord\r\nGeorge Bentinck drew up a statement, ‘setting forth all that had\r\npassed,’ and forwarded it to the secretary as his reply. Subsequently,\r\nhe met that gentleman, who admitted that ‘every word in that statement,\r\nas respected the conversation which had passed, was perfectly correct.’\r\n\r\nThis being the state of the case, on the second night of the debate\r\non Mr. Eliot Yorke’s amendment, which we have noticed, and after the\r\nadjournment had been moved and carried, the government proceeded with\r\nsome motions of form, which indicated their intention to secure, if\r\npossible, the third reading of the Corn Bill before Easter. Upon\r\nthis, Lord George Bentinck, after a hurried and apparently agitated\r\nconversation with the Secretary of the Treasury and others connected\r\nwith the government, rose to move the adjournment of the House. He then\r\ngave as his reason the circumstances which we have briefly conveyed. A\r\nscene of considerable confusion occurred; the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nadmitted the correctness of the statement; the First Lord of the\r\nTreasury rejected the alleged authority of the secretary. Mr. Tuffnell,\r\non the part of the Whigs, intimated that public business could not be\r\ncarried on if the recognized organs were repudiated by their chief. The\r\nfeeling of all parties coincided with Mr. Tuffnell; finally, an Irish\r\nrepealer rose and announced that the government were bartering their\r\nCorn Bill to secure coercion to Ireland. Lord George Bentinck said the\r\nCoercion Bill was ‘a second Curfew Act,’ that nothing but necessity\r\ncould justify it, and if it were necessary it must be immediate. Sir\r\nRobert remained irritated and obstinate. He would not give up a stage\r\neither of the Corn Bill or the Coercion Bill; he wanted to advance both\r\nbefore Easter. The mere division of the House between Free-traders and\r\nProtectionists had already ceased; there were breakers ahead, and it\r\nwas not difficult from this night to perceive that the course of the\r\ngovernment would not be so summary as they had once expected.\r\n\r\nThis strange interlude occurred after midnight on the 26th of March. On\r\nFriday, the 27th, the House divided on the amendment of Mr. Eliot Yorke,\r\nand the Corn Bill was read for the second time. On the reassembling of\r\nthe House on Monday, the 30th, an extraordinary scene took place.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the cabinet, after painful deliberation, had arrived at\r\nthe conclusion that, notwithstanding the importance of sending up\r\nthe Corn Bill to the House of Lords before Easter, it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to proceed at once with the Coercion Bill; and it was resolved\r\nthat the Secretary of State should on this evening lay before the House\r\nthe facts and reasons which ‘induce the Government to believe in the\r\nnecessity of the measure.’ Mr. O’Connell and his followers had already\r\nannounced their intention of opposing the first reading of the bill,\r\nan allowable but very unusual course. It is competent to the House of\r\nCommons to refuse a first reading to any bill sent down to it; but the\r\njournals afford few examples of the exercise of such a privilege. A\r\nmember of the House of Lords may lay on the table, as a matter of pure\r\nright, any bill which he thinks proper to introduce, and it is read a\r\nfirst time as a matter of course; the orders of the House of Commons are\r\ndifferent, and a member must obtain permission before he introduces a\r\nbill. This permission is occasionally refused; but when a bill comes\r\nfrom the House of Lords, the almost invariable custom is to read it\r\nfor the first time without discussion. There are, however, as we have\r\nobserved, instances to the contrary, and the Irish Coercion Bill of ‘33\r\nwas one of them. So pregnant a precedent could not be forgotten on\r\nthe present occasion. The government therefore were prepared for an\r\nopposition to the first reading of their bill; but trusting to the\r\nstrength of their case and the assumed support of the Whig party, they\r\nbelieved that this opposition would not be stubborn, more especially\r\nas there were numerous stages of the measure on which the views of its\r\nopponents might be subsequently expressed, and as they themselves were\r\nprepared to engage that they would not proceed further than this\r\nfirst reading until the Corn Bill had passed the House of Commons. The\r\nconsternation, therefore, of the government could scarcely be\r\nconcealed, when they found on Monday night that they had to encounter a\r\nwell-organized party opposition, headed by Sir William Somerville, and\r\nsanctioned and supported in debate by Lord John Russell and Sir George\r\nGrey.\r\n\r\nIt would seem indeed a difficult and somewhat graceless office for the\r\nWhigs to oppose the first reading of a government bill, concerning,\r\ntoo, the highest duties of administration, which had received such\r\nunqualified approval from all the leading members of their party in the\r\nHouse of Lords, who had competed in declarations of its necessity and\r\nacknowledgments of its moderation, while they only regretted the too\r\ntardy progress of a measure so indispensable to the safety of\r\nthe country and the security of her Majesty’s subjects. A curious\r\ncircumstance, however, saved them from this dilemma, which yet in\r\nthe strange history of faction they had nevertheless in due time to\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\nAs the Coercion Bill coming from the Lords appeared on the paper of\r\nthe day in the form of a notice of motion, the Secretary of State,\r\nthis being a day on which orders have precedence, had to move that such\r\norders of the day should be postponed, so that he might proceed with\r\nthe motion on the state of Ireland, of which notice had been given. The\r\nstrict rule of the House is, that on Mondays and Fridays, orders of\r\nthe day should have precedence of notices of motion, so that it was\r\nimpossible for the Secretary of State to make his motion, that a certain\r\nbill (the Protection of Life--Ireland--Bill) should be read a first time\r\nwithout permission of the House, a permission always granted as a matter\r\nof course on such nights to the government, since the business which can\r\nbe brought forward, whether in the shape of orders or motions, is\r\npurely government business, and thus the interests and privilege of no\r\nindependent member of Parliament can be affected by a relaxation of\r\nthe rules which the convenience of a ministry and the conduct of public\r\nbusiness occasionally require. However, on this night, no sooner had\r\nthe Secretary of State made, in a few formal words, this formal request,\r\nthan up sprang Sir William Somerville to move an amendment, that the\r\norders of the day should not be postponed, which he supported in a\r\nspirited address, mainly on the ground of the great inconvenience that\r\nmust be suffered from the postponement of the Corn Bill. The motion of\r\nthe Secretary of State would produce a long, exciting, and exasperating\r\ndebate. Time would be lost--for what? To advance one stage of a measure\r\nwhich it was avowedly not the intention of the government to press at\r\nthe present moment. Sir William concluded with a very earnest appeal\r\nto Lord George Bentinck and his friends, who might at no very distant\r\nperiod have the government of Ireland entrusted to them, not, for the\r\nsake of a momentary postponement of the Corn Bill, to place themselves,\r\nby voting for this measure of coercion, in collision with the Irish\r\nnation.’ He called upon Lord George Bentinck to weigh the position in\r\nwhich he was placed.\r\n\r\nThis amendment was seconded by Mr. Smith O’Brien, the member for the\r\ncounty of Limerick, who warned the government that they ‘were entering\r\non a contest which would continue for months.’ He taunted the minister\r\nwith governing the country without a party. What chance was there of\r\nreconciliation with his estranged friends? After the treatment of that\r\n‘disavowed plenipotentiary,’ the Secretary of the Treasury, who would be\r\nagain found willing to undertake the mission of patching up a truce?\r\nHe was not present when the terms of the treaty were exposed: but he\r\nunderstood, that if the government introduced this Coercion Bill before\r\nEaster, then that Lord George Bentinck would deem it wise, proper, and\r\nexpedient; but if after Easter, then the complexion and character of the\r\nbill were, in the noble lord’s judgment, utterly transformed, and it was\r\ndeclared to be quite untenable and unconstitutional. Was that the kind\r\nof support on which the government calculated for passing this measure?\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State made a dexterous, conciliatory, almost humble\r\naddress, in reply to the taunts of Mr. Smith O’Brien. He said that he\r\nwas well aware of the fact of which he had been just reminded, that, in\r\nthe present state of parties, the declared adherents of the government\r\nwere a small minority; he even, while excusing the delay in the progress\r\nof the Irish measure, reminded the House of the curious fact, that since\r\nthe meeting of Parliament, two successive Irish secretaries had lost\r\ntheir seats in the House of Commons in consequence of supporting the\r\nadministration of which they were members.\r\n\r\nThe case of the government was really so good and clear, that for a\r\nmoment it seemed the opposition could hardly persist in their unusual\r\nproceeding: but this was a night of misfortunes.\r\n\r\nThere had been for some time a smouldering feud between the secretary\r\nand the Recorder of Dublin. The learned gentleman had seized the\r\noccasion which the present state of parties afforded, and in the\r\ncourse of the recent debate on the second reading of the Corn Bill, had\r\ndeclared that the asserted famine in Ireland was, on the part of the\r\ngovernment, ‘a great exaggeration.’ The secretary had addressed himself\r\nparticularly to this observation in his speech on the 27th, the night\r\nof the division, and had noticed it in a tone of acerbity. He had even\r\nintimated that it might have been used by one who was a disappointed\r\nsolicitor for high office, and whom the government had declined to\r\nassist in an unwarrantable arrangement of the duties and salary of\r\nthe judicial post he at present occupied. The learned Recorder, justly\r\nindignant at this depreciating innuendo, resolved to make an opportunity\r\non the following Monday for his vindication and retort. He rose,\r\ntherefore, immediately after the skilful and winning appeal of the\r\nsecretary, and pronounced an invective against the right honourable\r\ngentleman which was neither ill-conceived nor ill-delivered. It\r\nrevived the passions that for a moment seemed inclined to lull, and\r\nthe Protectionists, who on this occasion were going to support the\r\ngovernment, forgot the common point of union, while the secretary was\r\ndescribed as ‘the evil genius of the cabinet.’\r\n\r\nAfter this, it was impossible to arrest the course of debate. Mr.\r\nO’Connell, who appeared to be in a state of great debility, made one\r\nof those acute points for which he was distinguished. He said the\r\ngovernment complained of the threat held out by those who opposed the\r\nbill, that they would avail themselves of the forms of the House to\r\ngive it every opposition in their power. But what did the government do\r\nthemselves? Why, they were trying to trample upon one of the sessional\r\norders and to abrogate the forms of the House in order to coerce the\r\nIrish people. Lord George Bentinck said, that ‘the chief minister had\r\ntold them, that this was a bill to put down murder and assassination; in\r\nthat case, if this bill were delayed, the blood of every man murdered\r\nin Ireland was on the head of her Majesty’s ministers.’ Sir George Grey\r\nfollowed, and avoiding any discussion of the state of Ireland, in\r\nwhich Lord George had entered, supported the amendment of Sir William\r\nSomerville, on the broad ground that the bill for the repeal of the corn\r\nlaws ought not to be for a moment delayed. ‘The debates on that\r\nmeasure had continued several weeks; and all who had any lengthened\r\nparliamentary experience must be convinced, that if the further progress\r\nof the Corn Bill was postponed until after Easter, they would have much\r\nlonger and protracted debates in its future stages, than if the bill\r\nwere pushed _de die in diem_. As he had understood, the government had\r\nintended that this bill should have gone up to the House of Lords before\r\nEaster, when it would have been printed, and the second reading could\r\nhave taken place at an early day after the holidays; but if it were put\r\noff until after Easter, he would defy any man to show any reasonable\r\nexpectation of its getting to a second reading in the other House before\r\nJune, or July, or even August.’ This was encouraging, and the plot\r\nseemed to thicken. The Secretary at War was put up by the government to\r\nneutralize the effect of the speech of Sir George Grey, and he said, ‘I\r\nspeak not only as a cabinet minister, but also as a considerable\r\nIrish proprietor.’ He said, ‘that anything so horrible as the state of\r\ndemoralization and crime in which many parts of Ireland were plunged,\r\nanything so perfect as the suspension of the law in those parts of the\r\ncountry, anything, in short, so complete as the abrogation of liberty\r\nthat obtained there, was, perhaps never known.’ He thought that, ‘no man\r\nand no minister could, under these circumstances, decline to admit that\r\nevery and any measure ought to be postponed until a division had been\r\ntaken, at least upon the principle of a measure which had for its object\r\nthe suppression of these horrors.’ After such a declaration it was clear\r\nthe government were in a false position when by the same organ it had to\r\nstate, ‘that in asking to read this bill to-night, they only intended to\r\npostpone the Corn Bill for one night.’\r\n\r\nLord John Russell following, admitted, that ‘in voting for the motion of\r\nSir William Somerville it was not to be supposed, that if the Secretary\r\nof State made out a case, he would not support the government bill;’\r\nyet how the secretary was ever to find an opportunity of making out his\r\ncase, if the amendment of Sir William Somerville was carried, was\r\nnot very apparent. Sir Robert Peel, who was disquieted by the whole\r\nproceedings connected with the Coercion Bill, irritated by the episode\r\nof ‘the disavowed plenipotentiary,’ from which he did not for some\r\ntime recover, and really alarmed at the indefinite prospect of delay in\r\npassing his all-important measures which now began to open, could not\r\nconceal his vexation in the remarks which he offered, and speaking of\r\nthe amendment as one ‘of a frivolous character,’ indignant cries of ‘No,\r\nno,’ from his usual admirers, obliged him to withdraw the expression.\r\nHis feelings were not soothed when, later in the evening, even Mr.\r\nCobden rose to deplore the conduct of that minister whom he otherwise so\r\nmuch admired. ‘He certainly regarded it as a great calamity. Something\r\nhad actuated the government which he could not understand. He had a\r\nperfect belief in the sincerity of the prime minister, but in all human\r\nprobability the Corn Bill would not now enter the House of Lords before\r\nthe beginning or middle of May; and when it would come out again, heaven\r\nonly knew!’\r\n\r\nThe House now divided, and being supported by all the Protectionists\r\npresent, the government had a majority of thirty-nine, so the standing\r\norder was for that night rescinded; and, although the hour was late for\r\nsuch a statement, the secretary proceeded with the official exposition.\r\nNotwithstanding the depressing circumstances of the previous debate,\r\nthe speech of Sir James Graham was distinguished by all that lucid\r\narrangement of details and that comprehensive management of his subject\r\nwhich distinguished him. The statement made a great impression upon the\r\nHouse and the country; but, unfortunately for the government, the more\r\nnecessary they made the measure appear, the more unjustifiable was their\r\nconduct in not immediately and vehemently pursuing it. They had, indeed,\r\nin the speech from the throne at the commencement of this memorable\r\nsession, taken up a false position for their campaign; and we shall see,\r\nas we pursue this narrative of these interesting events, that the fall\r\nof Sir Robert Peel was perhaps occasioned not so much by his repeal\r\nof the corn laws as by the mistake in tactics which this adroit and\r\nexperienced parliamentary commander so strangely committed.\r\n\r\nOn this night of the 30th the government made no advance; immediately\r\nafter the secretary had finished, the followers of Mr. O’Connell moved\r\nthe adjournment of the House, and persisted in this line notwithstanding\r\nthe almost querulous appeal of the first minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     _The Passing of O’Connell._\r\n\r\nLORD GEORGE wrote the next morning (Tuesday, March 31st) to a friend,\r\nwho had not been able to attend the debate: ‘I look upon last night as\r\nthe most awkward night the government have had yet; I believe they would\r\nhave given their ears to have been beaten. We have now fairly set\r\nthem and the tail at loggerheads, and I cannot see how they are to get\r\nanother stage of either the tariff or Corn Bill before next Tuesday at\r\nany rate. I doubt if they will do anything before Easter.’\r\n\r\nIt was understood that the House would adjourn for the Easter recess\r\non the 8th instant. There were therefore only two nights remaining for\r\ngovernment business before the holidays. On the first of these (Friday,\r\nApril the 3rd), Mr. O’Connell had announced that he should state his\r\nviews at length on the condition of Ireland, and the causes of these\r\nagrarian outrages. Accordingly, when the order of the day for resuming\r\nthe adjourned debate was read, he rose at once to propose an amendment\r\nto the motion. He sat in an unusual place--in that generally occupied by\r\nthe leader of the opposition--and spoke from the red box, convenient\r\nto him from the number of documents to which he had to refer. His\r\nappearance was of great debility, and the tones of his voice were very\r\nstill. His words, indeed, only reached those who were immediately around\r\nhim and the ministers sitting on the other side of the green table, who\r\nlistened with that interest and respectful attention which became the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange and touching spectacle to those who remembered the\r\nform of colossal energy and the clear and thrilling tones that had once\r\nstartled, disturbed, and controlled senates. Mr. O’Connell was on his\r\nlegs for nearly two hours, assisted occasionally in the management of\r\nhis documents by some devoted aide-de-camp. To the House generally it\r\nwas a performance in dumb show, a feeble old man muttering before a\r\ntable; but respect for the great parliamentary personage kept all as\r\norderly as if the fortunes of a party hung upon his rhetoric; and though\r\nnot an accent reached the gallery, means were taken that next morning\r\nthe country should not lose the last and not the least interesting of\r\nthe speeches of one who had so long occupied and agitated the mind of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable address was an abnegation of the whole policy of Mr.\r\nO’Connell’s career. It proved, by a mass of authentic evidence ranging\r\nover a long term of years, that Irish outrage was the consequence of\r\nphysical misery, and that the social evils of that country could not be\r\nsuccessfully encountered by political remedies. To complete the picture,\r\nit concluded with a panegyric of Ulster and a patriotic quotation from\r\nLord Clare.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell, who, as an experienced parliamentary leader, had\r\nalready made more than one effort to extricate the Whigs from the\r\nconsequences of the hearty support given to the government measures in\r\nthe other House by Lords Lansdowne and Clanricarde, and even by Lord\r\nGrey, ventured to-night even to say that if he should agree that the\r\nHouse would do well to assent to the first reading of this bill, he\r\nthought he was bound to state also that in the future stages of it, he\r\nshould have ‘objections to offer, going to the foundations of some of\r\nits principal provisions.’\r\n\r\nHis speech was curious, as perhaps the last considerable manifesto of\r\nWhig delusion respecting Ireland. Coercion Bills might be occasionally\r\nnecessary; no doubt of it; Lord Grey had once a Coercion Bill, and Lord\r\nJohn Russell had voted for it; but then remedial measures ought to be\r\nintroduced with coercive ones: the evil should be repressed, but also\r\ncured. Thus, Lord Althorp, when the government introduced their great\r\nCoercion Bill, introduced also a measure which, besides making a great\r\nreform in the Protestant Church of Ireland, exempted the whole Catholic\r\ncommunity of Ireland from the payment of church cess, which had\r\npreviously been felt as a very great grievance. On another day Lord\r\nAlthorp declared his intention of pressing through Parliament a Jury\r\nBill, which had been brought into the House the previous session, but\r\nwhich was allowed to drop in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nAgain, there was another declaration which Lord Althorp had made, which,\r\nsomehow or other, seemed to have been forgotten; it was a declaration\r\nwith respect to the municipal corporations of Ireland. Lord Althorp said\r\nit was exceedingly desirable that the institutions of the two countries\r\nshould be assimilated as much as possible; and that, as a general rule,\r\nthe corporate bodies of Ireland should be the same as England. Mr.\r\nO’Connell had said on that occasion that there was no greater grievance\r\nin Ireland than the existence of corporations in their then shape. Lord\r\nJohn contrasted this language of Lord Althorp, ‘simple, plain, emphatic,\r\nand decided,’ with the language of the government of Sir Robert Peel;\r\nand held up to admiration the Whig policy of 1833, certainly coercive,\r\nbut with remedial measures--a measure for the abolition of church cess,\r\nintroduced ten days before the Coercion Bill, and a promise of municipal\r\nreform made simultaneously with the proclamation of martial law. This\r\nwas real statesmanship and touching the root of the evil. Whereas\r\n‘Sir Robert Peel had only consented to passing the Municipal Bill in a\r\ncrippled state, and only now (in 1846) promised, that the corporations\r\nof Ireland should be placed on the same footing as the corporations of\r\nEngland.’ Who could be surprised that such a policy-should end in famine\r\nand pestilence?\r\n\r\nThe followers of Mr. O’Connell again succeeded in adjourning the debate\r\nuntil Monday the 6th. On that day Sir Robert Peel made ‘an earnest\r\nappeal’ to extricate himself from the almost perilous position in which\r\nhe found his administration suddenly involved. In case the division on\r\nthe first reading of the Irish Bill should not take place that night, he\r\nendeavoured to prevail on those members who had notices on the paper\r\nfor the following night (Tuesday the 7th), the last night before the\r\nholidays, to relinquish their right and to permit the Irish debate\r\nto proceed and conclude. ‘He had no wish to interfere with the due\r\ndiscussion of the measure; but he believed that the Irish members, if\r\nthey permitted the House to proceed with the Corn Bill, by concluding\r\nthe discussion on the Irish Bill, would be rendering an essential\r\nservice to their country.’\r\n\r\nBut this earnest appeal only influenced still more the fiery resolves\r\nof Mr. Smith O’Brien and his friends. They threw the responsibility for\r\ndelay of the Corn Bill on the government. The inconvenience which\r\nthe country suffered was occasioned by the minister, not by the Irish\r\nmembers. He ought, on Friday last, to have adjourned the discussion on\r\nthe Coercion Bill until after Easter. He and other members who were\r\non the paper for to-morrow would willingly relinquish their right of\r\npriority in favour of the Corn Bill, or of any measure of a remedial\r\nkind, but not in favour of a Coercion Bill. He did not wish to have any\r\nconcealment with the minister as to the course which the Irish members\r\nwould pursue. It was their bounden duty to take care that _pari passu_\r\nwith the discussion of the Coercion Bill there should be discussions\r\nas to the misgovernment of Ireland; and that, in the absence of any\r\nremedial measures of the government, they should have an opportunity of\r\nsuggesting such as they thought advisable for removing those evils which\r\nthey utterly denied that the measure now before the House would remove.\r\n\r\nIn vain Sir Robert, in his blandest tones and with that remarkable\r\ncommand of a temper not naturally serene which distinguished him,\r\nacknowledged to a certain degree the propriety of the course intimated\r\nby Mr. Smith O’Brien; but suggested at the same time that it was\r\ncompatible with allowing the Irish bill to be now read for a first time,\r\nsince on its subsequent stages Mr. O’Brien and his friends would have\r\nthe full opportunity which they desired, of laying before the House the\r\nwhole condition of the country. All was useless. No less a personage\r\nthan Mr. John O’Connell treated the appeal with contempt, and lectured\r\nthe first minister on the ‘great mistake’ which he had made. Little\r\ntraits like these revealed the true parliamentary position of the once\r\nomnipotent leader of the great Conservative party. With the legions\r\nof the Protectionists watching their prey in grim silence, while\r\nthe liberal sections were united in hostile manouvres against the\r\ngovernment, it was recognised at once that the great minister had a\r\nstaff without an army; not a reconnoitring could take place without the\r\nwhole cabinet being under orders, and scarcely a sharpshooter sallied\r\nfrom the opposite ranks without the prime minister returning his fire in\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel mournfully observed that he ‘did not wish to provoke\r\na recriminatory discussion,’ and he resigned himself to his fate.\r\nImmediately the third night of the adjourned debate on the Irish bill\r\ncommenced, and was sustained principally by the Irish members until a\r\nlate hour. It had not been the intention of Lord George Bentinck to have\r\nspoken on this occasion, though he had never been absent for a moment\r\nfrom his seat, and watched all that occurred with that keen relish which\r\nwas usual with him when he thought things were going right; but having\r\nbeen personally and not very courteously appealed to by the late Mr.\r\nDillon Browne, and deeming also the occasion, just before the holidays,\r\na not unhappy one, he rose and concluded the debate. His speech was not\r\nlong, it was not prepared, and it was very animated.\r\n\r\nRecapitulating himself the main features of the disturbed district, he\r\nsaid: ‘It is because of these things, sir, that I am prepared to support\r\nat least the first reading of a bill, which I freely admit to be most\r\nunconstitutional in itself.’\r\n\r\nNoticing a speech made in the course of the evening by Lord Morpeth,\r\nwho had himself once been chief secretary of the Lord Lieutenant,\r\nLord George thought it discreet to remind the House of the unequivocal\r\nsupport given to this bill by the Whig leaders in another place: ‘Sir, I\r\nthink when we see all the great leaders of the Whig party supporting the\r\nmeasure elsewhere, we cannot be justly impugned for doing as they do.’\r\nLord Morpeth had referred to ‘remedial measures which he thinks\r\nshould be introduced for Ireland: to measures for the extension of the\r\nmunicipal, and also of the parliamentary, franchise of that country; and\r\nhe expressed his desire to see those franchises put on the same footing\r\nas the franchises of England.’ ‘For the life of me,’ exclaimed Lord\r\nGeorge, ‘I confess, I cannot see in what way the extension of political\r\nfranchises of any description in Ireland would afford a remedy for\r\nthe evils which this measure aims to suppress. I think, sir, it is\r\nimpossible not to perceive that there is a connection between agrarian\r\noutrage and the poverty of the people.’\r\n\r\nAfter noticing the inadequate poor-law which then existed in Ireland,\r\nhe added: ‘There is also another point immediately connected with\r\nthis subject to which I must refer. I allude, sir, to the system of\r\nabsenteeism. I cannot disguise from myself the conviction, that many\r\nof the evils of Ireland arise from the system of receiving rents by\r\nabsentee landlords who spend them in other countries. I am well aware\r\nthat, in holding this doctrine, I am not subscribing to the creed of\r\npolitical economists. I am well aware that Messrs. Senior and M’Culloch\r\nhold that it makes no difference whether the Irish landlord spends his\r\nrents in Dublin, on his Irish estates, in London, in Bath, or elsewhere.\r\nI profess, sir, I cannot understand that theory. I believe that the\r\nfirst ingredient in the happiness of a people is, that the gentry should\r\nreside on their native soil, and spend their rents among those from whom\r\nthey receive them. I cannot help expressing a wish that some arrangement\r\nmay be made connected with the levying of the poor-rate in Ireland, by\r\nwhich absentee landlords may be made to contribute in something like a\r\nfair proportion to the wants of the poor in the district in which they\r\nought to reside. There is an arrangement in the hop-growing districts in\r\nEngland in respect to tithe, which might, I think, afford a very useful\r\nsuggestion. There are two tithes: the one, the ordinary tithe; the\r\nother, extraordinary; which is levied only so long as the land is\r\ncultivated in hops. I think if there were two poor-rates introduced into\r\nIreland, the one applying to all occupiers of land, and the other to all\r\nthose who did not spend a certain portion of the year on some portion of\r\ntheir estates in Ireland, it would prove useful. I think, that by thus\r\nappealing to their interests, it might induce absentee landlords to\r\nreside much more in Ireland, than is now unfortunately the case.\r\n\r\n‘But, sir, I think there are other remedial measures. Some days ago, the\r\nSecretary of State told the member for Stroud (Mr. Poulett Scrope),\r\nwhen he suggested some such measure, that he was treading on dangerous\r\nground, and that the doctrines he was advocating might be written in\r\nletters of blood in Ireland; but, notwithstanding all this, I still say\r\nthat I think measures might be introduced for improving the relations\r\nbetween landlord and tenant in Ireland. I do not think that some\r\nguarantee might and ought to be given to the tenantry of Ireland for the\r\nimprovements they make upon their farms.\r\n\r\n‘Sir, the Secretary of State, in introducing this measure, maintained\r\na doctrine which, I think, much more likely to be written in letters of\r\nblood, for he bound up the question of the corn laws with the present\r\none. He said, that unless he could, have prevailed on his colleagues\r\nto accede to his free-trade measures as regards corn, he would not have\r\nintroduced this bill. Why, sir, far from giving food to the people of\r\nIreland, in my opinion the measures of her Majesty’s ministers will take\r\naway from the people of Ireland their food, by destroying the profits\r\nof their only manufacture--the manufacture of corn--and injuring their\r\nagriculture; depriving them of employment; in fact, by taking away from\r\nthem the very means of procuring subsistence. Sir, I cannot see how the\r\nrepeal of those laws affecting corn can be In any way connected with the\r\nsuppression of outrage and the protection of life. What is this but to\r\nsay, that unless we have a free trade in corn, we must be prepared to\r\nconcede a free trade in agrarian outrage--a free trade in maiming and\r\nhoughing cattle--a free trade in incendiarism--a free trade in the\r\nburning and sacking of houses--a free trade in midnight murder, and in\r\nnoon-day assassination? What is this but telling the people of\r\nIreland, that assassination, murder, incendiarism, are of such light\r\nconsideration in the eyes of the Secretary of State, that their sanction\r\nor suppression by the minister of the crown hinges upon the condition of\r\nthe corn market and the difference in the price of potatoes?\r\n\r\n‘Sir, what has the potato disease to do with the outrages in Ireland?\r\nSome think a great deal. I have taken the trouble of looking into\r\nthe matter. I have examined into the state of crime in at least five\r\ncounties--Tipperary, Roscommon, Limerick, Leitrim, and Clare--and I\r\nfind, that during the three months prior to the first appearance of\r\nthe potato disease, and when in fact food was as cheap in Ireland as at\r\nalmost any former period--when plenty abounded in all quarters of the\r\nempire, that the amount of crime exceeded that in the three months\r\nimmediately following. Now, those who doubt this statement will have an\r\nopportunity of ascertaining the correctness of my figures, for I will\r\nnot deal in general assertions. Well then, sir, I find in the three\r\nmonths, May, June, and July last, that the number of crimes committed in\r\nthe five counties I have mentioned amounted to no less than 1,180, while\r\nin the three months immediately after the potato disease, or famine as\r\nit is called, the amount of crime committed in the same three months was\r\nnot 1,180, but 870. I should like to know, therefore, what this agrarian\r\noutrage has to do with the potato famine; and where is the justification\r\nfor a minister coming down to this House, and declaring that unless we\r\npass a free-trade measure, we are not to obey her Majesty’s commands\r\nby passing a measure for the protection of life in Ireland. Why, sir, I\r\nthink when this language reaches the people of Ireland--coming, too, as\r\nit does from the Treasury, above all, from the Secretary of State for\r\nthe Home Department--there is indeed danger to be apprehended that such\r\na doctrine may be written in letters of blood in that country. Why, sir,\r\nif we are to hear such language as this from that minister of the crown\r\ncharged with the peace of the country, we may just as well have Captain\r\nRock established as lord lieutenant in the castle of Dublin, a Whitefoot\r\nfor chief secretary, and Molly M’Guire installed at Whitehall with the\r\nseals of the home department.’\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards he remarked, ‘I have been taunted that when I may be\r\nentrusted with the government of Ireland, I should perhaps then learn\r\nthat Tyrone was an Orange county. Sir, in answer to that taunt, I must\r\ntake leave to ask what expression of mine, either in this house or out\r\nof it, justifies any such remark? When or where can it be said that I\r\nhave ever permitted myself to know any distinction between an Orangeman\r\nand a Catholic; when, in the whole course of my parliamentary career,\r\nhave I ever given a vote or uttered a sentiment hostile or unfriendly to\r\nthe Roman Catholics, either of England or Ireland?’ This speech, though\r\ndelivered generally in favour of the Irish bill, attracted very much\r\nthe attention, and, as it appeared afterwards, the approbation of those\r\nIrish members, who, although sitting on the Liberal benches, did not\r\nacknowledge the infallible authority of Mr. O’Connell, and was the\r\norigin of a political connection between them and Lord George Bentinck,\r\nwhich, on more than one subsequent occasion, promised to bring important\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nTwo successive motions were now made for the adjournment of the debate,\r\nand Sir Robert Peel at length said, that he ‘saw it was useless to\r\npersist.’ He agreed to the adjournment until the next day, with the\r\nunderstanding that if it did come on, he would name the time to which it\r\nshould be postponed after the holidays.\r\n\r\nUpon this, Sir William Somerville made one more appeal to the minister\r\nto postpone the further discussion of the Irish bill altogether until\r\nthe Corn Bill had passed the Commons. He intimated that unless the\r\ngovernment at once adopted this resolution, they would find themselves\r\nafter Easter in the same perplexity which now paralyzed them. They would\r\nnot be permitted to bring on this measure except upon government nights,\r\nand the discussion might then last weeks.\r\n\r\nThe minister, exceedingly embarrassed, would not, however, relent. On\r\nthe following day, when he moved the adjournment of the House for the\r\nholidays, he reduced the vacation three days, in order to obtain Friday,\r\na government night, which otherwise would have been absorbed in the\r\nholidays, and he announced the determination of the government again\r\nto proceed on that night with the Irish bill in preference to the Corn\r\nBill. The Irish members glanced defiance, and the Protectionists could\r\nscarcely conceal their satisfaction. The reputation of Sir Robert\r\nPeel for parliamentary management seemed to be vanishing; never was a\r\ngovernment in a more tottering state; and the Whigs especially began to\r\nrenew their laments that the Edinburgh letter and its consequences had\r\nprevented the settlement of the corn question from devolving to the\r\nnatural arbitrator in the great controversy, their somewhat rash but\r\nstill unrivalled leader, Lord John Russell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     _A Third Party_\r\n\r\nTHE members of the Protectionist opposition returned to their\r\nconstituents with the sanguine feelings which success naturally\r\ninspires. Their efforts had surprised, not displeased, the country;\r\nthe elections were in their favour; the government business halted; the\r\ndelay in the calculated arrival of the famine had taken the edge off the\r\nnecessity which it was supposed would have already carried the Corn Bill\r\nthrough the Commons; while the twin measure which the throes of Ireland\r\nhad engendered had developed elements of opposition which even the\r\ncalmest observer thought might possibly end in overthrow. Above all,\r\nthat seemed to have happened which the most experienced in parliamentary\r\nlife had always deemed to be impracticable; namely, the formation of a\r\nthird party in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nHow completely this latter and difficult result was owing to the\r\nabilities and energies of one man, and how anomalous was the position\r\nwhich he chose to occupy in not taking the formal lead of a party which\r\nwas entirely guided by his example, were convictions and considerations\r\nthat at this juncture much occupied men’s minds. And it was resolved\r\namong the most considerable of the country gentlemen to make some\r\nearnest and well-combined effort, during the recess, to induce Lord\r\nGeorge Bentinck to waive the unwillingness he had so often expressed of\r\nbecoming their avowed and responsible leader.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord George Bentinck first threw himself into the breach, he was\r\ninfluenced only by a feeling of indignation at the manner in which he\r\nthought the Conservative party had been trifled with by the government\r\nand Lord Stanley, his personal friend and political leader, deserted by\r\na majority of the cabinet. As affairs developed, and it became evident\r\nthat the bulk of the Conservative party throughout the country had\r\nrallied round his standard, Lord George could not conceal from himself\r\nthe consequences of such an event, or believe that it was possible\r\nthat the party in the House of Commons, although Lord Stanley might\r\neventually think fit to guide it by his counsels, and become, if\r\nnecessary, personally responsible for its policy, could be long held\r\ntogether unless it were conducted by a leader present in the same\r\nassembly, and competent under all circumstances to represent its\r\nopinions in debate. Lord George, although a very proud man, had no\r\nvanity or self-conceit. He took a very humble view of his own powers,\r\nand he had at the same time a very exalted one of those necessary to a\r\nleader of the House of Commons. His illustrious connection, Mr. Canning,\r\nwas his standard. He had been the private secretary of that minister\r\nin his youth, and the dazzling qualities of that eminent personage\r\nhad influenced the most susceptible time of life of one who was very\r\ntenacious of his impressions. What Lord George Bentinck appreciated\r\nmost in a parliamentary speaker was brilliancy: quickness of perception,\r\npromptness of repartee, clear and concise argument, a fresh and\r\nfelicitous quotation, wit and picture, and, if necessary, a passionate\r\nappeal that should never pass the line of high-bred sentiment. Believing\r\nhimself not to be distinguished by these rhetorical qualities, he would\r\nlisten with no complacency to those who would urge in private that the\r\npresent period of parliamentary life was different from the days of Mr.\r\nCanning, and that accumulated facts and well-digested reasoning on their\r\nbearing, a command of all the materials of commercial controversy, and\r\na mastery of the laws that regulate the production and distribution of\r\npublic wealth, combined with habits of great diligence and application,\r\nwould ensure the attention of a popular assembly, especially when united\r\nto a high character and great social position. This might be urged;\r\nbut he would only shake his head, with a ray of humour twinkling in his\r\npiercing eyes, and say, in a half-drawling tone, ‘If Mr. Canning were\r\nalive, he could do all this better than any of them, and be not a whit\r\nless brilliant.’\r\n\r\nThere was also another reason why Lord George Bentinck was unwilling to\r\nassume the post of leader of the Conservative party, and this very much\r\ninfluenced him. Sprung from a great Whig house, and inheriting all the\r\nprinciples and prejudices of that renowned political connection which\r\nhad expelled the Stuarts, he had accepted, in an unqualified sense, the\r\ndogma of religious liberty. This principle was first introduced into\r\nactive politics in order to preserve the possessions of that portion\r\nof the aristocracy which had established itself on the plunder of\r\nthe Church. It was to form the basis of a party which should prevent\r\nreaction and restitution of church lands. Whether the principle be a\r\ntrue one, and whether its unqualified application by any party in the\r\nstate be possible, are questions yet unsettled. It is not probable, for\r\nexample, that the worship of Juggernaut, which Lord Dalhousie permits\r\nin Orissa, would be permitted even by Lord John Russell at Westminster.\r\nEven a papist procession is forbidden, and wisely. The application of\r\nthe principle, however, in Lord George Bentinck’s mind, was among other\r\nthings associated with the public recognition of the Roman Catholic\r\nhierarchy by the state, and a provision for its maintenance in Ireland\r\nin accordance with the plan of Mr. Pitt. What had happened, with respect\r\nto the vote on the endowment of Maynooth in 1845, had convinced him that\r\nhis opinions on this subject presented an insuperable barrier to his\r\never becoming the leader of a party which had contributed three-fourths\r\nof the memorable minority on that occasion. It was in vain that it\r\nwas impressed upon him by those most renowned for their Protestant\r\nprinciples, and who were at the same time most anxious to see Lord\r\nGeorge Bentinck in his right position, that the question of Maynooth was\r\nsettled, and there was now no prospect of future measures of a similar\r\ncharacter. This was not the opinion of Lord George Bentinck. He nursed\r\nin his secret soul a great scheme for the regeneration and settlement\r\nof Ireland, which he thought ought to be one of the mainstays of a\r\nConservative party; and it was his opinion that the condition of the\r\nRoman Catholic priesthood must be considered.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain, in order to assist in removing these scruples, that it\r\nwas represented to him by others that endowment of a priesthood by the\r\nstate was a notion somewhat old-fashioned, and opposed to the spirit\r\nof the age which associated true religious freedom with the full\r\ndevelopment of the voluntary principle. He listened to these suggestions\r\nwith distrust, and even with a little contempt. Mr. Canning had been in\r\nfavour of the endowment of the Irish priesthood--that was sufficient for\r\nthat particular; and as for the voluntary principle, he looked upon it\r\nas priestcraft in disguise; his idea of religious liberty being that all\r\nreligions should be controlled by the state.\r\n\r\nBesides these two prominent objections to accepting the offered post,\r\nnamely, his unaffected distrust in his parliamentary abilities and his\r\nassumed want of concordance with his followers on a great principle\r\nof modern politics, we must also remember that his compliance with\r\nthe request involved no ordinary sacrifice of much which renders life\r\ndelightful. He was to relinquish pursuits of noble excitement to which\r\nhe was passionately attached, and to withdraw in a great degree from\r\na circle of high-spirited friends, many of them of different political\r\nconnection from himself, by whom he was adored. With all his unrivalled\r\npowers of application when under the influence of a great impulse, he\r\nwas constitutionally indolent and even lethargic. There was nothing,\r\ntherefore, in his position or his temperature to prick him on in ‘46;\r\nit was nothing but his strong will acting upon his indignation which\r\nsustained him. It is not, therefore, marvellous that he exhibited great\r\nreluctance to commit irretrievably his future life. At a subsequent\r\nperiod, indignation had become ambition, and circumstances of various\r\nkinds had made him resolve to succeed or die.\r\n\r\nOn the adjournment, Lord George had gone down to Newmarket, which he\r\ngreatly enjoyed after his exhausting campaign. Here some letters on the\r\nsubject of the leadership passed, but nothing was definitely arranged\r\ntill some time after the re-assembling of Parliament. For convenience\r\nwe mention here the result. The wish of the party was repeatedly\r\nand personally urged by the popular and much-esteemed member for\r\nDorsetshire, and at last Lord George consented to their wishes, on these\r\nconditions: that he should relinquish his post the moment the right man\r\nwas discovered, who, according to his theory, would ultimately turn up;\r\nand secondly, that his responsible post was not to restrict or embarrass\r\nhim on any questions in which a religious principle was involved.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, this negotiation was concluded, and while yet at\r\nNewmarket, he wrote to a friend, the day before the House met (April\r\n16th).\r\n\r\n‘I think there is no doubt, but that the Irish will take care of Friday\r\n(to-morrow) night. I have not much hope of their keeping up the debate\r\nbeyond Friday.\r\n\r\n‘It is quite clear from O’Connell’s language at Dublin that we have no\r\nhope from the Irish tail.\r\n\r\n‘I still think myself, that delay affords a great chance of something\r\nturning up in our favour; already the rejection of any reciprocity by\r\nM. Guizot has provided us with a grand weapon, which, I trust, you drive\r\nwell home into * * * * ’s vitals; a very short delay would probably\r\nbring over similar intelligence from the United States and their Congress.\r\nI trust we shall have an important deputation over from Canada,\r\nrepresenting that the inevitable results of these free-trade measures\r\nin corn and timber will be to alienate the feelings of our Canadian\r\ncolonists, and to induce them to follow their sordid interests, which\r\nwill now, undoubtedly, be best consulted and most promoted by annexation\r\nto the United States.\r\n\r\n‘Lord------‘s intended tergiversation has been, I believe, some time\r\nknown; he admits that all farmers without capital, in short, all little\r\nmen, must be sacrificed. What a barbarous and odious policy, that\r\ngoes upon the principle that none but capitalists are henceforth to\r\nbe allowed to live, as farmers at least. We must turn the tables upon\r\nLord------and all such heartless doctrinaires!\r\n\r\n‘I fear the majority in the Lords will be greater than was expected;\r\nI am told that we must endeavour to put ministers in a minority two or\r\nthree times before the bill gets to its second reading in the Lords,\r\nno matter upon what question. I hear there are many peers whose votes\r\ndepend entirely upon their notions, whether or not Peel can, by hook or\r\nby crook, carry on.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     _Railroads for Ireland_\r\n\r\nIF WE take a general view of the career of Lord George Bentinck during\r\nthe last year--from the time indeed when he was trying to find a lawyer\r\nto convey his convictions to the House of Commons until the moment when\r\nher Majesty prorogued her Parliament, the results will be found to be\r\nvery remarkable. So much was never done so unexpectedly by any public\r\nman in the same space of time. He had rallied a great party which seemed\r\nhopelessly routed; he had established a parliamentary discipline,\r\nin their ranks which old political connections, led by experienced\r\nstatesmen, have seldom surpassed; he had brought forward from those\r\nranks, entirely through his discrimination and by his personal\r\nencouragement, considerable talents in debate; he had himself proved a\r\nmaster in detail and in argument of all the great questions arising\r\nout of the reconstruction of our commercial system; he had made a\r\nvindication of the results of the Protective principle as applied to\r\nagriculture, which certainly, so far as the materials are concerned, is\r\nthe most efficient plea that ever was urged in the House of Commons\r\nin favour of the abrogated law; he had exhibited similar instances of\r\ninvestigation in considerable statements with respect to the silk trade\r\nand other branches of our industry; he had asserted the claims of the\r\nproductive classes in Ireland, and in our timber and sugar producing\r\ncolonies, with the effect which results from a thorough acquaintance\r\nwith a subject; he had promulgated distinct principles with regard to\r\nour financial as well as to our commercial system; he had maintained\r\nthe expediency cf relieving the consumer by the repeal of excise in\r\npreference to customs’ duties, and of establishing fiscal reciprocity as\r\na condition of mercantile exchange. On subjects of a more occasional\r\nbut analogous nature he had shown promptitude and knowledge, as in the\r\ninstances of the urgent condition of Mexico and of our carrying trade\r\nwith the Spanish colonies, both of which he brought forward in the last\r\nhours of the session, but the importance of which motions was recognized\r\nby all parties. Finally, he had attracted the notice, and in many\r\ninstances obtained the confidence, of large bodies of men in the\r\ncountry, who recognized in him a great capacity of labour combined with\r\nfirmness of character and honesty of purpose.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the session (August 28), Cord George visited Norfolk,\r\nwhere he received an entertainment from his constituents at King’s Lynn,\r\nproud of their member, and to whom he vindicated the course which he had\r\ntaken, and offered his views generally as to the relations which should\r\nsubsist between the legislation of the country and its industry.\r\nFrom Norfolk he repaired to Belvoir Castle, on a visit to the Duke of\r\nRutland, and was present at a banquet given by the agriculturists of\r\nLeicestershire to his friend and supporter the Marquis of Granby. After\r\nthis he returned to Welbeck, where he seems to have enjoyed a little\r\nrepose. Thus he writes to a friend from that place on the 22nd\r\nSeptember:\r\n\r\n‘Thanks for your advice, which I am following, having got Lord\r\nMalmesbury’s Diary; but I am relapsing into my natural dawdling, lazy,\r\nand somnolent habits, and can with difficulty get through the leaders\r\neven of the “Times.”\r\n\r\n* * * * ‘The vehemence of the farmers is personal against Peel; it is\r\nquite clear that the rising price of wheat has cured their alarm. The\r\nrailway expenditure must keep up prices and prosperity, both of which\r\nwould have been far greater without free trade; but in face of high\r\nprices, railway prosperity, and potato famine, depend upon it we shall\r\nhave an uphill game to fight.\r\n\r\n‘O’Connell talks of Parliament meeting in November, to mend the Irish\r\nLabour-rate Act. Do you believe this?’\r\n\r\nThe Labour-rate Act, passed at the end of the session [‘46), was one by\r\nwhich the Lord Lieutenant was enabled to require special barony\r\nsessions to meet in order to make presentments for public works for the\r\nemployment of the people, the whole of the money requisite for their\r\nconstruction to be supplied by the imperial treasury, though to\r\nbe afterwards repaid. The machinery of this act did not work\r\nsatisfactorily, but the government ultimately made the necessary\r\nalterations on their own responsibility, and obtained an indemnity from\r\nParliament when it met in ‘47. The early session, therefore, talked\r\nof by Mr. O’Connell, became unnecessary. As the only object of this\r\nLabour-rate Act was to employ the people, and as it was supposed there\r\nwere no public works of a reproductive nature which could be undertaken\r\non a sufficient scale to ensure that employment, the Irish people were\r\noccupied, towards the end of the autumn of ‘46, mainly in making roads,\r\nwhich, as afterwards described by the first minister, ‘were not wanted.’\r\nIn the month of September more than thirty thousand persons were thus\r\nemployed; but when the harvest was over, and it was ascertained that its\r\nterrible deficiency had converted pauperism into famine, the numbers\r\non the public works became greatly increased, so that at the end of\r\nNovember the amount of persons engaged was four hundred thousand,\r\nreceiving wages at the rate of nearly five millions sterling per annum.\r\nThese immense amounts went on increasing every week, and when Parliament\r\nmet in February, 1847, five hundred thousand persons were employed on\r\nthese public works, which could bring no possible public advantage, at\r\nan expense to the country of between £700,000 and £800,000 per month.\r\nNo Board of Works could efficiently superintend such a multitude, or\r\nprevent flagrant imposition, though the dimensions of that\r\ndepartment appeared almost proportionably to have expanded. What\r\nwith commissioners, chief clerks, check clerks, and pay clerks, the\r\nestablishment of the Board of Works in Ireland, at the end of ‘46,\r\nconsisted of more than eleven thousand persons.\r\n\r\nAlways intent upon Ireland, this condition of affairs early and\r\nearnestly attracted the attention of Lord George Bentinck. So vast an\r\nexpenditure in unproductive labour dismayed him. He would not\r\neasily assent to the conclusion that profitable enterprise under the\r\ncircumstances was impossible. Such a conclusion seemed to him unnatural,\r\nand that an occasion where we commenced with despair justified a bold\r\nand venturesome course. The field is legitimately open to speculation\r\nwhere all agree that all is hopeless. The construction of harbours, the\r\ndevelopment of fisheries, the redemption of waste lands, were resources\r\nwhich had been often canvassed, and whatever their recommendations, with\r\nthe exception of the last, they were necessarily very limited; and the\r\nlast, though it might afford prompt, could hardly secure profitable,\r\nemployment. Prompt and profitable employment was the object which Lord\r\nGeorge wished to accomplish. Where millions were to be expended by the\r\nstate, something more advantageous to the community should accrue than\r\nthe temporary subsistence of the multitude.\r\n\r\nLord George had always been a great supporter of railway enterprise in\r\nEngland, on the ground that, irrespective of all the peculiar advantages\r\nof those undertakings, the money was spent in the country; and that if\r\nour surplus capital were not directed to such channels, it would go, as\r\nit had gone before, to foreign mines and foreign loans, from which in a\r\ngreat degree no return would arrive. When millions were avowedly to be\r\nlaid out in useless and unprofitable undertakings, it became a question\r\nwhether it were not wiser even somewhat to anticipate the time when the\r\nnecessities of Ireland would require railways on a considerable scale;\r\nand whether by embarking in such enterprises, we might not only find\r\nprompt and profitable employment for the people, but by giving a new\r\ncharacter to the country and increasing its social relations and the\r\ncombinations of its industry, might not greatly advance the period when\r\nsuch modes of communication would be absolutely requisite.\r\n\r\nFull of these views, Lord George, in the course of the autumn, consulted\r\nin confidence some gentlemen very competent to assist him in such an\r\ninquiry, and especially Mr. Robert Stephenson, Mr. Hudson, and Mr.\r\nLaing. With their advice and at their suggestion, two engineers of\r\ngreat ability, Mr. Bidder and Mr. Smith, were despatched to Ireland,\r\npersonally to investigate the whole question of railroads in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMeditating over the condition of Ireland, a subject very frequently\r\nin his thoughts, and of the means to combat its vast and inveterate\r\npauperism, Lord George was frequently in the habit of reverting to\r\nthe years ‘41-42 in England, when there were fifteen hundred thousand\r\npersons on the parish rates; eighty-three thousand able-bodied men,\r\nactually confined within the walls of the workhouse, and more than four\r\nhundred thousand able-bodied men receiving out-door relief. What changed\r\nall this and restored England in a very brief space to a condition\r\nof affluence hardly before known in her annals? Not certainly the\r\nalterations in the tariff which were made by Sir Robert Peel at the\r\ncommencement of his government, prudent and salutary as they were. No\r\none would pretend that the abolition of the slight duty (five-sixteenths\r\nof a penny) on the raw material of the cotton manufacturer, or the free\r\nintroduction of some twenty-seven thousand head of foreign cattle,\r\nor even the admission of foreign timber at reduced duties, could have\r\neffected this. Unquestionably it was the railway enterprise which\r\nthen began to prevail that was the cause of this national renovation.\r\nSuddenly, and for several years, an additional sum of thirteen millions\r\nof pounds sterling a year was spent in the wages of our native industry;\r\ntwo hundred thousand able-bodied labourers received each upon an average\r\ntwenty-two shillings a week, stimulating the revenue both in excise and\r\ncustoms by their enormous consumption of malt and spirits, tobacco and\r\ntea. This was the main cause of the contrast between the England of ‘41\r\nand the England of ‘45.\r\n\r\nWas there any reason why a proportionate application of the same remedy\r\nto Ireland should not proportionately produce a similar result? Was\r\nthere anything wild or unauthorized in the suggestion? On the contrary:\r\nten years before (1836), the subject had engaged the attention of her\r\nMajesty’s government, and a royal commission had been issued to inquire\r\ninto the expediency of establishing railway communication in Ireland.\r\nThe commissioners, men of great eminence, recommended that a system\r\nof railways should be established in Ireland, and by the pecuniary\r\nassistance of government. They rested their recommendation mainly on the\r\nabundant evidence existing of the vast benefits which easy communication\r\nhad accomplished in Ireland, and of the complete success which had\r\nattended every Parliamentary grant for improving roads in that country.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the government, arising from the balanced state of\r\nparties, rendered it impossible at that time for them to prosecute the\r\nmeasures recommended by the royal commissioners, though they made an\r\nineffectual attempt in that direction. Could it be suspected that the\r\nrecommendation of the commissioners had been biassed by any political\r\nconsideration? Was it a Whig commission attempting to fulfil a Whig\r\nobject? Another commission, more memorable, at the head of which was the\r\nEarl of Devon, was appointed by a Tory government some years afterwards,\r\nvirtually to consider the condition of the people of Ireland, and the\r\nbest means for their amelioration. The report of the Devon commission\r\nconfirmed all the recommendations of the railway commissioners of ‘36,\r\nand pointed to these new methods of communication, by the assistance of\r\nloans from the government, as the best means of providing employment for\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Smith of Deanston was examined by a Parliamentary committee,\r\nand asked what measure of all others would be the one most calculated to\r\nimprove the agriculture and condition of Ireland, he did not reply, as\r\nsome might have anticipated, that the most efficient measure would be\r\nto drain the bogs; but his answer was, ‘advance the construction of\r\nrailways, and then agricultural improvement will speedily follow.’\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the value of railways to an agricultural population, Mr.\r\nSmith, of Deanston, said, ‘that the improvement of the land for one mile\r\nonly on each side of the railway so constructed would be so great, that\r\nit would pay the cost of the whole construction.’ He added, that there\r\nwere few districts’ in Ireland, in which railway communication could\r\nbe introduced, where the value of the country through which the railway\r\npassed would not be raised to an extent equal to the whole cost of the\r\nrailway.\r\n\r\nArguing on an area of six hundred and forty acres for every square mile,\r\nafter deducting the land occupied by fences, roads, and buildings, Mr.\r\nSmith, of Deanston, entered into a calculation of the gain deliverable\r\nfrom the mere carriage of the produce of the land, and the back carriage\r\nof manure, coals, tiles, bricks, and other materials, and estimated the\r\nsaving through those means on every square mile to more than £300, or\r\nsomething above £600 on 1,280 acres abutting each mile of railway,\r\nthis being the difference of the cost of carriage under the old mode of\r\nconveyance as compared with the new. Following up this calculation,\r\nhe showed that fifteen hundred miles of railway would improve the land\r\nthrough which it passed to the extent of nearly two million acres at the\r\nrate of a mile on each side; and, taken at twenty-five years’ purchase,\r\nwould equal twenty-four millions sterling in the permanent improvement\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\nThe ground, therefore, was sound on which Lord George cautiously, and\r\nafter due reflection, ventured to place his foot.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after the reports of these two royal commissions, what was the\r\nstate of railway enterprise in Ireland in the autumn of ‘46, when a vast\r\nmultitude could only subsist by being employed by the government, and\r\nwhen the government had avowedly no reproductive or even useful work\r\nwhereon to place them; but allotted them to operations which were\r\ndescribed by Colonel Douglas, the inspector of the government himself,\r\n‘as works which would answer no other purpose than that of obstructing\r\nthe public conveyances?’\r\n\r\nIn ‘46, acts of Parliament were in existence authorizing the\r\nconstruction of more than fifteen hundred miles of railway in Ireland,\r\nand some of these acts had passed so long as eleven years previously,\r\nyet at the end of ‘46 only one hundred and twenty-three miles of railway\r\nhad been completed, and only one hundred and sixty-four were in the\r\ncourse of completion, though arrested in their progress from want of\r\nfunds. Almost in the same period, two thousand six hundred miles of\r\nrailway had been completed in England, and acts of Parliament had passed\r\nfor constructing five thousand four hundred miles in addition: in the\r\nwhole, eight thousand miles.\r\n\r\nWhat then was the reason of this debility in Ireland in prosecuting\r\nthese undertakings? Were they really not required; were the elements\r\nof success wanting? The first element of success in railway enterprise,\r\naccording to the highest authorities, is population; property is only\r\nthe second consideration. Now, Ireland in ‘46 was more densely inhabited\r\nthan England. A want of population could not therefore be the cause.\r\nBut a population so impoverished as the Irish could not perhaps avail\r\nthemselves of the means of locomotion; and yet it appeared from research\r\nthat the rate of passengers on the two Irish railways that were open\r\ngreatly exceeded in number that of the passengers upon English and\r\nScotch railways. The average number of passengers on English and Scotch\r\nrailways was not twelve thousand per mile per annum, while on the Ulster\r\nrailway the number was nearly twenty-two thousand, and on the Dublin and\r\nDrogheda line the number exceeded eighteen thousand.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the weakness in Ireland to prosecute these undertakings\r\nwas the total want of domestic capital for the purpose, and the\r\nunwillingness of English capitalists to embark their funds in a country\r\nwhose social and political condition they viewed with distrust, however\r\npromising and even profitable the investment might otherwise appear.\r\nThis was remarkably illustrated by the instance of the Great Southern\r\nand Western Railway of Ireland, one of the undertakings of which the\r\ncompletion was arrested by want of funds, yet partially open. Compared\r\nwith a well-known railway in Great Britain, the Irish railway had cost\r\nin its construction £15,000 per mile, and the British upwards of £26,000\r\nper mile; the weekly traffic on the two railways, allowing for some\r\ndifference in their extent, was about the same on both, in amount\r\nvarying from £1,000 to £1,300 per week; yet the unfinished British\r\nrailway was at £40 premium in the market, and the incomplete Irish\r\nrailway at £2 discount. It was clear, therefore, that the commercial\r\nprinciple, omnipotent in England, was not competent to cope with the\r\npeculiar circumstances of Ireland.\r\n\r\nBrooding over the suggestions afforded by the details which we have\r\nslightly indicated, Lord George Bentinck, taking into consideration\r\nnot merely the advantage that would accrue to the country from the\r\nestablishment of a system of railroads, but also remembering the\r\npeculiar circumstances of the times, the absolute necessity of employing\r\nthe people, and the inevitable advance of public money for that purpose,\r\nframed a scheme with reference to all these considerations, and which\r\nhe believed would meet all the conditions of the case. He spared no\r\nthought, or time, or labour, for his purpose. He availed himself of the\r\nadvice of the most experienced, and prosecuted his researches ardently\r\nand thoroughly. When he had matured his scheme, he had it thrown into\r\nthe form of a parliamentary bill by the ablest hands, and then submitted\r\nthe whole to the judgment and criticism of those who shared his\r\nconfidence and counsels. Towards the end of November he was at Knowsley,\r\nfrom whence he communicated with the writer of these pages. ‘I am here\r\nhatching secret plans for the next session; and now, if you have not\r\nquite abjured politics, as you threatened for the next three months to\r\ndo, devoting yourself to poetry and romance, I think I ought to have a\r\nquiet day with you, in order that we may hold council together and talk\r\nover all our policy. I shall be at Harcourt House on the 30th. I shall\r\nstay there till the 3rd of December, for a meeting on that day of the\r\nNorfolk Estuary Company, of which I am chairman. Would that evening\r\nsuit you--or Friday--or Wednesday? I am not well acquainted with the\r\ngeography of Buckinghamshire, but presume you are accessible either by\r\nrail or road in less than twelve hours.\r\n\r\n‘The activity in the dockyard must be in preparation to interfere in\r\nPortugal, to keep King Leopold upon the Portuguese throne: it cannot be\r\nfor Mexico, for our friend the “Times” formally abandoned Mexico in his\r\nleader some days ago.\r\n\r\n‘* * * * has been entertaining Lord * * * * in Ireland, and writes: “How\r\nPeel must chuckle at the Whig difficulties.” I dare say he does, but\r\nin Ireland it seems to me Lord Besborough is putting the fate Irish\r\ngovernment to shame, whilst the rupture of the _entente cordiale_, the\r\nconquest of California and New Mexico, and the complications in the\r\nriver Plata,--are complete inheritances from Lord Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n‘Eaton has come to life again: else there was a prospect of George\r\nManners quietly succeeding him in Cambridgeshire.

(some of the states at least) on\r\ngrain.’\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to record, that in the autumn of this year, at Goodwood\r\nraces, the sporting world was astounded by hearing that Lord George\r\nBentinck had parted with his racing stud at an almost nominal price.\r\nLord George was present, as was his custom, at this meeting, held in the\r\ndemesne of one who was among his dearest friends. Lord George was not\r\nonly present but apparently absorbed in the sport, and his horses\r\nwere very successful. The world has hardly done justice to the great\r\nsacrifice which he made on this occasion to a high sense of duty. He not\r\nonly parted with the finest racing stud in England, but he parted with\r\nit at a moment when its prospects were never so brilliant; and he knew\r\nthis well. We may have hereafter to notice on this head an interesting\r\npassage in his life.\r\n\r\nHe could scarcely have quitted the turf that day without a pang. He had\r\nbecome the lord paramount of that strange world, so difficult to sway,\r\nand which requires for its government both a stern resolve and a courtly\r\nbreeding. He had them both; and though the blackleg might quail before\r\nthe awful scrutiny of his piercing eye, there never was a man so\r\nscrupulously polite to his inferiors as Lord George Bentinck. The\r\nturf, too, was not merely the scene of the triumphs of his stud and\r\nhis betting-book. He had purified its practice and had elevated its\r\ncharacter, and he was prouder of this achievement than of any other\r\nconnected with his sporting life. Notwithstanding his mighty stakes and\r\nthe keenness with which he backed his opinion, no one perhaps ever cared\r\nless for money. His habits were severely simple, and he was the most\r\ngenerous of men. He valued the acquisition of money on the turf, because\r\nthere it was the test of success. He counted his thousands after a great\r\nrace as a victorious general counts his cannon and his prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     _The Versatility of Lord George Bentinck_\r\n\r\nTHOSE who throw their eye over the debates of the session of ‘47,\r\ncannot fail to be struck by the variety of important questions in the\r\ndiscussion of which Lord George Bentinck took a leading or prominent\r\npart. And it must be borne in mind that he never offered his opinion on\r\nany subject which he had not diligently investigated and attempted\r\nto comprehend in all its bearings. His opponents might object to his\r\nprinciples or challenge his conclusions, but no one could deny that\r\nhis conclusions were drawn from extensive information and that his\r\nprinciples were clear and distinct. He spared no pains to acquire by\r\nreading, correspondence, and personal research, the most authentic\r\nintelligence on every subject in debate. He never chattered. He never\r\nuttered a sentence in the House of Commons which did not convey a\r\nconviction or a fact. He was too profuse indeed with his facts: he had\r\nnot the art of condensation. But those who have occasion to refer to his\r\nspeeches and calmly to examine them, will be struck by the amplitude\r\nand the freshness of his knowledge, the clearness of his views, the\r\ncoherence in all his efforts, and often--a point for which he never had\r\nsufficient credit--by his graphic idiom.\r\n\r\nThe best speech on the affairs of Cracow, for example, the most\r\nvigorous and the best informed, touching all the points with a thorough\r\nacquaintance, was that of Lord George Bentinck. The discussion on\r\nCracow, which lasted several nights and followed very shortly after\r\nthe defeat of his Irish bill, appeared to relate to a class of subjects\r\nwhich would not have engaged his attention; but on the contrary, he had\r\ngiven days and nights to this theme, had critically examined all the\r\ndocuments, and conferred with those qualified to supply him with any\r\nsupplementary information requisite. He spoke several times this session\r\non questions connected with our foreign affairs, and always impressed\r\nthe House with a conviction that he was addressing it after a due study\r\nof his subject: as for example, his speech against our interference in\r\nPortugal, and the statement in which he brought forward the claims of\r\nthe holders of Spanish bonds on the government of Spain before the House\r\nof Commons. In the instance of Portugal, a motion of censure on\r\nthe conduct of ministers had been introduced by Mr. Hume, and the\r\ngovernment were only saved from a minority by the friendly interposition\r\nof Mr. Duncombe, who proposed an amendment to the motion of Mr. Hume\r\nwhich broke the line of the liberal force. Lord George Bentinck in this\r\ncase followed Mr. Macaulay, whose speech, as was his wont, had been rich\r\nin historical illustration. ‘The right honourable and learned member for\r\nEdinburgh,’ Lord George replied, ‘had entered into a very interesting\r\nhistory of various interferences which had taken place in the affairs\r\nof Portugal; but in making that statement he forgot to mention one\r\ncircumstance which had occurred in that history, and it was this\r\n\r\n--that when Philip II. of Spain sought to conquer Portugal, the method\r\nhe had recourse to for that purpose was one which he thought her\r\nMajesty’s ministers had successfully practised on the present occasion\r\n\r\n--he persuaded the leaders in Portugal to mix sand with the powder of\r\ntheir troops. And so, on this occasion, her Majesty’s ministers had\r\nprevailed on the member for Finsbury, and those other members who were\r\nso ready to profess a love of liberty, to mix sand with their powder.’\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter we have treated at some length of the means\r\nproposed or adopted by the Parliament for the sustenance and relief\r\nof the people of Ireland. The new poor law for that country also much\r\nengaged the attention of both Houses this session. Lord George Bentinck\r\ntook a very active part in these transactions, and moved the most\r\nimportant of all the amendments to the government measure, namely, an\r\nattempt to assimilate the poor law of Ireland as much as possible to\r\nthat of England, and make the entire rates be paid by the occupying\r\ntenant. His object, he said, was to ‘prevent lavish expenditure and\r\nencourage profitable employment to the people.’ This amendment was only\r\nlost by a majority of four.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of March, on the government bringing forward their bill on\r\nthe rum duties, Lord George Bentinck brought before the House the\r\ncase of the British and Irish distillers, not with any preference\r\nor partiality towards English, Scotch, or Irish distillers over the\r\ncolonial producer. ‘I am no advocate of any monopoly whatever. I desire\r\nonly equal and exact justice between both parties; and the only way in\r\nwhich that end can, in my opinion, be properly attained, is in a select\r\ncommittee upstairs, consisting of impartial members of this house.’\r\n\r\nHe often used to say that no subject ever gave him more trouble\r\nthoroughly to master than the spirit duties; and he noticed the\r\ncharacter of the theme at the beginning of his speech. He said he\r\nrequired, not only the most especial indulgence, but even the toleration\r\nof the House, ‘for of all the dry and dull subjects which could possibly\r\nbe introduced, the question which it is now my misfortune to bring under\r\nthe consideration of the House is the driest and the dullest. If this\r\nquestion had been one merely of pounds, shillings, and pence, it would\r\nhave been dull and complicated enough; but this is a question in which\r\nare concerned not pounds and shillings, but pence, and halfpence, and\r\nfarthings.’\r\n\r\nThe Whitsuntide holidays occurred at the end of May. It had originally\r\nbeen the intention of Lord George Bentinck, at the request of leading\r\nmerchants and manufacturers of all parties and opinions, to have brought\r\nforward the question of the Bank Act after these holidays, and to move a\r\nresolution that some discretionary power should be established as to the\r\nissue of notes. He thus alludes to this point in a letter to Mr. Wright,\r\nof the 24th of May:--\r\n\r\n‘I return you No. 1019, of the “Bankers’ Circular,” with many thanks.\r\n\r\n‘This delightful and timely change in the weather will do wonders for\r\nthe country, and by producing an abundant and seasonable harvest, will\r\nsave the country, and _may save the Bank Charter Act_; but it is pretty\r\nwell settled that I am to give notice immediately after the holidays,\r\nof a resolution very much in the spirit of the memorial contained in the\r\npaper I am returning to you.\r\n\r\n‘Things are better in the City and at Liverpool, and with this weather\r\nwill continue to improve; but it seems to me any reverse in the weather,\r\nsuch as would occasion a late and deficient harvest, could not fail to\r\nbring the commerce of the country to a dead lock.\r\n\r\n‘The opinion is gaining ground, that in the present state not only\r\nof Ireland, but of many districts in England, the government will not\r\nventure upon a general election till after the harvest, and not then,\r\nunless the harvest should prove favourable.\r\n\r\n‘I am glad to read your opinion in opposition to Lord Ashburton’s, that\r\nrailways keep the gold in the country, and do not send it out. Glyn gave\r\nstrong evidence last year to this effect before the railway committee.’\r\n\r\nNeither of the prospects in this letter was realised. The commercial and\r\nmanufacturing interest, after the Whitsun recess, thought it advisable\r\nfor reasons of great weight that Lord George Bentinck should postpone\r\nfor a month or six weeks his intended motion on the Bank Charter, and\r\nthe ministers resolved to dissolve Parliament before the harvest: thus\r\nit happened that the merchants and manufacturers lost their chance of\r\nrelief from the yoke, and experienced the reign of terror in the autumn,\r\nthe terrible events of which ultimately occasioned the assembling of the\r\nnew Parliament in November.\r\n\r\nAnticipating the immediate dissolution of Parliament, Sir Robert Peel\r\nhad issued an address to the electors of Tamworth, justifying his\r\ncommercial policy. In the opinion of Lord George Bentinck it set forth\r\na statement as to the effect and operation of those financial measures\r\nwhich had taken place in the course of the last six years, which, if\r\nleft altogether unrefuted, might have a dangerous tendency at the\r\ncoming elections. The general effect of that statement was, that by the\r\nreduction of duties to a large extent, it was possible to relieve the\r\npeople of this country of burdens amounting to more than seven millions\r\nand a half sterling with little or no loss whatever to the revenue. But\r\nthe truth was, Sir Robert Peel in his reductions had dealt only with\r\nlittle more than ten millions sterling of the revenue of the country,\r\nand had left the remaining thirty-seven millions untouched. Now on\r\nthat portion of the revenue with which alone he had dealt, there was\r\na deficiency, through his changes, to the amount of five millions\r\nsterling, which loss was compensated by the increase on those very\r\narticles which Sir Robert had left untouched. It was the opinion of Lord\r\nGeorge Bentinck that the conclusion which Sir Robert Peel had drawn\r\nfrom the comparatively barren results of the increased duties on imports\r\ncarried by the Whigs in 1840, viz., that indirect taxation had reached\r\nits limit, and which was indeed the basis of his new system, was a\r\nfallacy, and that the anticipated increase of import duties had not\r\naccrued in 1840 in consequence of our having had three successive bad\r\nharvests, ‘and a bad cotton crop to boot,’ all of which had checked the\r\nconsuming power of the community. Sir Robert Peel had been favoured by\r\nthree successive good harvests and nearly £100,000,000 invested in six\r\nyears in domestic enterprise. ‘The interposition of Providence,’ said\r\nLord George, ‘is never a part of our debates.’\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, Lord George took occasion to review the\r\ncommercial policy of Sir Robert Peel, on the 20th July, in the House of\r\nCommons, only three days before the prorogation, and in one of his most\r\nsuccessful speeches. He was much assisted by the fact that the exports\r\nof all our staple manufactures had then greatly diminished, and of\r\ncourse he urged this point triumphantly. ‘If we had been indemnified for\r\nthe dead loss of £650,000 on cotton wool by any great impulse given\r\nto our manufacturers, it would be a consolation which unfortunately we\r\ncould not enjoy.’ He traced all the consumption to railway enterprise,\r\nand showed that it alone had compensated for the fruitless loss of\r\nrevenue which we had incurred in vainly stimulating the exports of our\r\nmanufactures, which had actually diminished. He was so impressed with\r\nthe importance that, ‘on the eve of a dissolution, such a statement\r\nas that of Sir Robert Peel should not go forth to the country\r\nuncontroverted, as in that case the necessary result would be that\r\nthe people would come to the opinion that they might abolish taxes\r\naltogether and yet maintain the revenue,’ that he sat up all night\r\nwriting an address to his constituents, the electors of King’s Lynn,\r\nwhich took up nearly two columns of the newspapers, in which he\r\npresented his refutation to the public of the commercial manifesto of\r\nTamworth, illustrated by the necessary tables and documents.\r\n\r\nThere is a sentence in this speech which, as a distinct expression of\r\npolicy, should perhaps be quoted:\r\n\r\n‘Sir, I am one of those who seek for the repeal of the malt tax and the\r\nhop duties. I am one of those who think that the excise duties ought to\r\nbe taken off. But, sir, I do not pretend that you can repeal the malt\r\ntax or the hop duties, or remove the soap tax without commutation for\r\nother taxes. I will not delude the people by pretending that I could\r\ntake off more than seven millions and a half of taxes without replacing\r\nthem by others, and not leave the nation bankrupt. But I think these\r\nreforms of Sir Robert Peel have been in a mistaken direction; I think\r\nthat revenue duties on all foreign imports ought to be maintained, and\r\nthat a revenue equal to those excise duties which I have mentioned can\r\nbe levied upon the produce of foreign countries and foreign industry,\r\nwithout imposing any greater tax than one which shall fall far short of\r\nMr. Walker’s “perfect revenue standard of 20 per cent.” I say that by\r\nimposing a tax far less than 20 per cent. upon all articles of foreign\r\nimport, a revenue might be derived far less burdensome to this country\r\nthan that of excise, a revenue of which the burden would be largely\r\nshared in by foreign countries, and in many cases paid altogether by\r\nforeign countries.’\r\n\r\nLord George at this time watched with great interest a novel feature\r\nin our commercial transactions. He wrote on the 29th May (1847), to Mr.\r\nBurn, the editor of the ‘Commercial Glance,’ and an individual of whose\r\nintelligence, accuracy, and zeal he had a high and just opinion, ‘Can\r\nyou inform me how the raw cotton purchased for exportation stands in\r\nthe first three weeks of the present month of May, as compared with the\r\ncorresponding periods of ‘46--5--4--3?\r\n\r\n‘I observe from a cotton circular sent to me the other day, that seven\r\nthousand five hundred bags of cotton had been purchased for exportation\r\nbetween the 1st and 21st of May. If with reduced stocks of raw cotton\r\nwe are commencing a career of increased exportation, it appears to me to\r\ninvolve very serious consequences for our cotton manufactures as growing\r\nout of the existing monetary difficulties of the manufacturers.\r\n\r\n‘If you could answer me these queries within the next three or four\r\ndays, I should feel greatly obliged to you.’\r\n\r\nAgain, on the 22d of July, on the point of going down to his\r\nconstituents, he was still pursuing his inquiries in the same quarter.’\r\nI want particularly to compare,’ he says to Mr. Burn, ‘the export of the\r\nlast ten weeks of raw cotton with the corresponding ten weeks of ‘46\r\nand ‘45, and at the same time to compare the importations and deliveries\r\ninto the hands of the manufacturers during these same periods.\r\n\r\n‘Pray address me, Lynn, Norfolk, where I go on Saturday, and shall\r\nremain till after my election on Thursday.’\r\n\r\nHe writes again from Lynn, with great thanks for the information which\r\nhad been accordingly forwarded to him there. ‘Might I ask you to give me\r\nan account of the cotton wool imported weekly into Liverpool, and also\r\nthe quantity sold to dealers, exporters, and speculators, in the three\r\ncorresponding weeks of ‘45-46.\r\n\r\n‘This information by return of post would greatly oblige me.’\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of July, 1847, the last day of the second Parliament of Queen\r\nVictoria, Lord George went down to the House of Commons early, and took\r\nthe opportunity of making a statement respecting the condition of our\r\nsugar-producing colonies, which were now experiencing the consequences\r\nof the unjustifiable legislation of the preceding year. He said there\r\nwere appearances in the political horizon which betokened that he should\r\nnot be able to obtain a select committee in the present session, and\r\ntherefore, if he had the honour of a seat in the next Parliament, he\r\nbegged to announce that he would take the earliest occasion to move for\r\na committee to inquire into the present power of our colonies to compete\r\nwith those countries which have still the advantage of the enforced\r\nlabour of slaves. The returns just laid upon the table of the House\r\ncould leave no doubt, he thought, on any man’s mind on that point. Since\r\nthe emancipation, the produce of sugar by the colonies, from ‘31 to ‘46,\r\nhad been reduced one half, and of rum and coffee had been reduced to one\r\nfourth. When the act of last year which admitted slave-grown sugar was\r\nintroduced, the allegation of the English colonies, that they could\r\nnot compete with the labour of slaves, was denied. The proof of that\r\nallegation was, that they were already overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nWhen one recalls all to which this speech led, the most memorable effort\r\nof that ardent, energetic life to which it was perhaps fatal, one can\r\nscarcely observe the origin of such vast exertions without emotion.\r\n\r\nThe Under Secretary of State replied to Lord George, making a cry of\r\ncheap sugar for the hustings which were before everybody’s eyes, but\r\nmaking also this remarkable declaration, that ‘the Island of Mauritius\r\nwas in a state of the greatest prosperity.’ While Lord George was\r\nspeaking, the cannon were heard that announced the departure of her\r\nmajesty from the palace.\r\n\r\nThen followed a motion of Mr. Bankes about the sale of bread, which led\r\nto some discussion. Mr. Bankes threatened a division. Lord Palmerston,\r\nwho on this occasion was leading the House, said it would be acting like\r\na set of schoolboys, if when Black Rod appeared they should be in the\r\nlobby instead of attending the Speaker to the other House. But as the\r\nmembers seemed very much inclined to act like schoolboys, the Secretary\r\nof State had to speak against time on the subject of baking. He analyzed\r\nthe petition, which he said he would not read through, but the last\r\nparagraph was of great importance.\r\n\r\nAt these words, Black Rod knocked at the door, and duly making his\r\nappearance, summoned the House to attend the Queen in the House of\r\nLords, and Mr. Speaker, followed by a crowd of members, duly obeyed the\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\nIn about a quarter of an hour, Mr. Speaker returned without the mace,\r\nand standing at the table read her Majesty’s speech to the members\r\naround, after which they retired, the Parliament being prorogued. In the\r\ncourse of the afternoon, the Parliament was dissolved by proclamation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n     _The Great Panic_\r\n\r\nTHE general election of 1847 did not materially alter the position of\r\nparties in the House of Commons. The high prices of agricultural produce\r\nwhich then prevailed naturally rendered the agricultural interest\r\napathetic, and although the rural constituencies, from a feeling of\r\nesteem, again returned those members who had been faithful to the\r\nprotective principle, the farmers did not exert themselves to increase\r\nthe number of their supporters. The necessity of doing so was earnestly\r\nimpressed upon them by Lord George Bentinck, who warned them then that\r\nthe pinching hour was inevitable; but the caution was disregarded, and\r\nmany of those individuals who are now the loudest in their imprecations\r\non the memory of Sir Robert Peel, and who are the least content with the\r\ntemperate course which is now recommended to them by those who have the\r\nextremely difficult office of upholding their interests in the House of\r\nCommons, entirely kept aloof, or would smile when they were asked for\r\ntheir support with sarcastic self-complacency, saying, ‘Well, Sir, do\r\nyou think after all that free trade has done us so much harm?’ Perhaps\r\nthey think now, that if they had taken the advice of Lord George\r\nBentinck and exerted themselves to return a majority to the House of\r\nCommons, it would have profited them more than useless execrations and\r\nbarren discontent. But it is observable, that no individuals now grumble\r\nso much as the farmers who voted for free trader in 1847, unless indeed\r\nit be the shipowners, every one of whom for years, both in and out of\r\nParliament, supported the repeal of the corn laws.\r\n\r\nThe Protectionists maintained their numbers, though they did not\r\nincrease them, in the new Parliament. Lord George Bentinck however\r\ngained an invaluable coadjutor by the re-appearance of Mr. Herries\r\nin public life, a gentleman whose official as well as parliamentary\r\nexperience, fine judgment, and fertile resource, have been of\r\ninestimable service to the Protectionist party. The political connection\r\nwhich gained most were the Whigs; they were much more numerous and\r\ncompact, but it was in a great measure at the expense of the general\r\nliberal element, and partly at the cost of the following of Sir Robert\r\nPeel. The triumphant Conservative majority of 1841 had disappeared;\r\nbut the government, with all shades of supporters, had not an absolute\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nHad the general election been postponed until the autumn, the results\r\nmight have been very different. That storm--which had been long\r\ngathering in the commercial atmosphere--then burst like a typhoon. The\r\nannals of our trade afford no parallel for the widespread disaster and\r\nthe terrible calamities. In the month of September, fifteen of the most\r\nconsiderable houses in the city of London stopped payment for between\r\nfive and six millions sterling. The governor of the Bank of England\r\nwas himself a partner in one of these firms; a gentleman who had lately\r\nfilled that office, was another victim; two other Bank directors were\r\nincluded in the list. The failures were not limited to the metropolis,\r\nbut were accompanied by others of great extent in the provinces. At\r\nManchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow large firms were obliged to suspend\r\npayments. This shock of credit arrested all the usual accommodation,\r\nand the pressure in the money-market, so terrible in the spring, was\r\nrevived. The excitement and the alarm in the city of London were so\r\ngreat that when the Chancellor of the Exchequer hurried up to town on\r\nthe 1st of October, he found that the interest of money was at the rate\r\nof 60 per cent. per annum. The Bank Charter produced the same injurious\r\neffect as it had done in April; it aggravated the evil by forcing men\r\nto hoard. In vain the commercial world deplored the refusal of the\r\ngovernment to comply with the suggestion made by Lord George Bentinck\r\nand Mr. Thomas Baring in the spring; in vain they entreated them at\r\nleast now to adopt it, and to authorize the Bank of England to enlarge\r\nthe amount of their discounts and advances on approved security, without\r\nreference to the stringent clause of the charter. The government,\r\nacting, it is believed, with the encouragement and sanction of Sir\r\nRobert Peel, were obstinate, and three weeks then occurred during\r\nwhich the commercial credit of this country was threatened with total\r\ndestruction. Nine more considerable mercantile houses stopped payment\r\nin the metropolis, the disasters in the provinces were still more\r\nextensive. The Royal Bank of Liverpool failed; among several principal\r\nestablishments in that town, one alone stopped payment for upwards of a\r\nmillion sterling. The havoc at Manchester was also great. The Newcastle\r\nbank and the North and South Wales bank stopped. Consols fell to 79 1/4,\r\nand exchequer bills were at last at 35 per cent, discount. The ordinary\r\nrate of discount at the Bank of England was between 8 and 9 per cent.,\r\nbut out of doors accommodation was not to be obtained. In such a state\r\nof affairs, the small houses of course gave way. From their rising in\r\nthe morning until their hour of retirement at night, the First Lord of\r\nthe Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer were employed in\r\nseeing persons of all descriptions, who entreated them to interfere and\r\npreserve the community from universal bankruptcy. ‘Perish the world,\r\nsooner than violate a principle,’ was the philosophical exclamation of\r\nher Majesty’s ministers, sustained by the sympathy and the sanction of\r\nSir Robert Peel. At last, the governor and the deputy-governor of the\r\nBank of England waited on Downing Street, and said it could go on no\r\nmore. The Scotch banks had applied to them for assistance. The\r\nwhole demand for discount was thrown upon the Bank of England. Two\r\nbill-brokers had stopped; two others were paralyzed. The Bank of England\r\ncould discount no longer. Thanks to the Bank Charter, they were safe and\r\ntheir treasury full of bullion, but it appeared that everybody else\r\nmust fall, for in four-and-twenty hours the machinery of credit would\r\nbe entirely stopped. The position was frightful, and the government gave\r\nway. They did that on the 25th of October, after houses had fallen to\r\nthe amount of fifteen millions sterling, which they had been counselled\r\nto do by Lord George Bentinck on the 25th of April. It turned out\r\nexactly as Mr. Thomas Baring had foretold. It was not want of capital or\r\ndeficiency of circulation which had occasioned these awful consequences.\r\nIt was sheer panic, occasioned by an unwisely stringent law. No sooner\r\nhad the government freed the Bank of England from that stringency,\r\nthan the panic ceased. The very morning the letter of license from\r\nthe government to the Bank of England appeared, thousands and tens of\r\nthousands of pounds sterling were taken from the hoards, some from boxes\r\ndeposited with bankers, although the depositors would not leave the\r\nnotes in their bankers’ hands. Large parcels of notes were returned to\r\nthe Bank of England cut into halves, as they had been sent down into the\r\ncountry, and so small was the real demand for an additional quantity of\r\ncurrency, that the whole amount taken from the Bank, when the unlimited\r\npower of issue was given, was under £400,000, and the Bank consequently\r\nnever availed itself of the privilege which the government had accorded\r\nit. The restoration of confidence produced an ample currency, and\r\nthat confidence had solely been withdrawn from the apprehension of the\r\nstringent clauses of the Bank Charter Act of 1844.\r\n\r\nThese extraordinary events had not occurred unnoticed by Lord George\r\nBentinck. The two subjects that mostly engaged his attention after the\r\ngeneral election were the action of the Bank Charter and the state of\r\nour sugar colonies. Perhaps it would be best to give some extracts from\r\nhis correspondence at this period. He was a good letter-writer, easy and\r\nclear. His characteristic love of details also rendered this style\r\nof communication interesting. It is not possible to give more than\r\nextracts, and it is necessary to omit all those circumstances which\r\ngenerally in letter-reading are most acceptable. His comments on men and\r\nthings were naturally free and full, and he always endeavoured, for the\r\namusement of his correspondents, to communicate the social gossip of the\r\nhour. But although all this must necessarily be omitted, his letters may\r\nafford some illustrations of his earnestness and energy, the constancy\r\nof his aim, and the untiring vigilance with which he pursued his\r\nobject--especially those which are addressed to gentlemen engaged in\r\ncommercial pursuits who cooperated with him in his investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A FRIEND.\r\n\r\nHarcourt House, August 30, 1847.\r\n\r\nAn answer is come out to my address to my constituents at King’s Lynn,\r\nand to my speech in answer to Peel’s manifesto. Pray read it. At first\r\nI thought I could swear to its being * * * *, I now think I can swear\r\nto its being * * * *; the servility to Peel, and the official red-tape\r\nstyle would equally do for either; but the no-popery page, I think,\r\nfixes it on * * * *.\r\n\r\nI think it wretchedly weak, and have written some notes on the margin,\r\nshowing up the principal points. The nine months’ famine of 1846-47, as\r\ncontrasted with Peel’s famine, shows a difference of between £6,000,000\r\nand £7,000,000; that is to say, on the balance in the nine months\r\n1845-46, Ireland exported about three millions’ worth of breadstuffs,\r\nand not a soul died of famine. In the nine months 1846-47, she imported\r\nthree millions’ sterling worth of bread-stuffs, which insufficed to\r\nprevent one million--or say half a million--of the people from dying of\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nAt present I have seen no notice of the pamphlet in any of the\r\nnewspapers: if it is either * * * *’s, or * * * *’s, or * * * *’s we\r\nshall see it reviewed in ‘Times,’ ‘Chronicle,’ and ‘Spectator.’\r\n\r\nThe Bank of England has raised the interest on * * * *’s mortgage\r\none-third per cent., making an additional annual charge of £1,500 a year\r\nto him. I am very sorry for him, but I know nothing so likely to rouse\r\nthe landed aristocracy from their apathy, and to weaken their idolatry\r\nof Peel so much as this warning note of the joint operation of his free\r\ntrade and restrictive currency laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A FRIEND.\r\n\r\nHarcourt House, September 2, 1847.\r\n\r\nI think it is * * * *. The trickster, I observe, has carefully reduced\r\nthe pounds of cotton to cwts., in the hopes of concealing a great fraud\r\nto which he has condescended; taking, in the Whig year of 1841, the home\r\nconsumption of cotton, whilst in Peel’s year he gives entire importation\r\nas the home consumption, representing both as home consumption.\r\n\r\nIn Peel’s year, 1846, officially we have only the gross importation; but\r\nin the Whig year, 1841, the entire importation and the home consumption\r\nare given separately: the importation exceeding the home consumption by\r\nfifty million pounds. Burn’s ‘Glance,’ however, gives the importation\r\nand home consumption for both years; unfortunately, however, not in\r\nlbs. or cwts., but in bags. * * * *’s fraud, however, is not the less\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nHe selects a Whig year when the home consumption was 220,-000 bags under\r\nthe importation, and a year for Peel when the importation exceeded the\r\nhome consumption by 280,000 bags, and claps down the figures as alike\r\ndescribing the home consumption.\r\n\r\nNone of the Peel papers have taken up the subject: if they should, the\r\n‘Morning Post’ will answer the pamphlet; but I should like to have mine\r\nback again, in order that I may furnish them with the notes.\r\n\r\n* * * * was with me this morning, and called my attention to the\r\ncircumstance that the author starts with ‘We,’ but drops into the\r\nsingular number; * * * * fancies it is Peel himself, but the page on\r\nendowment fixes it on * * * *.\r\n\r\nLord L * * * * means, I presume, that Peel’s savage hatred is applied\r\nto the Protectionist portion of his old party, not of course to the\r\njanissaries and renegade portion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter was in reply to one of a friend who had sent him\r\ninformation, several days before they occurred, of the great failures\r\nthat were about to happen in the city of London. The list was\r\nunfortunately quite accurate, with the exception indeed of the\r\nparticular house respecting which Lord George quotes the opinion of\r\nBaron Rothschild.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A FRIEND.\r\n\r\nWelbeck, September 17, 1847.\r\n\r\nA thousand thanks for your letter, the intelligence in which created a\r\ngreat sensation at Doncaster.\r\n\r\nAs yet none of the houses appear to have failed except S * * * *. Baron\r\nRothschild was at Doncaster. I talked with him on the subject; he seemed\r\nnot to doubt the probable failure of any of the houses you named, except\r\n* * * *. He declared very emphatically ‘that * * * * house was as sound\r\nas any house in London.’\r\n\r\nLord Fitzwilliam declares ‘it is no free trade without free trade in\r\nmoney.’\r\n\r\nLord Clanricarde is here--laughs at the idea of Parliament meeting in\r\nOctober; but talks much of the difficulties of Ireland--says he does not\r\nsee how the rates are to be paid.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Drummond are calling in their mortgages. I expect to hear that\r\nthis practice will be general; money dear, corn cheap, incumbrances\r\nenhanced, and rents depressed. What will become of the apathetic country\r\ngentlemen? I judge from * * * * ‘s language, that Lord John Russell\r\nwill stand or fall by the Bank Charter Act-but that he feels very\r\napprehensive of being unable to maintain it.\r\n\r\nI agree with Bonham, in thinking that the Protectionist party is\r\nsmashed for the present Parliament; but I must say I think Protectionist\r\nprinciples and policy are likely to come into repute again far sooner\r\nthan was expected; and though Peel’s party be a compact body, and\r\nformidable in the House of Commons, I cannot think that there appears\r\nthat in the working of his measures to make it likely that he should be\r\nsoon again carried into power on the shoulders of the people. I think\r\nhis political reputation must ebb further before it can rise again,\r\nif it should ever rise again. * * * * thought him ‘broken and in low\r\nspirits,’ when he met him at Longshaw; but Lord * * * *, who was there\r\nat the same time, came away more Peelite than ever, and told them at\r\nBretby that Sir Robert said, ‘That he was quite surprised at the number\r\nof letters he got every day from members returned to Parliament, saying\r\nthey meant to vote with him.’\r\n\r\nYou may rely upon it the Peelites are very sanguine that they will be in\r\npower again almost directly. We must keep them out.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BURN, EDITOR OF THE ‘COMMERCIAL GLANCE.’\r\n\r\nWelbeck, September 38, 1847. To the many courtesies you have already\r\nbestowed upon me, I will sincerely thank you to add that of informing me\r\nwhat have been the estimated cotton crops in the United States in\r\neach of the last four years. I would also thank you to inform me the\r\ncomparative importation, home consumption, re-exportation, and stocks\r\non hand of cotton of the first seven months of the current and three\r\npreceding years.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BURN.\r\n\r\nWelbeck, October 4, 1847.\r\n\r\nYour statistics have reached me in the very nick of time, and are\r\ninvaluable. I care nothing about ‘outsides,’ it is ‘insides’ I look to;\r\ngive me a good ‘heart,’ and I don’t care how rough the ‘bark’ is.\r\n\r\nAnything so good I fear to spoil by suggesting the most trivial\r\naddition, else I should say it would be an interesting feature to\r\nclassify the exports of cotton goods, etc., etc., under three heads:--\r\n\r\n1st. To the British colonies and British possessions abroad.\r\n\r\n2nd. To the northern states of Europe, France, Spain, Germany, Italy,\r\netc., etc., the United States of America, and other countries having\r\nhigh tariffs.\r\n\r\n3rd. To China, Turkey, Africa, and the Southern States of America, and\r\ncountries with low tariffs.\r\n\r\nI fear these failures of East and West India houses must entail great\r\ndistress upon Manchester, and the manufacturing interests generally. You\r\nhave given an account of the bankruptcies in the cotton trade during a\r\nlong series of years till last year inclusive; are you able to say how\r\nthe first nine months of the current year stands in comparison with its\r\npredecessors?\r\n\r\nI so highly prize your new work, that I must ask for a dozen copies to\r\ndistribute among my friends.\r\n\r\nP. S. I have already parted with the copy you sent me; may I, therefore,\r\nbeg another without waiting for any other binding?\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A FRIEND.\r\n\r\nWelbeck, October 5, 1847.\r\n\r\nI shall go up to town on Friday evening, in my way to Newmarket,\r\nand shall be at Harcourt House all Saturday and Sunday, and shall be\r\ndelighted to see you, and have a thorough good talk with you. Free trade\r\nseems working mischief faster than the most fearful of us predicted,\r\nand Manchester houses, as I am told, ‘failing in rows,’ ashamed to\r\ndo penance in public, are secretly weeping in sackcloth and ashes, and\r\nheartily praying that Peel and Cobden had been hanged before they were\r\nallowed to ruin the country.\r\n\r\nMoney at Manchester is quoted one and a quarter per cent, for ten days:\r\n£45 12s. 6d. per cent. per annum!\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A FRIEND.\r\n\r\nHarcourt House, October 22, 1847. I have this moment got a note from\r\nStuart, telling me that ‘the Chancellor has this afternoon sent out his\r\nnotice of the business to be taken in his own court during Michaelmas\r\nterm, that is, from the 2nd of November till the 26th, and below it\r\nthere is this notice--_except those days on which the Lord Chancellor\r\nmay sit in the House of Lords_!!!’\r\n\r\nSurely this must portend a November session.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A FRIEND.\r\n\r\nHarcourt House, October 23, 1847. The fat banker’s gossip is all stuff.\r\nPeel goes to Windsor today, I believe on an invitation of some standing.\r\n* * * * who had been dining at Palmerston’s last night, tells me that he\r\ndoes not think that ministers mean calling Parliament together, and is\r\nconfident they mean to maintain the Bank Charter Act. There have been\r\nsome first-rate articles and letters in the ‘Morning Chronicle’ lately\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A FRIEND.\r\n\r\nHarcourt House, November 6, 1847.\r\n\r\nI will stay over Tuesday, that I may have the pleasure of a thorough\r\ntalk with you.\r\n\r\nI am told things are gradually getting better. I expect, however, a\r\nfresh reverse about six weeks or two months hence, when the returned\r\nlists of the stoppages in the East and West Indies, consequent upon the\r\nlate failures here, come home. The Western Bank of Scotland is whispered\r\nabout. If that were to fail, it might bring the canny Scots to their\r\nsenses; but they are a headstrong race.\r\n\r\nA committee on commercial distress having been appointed, the principal\r\nreason for the summoning of the new Parliament in the autumn had been\r\nsatisfied, and an adjournment until a month after Christmas was in\r\nprospect. Before, however, this took place, a new and interesting\r\nquestion arose, which led to considerable discussion, and which\r\nultimately influenced in no immaterial manner the parliamentary position\r\nof Lord George Bentinck.\r\n\r\nThe city of London at the general election had sent to the House of\r\nCommons, as a colleague of the first minister, a member who found a\r\ndifficulty in taking one of the oaths appointed by the House to be\r\nsworn preliminarily to any member exercising his right of voting. The\r\ndifficulty arose from this member being not only of the Jewish race, but\r\nunfortunately believing only in the first part of the Jewish religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n     _The Jews_\r\n\r\nTHE relations that subsist between the Bedoueen race that, under the\r\nname of Jews, is found in every country of Europe, and the Teutonic,\r\nSclavonian, and Celtic races which have appropriated that division of\r\nthe globe, will form hereafter one of the most remarkable chapters in\r\na philosophical history of man. The Saxon, the Sclav, and the Celt\r\nhave adopted most of the laws and many of the customs of these Arabian\r\ntribes, all their literature and all their religion. They are therefore\r\nindebted to them for much that regulates, much that charms, and much\r\nthat solaces existence. The toiling multitude rest every seventh day\r\nby virtue of a Jewish law; they are perpetually reading, ‘for their\r\nexample,’ the records of Jewish history, and singing the odes and\r\nelegies of Jewish poets; and they daily acknowledge on their knees, with\r\nreverent gratitude, that the only medium of communication between the\r\nCreator and themselves is the Jewish race. Yet they treat that race as\r\nthe vilest of generations; and instead of logically looking upon them\r\nas the human family that has contributed most to human happiness, they\r\nextend to them every term of obloquy and every form of persecution.\r\n\r\nLet us endeavour to penetrate this social anomaly that has harassed and\r\nperplexed centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged that the dispersion of the Jewish race is a penalty\r\nincurred for the commission of a great crime: namely, the crucifixion\r\nof our blessed Lord in the form of a Jewish prince, by the Romans, at\r\nJerusalem, and at the instigation of some Jews, in the reign of Tiberius\r\nAugustus Caesar. Upon this, it may be observed, that the allegation is\r\nneither historically true nor dogmatically sound.\r\n\r\nI. _Not historically true_. It is not historically true, because at the\r\ntime of the advent of our Lord, the Jewish race was as much dispersed\r\nthroughout the world as at this present time, and had been so for many\r\ncenturies. Europe, with the exception of those shores which are bathed\r\nby the midland sea, was then a primeval forest, but in every city of the\r\ngreat Eastern monarchies and in every province of the Roman empire, the\r\nJews had been long settled. We have not precise authority for saying\r\nthat at the advent there were more Jews established in Egypt than in\r\nPalestine, but it may unquestionably be asserted that at that period\r\nthere were more Jews living, and that too in great prosperity and\r\nhonour, at Alexandria than at Jerusalem. It is evident from various\r\nRoman authors, that the Jewish race formed no inconsiderable portion\r\nof the multitude that filled Rome itself, and that the Mosaic religion,\r\nundisturbed by the state, even made proselytes. But it is unnecessary to\r\nenter into any curious researches on this head, though the authorities\r\nare neither scant nor uninteresting. We are furnished with evidence\r\nthe most complete and unanswerable of the pre-dispersion by the sacred\r\nwritings themselves. Not two months after the crucifixion, when the\r\nThird Person of the Holy Trinity first descended on Jerusalem, it being\r\nthe time of the great festivals, when the Jews, according to the custom\r\nof the Arabian tribes pursued to this day in the pilgrimage to Mecca,\r\nrepaired from all quarters to the central sacred place, the holy\r\nwritings inform us that there were gathered together in Jerusalem ‘Jews,\r\ndevout men, out of every nation under heaven.’ And that this expression,\r\nso general but so precise, should not be mistaken, we are shortly\r\nafterwards, though incidentally, informed, that there were Parthians,\r\nMedes, and Persians at Jerusalem, professing the Mosaic faith; Jews from\r\nMesopotamia and Syria, from the countries of the lesser and the greater\r\nAsia; Egyptian, Libyan, Greek, and Arabian Jews; and, especially, Jews\r\nfrom Rome itself, some of which latter are particularly mentioned as\r\nRoman proselytes. Nor is it indeed historically true that the small\r\nsection of the Jewish race which dwelt in Palestine rejected Christ.\r\nThe reverse is the truth. Had it not been for the Jews of Palestine,\r\nthe good tidings of our Lord would have been unknown for ever to the\r\nnorthern and western races. The first preachers of the gospel were Jews,\r\nand none else; the historians of the gospel were Jews, and none else. No\r\none has ever been permitted to write under the inspiration of the Holy\r\nSpirit, except a Jew. For nearly a century no one believed in the good\r\ntidings except Jews. They nursed the sacred flame of which they were the\r\nconsecrated and hereditary depositaries. And when the time was ripe to\r\ndiffuse the truth among the ethnics, it was not a senator of Rome or a\r\nphilosopher of Athens who was personally appointed by our Lord for that\r\noffice, but a Jew of Tarsus, who founded the seven churches of Asia. And\r\nthat greater church, great even amid its terrible corruptions, that has\r\navenged the victory of Titus by subjugating the capital of the Caesars,\r\nand has changed every one of the Olympian temples into altars of the God\r\nof Sinai and of Calvary, was founded by another Jew, a Jew of Galilee.\r\n\r\nFrom all which it appears that the dispersion of the Jewish race,\r\npreceding as it did for countless ages the advent of our Lord, could not\r\nbe for conduct which occurred subsequently to the advent, and that they\r\nare also guiltless of that subsequent conduct which has been imputed to\r\nthem as a crime, since for Him and His blessed name, they preached, and\r\nwrote, and shed their blood ‘as witnesses.’\r\n\r\nBut, is it possible that that which is not historically true can be\r\ndogmatically sound? Such a conclusion would impugn the foundations of\r\nall faith. The followers of Jesus, of whatever race, need not however be\r\nalarmed. The belief that the present condition of the Jewish race is a\r\npenal infliction for the part which some Jews took at the crucifixion is\r\nnot dogmatically sound.\r\n\r\n2. _Not dogmatically sound_. There is no passage in the sacred writings\r\nthat in the slightest degree warrants the penal assumption. The\r\nimprecation of the mob at the crucifixion is sometimes strangely quoted\r\nas a divine decree. It is not a principle of jurisprudence, human or\r\ninspired, to permit the criminal to ordain his own punishment. Why, too,\r\nshould they transfer any portion of the infliction to their posterity?\r\nWhat evidence have we that the wild suggestion was sanctioned by\r\nOmnipotence? On the contrary, amid the expiating agony, a Divine Voice\r\nat the same time solicited and secured forgiveness. And if unforgiven,\r\ncould the cry of a rabble at such a scene bind a nation?\r\n\r\nBut, dogmatically considered, the subject of the crucifixion must be\r\nviewed in a deeper spirit. We must pause with awe to remember what was\r\nthe principal office to be fulfilled by the advent. When the ineffable\r\nmystery of the Incarnation was consummated, a Divine Person moved on the\r\nface of the earth in the shape of a child of Israel, not to teach but to\r\nexpiate. True it is that no word could fall from such lips, whether in\r\nthe form of profound parable, or witty retort, or preceptive lore, but\r\nto guide and enlighten; but they who, in those somewhat lax effusions\r\nwhich in these days are honoured with the holy name of theology, speak\r\nof the morality of the Gospel as a thing apart and of novel revelation,\r\nwould do well to remember that in promulgating such doctrines they are\r\ntreading on very perilous ground. There cannot be two moralities; and to\r\nhold that the Second Person of the Holy Trinity could teach a different\r\nmorality from that which had been already revealed by the First Person\r\nof the Holy Trinity, is a dogma so full of terror that it may perhaps\r\nbe looked upon as the ineffable sin against the Holy Spirit. When the\r\nlawyer tempted our Lord, and inquired how he was to inherit eternal\r\nlife, the great Master of Galilee referred him to the writings of Moses.\r\nThere he would find recorded ‘the whole duty of man;’ to love God with\r\nall his heart, and soul, and strength, and mind, and his neighbour as\r\nhimself. These two principles are embalmed in the writings of Moses, and\r\nare the essence of Christian morals.*\r\n\r\n     * ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord.’\r\n     --Leviticus xix.  18.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was for something deeper than this, higher and holier than even Moses\r\ncould fulfil, that angels announced the Coming. It was to accomplish an\r\nevent pre-ordained by the Creator of the world for countless ages.\r\nBorn from the chosen house of the chosen people, yet blending in his\r\ninexplicable nature the Divine essence with the human elements, a\r\nsacrificial Mediator was to appear, appointed before all time, to purify\r\nwith his atoning blood the myriads that had preceded and the myriads\r\nthat will follow him. The doctrine embraces all space and time--nay,\r\nchaos and eternity; Divine persons are the agents, and the redemption of\r\nthe whole family of man the result. If the Jews had not prevailed upon\r\nthe Romans to crucify our Lord, what would have become of the Atonement?\r\nBut the human mind cannot contemplate the idea that the most important\r\ndeed of time could depend upon human will. The immolators were\r\npreordained like the victim, and the holy race supplied both. Could that\r\nbe a crime which secured for all mankind eternal joy--which vanquished\r\nSatan, and opened the gates of Paradise? Such a tenet would sully and\r\nimpugn the doctrine that is the corner-stone of our faith and hope. Men\r\nmust not presume to sit in judgment on such an act. They must bow their\r\nheads in awe and astonishment and trembling gratitude.\r\n\r\nBut, though the opinion that the dispersion of the Jewish race must be\r\ndeemed a penalty incurred for their connection with the crucifixion\r\nhas neither historical nor doctrinal sanction, it is possible that its\r\ndegrading influence upon its victims may have been as efficacious as if\r\ntheir present condition were indeed a judicial infliction. Persecution,\r\nin a word, although unjust, may have reduced the modern Jews to a state\r\nalmost justifying malignant vengeance. They may have become so odious\r\nand so hostile to mankind, as to merit for their present conduct, no\r\nmatter how occasioned, the obloquy and ill-treatment of the communities\r\nin which they dwell and with which they are scarcely permitted to\r\nmingle.\r\n\r\nLet us examine this branch of the subject, which, though of more limited\r\ninterest, is not without instruction.\r\n\r\nIn all the great cities of Europe, and in some of the great cities of\r\nAsia, among the infamous classes therein existing, there will always be\r\nfound Jews. They are not the only people who are usurers, gladiators,\r\nand followers of mean and scandalous occupations, nor are they anywhere\r\na majority of such, but considering their general numbers, they\r\ncontribute perhaps more than their proportion to the aggregate of the\r\nvile. In this they obey the law which regulates the destiny of all\r\npersecuted races: the infamous is the business of the dishonoured; and\r\nas infamous pursuits are generally illegal pursuits, the persecuted race\r\nwhich has most ability will be most successful in combating the law.\r\nThe Jews have never been so degraded as the Greeks were throughout the\r\nLevant before the emancipation, and the degradation of the Greeks was\r\nproduced by a period of persecution which, both in amount and suffering,\r\ncannot compare with that which has been endured by the children of\r\nIsrael. This peculiarity, however, attends the Jews under the most\r\nunfavourable circumstances; the other degraded races wear out and\r\ndisappear; the Jew remains, as determined, as expert, as persevering,\r\nas full of resource and resolution as ever. Viewed in this light, the\r\ndegradation of the Jewish race is alone a striking evidence of its\r\nexcellence, for none but one of the great races could have survived the\r\ntrials which it has endured.\r\n\r\nBut, though a material organization of the highest class may account for\r\nso strange a consequence, the persecuted Hebrew is supported by other\r\nmeans. He is sustained by a sublime religion. Obdurate, malignant,\r\nodious, and revolting as the lowest Jew appears to us, he is rarely\r\ndemoralized. Beneath his own roof his heart opens to the influence of\r\nhis beautiful Arabian traditions. All his ceremonies, his customs, and\r\nhis festivals are still to celebrate the bounty of nature and the favour\r\nof Jehovah. The patriarchal feeling lingers about his hearth. A man,\r\nhowever fallen, who loves his home is not wholly lost. The trumpet of\r\nSinai still sounds in the Hebrew ear, and a Jew is never seen upon the\r\nscaffold, unless it be at an _auto da fè_.\r\n\r\nBut, having made this full admission of the partial degradation of the\r\nJewish race, we are not prepared to agree that this limited degeneracy\r\nis any justification of the prejudices and persecution which originated\r\nin barbarous or mediæval superstitions. On the contrary, viewing the\r\ninfluence of the Jewish race upon the modern communities, without\r\nany reference to the past history or the future promises of Israel;\r\ndismissing from our minds and memories, if indeed that be possible, all\r\nthat the Hebrews have done in the olden time for man and all which it\r\nmay be their destiny yet to fulfil, we hold that instead of being an\r\nobject of aversion, they should receive all that honour and favour from\r\nthe northern and western races, which, in civilized and refined nations,\r\nshould be the lot of those who charm the public taste and elevate the\r\npublic feeling. We hesitate not to say that there is no race at this\r\npresent, and following in this only the example of a long period, that\r\nso much delights, and fascinates, and elevates, and ennobles Europe, as\r\nthe Jewish.\r\n\r\nWe dwell not on the fact, that the most admirable artists of the drama\r\nhave been and still are of the Hebrew race: or, that the most entrancing\r\nsingers, graceful dancers, and exquisite musicians, are sons and\r\ndaughters of Israel: though this were much. But these brilliant\r\naccessories are forgotten in the sublimer claim.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the only means by which in these modern times we\r\nare permitted to develop the beautiful is music. It would appear\r\ndefinitively settled that excellence in the plastic arts is the\r\nprivilege of the earlier ages of the world. All that is now produced\r\nin this respect is mimetic, and, at the best, the skilful adaptation\r\nof traditional methods. The creative faculty of modern man seems by an\r\nirresistible law at work on the virgin soil of science, daily increasing\r\nby its inventions our command over nature, and multiplying the material\r\nhappiness of man. But the happiness of man is not merely material. Were\r\nit not for music, we might in these days say, the beautiful is dead.\r\nMusic seems to be the only means of creating the beautiful, in which we\r\nnot only equal, but in all probability greatly excel, the ancients. The\r\nmusic of modern Europe ranks with the transcendent creations of human\r\ngenius; the poetry, the statues, the temples, of Greece. It produces and\r\nrepresents as they did whatever is most beautiful in the spirit of\r\nman and often expresses what is most profound. And who are the great\r\ncomposers, who hereafter will rank with Homer, with Sophocles, with\r\nPraxiteles, or with Phidias? They are the descendants of those Arabian\r\ntribes who conquered Canaan, and who by favour of the Most High have\r\ndone more with less means even than the Athenians.\r\n\r\nForty years ago--not a longer period than the children of Israel were\r\nwandering in the desert--the two most dishonoured races in Europe were\r\nthe Attic and the Hebrew, and they were the two races that had done most\r\nfor mankind. Their fortunes had some similarity: their countries were\r\nthe two smallest in the world, equally barren and equally famous; they\r\nboth divided themselves into tribes: both built a most famous temple on\r\nan acropolis; and both produced a literature which all European nations\r\nhave accepted with reverence and admiration. Athens has been sacked\r\noftener than Jerusalem, and oftener razed to the ground; but the\r\nAthenians have escaped expatriation, which is purely an Oriental custom.\r\nThe sufferings of the Jews, however, have been infinitely more prolonged\r\nand varied than those of the Athenians. The Greek nevertheless appears\r\nexhausted. The creative genius of Israel, on the contrary, never shone\r\nso bright; and when the Russian, the Frenchman, and the Anglo-Saxon,\r\namid applauding theatres or the choral voices of solemn temples, yield\r\nthemselves to the full spell of a Mozart or a Mendelssohn, it seems\r\ndifficult to comprehend how these races can reconcile it to their hearts\r\nto persecute a Jew.\r\n\r\nWe have shown that the theological prejudice against the Jews has no\r\nfoundation, historical or doctrinal; we have shown that the social\r\nprejudice, originating in the theological but sustained by superficial\r\nobservations, irrespective of religious prejudice, is still more\r\nunjust, and that no existing race is so much entitled to the esteem\r\nand gratitude of society as the Hebrew. It remains for us to notice the\r\ninjurious consequences to European society of the course pursued by\r\nthe communities to this race; and this view of the subject leads us to\r\nconsiderations which it would become existing statesmen to ponder.\r\n\r\nThe world has by this time discovered that it is impossible to destroy\r\nthe Jews. The attempt to extirpate them has been made under the most\r\nfavourable auspices and on the largest scale; the most considerable\r\nmeans that man could command have been pertinaciously applied to this\r\nobject for the longest period of recorded time. Egyptian Pharaohs,\r\nAssyrian kings, Roman emperors, Scandinavian crusaders, Gothic princes,\r\nand holy inquisitors have alike devoted their energies to the fulfilment\r\nof this common purpose. Expatriation, exile, captivity, confiscation,\r\ntorture on the most ingenious, and massacre on the most extensive,\r\nscale, with a curious system of degrading customs and debasing laws\r\nwhich would have broken the heart of any other people, have been tried,\r\nand in vain. The Jews, after all this havoc, are probably more numerous\r\nat this date than they were during the reign of Solomon the Wise, are\r\nfound in all lands, and, unfortunately, prospering in most. All of which\r\nproves that it is in vain for man to attempt to battle the inexorable\r\nlaw of nature, which has decreed that a superior race shall never be\r\ndestroyed or absorbed by an inferior.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of a great race will be felt; its greatness does not\r\ndepend upon its numbers, otherwise the English would not have vanquished\r\nthe Chinese, nor would the Aztecs have been overthrown by Cortez and\r\na handful of Goths. That greatness results from its organization, the\r\nconsequences of which are shown in its energy and enterprise, in the\r\nstrength of its will and the fertility of its brain. Let us observe\r\nwhat should be the influence of the Jews, and then ascertain how it\r\nis exercised. The Jewish race connects the modern populations with the\r\nearly ages of the world, when the relations of the Creator with the\r\ncreated were more intimate than in these days, when angels visited\r\nthe earth, and God himself even spoke with man. The Jews represent the\r\nSemitic principle; all that is spiritual in our nature. They are the\r\ntrustees of tradition and the conservators of the religious element.\r\nThey are a living and the most striking evidence of the falsity of that\r\npernicious doctrine of modern times--the natural equality of man.\r\nThe political equality of a particular race is a matter of municipal\r\narrangement, and depends entirely on political considerations and\r\ncircumstances; but the natural equality of man now in vogue, and taking\r\nthe form of cosmopolitan fraternity, is a principle which, were it\r\npossible to act on it, would deteriorate the great races and destroy\r\nall the genius of the world. What would be the consequence on the great\r\nAnglo-Saxon republic, for example, were its citizens to secede from\r\ntheir sound principle of reserve, and mingle with their negro and\r\ncoloured populations? In the course of time they would become so\r\ndeteriorated that their states would probably be reconquered and\r\nregained by the aborigines whom they have expelled, and who would then\r\nbe their superiors. But though nature will never ultimately permit this\r\ntheory of natural equality to be practised, the preaching of this dogma\r\nhas already caused much mischief, and may occasion much more. The native\r\ntendency of the Jewish race, who are justly proud of their blood, is\r\nagainst the doctrine of the equality of man. They have also another\r\ncharacteristic, the faculty of acquisition. Although the European\r\nlaws have endeavoured to prevent their obtaining property, they have\r\nnevertheless become remarkable for their accumulated wealth. Thus\r\nit will be seen that all the tendencies of the Jewish race are\r\nconservative. Their bias is to religion, property, and natural\r\naristocracy: and it should be the interest of statesmen that this bias\r\nof a great race should be encouraged, and their energies and creative\r\npowers enlisted in the cause of existing society.\r\n\r\nBut existing society has chosen to persecute this race which should\r\nfurnish its choice allies, and what have been the consequences?\r\n\r\nThey may be traced in the last outbreak of the destructive principle in\r\nEurope. An insurrection takes place against tradition and aristocracy,\r\nagainst religion and property. Destruction of the Semitic principle,\r\nextirpation of the Jewish religion, whether in the Mosaic or in the\r\nChristian form, the natural equality of man, and the abrogation of\r\nproperty, are proclaimed by the secret societies who form provisional\r\ngovernments, and men of Jewish race are found at the head of every one\r\nof them. The people of God coöperate with atheists; the most skilful\r\naccumulators of property ally themselves with communists; the peculiar\r\nand chosen race touch the hand of all the scum and low castes of Europe!\r\nAnd all this because they wish to destroy that ungrateful Christendom\r\nwhich owes to them even its name, and whose tyranny they can no longer\r\nendure.\r\n\r\nWhen the secret societies, in February, 1848, surprised Europe, they\r\nwere themselves surprised by the unexpected opportunity, and so little\r\ncapable were they of seizing the occasion, that had it not been for the\r\nJews, who of late years unfortunately have been connecting themselves\r\nwith these unhallowed associations, imbecile as were the governments,\r\nthe uncalled-for outbreak would not have ravaged Europe. But the fiery\r\nenergy and the teeming resources of the children of Israel maintained\r\nfor a long time the unnecessary and useless struggle. If the reader\r\nthrow his eye over the provisional governments of Germany and Italy, and\r\neven of France, formed at that period, he will recognize everywhere the\r\nJewish element. Even the insurrection, and defence, and administration\r\nof Venice, which, from the resource and statesmanlike moderation\r\ndisplayed, commanded almost the respect and sympathy of Europe, were\r\naccomplished by a Jew--Manini--who, by the bye, is a Jew who professes\r\nthe whole of the Jewish religion, and believes in Calvary as well as\r\nSinai,--‘a converted Jew,’ as the Lombards styled him, quite forgetting,\r\nin the confusion of their ideas, that it is the Lombards who are the\r\nconverts--not Manini.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen, that the persecution of the Jewish race has\r\ndeprived European society of an important conservative element, and\r\nadded to the destructive party an influential ally. Prince Metternich,\r\nthe most enlightened of modern statesmen, not to say the most\r\nintellectual of men, was, though himself a victim of the secret\r\nsocieties, fully aware of these premises. It was always his custom,\r\ngreat as were the difficulties which in so doing he had to encounter,\r\nto employ as much as possible the Hebrew race in the public service. He\r\ncould never forget that Napoleon, in his noontide hour, had been checked\r\nby the pen of the greatest of political writers; he had found that\r\nillustrious author as great in the cabinet as in the study; he knew that\r\nno one had more contributed to the deliverance of Europe. It was not\r\nas a patron, but as an appreciating and devoted friend, that the\r\nHigh Chancellor of Austria appointed Frederick Gentz secretary to the\r\nCongress of Vienna--and Frederick Gentz was a child of Israel.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt to be deplored that several millions of the Jewish race\r\nshould persist in believing in only a part of their religion; but this\r\nis a circumstance which does not affect Europe, and time, with different\r\ntreatment, may remove the anomaly which perhaps may be accounted for. It\r\nshould be recollected, that the existing Jews are perhaps altogether the\r\ndescendants of those various colonies and emigrations which, voluntary\r\nor forced, long preceded the advent. Between the vast carnage of the\r\nRoman wars, from Titus to Hadrian, and the profession of Christ by his\r\ncountrymen, which must have been very prevalent, since the Christian\r\nreligion was solely sustained by the Jews of Palestine during the\r\ngreater part of its first century, it is improbable that any descendants\r\nof the Jews of Palestine exist who disbelieve in Christ. After the fall\r\nof Jerusalem and the failure of Barchochebas, no doubt some portion of\r\nthe Jews found refuge in the desert, returning to their original land\r\nafter such long and strange vicissitudes. This natural movement would\r\naccount for those Arabian tribes, of whose resistance to Mohammed we\r\nhave ample and authentic details, and who, if we are to credit the\r\naccounts which perplex modern travellers, are to this day governed by\r\nthe Pentateuch instead of the Koran.\r\n\r\nWhen Christianity was presented to the ancestors of the present Jews,\r\nit came from a very suspicious quarter, and was offered in a very\r\nquestionable shape. Centuries must have passed in many instances before\r\nthe Jewish colonies heard of the advent, the crucifixion, and the\r\natonement; the latter, however, a doctrine in perfect harmony with\r\nJewish ideas. When they first heard of Christianity, it appeared to be a\r\nGentile religion, accompanied by idolatrous practices, from which severe\r\nmonotheists, like the Arabians, always recoil, and holding the Jewish\r\nrace up to public scorn and hatred. This is not the way to make\r\nconverts.\r\n\r\nThere have been two great colonies of the Jewish race in Europe; in\r\nSpain and in Sarmatia. The origin of the Jews in Spain is lost in\r\nthe night of time. That it was of great antiquity we have proof. The\r\ntradition, once derided, that the Iberian Jews were a Phoenician colony\r\nhas been favoured by the researches of modern antiquaries, who have\r\ntraced the Hebrew language in the ancient names of the localities.\r\nIt may be observed, however, that the languages of the Jews and the\r\nPhilistines, or Phoenicians, were probably too similar to sanction any\r\npositive induction from such phenomena; while on the other hand, in\r\nreply to those who have urged the improbability of the Jews, who had no\r\nseaports, colonizing Spain, it may be remarked that the colony may\r\nhave been an expatriation by the Philistines in the course of the long\r\nstruggle which occurred between them and the invading tribes previous\r\nto the foundation of the Hebrew monarchy. We know that in the time of\r\nCicero the Jews had been settled immemorially in Spain. When the Romans,\r\nconverted to Christianity and acted on by the priesthood, began to\r\ntrouble the Spanish Jews, it appears by a decree of Constantine that\r\nthey were owners and cultivators of the soil, a circumstance which\r\nalone proves the antiquity and the nobility of their settlement, for\r\nthe possession of the land is never conceded to a degraded race.\r\nThe conquest of Spain by the Goths in the fifth and sixth centuries\r\nthreatened the Spanish Jews, however, with more serious adversaries than\r\nthe Romans. The Gothic tribes, very recently converted to their Syrian\r\nfaith, were full of barbaric zeal against those whom they looked upon as\r\nthe enemies of Jesus. But the Spanish Jews sought assistance from\r\ntheir kinsmen the Saracens on the opposite coast; Spain was invaded and\r\nsubdued by the Moors, and for several centuries the Jew and the Saracen\r\nlived under the same benignant laws and shared the same brilliant\r\nprosperity. In the history of Spain during the Saracenic supremacy any\r\ndistinction of religion or race is no longer traced. And so it came\r\nto pass that when at the end of the fourteenth century, after the fell\r\ntriumph of the Dominicans over the Albigenses, the holy inquisition was\r\nintroduced into Spain, it was reported to Torquemada that two-thirds of\r\nthe nobility of Arragon, that is to say of the proprietors of the land,\r\nwere Jews.\r\n\r\nAll that these men knew of Christianity was, that it was a religion\r\nof fire and sword, and that one of its first duties was to avenge some\r\nmysterious and inexplicable crime which had been committed ages ago by\r\nsome unheard of ancestors of theirs in an unknown land. The inquisitors\r\naddressed themselves to the Spanish Jews in the same abrupt and\r\nferocious manner in which the monks saluted the Mexicans and the\r\nPeruvians. All those of the Spanish Jews, who did not conform after\r\nthe fall of the Mohammedan kingdoms, were expatriated by the victorious\r\nGoths, and these refugees were the main source of the Italian Jews, and\r\nof the most respectable portion of the Jews of Holland. These exiles\r\nfound refuge in two republics; Venice and the United Provinces. The\r\nPortuguese Jews, it is well known, came from Spain, and their ultimate\r\nexpulsion from Portugal was attended by the same results as the Spanish\r\nexpatriation.\r\n\r\nThe other great division of Jews in Europe are the Sarmatian Jews, and\r\nthey are very numerous. They amount to nearly three millions. These\r\nunquestionably entered Europe with the other Sarmatian nations,\r\ndescending the Borysthenes and ascending the Danube, and are according\r\nto all probability the progeny of the expatriations of the times of\r\nTiglath-Pileser and Nebuchadnezzar. They are the posterity of those\r\n‘devout men,’ Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, who were attending the\r\nfestivals at Jerusalem at the time of the descent of the Holy Spirit.\r\nLiving among barbarous pagans, who never molested them, these people\r\nwent on very well, until suddenly the barbarous pagans, under the\r\ninfluence of an Italian priesthood, were converted to the Jewish\r\nreligion, and then as a necessary consequence the converts began to\r\nharass, persecute, and massacre the Jews.\r\n\r\nThese people had never heard of Christ. Had the Romans not destroyed\r\nJerusalem, these Sarmatian Jews would have had a fair chance of\r\nobtaining from civilized beings some clear and coherent account of the\r\ngreat events which had occurred. They and their fathers before them\r\nwould have gone up in customary pilgrimage to the central sacred place,\r\nboth for purposes of devotion and purposes of trade, and they might have\r\nheard from Semitic lips that there were good tidings for Israel. What\r\nthey heard from their savage companions, and the Italian priesthood\r\nwhich acted on them, was, that there were good tidings for all the world\r\nexcept Israel, and that Israel, for the commission of a great crime\r\nof which they had never heard and could not comprehend, was to be\r\nplundered, massacred, hewn to pieces, and burnt alive in the name of\r\nChrist and for the sake of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Jews, who are very numerous, are in general the descendants\r\nof those who in the course of repeated captivities settled in the great\r\nEastern monarchies, and which they never quitted. They live in the same\r\ncities and follow the same customs as they did in the days of Cyrus.\r\nThey are to be found in Persia, Mesopotamia, and Asia Minor; at Bagdad,\r\nat Hamadan, at Smyrna. We know from the Jewish books how very scant was\r\nthe following which accompanied Esdras and Nehemiah back to Jerusalem.\r\nA fortress city, built on a ravine, surrounded by stony mountains and\r\nwatered by a scanty stream, had no temptations after the gardens of\r\nBabylon and the broad waters of the Euphrates. But Babylon has vanished\r\nand Jerusalem remains, and what are the waters of Euphrates to the brook\r\nof Kedron! It is another name than that of Jesus of Nazareth with which\r\nthese Jews have been placed in collision, and the Ishmaelites have not\r\nforgotten the wrongs of Hagar in their conduct to the descendants of\r\nSarah.\r\n\r\nIs it therefore wonderful that a great portion of the Jewish race should\r\nnot believe in the most important portion of the Jewish religion? As,\r\nhowever, the converted races become more humane in their behaviour to\r\nthe Jews, and the latter have opportunity fully to comprehend and deeply\r\nto ponder over true Christianity, it is difficult to suppose that the\r\nresult will not be very different. Whether presented by a Roman or\r\nAnglo-Catholic or Genevese divine, by pope, bishop, or presbyter, there\r\nis nothing, one would suppose, very repugnant to the feelings of a Jew\r\nwhen he learns that the redemption of the human race has been effected\r\nby the mediatorial agency of a child of Israel: if the ineffable mystery\r\nof the Incarnation be developed to him, he will remember that the\r\nblood of Jacob is a chosen and peculiar blood; and if so transcendent a\r\nconsummation is to occur, he will scarcely deny that only one race could\r\nbe deemed worthy of accomplishing it. There may be points of doctrine\r\non which the northern and western races may perhaps never agree. The\r\nJew like them may follow that path in those respects which reason and\r\nfeeling alike dictate; but nevertheless it can hardly be maintained that\r\nthere is anything revolting to a Jew to learn that a Jewess is the queen\r\nof heaven, or that the flower of the Jewish race are even now sitting on\r\nthe right hand of the Lord God of Sabaoth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, too, in this enlightened age, as his mind expands, and he takes\r\na comprehensive view of this period of progress, the pupil of Moses may\r\nask himself, whether all the princes of the house of David have done so\r\nmuch for the Jews as that prince who was crucified on Calvary. Had it\r\nnot been for Him, the Jews would have been comparatively unknown, or\r\nknown only as a high Oriental caste which had lost its country. Has not\r\nHe made their history the most famous in the world? Has not He hung up\r\ntheir laws in every temple? Has not He vindicated all their wrongs?\r\nHas not He avenged the victory of Titus and conquered the Caesars? What\r\nsuccesses did they anticipate from their Messiah? The wildest dreams of\r\ntheir rabbis have been far exceeded. Has not Jesus conquered Europe and\r\nchanged its name into Christendom? All countries that refuse the cross\r\nwither, while the whole of the new world is devoted to the Semitic\r\nprinciple and its most glorious offspring the Jewish faith, and the time\r\nwill come when the vast communities and countless myriads of America\r\nand Australia, looking upon Europe as Europe now looks upon Greece, and\r\nwondering how so small a space could have achieved such great deeds,\r\nwill still find music in the songs of Sion and still seek solace in the\r\nparables of Galilee.\r\n\r\nThese may be dreams, but there is one fact which none can contest.\r\nChristians may continue to persecute Jews, and Jews may persist in\r\ndisbelieving Christians, but who can deny that Jesus of Nazareth, the\r\nIncarnate Son of the Most High God, is the eternal glory of the Jewish\r\nrace?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n     _Jewish Disabilities_\r\n\r\nIT WOULD seem to follow from the views expressed in the preceding\r\nchaptet, that in communities professing a belief in our Lord, the\r\nJewish race ought not to be subject to any legislative dishonour or\r\ndisqualification. These views, however, were not those which influenced\r\nLord George Bentinck in forming his opinion that the civil disabilities\r\nof those subjects of her Majesty who profess that limited belief in\r\ndivine revelation which is commonly called the Jewish religion should\r\nbe removed. He had supported a measure to this effect in the year\r\n1833, guided in that conduct by his devoted attachment to the equivocal\r\nprinciple of religious liberty, the unqualified application of which\r\nprinciple seems hardly consistent with that recognition of religious\r\ntruth by the state to which we yet adhere, and without which it is\r\nhighly probable that the northern and western races, after a disturbing\r\nand rapidly degrading period of atheistic anarchy, may fatally recur\r\nto their old national idolatries, modified and mythically dressed up\r\naccording to the spirit of the age. It may be observed that the decline\r\nand disasters of modern communities have generally been relative to\r\ntheir degree of sedition against the Semitic principle. Since the great\r\nrevolt of the Celts against the first and second testament, at the close\r\nof the last century, France has been alternately in a state of collapse\r\nor convulsion. Throughout the awful trials of the last sixty years,\r\nEngland, notwithstanding her deficient and meagre theology, has always\r\nremembered Sion. The great Transatlantic republic is intensely\r\nSemitic, and has prospered accordingly. This sacred principle alone has\r\nconsolidated the mighty empire of all the Russias. How omnipotent it\r\nis cannot be more clearly shown than by the instance of Rome, where it\r\nappears in its most corrupt form. An old man on a Semitic throne baffles\r\nthe modern Attilas, and the recent invasion of the barbarians, under the\r\nform of red republicans, socialists, communists, all different phases\r\nwhich describe the relapse of the once converted races into their\r\nprimitive condition of savagery. Austria would long ago have dissolved\r\nbut for the Semitic principle, and if the north of Germany has never\r\nsucceeded in attaining that imperial position which seemed its natural\r\ndestiny, it is that the north of Germany has never at any time been\r\nthoroughly converted. Some perhaps may point to Spain as a remarkable\r\ninstance of decline in a country where the Semitic principle has\r\nexercised great influence. But the fall of Spain was occasioned by the\r\nexpulsion of her Semitic population: a million families of Jews and\r\nSaracens, the most distinguished of her citizens for their industry and\r\ntheir intelligence, their learning and their wealth.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Lord George Bentinck had offended some of his followers\r\nby an opinion expressed in his address to his constituency in ‘47, that\r\nin accordance with the suggestion of Mr. Pitt, some provision should\r\nbe made for the Roman Catholic priesthood of Ireland out of the land.\r\nAlthough this opinion might offend the religious sentiments of some,\r\nand might be justly looked upon by others as a scheme ill-suited to the\r\ncharacter of an age adverse to any further religious endowments, it must\r\nbe acknowledged that no member of the Protectionist party had any just\r\ncause of complaint against Lord George for the expression of an opinion\r\nwhich he had always upheld, and of his constancy to which he had fairly\r\ngiven his friends notice. This was so generally felt that the repining\r\ndied away. The Jewish question, as it was called, revived these\r\nreligious emotions. These feelings, as springing from the highest\r\nsentiment of our nature, and founded, however mistaken in their\r\napplication, on religious truth, are entitled to deep respect and\r\ntenderness; but no one can indulge them by the compromise of the highest\r\nprinciples, or by sanctioning a course which he really believes to be\r\ndestructive of the very object which their votaries wish to cherish.\r\n\r\nAs there are very few Englishmen of what is commonly called the Jewish\r\nfaith, and as therefore it was supposed that political considerations\r\ncould not enter into the question, it was hoped by many of the followers\r\nof Lord George Bentinck that he would not separate himself from his\r\nparty on this subject, and very earnest requests and representations\r\nwere made to him with that view. He was not insensible to them; he gave\r\nthem prolonged and painful consideration; they greatly disquieted him.\r\nIn his confidential correspondence he often recurs to the distress\r\nand anxiety which this question and its consequences as regarded his\r\nposition with those friends to whom he was much attached occasioned him.\r\nIt must not, therefore, be supposed that, in the line he ultimately\r\ntook with reference to this question, he was influenced, as some have\r\nunkindly and unwarrantably fancied, by a self-willed, inexorable, and\r\nimperious spirit. He was no doubt, by nature, a proud man, inclined even\r\nto arrogance, and naturally impatient of contradiction; but two\r\nsevere campaigns in the House of Commons had already mitigated these\r\ncharacteristics: he understood human nature, he was fond of his party,\r\nand, irrespective of other considerations, it pained his ardent and\r\ngenerous heart to mortify his comrades. It was therefore not in any\r\ndegree from temper, but from principle,--from as pure, as high, and as\r\nnoble a sense of duty as ever actuated a man in public life,--that Lord\r\nGeorge Bentinck ultimately resolved that it was impossible for him\r\nto refuse to vote for the removal of what are commonly called Jewish\r\ndisabilities. He had voted in this particular cause shortly after\r\nhis entrance into public life; it was in accordance with that general\r\nprinciple of religious liberty to which he was an uncompromising\r\nadherent; it was in complete agreement with the understanding which\r\nsubsisted between himself and the Protectionist party, when at their\r\nurgent request he unwillingly assumed the helm. He was entreated not to\r\nvote at all; to stay away, which the severe indisposition under which\r\nhe was then labouring warranted. He did not rudely repulse these latter\r\nrepresentations, as has been circulated. On the contrary, he listened\r\nto them with kindness, and was not uninfluenced by them. Enfeebled by\r\nillness, he had nearly brought himself to a compliance with a request\r\nurged with affectionate importunity, but from which his reason and sense\r\nof duty held him aloof. After long and deep and painful pondering, when\r\nthe hour arrived, he rose from his bed of sickness, walked into the\r\nHouse of Commons, and not only voted, but spoke in favour of his\r\nconvictions. His speech remains, one of the best ever delivered on the\r\nsubject, not only full of weighty argument, but touched with a high and\r\neven tender vein of sentiment.\r\n\r\nThis vote and speech of Lord George Bentinck no doubt mortified at the\r\nmoment a considerable portion of his followers, and occasioned great\r\ndissatisfaction among a very respectable though limited section of\r\nthem. This latter body must either have forgotten or they must have been\r\nstrangely unacquainted with the distinct understanding on which Lord\r\nGeorge had undertaken the lead of the party, or otherwise they could\r\nnot have felt authorized in conveying to him their keen sense of\r\ndisapprobation. Unfortunately he received this when the House had\r\nadjourned for the holidays, and when Mr. Bankes, who had been the organ\r\nof communication with him in ‘46, was in the country, and when the party\r\nwas of course generally dispersed. Lord George did not take any pains to\r\nascertain whether the representation which was made to him was that of\r\nthe general feeling of a large party, or that only of a sincere, highly\r\nestimable, but limited section. He was enfeebled and exhausted by\r\nindisposition; he often felt, even when in health, that the toil of his\r\nlife was beyond both his physical and moral energies; and though he was\r\nof that ardent and tenacious nature that he never would have complained,\r\nbut have died at his post, the opportunity of release coming to him at\r\na moment when he was physically prostrate was rather eagerly seized, and\r\nthe world suddenly learnt at Christmas, with great astonishment, that\r\nthe renowned leader of the Protectionist party had relinquished his\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\nThe numerous communications which he received must have convinced\r\nhim that the assumed circumstances under which he acted had not been\r\naccurately appreciated by him. He was implored to reconsider his course,\r\nas one very detrimental to the cause to which he was devoted, and\r\nwhich would probably tend to the triumph of those whose policy he\r\nhad attempted to defeat, and whose personal conduct he had at least\r\nsucceeded in punishing.\r\n\r\n‘The prophesied time has come,’ he wrote to his friend Mr. Bankes, on\r\nthe 23rd of December, 1847, ‘when I have ceased to be able to serve\r\nthe party, the great cause of Protection, or my country, by any longer\r\nretaining the commission bestowed on me in the spring of 1846. You will\r\nremember, however, that when unfeignedly and honestly, but in vain,\r\ntrying to escape from being raised to a position which I foresaw I must\r\nfail to maintain with advantage to you or honour to myself, I at last\r\ngave my consent, I only did so on the express understanding that my\r\nadvancement should be held to be merely a pro tempore appointment,\r\nwaiting till the country should have the opportunity of sending to\r\nParliament other men better fitted to lead the country gentlemen of\r\nEngland. I have recalled these circumstances to your mind with no other\r\npurpose than that the party may feel how entirely free they are, without\r\neven the suspicion of doing an injustice to me or of showing me in\r\nthis any disrespect, to remodel their arrangements, and to supersede my\r\nlieutenancy by the appointment of a superior and permanent commander.’\r\n\r\nAnd again on Christmas-day, to the same gentleman, in reply to an\r\nacknowledgment of the preceding, he says, while thanking Mr. Bankes\r\n‘for his warm-hearted letter as very grateful to his feelings,’--’\r\nConfidentially I tell you, that far from feeling in the least annoyed,\r\nI shall feel greatly relieved by a restoration to privacy and freedom. I\r\nworked upon my spirit in ‘46 and ‘47; but I have learnt now that I have\r\nshaken my constitution to the foundation, and I seriously doubt my being\r\nable to work on much longer.’\r\n\r\nHe wrote on the 24th of December to one of his most intimate friends and\r\nwarmest supporters, Mr. Christopher, the member for Lincolnshire, who\r\nhad remonstrated with him as to his decision: ‘It is not in my nature to\r\nretain a station one moment after I get a hint even that any portion\r\nof those who raised me to it are wearied of seeing me there. The old\r\nmembers of the party will all recollect how clearly I foresaw and\r\nforetold that I should be found a very inconvenient as well as a very\r\ninefficient leader, so soon as the great Protection battle was brought\r\nto a close. I predicted all that has since occurred; and no one more\r\ncordially agrees than I do in the wisdom of the present decision, the\r\nspirit I presume of which is that no great party or large body of men\r\ncan be successfully, or to any good purpose, led except by a man\r\nwho heart and soul sympathizes with them in all their feelings,\r\npartialities, and prejudices. Cold reason has a poor chance against such\r\ninfluences. There can be no _esprit de corps_ and no zeal where there\r\nis not a union of prejudices as well as of commercial opinions. The\r\nelection of a leader united with the great body of the party in these\r\nrespects, will tend greatly to reunite its scattered particles, even on\r\nthose questions where I shall be able to give my aid with all my wonted\r\nzeal, which will not be the less spirited because it will be free and\r\nindependent.’\r\n\r\nAt a later period, acknowledging an address signed by the great body\r\nof the Protectionist party, and presented to him by the present Earl\r\nTalbot, then a member of the House of Commons, Lord George wrote, ‘The\r\nconsiderations which obliged me to surrender a post of honour which\r\nevery independent and high-minded English gentleman has at all times\r\nprized above the highest rewards in the gift of the crown, “the\r\nleadership of the country gentlemen of England,” will never influence\r\nme to swerve from any endeavours of which my poor abilities and bodily\r\nenergies are capable in the promotion of the prosperity of all classes\r\nin the British empire at home and in the colonies, any more than\r\nthey can ever make me forget the attachment, the friendship, and the\r\nenthusiastic support of those who stood by me to the end of the death\r\nstruggle for British interests and for English good faith and political\r\nhonour, and to whose continued friendship and constancy I know I am\r\nindebted for this graceful and grateful compliment.’\r\n\r\nIf Lord George Bentinck was inexorable to the entreaties of his friends,\r\nit must not be supposed that he was influenced in the course which he\r\npursued, as was presumed by many at the time not acquainted with the\r\ncircumstances, by any feeling of pique or brooding sullenness. No\r\nhigh-spirited man under vexatious and distressing circumstances ever\r\nbehaved with more magnanimity. In this he was actuated in a great degree\r\nby a sense of duty, but still more by that peculiar want of selfishness\r\nwhich was one of the most beautiful traits of his character. The moment\r\nhe had at all recovered from the severe attack by which, to use his own\r\nlanguage, he had been ‘struck down in the first week of the session,’\r\nand from the effects of which it may be doubted whether he ever entirely\r\nrecovered, he laboured zealously to induce some competent person to\r\nundertake the office which he had thought it expedient to resign,\r\noffering in several instances to serve in the ranks, and to assist with\r\nhis utmost energies, both in and out of the House, the individual who\r\nwould undertake the responsible direction in the Commons.\r\n\r\nThese efforts, though indefatigable, were not successful, for those who\r\nwere competent to the office cared not to serve under any one except\r\nhimself. About this time, a personage of great station, and who very\r\nmuch admired Lord George Bentinck, wrote to him, and recommended him\r\nnot to trouble himself about the general discipline of the party, but\r\nto follow his own course, and lead that body of friends who under all\r\ncircumstances would adhere to him, instancing the case of Mr. Canning,\r\nunder circumstances not altogether dissimilar. Lord George replied: ‘As\r\nfor my rallying a personal party round myself, as Mr. Canning did, I\r\nhave no pretension to anything of the kind; when Mr. Canning did that,\r\nthe House of Commons, and England too, acknowledged him to be the\r\ngreatest orator who had survived Pitt and Fox; he had been Secretary of\r\nState for foreign affairs, and had taken a conspicuous part in rousing\r\nthe country to carry on the war against France.’\r\n\r\nThe nature of the subject, dealing as it necessarily does with so\r\nmany personal details, renders it impossible to make public the\r\ncorrespondence in which Lord George Bentinck was engaged at this time in\r\nhis attempts to place the Protectionist party under the guidance of one\r\nwho would unite all sympathies; but were that publication possible, it\r\nwould place Lord George Bentinck in a very noble and amiable light, and\r\nprove a gentleness and softness in his nature for which those who were\r\nnot very intimate with him did not give him credit. Not that it must be\r\nfor a moment supposed that he was insensible to what was occurring. He\r\nwas the most sensitive as well as the proudest of men. When the writer\r\ncalled at Harcourt House, to bid him farewell, before the Christmas\r\nholidays, and, conversing very frankly on the course which he was then\r\npursuing, inquired as to his future proceedings, Lord George said with\r\nemotion: ‘In this cause I have shaken my constitution and shortened\r\nmy days, and I will succeed or die.’ In the course of the year 1848,\r\nwalking home, talking together, from the House of Commons, he twice\r\nrecurred to this terrible alternative.\r\n\r\nBut all considerations were merged at this moment in the predominant one\r\nwhich was to keep the party together. He wrote to a friend at the end of\r\nJanuary, who urged him, as the hour of work approached and the injurious\r\ninconveniences of his abdication would be more felt, to confer with his\r\nformer followers and reconsider his position, that no personal feeling\r\nprevented his taking that course, but that he felt any resumption of\r\nresponsibility on his part would not be pleasing to a section of those\r\nwho formerly served with him, and that there would be a ‘split’ in the\r\nranks. ‘As far as I am personally concerned,’ he added, ‘I could submit\r\nto anything short of having my ears cut off and appearing as a “Croppy,”\r\n to be free again. My pride cannot stand leading an unwilling party; I\r\nwould just as soon thrust myself into a dinner-room where I was at once\r\nan uninvited and an unwelcome guest.’\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, according to his custom, the moment that he had\r\nsufficiently recovered from his illness, he prepared with the utmost\r\nzeal for the coming struggle respecting the fate of our sugar colonies,\r\nin which subject he was soon absorbed.\r\n\r\nParliament reassembled on the 3rd of February, and on that night Lord\r\nGeorge Bentinck brought forward his motion for ‘a select committee\r\nto inquire into the present condition and prospects of the interests\r\nconnected with and dependent on sugar and coffee planting in her\r\nMajesty’s East and West Indian possessions and the Mauritius, and to\r\nconsider whether any and what measures can be adopted by Parliament for\r\ntheir relief.’ When he entered the House, Lord George walked up to the\r\nhead of the second bench below the gangway, on the opposition side,\r\nand thus significantly announced that he was no longer the responsible\r\nleader of the Protectionist party. It was the wish of the writer of\r\nthese pages, who had resolved to stand or fall by him, to have followed\r\nhis example and to have abdicated the prominent seat in which the writer\r\nhad been unwillingly and fortuitously placed; but by the advice, or\r\nrather at the earnest request, of Lord George Bentinck, this course was\r\nrelinquished as indicative of schism, which he wished to discourage; and\r\nthe circumstance is only mentioned as showing that Lord George was not\r\nless considerate at this moment of the interests of the Protectionist\r\nparty than when he led them with so much confidence and authority.\r\nThe session, however, was to commence without a leader, without any\r\nrecognized organ of communication between parties, or any responsible\r\nrepresentative of opinion in debate. All again was chaos. There is,\r\nhowever, something so vital in the Conservative party that it seems\r\nalways to rally under every disadvantage.\r\n\r\nLord George spoke well to his resolution: the House soon recognized\r\nhe was master of his case, and though few foresaw at the moment the\r\nimportant consequences to which this motion would lead, the House was\r\ninterested from the first; and though there was no division, the debate\r\nlasted two days, and was sustained on both sides with great animation.\r\n\r\nThe mover vindicated himself very successfully for only proposing a\r\ncommittee of inquiry. ‘It has been represented to me,’ he said, ‘by the\r\ncolonies and by persons in this country who are interested in them, that\r\nthe course which I am proposing is not consistent with the necessities\r\nof the case; that there is something pusillanimous in the motion which\r\nI am going to make; that in point of fact the interests connected with\r\nsugar and coffee planting are in extremis; and that while the question\r\nof their redress is being discussed in a committee above-stairs, these\r\ngreat interests will perish. They say to me that a committee of inquiry\r\nwill be to them of the nature of that comfort which,\r\n\r\n     “Like cordials after death, come late; ”\r\n\r\nand that before the committee shall have reported, the West-Indian\r\ninterest will be altogether past recovery. But, sir, it is for me to\r\nconsider what my power is to obtain any substantial relief by a direct\r\nvote of this House; and when I remember that in July, 1846, I moved a\r\nresolution the purport of which was, to maintain the protection for\r\nthe West-Indian and the East-Indian free-labour colonies which they now\r\nseek, and that I had but one hundred and thirty gentlemen to support me,\r\nwhile two hundred and sixty-five votes were recorded in favour of the\r\nmeasure of the Government admitting slave-labour sugar, I feel that it\r\nis hopeless for me to endeavour in this House, where I have no reason\r\nto suppose any addition has been made to the members acquiescing in my\r\nviews, to convert that minority into a majority; and more especially\r\nwhen I recollect that on that occasion but five gentlemen connected with\r\nthe West-Indian and East-Indian interests recorded their votes with me,\r\nI think the West-Indian interest has not a good case against me when\r\nthey blame me for not taking a more resolute step on this occasion.’\r\n\r\nHe was not, however, without hope from the course which he had decided\r\nto pursue. ‘Looking, as I have done, at the deplorable state of the\r\nWest Indies, the East Indies, and the Mauritius, and holding, as I do,\r\nin my hand a list of forty-eight great houses in England--twenty-six\r\nof the first commercial houses in London, sixteen in Liverpool, and six\r\nelsewhere--which have failed, and whose liabilities amount in the whole\r\nto £6,300,000 and upwards, none of which I believe would have fallen had\r\nit not been for the ruin brought upon them by the change in the sugar\r\nduties and the consequent reduction in the price of their produce,--I\r\ndo hope, through the intervention of a committee of this House, I may be\r\nable to prevail upon the House to change its policy with regard to this\r\ngreat question.’\r\n\r\nLord George was supported in this debate by Mr. Thomas Baring, in one\r\nof the best speeches ever made in the House of Commons. Few more combine\r\nmastery of the case with parliamentary point than this gentleman. It is\r\nnot impossible to find a man capable of addressing the House of Commons\r\nwho understands the subject; it is not impossible to find a man who\r\ncan convey his impressions on any subject to the House in a lively and\r\ncaptivating manner, though both instances are rarer than the world would\r\nimagine; but a man who at the same time understands a question and can\r\nhandle it before a popular assembly in a popular style, who teaches\r\nwithout being pedantic, can convey an argument in an epigram, and\r\ninstruct as the Mexicans did by picture, possesses a talent for the\r\nexercise of which he is responsible to his sovereign and his country.\r\n\r\nMr. Baring said that he could not perfectly agree either with Lord John\r\nRussell or Lord George Bentinck, that Protection or Free Trade must be\r\nin what they called a circle, round which in their legislation they must\r\nalways move; that they must either give protection to everything or\r\nfree trade to everything. He could not say that because sugar claimed\r\nprotection, coals must have protection also. Neither would he, on the\r\nother hand, apply free trade to every article. He acknowledged the\r\nadvantage of competition as a stimulus: he thought that, placing things\r\non equal grounds, competition was undoubtedly a great advantage. He\r\ncould understand a competition to try the mutual speed of race-horses;\r\nbut there could be no competition between a race-horse and a\r\nsteam-engine, for the power of the animal could bear no comparison with\r\nthat of the machine!\r\n\r\nMr. Baring could look back to no legislation more humiliating than the\r\nlegislation regarding our colonies. No great interest was ever so much\r\ntrifled with, so much sacrificed to the cry of the day; at one moment to\r\nno slavery and another to cheap sugar.\r\n\r\nThe committee was granted, and it was generally felt that the question\r\nwas consequently quieted for the session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n     _Leader Perforce_\r\n\r\nDURING the first six weeks of this famous committee the attendance\r\nof its members was not very regular, and its labours attracted little\r\nattention. The evidence on the East-India part of the question was\r\nclosed and reported to the House by the end of February; after that\r\nperiod the evidence was reported to the House every week or ten\r\ndays. Towards the end of March, rumours began to circulate of the\r\nextraordinary vigour and ability with which this investigation was\r\npursued, and of the novel, authentic, and striking evidence that had\r\nbeen elicited. The proceedings were talked of in the House of Commons\r\nand on the Royal Exchange; the City men who were examined went back\r\nto their companions with wondrous tales of the energy and acuteness\r\nof Harcourt House, and the order, method, and discipline of the\r\ncommittee-room at Westminster. As time elapsed, the hopes of the\r\ncolonial interest again revived. It was generally felt that Lord George\r\nhad succeeded in establishing an irresistible case. It was rumoured that\r\nthe government could not withstand it. Those who had originally murmured\r\nat the course which he had adopted of moving for a committee of inquiry,\r\ninstead of proposing a specific measure of relief, and had treated an\r\ninvestigation as a mere means of securing inaction, now recanted their\r\nrash criticism, and did justice to his prescience and superior judgment,\r\nas well as to his vast information and indefatigable exertions. The week\r\nduring which the committee sat on their report was a very anxious\r\none; the divisions were known every day in the House of Commons; the\r\nalternations of success and discomfiture, and the balanced numbers that\r\nso often called for the interposition of the chairman, were calculated\r\nto sustain the excitement; and when, on the 29th of May, it was known\r\nthat the report was at length agreed to, and that a committee of free\r\ntraders had absolutely recommended a differential duty of 10s. in favour\r\nof our own produce, one might have fancied from the effect visibly\r\nproduced, that a government was changed.\r\n\r\nA few days before--it was the day after the Derby, May 25th--the writer\r\nmet Lord George Ben-tinck in the library of the House of Commons. He\r\nwas standing before the book-shelves, with a volume in his hand, and\r\nhis countenance was greatly disturbed. His resolutions in favour of\r\nthe colonial interest after all his labours had been negatived by the\r\ncommittee on the 22nd, and on the 24th, his horse Surplice, whom he\r\nhad parted with among the rest of his stud, solely that he might pursue\r\nwithout distraction his labours on behalf of the great interests of the\r\ncountry, had won that paramount and Olympian stake, to gain which had\r\nbeen the object of his life. He had nothing to console him, and nothing\r\nto sustain him except his pride. Even that deserted him before a heart\r\nwhich he knew at least could yield him sympathy. He gave a sort of\r\nsuperb groan:--\r\n\r\n‘All my life I have been trying for this, and for what have I sacrificed\r\nit!’ he murmured.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain to offer solace.\r\n\r\n‘You do not know what the Derby is,’ he moaned out.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, I do; it is the blue ribbon of the turf.’\r\n\r\n‘It is the blue ribbon of the turf,’ he slowly repeated to himself, and\r\nsitting down at the table, he buried himself in a folio of statistics.\r\n\r\nBut on Monday, the 29th, when the resolution in favour of a 10s.\r\ndifferential duty for the colonies had at the last moment been carried,\r\nand carried by his casting vote, ‘the blue ribbons of the turf were all\r\nforgotten. Not for all the honours and successes of all the meetings,\r\nspring or autumn, Newmarket, Epsom, Goodwood, Doncaster, would he have\r\nexchanged that hour of rapture. His eye sparkled with fire, his nostril\r\ndilated with triumph, his brow was elate like a conqueror, his sanguine\r\nspirit saw a future of continued and illimitable success.\r\n\r\n‘We have saved the colonies,’ he said,--‘saved the colonies. I knew it\r\nmust be so. It is the knell of free trade.’\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the formal renunciation of the leadership of the\r\nProtectionist party by Lord George Bentinck, it was soon evident to the\r\nHouse and the country that that renunciation was merely formal. In these\r\ndays of labour, the leader of a party must be the man who does the work,\r\nand that work cannot now be accomplished without the devotion of a life.\r\nWhenever a great question arose, the people out of doors went to Lord\r\nGeorge Bentinck, and when the discussion commenced, he was always found\r\nto be the man armed with the authority of knowledge. There was, however,\r\nno organized debate and no party discipline. No one was requested to\r\ntake a part, and no attendance was ever summoned. The vast majority\r\nsitting on the Protectionist benches always followed Bentinck, who,\r\nwhatever might be his numbers in the lobby, always made a redoubtable\r\nstand in the House. The situation however, it cannot be denied, was a\r\ndangerous one for a great party to persevere in, but no permanent damage\r\naccrued, because almost every one hoped that before the session was\r\nover, the difficulty would find a natural solution in the virtual chief\r\nresuming his formal and responsible post. Notwithstanding his labours on\r\nthe two great committees of the year--those on colonial and commercial\r\ndistress,--Lord George Bentinck found time to master the case of the\r\nshipping interest when the navigation laws were attacked, to impugn in\r\na formal motion the whole of the commercial policy of Sir Robert Peel,\r\neven while the sugar and coffee planting committee was still sitting,\r\nand to produce, early in March, a rival budget. It was mainly through\r\nthe prolonged resistance which he organized against the repeal of the\r\nnavigation laws, that the government, in 1848, was forced to abandon\r\ntheir project. The resistance was led with great ability by Mr. Herries,\r\nand the whole party put forward their utmost strength to support him.\r\nBut it is very difficult to convey a complete picture of the laborious\r\nlife of Lord George Bentinck during the sitting of Parliament.\r\nAt half-past nine o’clock there called upon him the commercial\r\nrepresentatives of the question of the day; after these conferences came\r\nhis elaborate and methodical correspondence, all of which he carried\r\non himself in a handwriting clear as print, and never employing a\r\nsecretary; at twelve or one o’clock he was at a committee, and he only\r\nleft the committee-room to take his seat in the House of Commons, which\r\nhe never quitted till the House adjourned, always long past midnight,\r\nand often at two o’clock in the morning. Here he was ready for all\r\ncomers, never omitting an opportunity to vindicate his opinions, or\r\nwatching with lynx-like vigilance the conduct of a public office. What\r\nwas not his least remarkable trait is, that although he only breakfasted\r\non dry toast, he took no sustenance all this time, dining at White’s\r\nat half-past two o’clock in the morning. After his severe attack of\r\nthe influenza he broke through this habit a little during the last\r\nfew months of his life, moved by the advice of his physician and the\r\ninstance of his friends. The writer of these observations prevailed\r\nupon him a little the last year to fall into the easy habit of dining\r\nat Bellamy’s, which saves much time, and permits the transaction of\r\nbusiness in conversation with a congenial friend. But he grudged it:\r\nhe always thought that something would be said or done in his absence,\r\nwhich would not have occurred had he been there; some motion whisked\r\nthrough, or some return altered. His principle was that a member should\r\nnever be absent from his seat.\r\n\r\nThe session of ‘48 had been one of unexampled length, having lasted ten\r\nmonths, and, as usual under such circumstances, the obstacles to the\r\ntransaction of public business were sought everywhere except in the\r\nreal quarter. The forms of the House and the propensity to unnecessary\r\ndiscussion among its members were chiefly denounced. Lord George\r\nBentinck did not agree in the justness of these criminations; they were\r\neagerly caught by the thoughtless and the superficial, but it was his\r\nhabit to investigate and analyze everything, and he found that these\r\ncharges had no basis. The forms of the House of Commons are the\r\nresult of accumulated experience and have rarely been tampered with\r\nsuccessfully, while on the other hand a parliamentary government is by\r\nname and nature essentially a government of discussion. It is not at all\r\ndifficult to conceive a mode of governing a country more expeditious\r\nthan by a parliament; but where truth as well as strength is held to\r\nbe an essential element of legislation, opinion must be secured an\r\nunrestricted organ. Superfluity of debate may often be inconvenient to\r\na minister, and sometimes perhaps even distasteful to the community;\r\nbut criticizing such a security for justice and liberty as a free-spoken\r\nparliament is like quarrelling with the weather because there is too\r\nmuch rain or too much sunshine. The casual inconvenience should be\r\nforgotten in the permanent blessing. Acting upon these false imputations\r\na committee was even appointed, two years ago, of the most eminent\r\nmembers of the House of Commons, to investigate the subject and suggest\r\nremedies, and some votaries of the Transatlantic type recommended the\r\nadoption of the rules of Congress where each speaker is limited to\r\nan hour. But an hour from an uninteresting speaker would be a great\r\ninfliction. The good sense and the good taste of the House of Commons\r\nwill be found on the whole to be the best regulators of the duration of\r\na debate.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the delay in the conduct of parliamentary business\r\nwhich has been much complained of during the last few years, murmurs of\r\nwhich were especially rife in 1848, is attributable to the fact that the\r\nministry, though formed of men inferior in point of ability to none who\r\ncould be reasonably intrusted with administration, had not\r\nsufficient parliamentary strength. After all their deliberations and\r\nforesight,--after all their observations of the times and study of the\r\npublic interest, their measures when launched from the cabinet into the\r\nHouse were not received by a confiding majority, firm in their faith\r\nin the statesmanlike qualities of the authors of these measures and in\r\ntheir sympathy with the general political system of which the ministry\r\nwas the representative. On the contrary, the success of the measures\r\ndepended on a* variety of sections who in their aggregate exceeded in\r\nnumber and influence the party of the ministers. These became critics\r\nand took the ministerial measures in hand; the measures became, the\r\nmeasures, not of the cabinet, but of the House of Commons; and a purely\r\nlegislative assembly became, in consequence of the weakness of the\r\ngovernment, yearly more administrative. This was undoubtedly a great\r\nevil, and occasioned, besides great delay, many crude enactments, as\r\nwill be the case where all are constructors and none are responsible,\r\nbut the evil was not occasioned by the forms of the House or the\r\nlength of the speeches. Sir Robert Peel was unquestionably a very able\r\nadministrator, but if he had not had a majority of ninety he would\r\nhave fallen in as ill repute as has been too often the lot of Lord John\r\nRussell.\r\n\r\nLord George Bentinck was very anxious that there should be a\r\nparliamentary summary of this enormous and eventful session of ‘48, that\r\nthe conduct of business by the ministry should be traced and criticized\r\nand the character of the House of Commons vindicated, and he appealed to\r\nthe writer of these observations to undertake the task. But the writer\r\nwas unwilling to accede to this suggestion, not only because at the end\r\nof August he shrank from a laborious effort, but principally because he\r\ndid not hold that his position in the House of Commons warranted on his\r\npart such an interference, since, after all, he was only the comrade in\r\narms of one who chose to be only an independent member of the House. He\r\ntherefore unaffectedly stated that he thought the office was somewhat\r\nabove his measure. But Lord George Bentinck would not listen to these\r\nrepresentations. ‘I don’t pretend to know much,’ he said, ‘but I can\r\njudge of men and horses.’ It is difficult to refuse those who are\r\nthemselves setting a constant example of self-sacrifice, and therefore,\r\nso far as the labour was concerned, the writer would not have shrunk\r\nfrom the exertion even on the last day of the month of August, and when\r\nthe particular wish of Lord George was found to be more general than the\r\nwriter presumed to suppose, he accordingly endeavoured to accomplish the\r\nintention.\r\n\r\nThree or four days after this, the writer, about to leave London, called\r\nat Harcourt House, to say farewell to his comrade in arms. He\r\npassed with Lord George the whole morning, rather indulging in the\r\ncontemplation of the future than in retrospect. Lord George was serene,\r\ncheerful, and happy. He was content with himself, which was rarely the\r\ncase, and remembered nothing of his career but its distinction, and the\r\nennobling sense of having done his duty.\r\n\r\nAny misunderstandings that may have for a moment irritated him seemed\r\nforgotten; he appeared conscious that he possessed the confidence\r\nand cordial regard of the great majority of the Protectionist party,\r\nalthough he chose to occupy a private post, and he was proud of the\r\nconsciousness. He was still more sensible of the sympathy which he had\r\ncreated out of doors, which he greatly appreciated, and to which, though\r\nwith his usual modesty, he more than once recurred. ‘The thing is\r\nto get the people out of doors with you,’ he repeated, ‘men like the\r\nmerchants; all the rest follow.’ It was evident that the success of his\r\ncolonial committee had greatly satisfied his spirit. He had received\r\nthat day the vote of thanks of the West-India body for his exertions.\r\nHe said more than once, that with a weak government, a parliamentary\r\ncommittee properly worked might do wonders. He said he would have a\r\ncommittee on import duties next year, and have all the merchants to show\r\nwhat share the foreigners had obtained of the reductions that had been\r\nmade of late years. He maintained, that, quite irrespective of the\r\ngeneral arrangements of the new commercial system, Sir Robert Peel had\r\nthrown away a great revenue on a number of articles of very inferior\r\nimportance, and he would prove this to the country. He said our colonial\r\nempire ought to be reconstructed by a total abolition of all duties on\r\nproduce from her Majesty’s dominions abroad.\r\n\r\nAll his ideas were large, clear, and coherent. He dwelt much on the\r\nvicissitudes which most attend all merely foreign trade, which, though\r\nit should be encouraged, ought not to be solely relied on, as was the\r\nfashion of this day. Looking upon war as occasionally inevitable, he\r\nthought a commercial system based upon the presumption of perpetual\r\npeace to be full of ruin. His policy was essentially imperial and not\r\ncosmopolitan.\r\n\r\nAbout to part probably for many months, and listening to him as he\r\nspoke, according to his custom, with so much fervour and sincerity, one\r\ncould not refrain from musing over his singular and sudden career. It\r\nwas not three years since he had in an instant occupied the minds\r\nof men. No series of parliamentary labours had ever produced so much\r\ninfluence in the country in so short a time. Never was a reputation so\r\nsubstantial built up in so brief a period. AH the questions with which\r\nhe had dealt were colossal questions: the laws that should regulate\r\ncompetition between native and foreign labour; the interference of the\r\nstate in the development of the resources of Ireland; the social and\r\ncommercial condition of our tropical colonies; the principles upon which\r\nour revenue should be raised; the laws which should regulate and protect\r\nour navigation. But it was not that he merely expressed opinions\r\nupon these subjects; he came forward with details in support of his\r\nprinciples and policy, which it had before been believed none but a\r\nminister could command. Instead of experiencing the usual and almost\r\ninevitable doom of private members of Parliament, and having his\r\nstatements shattered by official information, Lord George Bentinck on\r\nthe contrary, was the assailant, and the successful assailant, of\r\nan administration on these very heads. He often did their work more\r\neffectually than all their artificial training enabled them to do it.\r\nHis acute research, and his peculiar sources of information, roused\r\nthe vigilance of all the public offices of the country. Since his time,\r\nthere has been more care in preparing official returns, and in arranging\r\nthe public correspondence placed on the table of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nWhen one remembered that in this room, not three years ago, he was\r\ntrying to find a lawyer who would make a speech for him in Parliament,\r\nit was curious to remember that no one in the period had probably\r\naddressed the House of Commons oftener. Though his manner, which was\r\ndaily improving, was not felicitous in the House, the authority of his\r\nintellect, his knowledge, and his character, made him one of the great\r\npersonages of debate; but with the country who only read his speeches\r\nhe ranked high as an orator. It is only those who have had occasion\r\ncritically to read and examine the long series of his speeches who can\r\nbe conscious of their considerable merits. The information is always\r\nfull and often fresh, the scope large, the argument close, and the\r\nstyle, though simple, never bald, but vigorous, idiomatic, and often\r\npicturesque. He had not credit for this in his day, but the passages\r\nwhich have been quoted in this sketch will prove the justness of this\r\ncriticism. As a speaker and writer, his principal need was condensation.\r\nHe could not bear that anything should remain untold. He was deficient\r\nin taste, but he had fervour of feeling, and was by no means void of\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nThe writer, in his frequent communications with him of faithful and\r\nunbounded confidence, was often reminded of the character by Mr. Burke\r\nof my Lord Keppell.\r\n\r\nThe labours of Lord George Bentinck had been supernatural, and one ought\r\nperhaps to have felt then that it was impossible they could be continued\r\non such a scale of exhaustion; but no friend could control his eager\r\nlife in this respect; he obeyed the law of his vehement and fiery\r\nnature, being one of those men who in whatever they undertake know no\r\nmedium, but will ‘succeed or die.’\r\n\r\nBut why talk here and now of death! He goes to his native county and his\r\nfather’s proud domain, to breathe the air of his boyhood and move amid\r\nthe parks and meads of his youth. Every breeze will bear health, and the\r\nsight of every hallowed haunt will stimulate his pulse. He is scarcely\r\nolder than Julius Cæsar when he commenced his public career, he looks as\r\nhigh and brave, and he springs from a long-lived race.\r\n\r\nHe stood upon the _perron_ of Harcourt House, the last of the great\r\nhotels of an age of stately dwellings with its wings, and court-yard,\r\nand carriage portal, and huge outward walls. He put forth his hand to\r\nbid farewell, and his last words were characteristic of the man--of his\r\nwarm feelings and of his ruling passion: ‘God bless you; we must work,\r\nand the country will come round us.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n     _The Curtain Falls_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE heavens darken; a new character enters upon the scene.\r\n\r\nThey say that when great men arise they have a mission to accomplish\r\nand do not disappear until it is fulfilled. Yet this is not always true.\r\nAfter all his deep study and his daring action Mr. Hampden died on an\r\nobscure field, almost before the commencement of that mighty struggle\r\nwhich he seemed born to direct. In the great contention between the\r\npatriotic and the cosmopolitan principle which has hardly begun, and\r\non the issue of which the fate of this island as a powerful community\r\ndepends, Lord George Ben-tinck appeared to be produced to represent the\r\ntraditionary influences of our country in their most captivating form.\r\nBorn a natural leader of the people, he was equal to the post. Free from\r\nprejudices, his large mind sympathized with all classes of the realm.\r\nHis courage and his constancy were never surpassed by man. He valued\r\nlife only as a means of fulfilling duty, and truly it may be said of\r\nhim, that he feared none but God.\r\n\r\nA few days after the interview noticed in the last chapter, Lord George\r\nBentinck returned to Welbeck. Some there were who thought him worn by\r\nthe exertions of the session, and that an unusual pallor had settled\r\nupon that mantling and animated countenance. He himself never felt in\r\nbetter health or was ever in higher spirits, and greatly enjoyed the\r\nchange of life, and that change to a scene so dear to him.\r\n\r\nOn the 21 st of September, after breakfasting with his family, he\r\nretired to his room, where he employed himself With some papers, and\r\nthen wrote three letters, one to Lord Enfield, another to the Duke of\r\nRichmond, and the third to the writer of these pages. That letter is\r\nnow at hand; it is of considerable length, consisting of seven sheets of\r\nnote-paper, full of interesting details of men and things, and written\r\nnot only in a cheerful but even a merry mood. Then, when his letters\r\nwere sealed, about four o’clock he took his staff and went forth to\r\nwalk to Thoresby, the seat of Lord Manvers, distant between five and six\r\nmiles from Welbeck, where Lord George was to make a visit of two days.\r\nIn consequence of this his valet drove over to Thoresby at the same time\r\nto meet his master. But the master never came. Hours passed on and the\r\nmaster never came. At length the anxious servant returned to Welbeck,\r\nand called up the groom who had driven him over to Thoresby and who was\r\nin bed, and inquired whether he had seen anything of Lord George on the\r\nway back, as his lord had never reached Thoresby. The groom got up, and\r\naccompanied by the valet and two others took lanthorns, and followed\r\nthe footpath which they had seen Lord George pursuing as they themselves\r\nwent to Thoresby.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from the Abbey, on the path which they had observed him\r\nfollowing, lying close to the gate which separates a water meadow from\r\nthe deer-park, they found the body of Lord George Bentinck. He was lying\r\non his face; his arms were under his body, and in one hand he grasped\r\nhis walking-stick. His hat was a yard or two before him, having\r\nevidently been thrown off in falling. The body was cold and stiff. He\r\nhad been long dead.\r\n\r\nA woodman and some peasants passing near the spot, about two hundred\r\nyards from the gate in question, had observed Lord George, whom at the\r\ndistance they had mistaken for his brother the Marquis of Titchfield,\r\nleaning against this gate. It was then about half-past four o’clock, or\r\nit might be a quarter to five, so he could not have left his home much\r\nmore than half an hour. The woodman and his companions thought ‘the\r\ngentleman’ was reading, as he held his head down. One of them lingered\r\nfor a minute looking at the gentleman, who then turned round, and might\r\nhave seen these passers-by, but he made no sign to them.\r\n\r\nThus it seems that the attack, which was supposed to be a spasm of the\r\nheart, was not instantaneous in its effects, but with proper remedies\r\nmight have been baffled. Terrible to think of him in his death-struggle\r\nwithout aid, and so near a devoted hearth! For that hearth, too, what an\r\nimpending future!\r\n\r\nThe terrible news reached Nottingham on the morning of the 22nd, at\r\nhalf-past nine o’clock, and, immediately telegraphed to London,\r\nwas announced by a second edition of the ‘Times’ to the country.\r\nConsternation and deep grief fell upon all men. One week later, the\r\nremains arrived from Welbeck at Harcourt House, to be entombed in the\r\nfamily vault of the Bentincks, that is to be found in a small building\r\nin a dingy street, now a chapel of ease, but in old days the parish\r\nchurch among the fields of the pretty village of Marylebone.\r\n\r\nThe day of interment was dark, and cold, and drizzling. Although the\r\nlast offices were performed in the most scrupulously private manner, the\r\nfeelings of the community could not be repressed. From nine till eleven\r\no’clock that day all the British shipping in the docks and the river,\r\nfrom London Bridge to Gravesend, hoisted their flags half-mast high,\r\nand minute guns were fired from appointed stations along the Thames.\r\nThe same mournful ceremony was observed in all the ports of England and\r\nIreland; and not only in these, for the flag was half-mast high on every\r\nBritish ship at Antwerp, at Rotterdam, and at Havre.\r\n\r\nEre the last minute gun sounded, all was over. Followed to his tomb by\r\nthose brothers who, if not consoled, might at this moment be sustained\r\nby the remembrance that to him they had ever been brothers not only in\r\nname but in spirit, the vault at length closed on the mortal remains of\r\n_George Bentinck_.\r\n\r\nOne who stood by his side in an arduous and unequal struggle, who often\r\nshared his councils and sometimes perhaps soothed his cares, who knew\r\nwell the greatness of his nature and esteemed his friendship among\r\nthe chief of worldly blessings, has stepped aside from the strife and\r\npassion of public life to draw up this record of his deeds and thoughts,\r\nthat those who come after us may form some conception of his character\r\nand career, and trace in these faithful though imperfect pages the\r\nportraiture of an _English Worthy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg’s Lord George Bentinck, by Benjamin Disraeli",
