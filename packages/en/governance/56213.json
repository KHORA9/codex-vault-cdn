THE LAW UNDER WHICH NAZI ORGANIZATIONS ARE ACCUSED OF BEING CRIMINAL\r\n\r\n_The following argument on the law and policy involved in the\r\nprosecution’s charge that certain Nazi groups and organizations should\r\nbe declared criminal, was delivered by Justice Jackson before the\r\nTribunal on 28 February 1946._\r\n\r\nMay it please the Tribunal:\r\n\r\nThe unconditional surrender of Germany created, for the victors, novel\r\nand difficult problems of law and administration. Since it is the first\r\nsuch surrender of an entire and modernly organized society, precedents\r\nand past experiences are of little help in guiding our policy toward the\r\nvanquished. The responsibility implicit in demanding and accepting\r\ncapitulation of a whole people must of necessity include a duty to\r\ndiscriminate justly and intelligently between opposing elements of the\r\npopulation which bore dissimilar relations to the policies and conduct\r\nwhich led to the catastrophe. This differentiation is the objective of\r\nthose provisions of the Charter which authorize this Tribunal to declare\r\norganizations or groups to be criminal. Understanding of the problem\r\nwhich the instrument attempts to solve is essential to its\r\ninterpretation and application.\r\n\r\n              A. _The Problem of the Nazi Organizations._\r\n\r\nOne of the sinister peculiarities of German society at the time of the\r\nsurrender was that the State itself played only a subordinate role in\r\nthe exercise of political power, while the really drastic controls over\r\nGerman society were organized outside its nominal government. This was\r\naccomplished through an elaborate network of closely knit and exclusive\r\norganizations of selected volunteers oath-bound to execute, without\r\ndelay and without question, the commands of the Nazi leaders.\r\n\r\nThese organizations penetrated the whole German life. The country was\r\nsubdivided into little Nazi principalities of about 50 households each,\r\nand every such community had its recognized party leaders, party police,\r\nand its undercover party spies. These were combined into larger units\r\nwith higher ranking leaders, executioners and spies. The whole formed a\r\npyramid of power outside the law, with the Fuehrer at its apex, and with\r\nthe local party officials as its broad base resting heavily on the\r\nGerman population. The Nazi despotism, therefore, did not consist of\r\nthese individual defendants alone. A thousand little fuehrers dictated,\r\na thousand imitation Goerings strutted, a thousand Schirachs incited the\r\nyouth, a thousand Sauckels worked slaves, a thousand Streichers and\r\nRosenbergs stirred hate, a thousand Kaltenbrunners and Franks tortured\r\nand killed, a thousand Schachts and Speers and Funks administered,\r\nfinanced, and supported the movement. The Nazi movement was an\r\nintegrated force in city and county and hamlet. The party power\r\nresulting from this system of organizations first rivaled, and then\r\ndominated, the power of the State itself.\r\n\r\nThe primary vice of this web of organizations was that they were used to\r\ntransfer the power of coercing men from the government and the law to\r\nthe Nazi leaders. Liberty, self-government, and security of persons and\r\nproperty do not exist except where the power of coercion is possessed\r\nonly by the State and is exercised only in obedience to law. The Nazis,\r\nhowever, set up a private system of coercion, outside of and immune from\r\nlaw, with party-controlled concentration camps and firing squads to\r\nadminister privately decreed sanctions. Without responsibility to law\r\nand without warrant from any court, they were enabled to seize property,\r\ntake away liberty, and even take life itself.\r\n\r\nThese organizations had a calculated and decisive part in the barbaric\r\nextremes of the Nazi movement. They served cleverly to exploit mob\r\npsychology and to manipulate the mob. Multiplying the numbers of persons\r\nin a common enterprise tends to diminish each individual’s sense of\r\nmoral responsibility and to increase his sense of security. The Nazi\r\nleaders were masters of this technique. They manipulated these\r\norganizations to make before the German populace impressive exhibitions\r\nof numbers and of power. These were used to incite a mob spirit and then\r\nriotously to gratify the popular hates they had inflamed and the\r\nGermanic ambition they had inflated.\r\n\r\nThese organizations indoctrinated and practiced violence and terrorism.\r\nThey provided the systematized, aggressive, and disciplined execution\r\nthroughout Germany and the occupied countries of the whole catalogue of\r\ncrimes we have proven. The flowering of the system is represented in the\r\nfanatical SS General Ohlendorf, who told this Tribunal without shame or\r\ntrace of pity how he personally directed the putting to death of 90,000\r\nmen, women, and children. No tribunal ever listened to a recital of such\r\nwholesale murder as this Tribunal heard from him and from Wisliceny, a\r\nfellow officer of the SS. Their own testimony shows the responsibility\r\nof the SS for the extermination program which took the lives of five\r\nmillion Jews, a responsibility the organization welcomed and discharged\r\nmethodically, remorselessly, and thoroughly. These crimes are\r\nunprecedented ones because of the shocking numbers of victims. They are\r\neven more shocking and unprecedented because of the large number of\r\npersons who united to perpetrate them. All scruple or conscience of a\r\nvery large segment of the German people was committed to Nazi keeping,\r\nand its devotees felt no personal sense of guilt as they went from one\r\nextreme measure to another. On the other hand, they developed a contest\r\nin cruelty and a competition in crime. Ohlendorf from the witness stand\r\naccused other SS commanders, whose killings exceeded his, of\r\n“exaggerating” their figures.\r\n\r\nThere could be no justice and no wisdom in an occupation policy which\r\nimposed upon passive and unorganized and inarticulate Germans the same\r\nburdens as it placed upon those who voluntarily banded themselves\r\ntogether in these powerful and notorious gangs. One of the basic\r\nrequirements, both of justice and of successful administration of the\r\noccupation responsibility of the victors, is a segregation of these\r\norganized elements from the masses of Germans for separate treatment.\r\n\r\nIt seems beyond controversy that to punish a few top leaders but to\r\nleave this web of organized bodies unscotched in the midst of German\r\npostwar society, would be to foster the nucleus of a new Nazidom. The\r\nmembers are accustomed to an established chain of centralized command;\r\nthey have formed a habit and developed a technique of both secret and\r\nopen cooperation. They still nourish a blind devotion to the suspended,\r\nbut not abandoned, Nazi program. They will keep alive the hates and\r\nambitions which generated the orgy of crime we have proved. They are\r\ncarriers, from this generation to the next, of the infection of\r\naggressive and ruthless war. The Tribunal has seen on the screen how\r\neasily an assemblage that ostensibly is only a common labor force can be\r\nin fact a military training unit drilling with shovels. The next war and\r\nthe next pogroms will be hatched in the nests of these organizations as\r\nsurely as we leave their membership with its prestige and influence\r\nundiminished by condemnation and punishment.\r\n\r\nThe menace of these organizations is the more impressive when we\r\nconsider the demoralized state of German society. It will be years\r\nbefore there can be established in the German State any political\r\nauthority that is not inexperienced and provisional. It cannot quickly\r\nacquire the stability of a government aided by long habit of obedience\r\nand traditional respect. The intrigue, obstruction, and possible\r\noverthrow, which older and established governments fear from\r\nconspiratorial groups, is a real and present danger to any stable social\r\norder in the Germany of today and of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nInsofar as the Charter of this Tribunal contemplates a justice of\r\nretribution, it is obvious that it could not overlook these organized\r\ninstruments and instigators of past crimes. In opening this case, I said\r\nthat the United States does not seek to convict the whole German people\r\nof crime. But it is equally important that this trial shall not serve to\r\nabsolve the whole German people except 22 men in the dock. The wrongs\r\nthat have been done to the world by these defendants and their top\r\nconfederates was not done by their will or by their strength alone. The\r\nsuccess of their designs was made possible because great numbers of\r\nGermans organized themselves to become the fulcrum and the lever by\r\nwhich the power of these leaders was extended and magnified. If this\r\ntrial fails to condemn these organized confederates for share of\r\nresponsibility for this catastrophe, it will be construed as their\r\nexoneration.\r\n\r\nBut the Charter was not concerned with retributive justice alone. It\r\nmanifests a constructive policy influenced by exemplary and preventive\r\nconsiderations. The primary objective of requiring that the surrender be\r\nunconditional was to clear the way for reconstruction of German society\r\non such a basis that it will not again threaten the peace of Europe and\r\nof the world. Temporary measures of the occupation authorities may, by\r\nnecessity, have been more arbitrary and applied with less discrimination\r\nthan befits a permanent policy. Under existing denazification policy, no\r\nmember of the Nazi party or its formations may be employed in any\r\nposition, other than ordinary labor, or in any business enterprise\r\nunless he is found to have been only a nominal Nazi. Persons in certain\r\ncategories, whose standing in the community is one of prominence or\r\ninfluence, are required to meet this standard, and those who do not may\r\nbe denied further participation in their businesses or professions. It\r\nis mandatory to remove or exclude from public office, and from positions\r\nof importance in quasi public and private enterprises, persons falling\r\nwithin approximately 90 specified categories deemed to consist of either\r\nactive Nazis, Nazi supporters, or militarists. The property of such\r\npersons is blocked.\r\n\r\nIt is recognized by the Control Council, as it was by the framers of the\r\nCharter, that a permanent, long-term program should be based on a more\r\ncareful and more individual discrimination than was possible with\r\nsweeping temporary measures. There is a movement now within the Control\r\nCouncil for reconsideration of its whole denazification policy and\r\nprocedure. The action of this Tribunal in declaring, or in failing to\r\ndeclare, the accused organizations criminal has a vital bearing on\r\nfuture occupation policy.\r\n\r\nIt was the intent of the Charter to utilize the hearing processes of\r\nthis Tribunal to identify and condemn those Nazi and militaristic forces\r\nthat were so organized as to constitute a continuing menace to the\r\nlong-term objectives for which our respective countries have spent the\r\nlives of their young men. It is in the light of this great purpose that\r\nwe must examine the provisions of the Charter.\r\n\r\n            B. _The Procedure for Condemning Organizations._\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that the conventional litigation procedures could not,\r\nwithout some modification, be adapted to this task. No system of\r\njurisprudence has yet evolved any satisfactory technique for handling a\r\ngreat multiplicity of common charges against a multitude of accused\r\npersons. The number of individual defendants that fairly can be tried in\r\na single proceeding probably does not greatly exceed the number now in\r\nyour dock. Moreover, the number of separate trials in which the same\r\nvoluminous evidence as to common plan must be repeated is very limited\r\nas a practical matter. Yet adversary hearing procedures are the best\r\nassurance the law has evolved that decisions will be well considered and\r\njust. The task of the framers of the Charter was to find a way to\r\novercome these obstacles to practicable and early decision without\r\nsacrificing the fairness implicit in hearings. The solution prescribed\r\nby the Charter is certainly not faultless, but not one of its critics\r\nhas ever proposed an alternative that would not either deprive the\r\nindividual of any hearing or contemplate such a multitude of long trials\r\nas to be impracticable. In any case, it is the plan adopted by our\r\nrespective governments and our duty here is to make it work.\r\n\r\nThe plan which was adopted in the Charter essentially is a severance of\r\nthe general issues which would be common to all individual trials from\r\nthe particular issues which would differ in each trial. The plan is\r\ncomparable to that employed in certain wartime legislation of the United\r\nStates (_Yakus_ v. _United States_, 321 U. S., 414, 64 Sup. Ct. 660).\r\nThe general issues are to be determined with finality in one trial\r\nbefore the International Tribunal. In this trial, every accused\r\norganization must be defended by counsel and must be represented by at\r\nleast one leading member, and other individual members may apply to be\r\nheard. Their applications may be granted if the Tribunal thinks justice\r\nrequires it. The only issue in this trial concerns the collective\r\ncriminality of the organization or group. It is to be adjudicated by\r\nwhat amounts to be a declaratory judgment. It does not decree any\r\npunishment, either against the organization or against the individual\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe only specification as to the effect of this Tribunal’s declaration\r\nthat an organization is criminal, is contained in Article 10 of the\r\nCharter, which provides:\r\n\r\n    “In cases where a group or organization is declared criminal by\r\n    the Tribunal, the competent national authority of any Signatory\r\n    shall have the right to bring individuals to trial for\r\n    membership therein before national, military or occupation\r\n    courts. In any such case the criminal nature of the group or\r\n    organization is considered proved and shall not be questioned.”\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, it would be competent for the Charter to have declared\r\nflatly that membership in any of these named organizations is criminal\r\nand should be punished accordingly. If there had been such an enactment,\r\nit would not have been open to an individual who was being tried for\r\nmembership in the organization to contend that the organization was not\r\nin fact criminal. The framers of the Charter, at a time before the\r\nevidence adduced here was available, did not care to find organizations\r\ncriminal by fiat. They left that issue to determination after relevant\r\nfacts were developed by adversary proceedings. Plainly, the individual\r\nmember is better off because of the procedure of the Charter, which\r\nleaves that finding of criminality to this body after hearings at which\r\nthe organization must, and the individual may, be represented.\r\n\r\nThe groups and organizations named in the Indictment are not “on trial”\r\nin the conventional sense of that term. They are more nearly under\r\ninvestigation as they might be before a grand jury in Anglo-American\r\npractice. Article 9 recognizes a distinction between _the declaration_\r\nof a group or organization as criminal and “_the trial_ of any\r\nindividual member thereof.” The power of the Tribunal to try is confined\r\nto “persons,” and the Charter does not expand that term by definition,\r\nas statutes sometimes do, to include other than natural persons. The\r\ngroups or organizations named in the Indictment were not as entities\r\nserved with process. The Tribunal is not empowered to impose any\r\nsentence upon them as entities, nor to convict any person because of\r\nmembership.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the Charter does not _require_ subsequent\r\nproceedings against anyone. It provides only that the competent national\r\nauthorities “_shall have the right_ to bring individuals to trial for\r\nmembership therein.”\r\n\r\nThe Charter is silent as to the form these trials should take. It was\r\nnot deemed wise, on the information available when the Charter was drawn\r\nup, that the Charter should regulate subsequent proceedings. Nor was it\r\nnecessary to do so. There is a continuing legislative authority,\r\nrepresenting all four signatory nations, competent to take over where\r\nthe Charter leaves off. Legislative supplementation of the Charter is\r\nnecessary to confer jurisdiction on local courts, to define procedures,\r\nand to prescribe different penalties for different forms of activity.\r\n\r\nFear has been expressed, however, that the Charter’s silence as to\r\nfuture proceedings means that great numbers of members will be rounded\r\nup and automatically punished as a result of a declaration of an\r\norganization to be criminal. It also has been suggested that this is, or\r\nmay be, the consequence of Article II, 1(d) of Control Council Act No.\r\n10, which defines as a crime “membership in categories of a criminal\r\ngroup or organization declared criminal by the International Military\r\nTribunal.” A purpose to inflict punishments without a right of hearing\r\ncannot be spelled out of the Charter, and would be offensive to both its\r\nletter and its spirit. And I do not find in Control Council Act No. 10\r\nany inconsistency with the Charter. Of course, to reach all individual\r\nmembers will require numerous hearings. But they will involve only\r\nnarrow issues; many accused will have no answers to charges if they are\r\nclearly stated, and the proceedings should be expeditious and\r\nnontechnical.\r\n\r\nBut I think it is clear that before any person is punishable for\r\nmembership in a criminal organization, he is entitled to a hearing on\r\nthe facts of his case. The Charter does not authorize the national\r\nauthorities to punish membership without a hearing—it gives them only\r\nthe right to “bring individuals to trial.” That means what it says. A\r\ntrial means there is something to try.\r\n\r\nAs to trials of the individual members, the Charter denies only one of\r\nthe possible defenses of an accused: he may not relitigate the question\r\nwhether the organization itself was a criminal one. Nothing precludes\r\nhim from denying that his participation was voluntary and proving he\r\nacted under duress; he may prove that he was deceived or tricked into\r\nmembership; he may show that he had withdrawn; or he may prove that his\r\nname on the rolls is a case of mistaken identity.\r\n\r\nThe membership which the Charter and the Control Council Act make\r\ncriminal, of course, implies a genuine membership involving the volition\r\nof the member. The act of affiliation with the organization must have\r\nbeen intentional and voluntary. Legal compulsion or illegal duress,\r\nactual fraud or trick of which one is a victim, has never been thought\r\nto be the victim’s crime, and such an unjust result is not to be implied\r\nnow. The extent of the member’s knowledge of the criminal character of\r\nthe organization is, however, another matter. He may not have known on\r\nthe day he joined but may have remained a member after learning the\r\nfact. And he is chargeable not only with what he knew but with all of\r\nwhich he reasonably was put on notice.\r\n\r\nThere are safeguards to assure that this program will be carried out in\r\ngood faith. Prosecution under the declaration is discretionary, and if\r\nthere were purpose to punish without trial, it would have been already\r\ndone without waiting for the declaration. We think the Tribunal will\r\npresume that signatory powers which have voluntarily submitted to this\r\nprocess will carry it out faithfully.\r\n\r\nThe Control Council Act applies only to “categories of membership\r\ndeclared criminal.” This language recognizes a power in this Tribunal to\r\nlimit the effect of its declaration. I do not think, for reasons I will\r\nlater state, that this should be construed or availed of so as to try\r\nhere any issues as to sub-groups or sections or individuals, which can\r\nbe tried later. It should, I think, be construed to mean, not those\r\nlimitations which must be defined by detailed evidence, but limitations\r\nof principle such as those I have outlined as already implied. It does\r\nnot require this Tribunal to delve into evidence to condition its\r\njudgment, if it sees fit, to apply only to intentional, voluntary, and\r\nknowing membership. It does not supplant later trials but guides them.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that a plan, such as we have here, for the severance\r\nof general issues common to many cases from particular issues applicable\r\nonly to individual defendants and for the litigation of each type of\r\nissue in separate Tribunals specially adapted to their different tasks,\r\nis lacking in reasonableness or fair play. And while it presents unusual\r\nprocedural difficulties, I do not think it presents any insurmountable\r\nones.\r\n\r\n   C. _Criteria, Principles, and Precedents for Declaring Collective\r\n                             Criminality._\r\n\r\nThe substantive law which governs the inquiry into criminality of\r\norganizations is, in its large outline, old and well settled and fairly\r\nuniform in all systems of law. It is true that we are dealing with a\r\nprocedure easy to abuse and one often feared as an interference with\r\nliberty of assembly or as an imposition of “guilt by association.” It\r\nalso is true that proceedings against organizations are closely akin to\r\nthe conspiracy charge, which is the great dragnet of the law, rightly\r\nwatched by courts lest it be abused.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, however, that every form of government has considered it\r\nnecessary to treat some organizations as criminal. Not even the most\r\ntolerant of governments can permit the accumulation of power in private\r\norganizations to a point where it rivals, obstructs, or dominates the\r\ngovernment itself. To do so would be to grant designing men a liberty to\r\ndestroy liberty. It was the very complacency and tolerance as well as\r\nthe impotence of the Weimar Republic towards the growing organization of\r\nNazi power, which spelled the death of German freedom.\r\n\r\nProtection of the citizen’s liberty has required even free governments\r\nto enact laws making criminal those aggregations of power which threaten\r\nto impose their will on unwilling citizens. Every one of the nations\r\nsignatory to this Charter has laws making certain types of organizations\r\ncriminal. The Ku Klux Klan in the United States flourished at about the\r\nsame time as the Nazi movement in Germany. It appealed to the same\r\nhates, practiced the same extra-legal coercions, and likewise terrorized\r\nby weird nighttime ceremonials. Like the Nazi Party it was composed of a\r\ncore of fanatics, but enlisted support of some respectable persons who\r\nknew it was wrong, but thought it was winning. It eventually provoked a\r\nvariety of legislative acts directed against such organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the United States also has enacted legislation outlawing\r\ncertain organizations. A recent example is the Act of June 28, 1940 (c.\r\n439, Title I, Section 2, 54 Stat. 671, 18 USCA 10) which provides in\r\npart as follows:\r\n\r\n    “(a) It shall be unlawful for any person . . .\r\n\r\n        “(3) to organize or help to organize any society, group,\r\n        or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage\r\n        the overthrow or destruction of any government in the\r\n        United States by force or violence; or to be or become a\r\n        member of, or affiliate with, any such society, group,\r\n        or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof.”\r\n\r\nThere is much legislation by States of the American union creating\r\nanalogous offenses. An example is to be found in the Act of California\r\n(Statutes 1919, Chapter 188, p. 281) which, after defining “criminal\r\nsyndicalism,” provides:\r\n\r\n    “Section 2. Any person who . . . (4) organizes or assists in\r\n    organizing, or is or knowingly becomes a member of, any\r\n    organization, society, group or assemblage of persons organized\r\n    or assembled to teach or aid and abet criminal syndicalism . . .\r\n\r\n    “Is guilty of a felony and punishable by imprisonment.”\r\n\r\nPrecedents in English law for outlawing organizations and punishing\r\nmembership therein are old and consistent with the Charter. One of the\r\nfirst is the British India Act No. 30, enacted November 14, 1836.\r\nSection 1 provides:\r\n\r\n    “It is hereby enacted that whoever shall be proved to have\r\n    belonged either before or after the passing of this Act to any\r\n    gang of thugs either within or without the territories of the\r\n    East India Company shall be punished with imprisonment for life\r\n    with hard labour.”\r\n\r\nOther precedents in English legislation are the Unlawful Societies Act\r\nof 1799 (3 George III, Chapter 79); the Seditious Meetings Act of 1817\r\n(57 George III, Chapter 19); the Seditious Meetings Act of 1846 (9 and\r\n10 Victoria, Chapter 33); the Public Order Act of 1936 and Defense\r\nRegulation 18(b). The last, not without opposition, was intended to\r\nprotect the integrity of the British Government against the fifth-column\r\nactivities of this same Nazi conspiracy.\r\n\r\nSoviet Russia punishes as a crime the formation of and membership in a\r\ncriminal gang. Criminologists of the U.S.S.R. call this crime the “crime\r\nof banditry,” a term appropriate to the German organizations.\r\n\r\nFrench criminal law makes membership in subversive organizations a\r\ncrime. Membership of the criminal gang is a crime in itself. (Articles\r\n265-268, French Penal Code, “_Association de Malfaiteurs_”; Garaud,\r\n_Précis de Droit Criminel_, 1934 Edition Sirey, p. 1518 and seq. See\r\nalso Act of December 18, 1893.)\r\n\r\nFor German precedents, it is neither seemly nor necessary to go to the\r\nNazi regime. Under the Empire and the Weimar Republic, however, German\r\njurisprudence deserved respect and it presents both statutory and\r\njuridical examples of declarations of the criminality of organizations.\r\nAmong statutory examples are:\r\n\r\n1. The German Criminal Code enacted in 1871. Section 128 was aimed\r\nagainst secret associations and Section 129 was directed against\r\norganizations inimical to the State.\r\n\r\n2. The law of March 22, 1921 against paramilitary organizations.\r\n\r\n3. The law of July 21, 1922 against organizations aimed at overthrowing\r\nthe constitution of the Reich.\r\n\r\nSection 128 of the Criminal Code of 1871 is especially pertinent. It\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    “The participation in an organization the existence,\r\n    constitution, or purposes of which are to be kept secret from\r\n    the Government, or in which obedience to unknown superiors or\r\n    unconditional obedience to known superiors is pledged, is\r\n    punishable by imprisonment up to six months for the members and\r\n    from one month to one year for the founders and officers. Public\r\n    officials may be deprived of the right to hold public office for\r\n    a period of from one to five years.”\r\n\r\nUnder the Empire, various Polish national unions were the subject of\r\ncriminal prosecution. Under the Republic, judicial judgments in 1927-28\r\nheld criminal the entire Communist Party of Germany. In 1922 and 1928\r\njudgments ran against the political Leadership Corps of the Communist\r\nParty, which included all its so-called “body of functionaries,”\r\ncorresponding to the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party which we have\r\naccused. The judgment included every cashier, every employee, every\r\ndelivery boy and messenger, and every district leader. In 1930 a\r\njudgment of criminality against the “Union of Red Front Fighters” of the\r\nCommunist Party made no discrimination between leaders and ordinary\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nMost significant of all is the fact that on 30 May, 1924 the German\r\ncourts rendered judgment that the whole Nazi Party was a criminal\r\norganization. This decision referred not only to the Leadership Corps,\r\nwhich we are indicting here, but to all other members as well. The whole\r\nsubsequent rise to power of the Nazi Party was in the shadow of this\r\njudgment of illegality.\r\n\r\nThe German courts in dealing with criminal organizations proceeded on\r\nthe theory that all members were held together by a common plan in which\r\neach one participated even though at various levels. Moreover, the\r\nfundamental principles of responsibility of members as stated by the\r\nGerman Supreme Court are strikingly like the principles that govern our\r\nAnglo-American law of conspiracy. Among them were these:\r\n\r\n    1. “It is a matter of indifference whether all the members\r\n    pursued the forbidden aims. It is enough if a part exercised the\r\n    forbidden activity.” (R.G. VIa 97/22 of the 8.5.22.)\r\n\r\n    2. “It is a matter of indifference whether the members of the\r\n    group or association agree with the aims, tasks, means of\r\n    working and means of fighting.” (R.G. 58, 401 of the 24.10.24.)\r\n\r\n    3. “The real attitude of mind of the participants is a matter of\r\n    indifference. Even if they had the intention of not\r\n    participating in criminal efforts, or hindering them, this can\r\n    not eliminate their responsibility.” (R.G. 58, 401 of the\r\n    24.10.24.)\r\n\r\nOrganizations with criminal ends are everywhere regarded as in the\r\nnature of criminal conspiracies, and their criminality is judged by the\r\napplication of conspiracy principles. The reason why they are offensive\r\nto law-governed people has been succinctly stated as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The reason for finding criminal liability in case of a\r\n    combination to effect an unlawful end or to use unlawful means,\r\n    where none would exist, even though the act contemplated were\r\n    actually committed by an individual, is that a combination of\r\n    persons to commit a wrong, either as an end or as a means to an\r\n    end, is so much more dangerous, because of its increased power\r\n    to do wrong, because it is more difficult to guard against and\r\n    prevent the evil designs of a group of persons than of a single\r\n    person, and because of the terror which fear of such a\r\n    combination tends to create in the minds of people.” (_Miller on\r\n    Criminal Law_, 1932, p. 110.)\r\n\r\nThe Charter, in Article 6, provides that “Leaders, organizers,\r\ninstigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or\r\nexecution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing\r\ncrimes are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in\r\nexecution of such plan.” The individual defendants are arraigned at your\r\nbar on this charge which, if proved, makes them responsible for the acts\r\nof others in execution of the common plan.\r\n\r\nThe Charter did not define responsibility for the acts of others in\r\nterms of “conspiracy” alone. The crimes were defined in non-technical\r\nbut inclusive terms, and embraced formulating and executing a “common\r\nplan” as well as participating in a “conspiracy.” It was feared that to\r\ndo otherwise might import into the proceedings technical requirements\r\nand limitations which have grown up around the term “conspiracy.” There\r\nare some divergences between the Anglo-American concept of conspiracy\r\nand that of either Soviet, French, or German jurisprudence. It was\r\ndesired that concrete cases be guided by the broader considerations\r\ninherent in the nature of the social problem, rather than controlled by\r\nrefinements of any local law.\r\n\r\nNow, except for procedural difficulties arising from their multitude,\r\nthere is no reason why every member of any Nazi organization accused\r\nhere could not have been indicted and convicted as a part of the\r\nconspiracy under Article 6 even if the Charter had never mentioned\r\norganizations at all. Voluntary affiliation constituted a definite act\r\nof adherence to some common plan and purpose. These did not pretend to\r\nbe merely social or cultural groups; admittedly they were united for\r\naction. In the case of several of the Nazi organizations, the fact of\r\nconfederation was evidenced by formal induction into membership, the\r\ntaking of an oath, the wearing of a distinctive uniform, the submission\r\nto a discipline. That all members of each Nazi organization did combine\r\nunder a common plan to achieve some end by combined efforts is\r\nabundantly established.\r\n\r\nThe criteria for determining the collective guilt of those who thus\r\nadhered to a common plan obviously are those which would test the\r\nlegality of any combination or conspiracy. Did it contemplate illegal\r\nmethods or aim at illegal ends? If so, the liability of each member of\r\none of these Nazi organizations for the acts of every other member is\r\nnot essentially different from the liability for conspiracy enforced in\r\nCourts of the United States against business men who combine in\r\nviolation of the anti-trust laws, or of other defendants accused under\r\nnarcotic drugs laws, sedition acts, or other federal penal enactments.\r\n\r\nAmong the principles every day enforced in Courts of Great Britain and\r\nthe United States in dealing with conspiracy are these:\r\n\r\n1. No meeting or formal agreement is necessary. It is sufficient,\r\nalthough one performs one part and other persons other parts, if there\r\nbe concert of action, and working together understandingly with a common\r\ndesign to accomplish a common purpose.\r\n\r\n2. One may be liable even though he may not have known who his\r\nfellow-conspirators were, or just what part they were to take, or what\r\nacts they committed, and though he did not take personal part in them or\r\nwas absent when criminal acts occurred.\r\n\r\n3. There may be liability for acts of fellow-conspirators although the\r\nparticular acts were not intended or anticipated, if they were done in\r\nexecution of the common plan.\r\n\r\n4. It is not necessary to liability that one be a member of a conspiracy\r\nat the same time as other actors, or at the time of criminal acts. When\r\none becomes a party to it, he adopts and ratifies what has gone before\r\nand remains responsible until he abandons the conspiracy with notice to\r\nhis fellow-conspirators.\r\n\r\nOf course, members of criminal organizations or conspiracies who\r\npersonally commit crimes are individually punishable for those crimes\r\nexactly as are those who commit the same offenses without organizational\r\nbacking. But the very gist of the crime of conspiracy or membership in a\r\ncriminal association is liability for acts one did not personally commit\r\nbut which his acts facilitated or abetted. The crime is to combine with\r\nothers and to participate in the unlawful common effort, however\r\ninnocent the personal acts of the participant when considered by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe very innocent act of mailing a letter is enough to implicate one in\r\na conspiracy if the purpose of the letter is to advance a criminal plan.\r\nThere are countless examples of this doctrine in Anglo-American\r\njurisprudence.\r\n\r\nThe sweep of the law of conspiracy is an important consideration in\r\ndetermining the criteria of guilt for organizations. Certainly the\r\nvicarious liability imposed in consequence of voluntary membership,\r\nformalized by oath, dedicated to a common organizational purpose and\r\nsubmission to a discipline and chain of command, can not be less than\r\nthat which follows from informal cooperation with a nebulous group to a\r\ncommon end as is sufficient in conspiracy. This meets the suggestion\r\nthat the prosecution is required to prove every member, or every part,\r\nfraction, or division of the membership to be guilty of criminal acts.\r\nThe suggestion ignores the conspiratorial nature of the charge. Such an\r\ninterpretation also would reduce the Charter to an unworkable absurdity.\r\nTo concentrate in one International Tribunal inquiries requiring such\r\ndetailed evidence as to each member would set a task not possible of\r\ncompletion within the lives of living men.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to toss about such a plausible but superficial cliché as,\r\n“One should be convicted for his activities, not for his membership.”\r\nBut this ignores the fact that membership in Nazi bodies was itself an\r\nactivity. It was not something passed out to a passive citizen like a\r\nhandbill. Even a nominal membership may aid and abet a movement greatly.\r\nDoes anyone believe that Hjalmar Schacht sitting in the front row of the\r\nNazi Party Congress of 1935, wearing the insignia of the Party, was\r\nincluded in the Nazi propaganda films merely for artistic effect? This\r\ngreat banker’s mere loan of his name to this shady enterprise gave it a\r\nlift and a respectability in the eyes of every hesitating German. There\r\nmay be instances in which membership did not aid and abet the\r\norganizational ends and means, but individual situations of that kind\r\nare for appraisal in the later hearings and not by this Tribunal. By and\r\nlarge, the use of organization affiliation is a quick and simple, but at\r\nthe same time fairly accurate outline of the contours of a conspiracy to\r\ndo what the organization actually did. It is the only one workable at\r\nthis stage of the trial. It can work no injustice because before any\r\nindividual can be punished, he can submit the facts of his own case to\r\nfurther and more detailed judicial scrutiny.\r\n\r\nWhile the Charter does not so provide, we think that on ordinary legal\r\nprinciples the burden of proof to justify a declaration of criminality\r\nis upon the prosecution. It is discharged, we think, when we establish\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n1. The organization or group in question must be some aggregation of\r\npersons associated in some identifiable relationship with a collective\r\ngeneral purpose.\r\n\r\n2. While the Charter does not so declare, we think it implied that\r\nmembership in such an organization must be generally voluntary. That\r\ndoes not require proof that every member was a volunteer. Nor does it\r\nmean that an organization is not to be considered voluntary if the\r\ndefense proves that some minor fraction or small percentage of its\r\nmembership was compelled to join. The test is a common-sense one: Was\r\nthe organization on the whole one which persons were free to join or to\r\nstay out of? Membership is not made involuntary by the fact that it was\r\ngood business or good politics to identify one’s self with the movement.\r\nAny compulsion must be of the kind which the law normally recognizes,\r\nand threats of political or economic retaliation would be of no\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n3. The aims of the organization must be criminal in that it was\r\ndesigning to perform acts denounced as crimes in Article 6 of the\r\nCharter. No other act would authorize conviction of an individual and\r\ntherefore no other act would authorize conviction of an organization in\r\nconnection with the conviction of the individual.\r\n\r\n4. The criminal aims or methods of the organization must have been of\r\nsuch character that its membership in general may properly be charged\r\nwith knowledge of them. This again is not specifically required by the\r\nCharter. Of course, it is not incumbent on the prosecution to establish\r\nthe individual knowledge of every member of the organization or to rebut\r\nthe possibility that some may have joined in ignorance of its true\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n5. Some individual defendant must have been a member of the organization\r\nand must be convicted of some act on the basis of which the organization\r\nis declared to be criminal.\r\n\r\n                  D. _Definition of Issues for Trial._\r\n\r\nThe progress of this trial will be expedited by clear definition of the\r\nissues to be tried. I have indicated what we consider to be the proper\r\ncriteria of guilt. There are also subjects which we think are not\r\nrelevant before this Tribunal, some of which are mentioned in the\r\nspecific questions asked by the Tribunal.\r\n\r\nOnly a single ultimate issue is before this Tribunal for decision. That\r\nis whether accused organizations properly may be characterized as\r\ncriminal ones or as innocent ones. Nothing is relevant here that does\r\nnot bear on a question that would be common to the case of every member.\r\nAny matter which would be exculpating for some members but not for all\r\nis irrelevant here.\r\n\r\nWe think it is not relevant to this proceeding at this stage that one or\r\nmany members were conscripted if in general the membership was\r\nvoluntary. It may be conceded that conscription is a good defense for an\r\nindividual charged with membership in a criminal organization, but an\r\norganization can have criminal purposes and commit criminal acts even if\r\na portion of its membership consists of persons who were compelled to\r\njoin it. The issue of conscription is not pertinent to this proceeding\r\nbut it is pertinent to the trials of individuals for membership in\r\norganizations declared criminal by this Tribunal.\r\n\r\nWe also think it is not relevant to this proceeding that one or more\r\nmembers of the named organizations were ignorant of its criminal\r\npurposes or methods if its purposes or methods were open and notorious.\r\nAn organization may have criminal purposes and commit criminal acts\r\nalthough one or many of its members were without personal knowledge\r\nthereof. If a person joined what he thought was a social club but what\r\nin fact was a gang of cutthroats and murderers, his lack of knowledge\r\nwould not exonerate the gang considered as a group, although it might\r\npossibly be a factor in extenuation of a charge of criminality brought\r\nagainst him for mere membership in the organization. Even then the test\r\nwould be not what the man knew, but what, as a person of common\r\nunderstanding, he should have known.\r\n\r\nIt is not relevant to this proceeding that one or more members of the\r\nnamed organizations were themselves innocent of unlawful acts. This\r\nproposition is basic to the entire theory of the declaration of\r\norganizational criminality. The purpose of declaring criminality of\r\norganizations, as in every conspiracy charge, is punishment for aiding\r\ncrimes, although the precise perpetrators may never be found or\r\nidentified. We know that the Gestapo and SS, as organizations, were\r\ngiven principal responsibility for the extermination of the Jewish\r\npeople in Europe—but beyond a few isolated instances, we can never\r\nestablish which members of the Gestapo or SS actually carried out the\r\nmurders. Any member guilty of direct participation in such crimes can be\r\ntried on the charge of having committed specific crimes in addition to\r\nthe general charge of membership in a criminal organization. Therefore,\r\nit is wholly immaterial that one or more members of the organizations\r\nwere themselves allegedly innocent of specific wrongdoing. The purpose\r\nof this proceeding is not to reach instances of individual criminal\r\nconduct, even in subsequent trials and, therefore, such considerations\r\nare irrelevant here.\r\n\r\nAnother question raised by the Tribunal is the period of time during\r\nwhich the groups or organizations named in the Indictment are claimed by\r\nthe Prosecution to have been criminal. The Prosecution believes that\r\neach organization should be declared criminal during the period referred\r\nto in the Indictment. We do not contend that the Tribunal is without\r\npower to condition its declaration so as to cover a lesser period of\r\ntime than that set forth in the Indictment. The Prosecution feels,\r\nhowever, that there is in the record at this time adequate evidence to\r\nsupport the charge of criminality with respect to each of the named\r\norganizations during the full period of time set forth in the\r\nIndictment.\r\n\r\nAnother question raised by the Tribunal is whether any classes of\r\npersons included within the accused groups or organizations should be\r\nexcluded from the declaration of criminality. It is, of course,\r\nnecessary that the Tribunal relate its declaration to some identifiable\r\ngroup or organization. The Tribunal, however, is not expected or\r\nrequired to be bound by formalities of organization. In framing the\r\nCharter, the use was deliberately avoided of terms or concepts which\r\nwould involve this trial in legal technicalities about “juristic\r\npersons” or “entities.” Systems of jurisprudence are not uniform in the\r\nrefinements of these fictions. The concept of the Charter, therefore, is\r\na nontechnical one. “Group” or “organization” should be given no\r\nartificial or sophistical meaning. The word “group” was used in the\r\nCharter as a broader term, implying a looser and less formal structure\r\nor relationship than is implied in the “organization.” The terms mean in\r\nthe context of the Charter what they mean in the ordinary speech of\r\npeople. The test to identify a group or organization is, we submit, a\r\nnatural and common-sense one.\r\n\r\nIt is important to bear in mind that while the Tribunal no doubt has\r\npower to make its own definition of the groups it will declare criminal,\r\nthe precise composition and membership of groups and organizations is\r\nnot an issue for trial here. There is no Charter requirement and no\r\npractical need for the Tribunal to define a group or organization with\r\nsuch particularity that its precise composition or membership is thereby\r\ndetermined. The creation of a mechanism for later trial of such issues\r\nwas a recognition that the declaration of this Tribunal is not decisive\r\nof such questions and is likely to be so general as to comprehend\r\npersons who on more detailed inquiry will prove to be outside of it. An\r\neffort by this Tribunal to try questions of exculpation of individuals,\r\nfew or many, would unduly protract the trial, transgress the limitation\r\nof the Charter, and quite likely do some mischief by attempting to\r\nadjudicate precise boundaries on evidence which is not directed to that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution stands upon the language of the Indictment and contends\r\nthat each group or organization should be declared criminal as an entity\r\nand that no inquiry should be entered upon and no evidence entertained\r\nas to the exculpation of any class or classes of persons within such\r\ndescriptions. Practical reasons of conserving the Tribunal’s time\r\ncombine with practical considerations for the defendants. A single trial\r\nheld in one city to deal with questions of excluding thousands of\r\ndefendants living all over Germany could not be expected to do justice\r\nto each member unless it was expected to endure indefinitely. Provision\r\nfor later, local trial of individual relationships protects the rights\r\nof members better than can possibly be done in proceedings before this\r\nTribunal.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Gestapo, the United States consents to exclude\r\npersons employed in purely clerical, stenographic, janitorial or similar\r\nunofficial routine tasks. As to the Nazi Leadership Corps we abide by\r\nthe position taken at the time of submission of the evidence, that the\r\nfollowing should be included: the Fuehrer, the _Reichsleitung_ (i.e.,\r\nthe _Reichsleiters_, main departments and officeholders), the\r\n_Gauleiters_ and their staff officers, the _Kreisleiters_ and their\r\nstaff officers, the _Ortsgruppenleiters_, the _Zellenleiters_, and the\r\n_Blockleiters_, but not members of the staff of the last three\r\nofficials. As regards the SA, it is considered advisable that the\r\nDeclaration expressly exclude (1) wearers of the SA Sports Badge; (2) SA\r\ncontrolled Home Guard Units (_SA Wehrmannschaften_) which were not\r\nstrictly part of the SA; (3) The _Marchabteilungen_ of the N.S.K.O.V.\r\n(National Socialist League for Disabled Veterans); and (4) the SA\r\nReserve, so as to include only the active part of the organization, and\r\nthat members who were never in any part of that organization other than\r\nthe Reserve should be excluded.\r\n\r\nThe Prosecution does not feel that there is evidence of the severability\r\nof any class or classes of persons within the organizations accused\r\nwhich would justify any further concessions and feels that no other part\r\nof the named groups should be excluded. In this connection, we would\r\nagain stress the principles of conspiracy. The fact that a section of an\r\norganization itself committed no criminal act, or may have been occupied\r\nin technical or administrative functions, does not relieve that section\r\nof criminal responsibility if its activities contributed to the\r\naccomplishment of the criminal enterprise.\r\n\r\n                E. _Further Steps Before This Tribunal._\r\n\r\nOver 45,000 persons have joined in communications to this Tribunal\r\nasking to be heard in connection with the accusations against\r\norganizations. The volume of these applications has caused apprehension\r\nas to further proceedings. No doubt there are difficulties yet to be\r\novercome, but my study indicates that the difficulties are greatly\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal is vested with wide discretion as to whether it will\r\nentertain an application to be heard. The Prosecution would be anxious,\r\nof course, to have every application granted that is necessary, not only\r\nto do justice but to avoid the appearance of doing anything less than\r\njustice. And we do not consider that expediting this trial is so\r\nimportant as affording a fair opportunity to present all really\r\npertinent facts.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the conditions which have brought about this flood of\r\napplications indicates that their significance is not proportionate to\r\ntheir numbers. The Tribunal sent out 200,000 printed notices of the\r\nright to appear before it and defend. They were sent to Allied prisoner\r\nof war and internment camps. The notice was published in all German\r\nlanguage papers and was repeatedly broadcast over the radio. The 45,000\r\npersons who responded with applications to be heard came principally\r\nfrom about 15 prisoner of war and internment camps in British or United\r\nStates control. Those received included an approximate 12,000 from\r\nDachau, 10,000 from Langwasser, 7,500 from Auerbach, 4,000 from\r\nStaumuehle, 2,500 from Garmisch, and several hundred from each of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWe undertook investigation of these applications from Auerbach camp as\r\nprobably typical of all. The camp is for prisoners of war, predominantly\r\nSS members, and its prisoners number 16,964 enlisted men and 923\r\nofficers. The notice of the International Tribunal was posted in each\r\nbarracks and was read to all inmates. The applications to the Tribunal\r\nwere forwarded without censorship. Applications to defend were made by\r\n7,509 SS members.\r\n\r\nInvestigation indicates that these were filed in direct response to the\r\nnotice and that no action was directed or inspired from any other source\r\nwithin the camp. All who were interrogated professed no knowledge of any\r\nSS crimes or of SS criminal purpose, but expressed interest only in\r\ntheir individual fate. Our investigators report no indication that the\r\nSS members had additional evidence or information to submit on the\r\ngeneral question of the criminality of the SS as an organization. They\r\nseemed to think it necessary to make the application to this Tribunal in\r\norder to protect themselves.\r\n\r\nExamination of the applications made to the Tribunal indicates that most\r\nmembers do not profess to have evidence on the general issue triable\r\nhere. They assert that the writer has neither committed, witnessed, nor\r\nknown of the crimes charged against the organization. On a proper\r\ndefinition of the issues such an application is insufficient on its\r\nface.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the Tribunal’s notice to which these\r\napplications respond will indicate that the notice contains no word\r\nwhich would inform a member, particularly if a layman, of the narrowness\r\nof the issues here, or of the later opportunity of each member, if and\r\nwhen prosecuted, to present personal defenses. On the other hand, I\r\nthink the notice creates the impression that every member may be\r\nconvicted and punished by this Tribunal and that his only chance to be\r\nheard is here.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts we suggest consideration of the following program\r\nfor completion of this trial as to organizations.\r\n\r\n1. That the Tribunal formulate and express in an order the scope of the\r\nissues and the limitations on the issues to be heard by it.\r\n\r\n2. That a notice adequately informing members as to the limitation on\r\nissues and the opportunity for later, individual trial, be sent to all\r\napplicants and published as was the original notice.\r\n\r\n3. That a panel of masters be appointed as authorized in Article 17(e)\r\nof the Charter to examine applications and report those insufficient on\r\ntheir own statements, and to go to the camps and supervise the taking of\r\nany relevant evidence. Defense counsel and prosecution representatives\r\nshould of course attend and be heard before the masters. The masters\r\nshould reduce any evidence to deposition form and report the whole to\r\nthe Tribunal to be introduced as a part of its record.\r\n\r\n4. The representative principle may also be employed to simplify this\r\ntask. Members of particular organizations in particular camps might well\r\nbe invited to choose one or more to represent them in presenting\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIt may not be untimely to remind the Tribunal and defense counsel that\r\nthe prosecution has omitted from evidence many relevant documents which\r\nshow repetition of crimes by these organizations in order to save time\r\nby avoiding cumulative evidence. It is not too much to expect that\r\ncumulative evidence of a negative character will likewise be limited.\r\n\r\nSome concern has been expressed as to the number of persons who might be\r\naffected by the declarations of criminality we have asked. Some people\r\nseem more susceptible to the shock of a million punishments than to the\r\nshock of 5 million murders. At most the number of punishments will never\r\ncatch up with the number of crimes. However, it is impossible to state\r\neven with approximate accuracy the number of persons who might be\r\naffected. Figures from German sources seriously exaggerate the number,\r\nbecause they do not take account of heavy casualties in the latter part\r\nof the war, and make no allowances for duplication of membership, which\r\nwas large. For example, the evidence is to the effect that 75 percent of\r\nthe Gestapo men also were members of the SS. We know that the United\r\nStates forces have in detention a roughly estimated 130,000 persons who\r\nappear to be members of accused organizations. I have no figures from\r\nother Allied forces. But how many of these actually would be prosecuted,\r\ninstead of being dealt with under the denazification program, no one can\r\nforetell. Whatever the number, of one thing we may be sure: it is so\r\nlarge that a thorough inquiry by this Tribunal, into each case, would\r\nprolong its session beyond endurance. All questions as to whether\r\nindividuals or sub-groups of accused organizations should be excepted\r\nfrom the Declaration of Criminality, should be left for local courts,\r\nlocated near the home of the accused and near sources of evidence. These\r\ncourts can work in one or at most in two languages, instead of four, and\r\ncan hear evidence which both parties direct to the specific issues.\r\n\r\n                            F. _Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThis is not the time to review the evidence against particular\r\norganizations which, we take it, should be reserved for summation after\r\nall the evidence is presented. But it is timely to say that the\r\nselection of the six organizations named in the Indictment was not a\r\nmatter of chance. The chief reasons they were chosen are these:\r\ncollectively they were the ultimate repositories of all power in the\r\nNazi regime; they were not only the most powerful, but the most vicious\r\norganizations in the regime; and they were organizations in which\r\nmembership was generally voluntary.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi Leadership Corps consisted of the directors and principal\r\nexecutors of the Nazi Party, which was the force lying behind and\r\ndominating the whole German state. The Reichs Cabinet was the facade\r\nthrough which the Nazi Party translated its will into legislative,\r\nadministrative, and executive acts. The two pillars on which the\r\nsecurity of the regime rested were the armed forces, directed and\r\ncontrolled by the General Staff and High Command, and the police\r\nforces—the Gestapo, the SA, the SD, and the SS. These organizations\r\nexemplify all the evil forces of the Nazi regime.\r\n\r\nThese organizations were also selected because, while representative,\r\nthey were not so large or extensive as to make it probable that\r\ninnocent, passive, or indifferent Germans might be caught up in the same\r\nnet with the guilty. State officialdom is represented, but not all\r\nadministrative officials or department heads or civil servants; only the\r\n_Reichsregierung_, the very heart of Nazidom within the Government, is\r\nnamed. The armed forces are accused, but not the average soldier or\r\nofficer, no matter how high ranking. Only the top policy-makers—the\r\nGeneral Staff and High Command—are named. The police forces are\r\naccused, but not every policeman: not the ordinary police, which\r\nperformed only normal police functions. Only the most terroristic and\r\nrepressive police elements—the Gestapo and SD—are named. The Nazi\r\nParty is accused, but not every Nazi voter, not even every member; only\r\nthe leaders, the _Politische Leiter_. (_See Chart No. 14._) And not even\r\nevery Party official or worker is included; only “the bearers of\r\nsovereignty,” in the metaphysical jargon of the Party, who were the\r\nactual commanding officers and their staff officers on the highest\r\nlevels, are accused. The “formations” or strong arms of the Party are\r\naccused, but not every one of the seven formations, nor any of the\r\ntwenty or more supervised or affiliated party groups. Nazi organizations\r\nin which membership was compulsory, either legally or in practice (like\r\nthe Hitler Youth and the _Deutsche Studentschaft_); Nazi professional\r\norganizations (like the Civil Servants Organization, the National\r\nSocialist Teachers Organization, and the National Socialist Lawyers\r\nOrganization); Nazi organizations having some legitimate purpose (like\r\nthe welfare organizations), have not been indicted. Only two formations\r\nare named, the SA and the SS, the oldest of the Nazi organizations,\r\ngroups which had no purpose other than carrying out the Nazi schemes and\r\nwhich actively participated in every crime denounced in the Charter.\r\n\r\nIn administering preventive justice with a view to forestalling\r\nrepetition of these crimes against peace, crimes against humanity, and\r\nwar crimes, it would be a greater catastrophe to acquit these\r\norganizations than it would be to acquit the entire 22 individual\r\ndefendants in the box. These defendants’ power for harm is spent. That\r\nof these organizations goes on. If they are exonerated here, the German\r\npeople will infer that they did no wrong and will easily be regimented\r\nin reconstituted organizations under new names behind the same program.\r\n\r\nIn administering retributive justice it would be possible to exonerate\r\nthese organizations only by concluding that no crimes have been\r\ncommitted by the Nazi regime. Their sponsorship of every Nazi purpose\r\nand their confederation to execute every measure to attain those ends is\r\nbeyond denial. A failure to condemn these organizations under the terms\r\nof the Charter can only mean that such Nazi ends and means cannot be\r\nconsidered criminal, and that the Charter of the Tribunal is considered\r\na nullity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   2. THE NAZI PARTY LEADERSHIP CORPS\r\n\r\nThe Nazi Party Leadership Corps—it is proposed to demonstrate—was\r\nresponsible for planning, directing, and supervising the criminal\r\nmeasures carried into execution by the Nazi Party, which was the central\r\ncore of the common plan or conspiracy charged in Count I of the\r\nIndictment. Moreover, it will be shown, the members of the Leadership\r\nCorps themselves actively participated in the commission of illegal\r\nmeasures in aid of the conspiracy. In the light of the evidence to be\r\ndiscussed, the Leadership Corps may be fairly described as the brain,\r\nthe backbone, and the directing arms of the Nazi Party. Its\r\nresponsibilities are more massive and comprehensive than those of the\r\narmy of followers who blindly and faithfully did its bidding.\r\n\r\n    A. _Composition, Functions, Responsibilities, and Powers of the\r\n                           Leadership Corps._\r\n\r\nIn considering the composition and organizational structure of the\r\nLeadership Corps, preliminary reference is made to the organization\r\nchart of the Nazi Party (_Chart Number 1_) as well as a chart of the\r\nLeadership Corps of the Nazi Party appearing at page 9 of a magazine\r\npublished by the Chief Education Office of the Nazi Party entitled “_Das\r\nGesicht der Partei_” (The Face of the Party). These charts and the\r\nevidence to follow show that the Leadership Corps constituted the sum of\r\nthe officials of the Nazi Party: it included the Fuehrer; the\r\n_Reichsleiter_ and Reich office holders; the five categories of leaders\r\nwho were area commanders (called _Hoheitstraeger_, or “bearers of\r\nsovereignty”) ranging all the way from the 40-odd _Gauleiter_ in charge\r\nof large districts down through the intermediate political leaders to\r\nthe _Blockleiter_, charged with looking after 40 to 60 households; and\r\nwhat may best be described as the Staff Officers attached to each of the\r\n5 levels of _Hoheitstraeger_.\r\n\r\nOrganized upon a hierarchical basis, forming a pyramidal structure, the\r\nprincipal Political Leaders on a scale of descending authority were:\r\n\r\n    _Fuehrer_\r\n\r\n    _Reichsleiter_ (Reich Leaders) and _Main Office_ and _Office\r\n    Holders_\r\n\r\n    _Gauleiter_ (District Leaders) and Staff Officers\r\n\r\n    _Kreisleiter_ (County Leaders) and Staff Officers\r\n\r\n    _Ortsgruppenleiter_ (Local Chapter Leaders) and Staff Officers\r\n\r\n    _Zellenleiter_ (Cell Leaders) and Staff Officers\r\n\r\n    _Blockleiter_ (Block Leaders) and Staff Officers\r\n\r\nA large part of this and other evidence relating to the composition of\r\nthe Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party is to be found in the 1943\r\nedition of the _Organization Book of the NSDAP_, an authoritative primer\r\non Nazi organizations which was edited by the defendant, Reich\r\nOrganization Leader of the NSDAP, Dr. Robert Ley.\r\n\r\nThe _Reichsleitung_ of the Leadership Corps consisted of the\r\n_Reichsleiter_ or Reich Leaders of the Party, the _Hauptaemter_ (Main\r\nOffices) and the _Aemter_ (or Offices). The _Reichsleiter_ of the Party\r\nwere, next to Hitler, the highest officeholders in the Party hierarchy.\r\nAll the _Reichsleiter_ and Main Office and officeholders within the\r\n_Reichsleitung_ were appointed by Hitler and were directly responsible\r\nto him. _The Organization Book of the NSDAP_ puts it as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer appoints the following Political Directors:\r\n    “_Reichsleiter_ and all Political Directors, to include the\r\n    Directors of the Womens Leagues within the Reich Directorate or\r\n    _Reichsleitung_.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe significant fact is that through the _Reichsleitung_ perfect\r\ncoordination of Party and State machinery was guaranteed. The Party\r\nManual describes it this way:\r\n\r\n    “In the _Reichsleitung_ the arteries of the organization of the\r\n    German people and of the German State merge.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate that the _Reichsleiter_ of the Leadership Corps included\r\nthe most powerful coalition of political overlords in Nazi Germany, it\r\nis necessary only to mention their names. The list of _Reichsleiter_\r\nincludes the following defendants on trial: Rosenberg, Von Schirach,\r\nFrick, Bormann, and Ley.\r\n\r\nThe evidence to be presented will show that Rosenberg was the leader of\r\nan organization named for him, the _Einsatzstab_ Rosenberg, which\r\ncarried out a vast program of looting and plunder of art treasures\r\nthroughout occupied Europe. The evidence will further show that, as\r\nRepresentative of the Fuehrer for the Supervision of Nazi Ideology and\r\nSchooling, Rosenberg participated in an aggressive campaign to undermine\r\nthe Christian churches and to supersede Christianity by a German\r\nNational Church founded upon a combination of irrationality,\r\npseudo-scientific theories, mysticism, and the cult of the racial state.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown that the late Defendant Ley, acting as the agent of\r\nHitler and the Leadership Corps, directed the Nazi assault upon the\r\nindependent labor unions of Germany and before destroying himself first\r\ndestroyed the free and independent labor movement; and that he replaced\r\nit by a Nazi organization, the German Labor front or DAF, which he\r\nemployed as a means of exploiting the German labor force in the\r\ninterests of the conspiracy and to instill Nazi ideology among the ranks\r\nof the German workers.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown that Frick participated in the enactment of many laws\r\nwhich were designed to promote the conspiracy in its several phases.\r\nFrick shares responsibility for the grave injury done by the officials\r\nof the Leadership Corps to the concept of the rule of law by virtue of\r\nhis efforts to give the color of law and formal legality to a large\r\nvolume of Nazi legislation violative of the rights of humanity, such as\r\nthe legislation designed to stigmatize and eliminate the Jewish people\r\nof Germany and German-occupied Europe. As chief of the Party\r\nChancellery, immediately under Hitler, Bormann was an extremely\r\nimportant force in directing the activities of the Leadership Corps. As\r\nwill be shown, a decree of 16 January 1942 provided that the\r\nparticipation of the Party in all important legislation, governmental\r\nappointments, and promotions had to be undertaken exclusively by\r\nBormann. He took part in the preparation of all laws and decrees issued\r\nby the Reich authorities and gave his assent to those of the subordinate\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nThe list of _Reichsleiter_ of the NSDAP set forth in the _National\r\nSocialist Yearbook_ (1943 Edition) shows that the following 15\r\n_Reichsleiter_ were in office in 1943 (_2473-PS_):\r\n\r\n                    “_THE REICHSLEITERS OF THE NSDAP_\r\n   “Max Amann                _Reichsleiter_ for the Press.\r\n   “Martin Bormann           Chief of the Party Chancery.\r\n   “Phillipp Bouhler         Chief of the Chancery of the Fuehrer of\r\n                             the NSDAP.

The _Reichsleiter_ were further\r\ncharged with insuring that Party policies were being executed in all the\r\nsubordinate areas of the Reich. The _Reichsleiter_ were also responsible\r\nfor insuring a continual flow of new leadership into the Party. With\r\nrespect to the function and responsibilities of the _Reichsleiter_, the\r\nOrganization Book of the NSDAP states as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The NSDAP represents the political conception, the political\r\n    conscience, and the political will of the German nation.\r\n    Political conception, political conscience, and political will\r\n    are embodied in the person of the Fuehrer. Based on his\r\n    directives and in accordance with the program of the NSDAP the\r\n    organs of the Reich Directorate directionally determine the\r\n    political aims of the German people. It is in the Reich\r\n    Directorate that the arteries of the organization of the German\r\n    people and the State merge. It is the task of the separate\r\n    organs of the Reich Directorate to maintain as close a contact\r\n    as possible with the life of the nation through their\r\n    sub-offices in the Gau * * *\r\n\r\n    “The structure of the Reich Directorate is thus that the channel\r\n    from the lowest Party office upwards shows the most minute\r\n    weaknesses and changes in the mood of the people * * *\r\n\r\n    “Another essential task of the Reich Directorate is to assure a\r\n    good selection of leaders. It is the duty of the Reich\r\n    Directorate to see that there is leadership in all phases of\r\n    life, a leadership which is firmly tied to National Socialist\r\n    ideology and which promotes its dissemination with all its\r\n    energy * * *\r\n\r\n    “* * * It is the supreme task of the Reich Organization Leader\r\n    to preserve the Party as a well-sharpened sword for the\r\n    Fuehrer.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe domination of the German Government by the top members of the\r\nLeadership Corps was facilitated by a circular decree of the Reich\r\nMinister of Justice, dated 17 February 1934, which established equal\r\nrank for the offices within the _Reichsleitung_ of the Leadership Corps\r\nand the Reich offices of the government. In this decree it was expressly\r\nprovided that\r\n\r\n    “the supreme offices of the _Reichsleitung_ are equal in rank to\r\n    the supreme Reich Government authorities.”\r\n\r\nThe Party Manual termed the control exercised over the machinery of\r\ngovernment by the Leadership Corps “the permeation of the State\r\napparatus with the political will of the Party.”\r\n\r\nDomination by the Leadership Corps over the German State and Government\r\nwas facilitated by uniting in the same Nazi chieftains both high office\r\nwithin the _Reichsleitung_ and corresponding offices within the\r\napparatus of government. For example, Goebbels was a _Reichsleiter_ in\r\ncharge of Party propaganda, but he was also a cabinet minister in charge\r\nof Propaganda and Public Enlightenment. Himmler held office within the\r\n_Reichsleitung_ as head of the Main Office for “Volkdom” and as\r\nReichsfuehrer of the SS. At the same time, Himmler held the governmental\r\nposition of Reich Commission for the Consolidation of Germandom and was\r\nthe governmental head of the German police system (_Chart Number 1_).\r\nThis personal union of high office in the Leadership Corps and high\r\ngovernmental position in the same Nazi Leaders greatly assisted the plan\r\nof the Leadership Corps to dominate and control the German State and\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the _Reichsleiter_, the _Reichsleitung_ (Reich Party\r\nDirectorate) included about eleven _Hauptamter_, or Main Offices, and\r\nabout four _Amter_, or Offices. The _Hauptamter_ of the Party included\r\nsuch main organizations as those for personnel, training, technology\r\n(headed by Speer), “Volkdom,” (headed by Himmler), civil servants,\r\ncommunal policy, and the like. The _Amter_, or offices, of the Party\r\nwithin the _Reichsleitung_ included the Office for Foreign Policy under\r\nRosenberg which actively participated in plans for aggression against\r\nNorway, the Office for Colonial Policy, the Office for Geneology, and\r\nthe Office for Racial Policy.\r\n\r\nCertain of the main offices and offices within the _Reichsleitung_\r\nappeared again within the _Gauleitung_, or Gau Party Directorate, and\r\n_Kreisleitung_, or County Party Directorate. Thus, the _Reichsleiter_\r\nand main office and office holders within the _Reichsleitung_ exercised,\r\nthrough functional channels running through subordinate offices on lower\r\nregional levels, total control over the various sectors of the national\r\nlife of Germany.\r\n\r\n(1) _Gauleiter._ For Party purposes Germany was divided into major\r\nadministrative regions, _Gaue_, which, in turn, were subdivided into\r\n_Kreise_ (counties), _Ortsgruppen_ (local chapters), _Zellen_ (cells),\r\nand _Blocke_ (blocks). Each _Gau_ was in charge of a _Gauleiter_ who was\r\nthe political leader of the _Gau_ or district. Each _Gauleiter_ was\r\nappointed by and was responsible to Hitler himself. The _Organization\r\nBook of the NSDAP_ states:\r\n\r\n    “The _Gau_ represents the concentration of a number of Party\r\n    counties, or _Kreise_. The _Gauleiter_ is directly subordinate\r\n    to the Fuehrer. He is appointed by the Fuehrer. The _Gauleiter_\r\n    bears overall responsibility to the Fuehrer for the sector of\r\n    sovereignty entrusted to him. The rights, duties, and\r\n    jurisdiction of the _Gauleiter_ result primarily from the\r\n    mission assigned by the Fuehrer and, apart from that, from\r\n    detailed directives.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe responsibility and function of the _Gauleiter_ and his staff\r\nofficers or office holders were essentially political, namely, to insure\r\nthe authority of the Nazi Party within his area, to coordinate the\r\nactivities of the Party and all its affiliated and supervised\r\norganizations, and to enlarge the influence of the Party over people and\r\nlife in his _Gau_ generally. Following the outbreak of the war, when it\r\nbecame imperative to coordinate the various phases of the German war\r\neffort, the _Gauleiter_ were given additional important\r\nresponsibilities. The Ministerial Council for the Defense of the Reich,\r\nwhich was a sort of general staff for civil defense and the mobilization\r\nof the German war economy, by a decree of 1 September 1939 (1939,\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 1565), appointed about sixteen\r\n_Gauleiter_ as Reich Defense Commissars. Later, under the impact of\r\nmounting military reverses and an increasingly strained war economy,\r\nmore and more important administrative functions were put on a _Gau_\r\nbasis; the Party Gaue became the basic defense areas of the Reich and\r\neach _Gauleiter_ became a Reich Defense Commissar (Decree of the\r\nMinisterial Council for the Defense of the Reich of 16 November 1942,\r\n1942 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 649). In the course of the war,\r\nadditional functions were entrusted to the _Gauleiter_ so that at the\r\nend, with the exception of certain special matters, such as police\r\naffairs, almost all phases of the German war economy were coordinated\r\nand supervised by them. For instance, regional authority over price\r\ncontrol was put under the _Gauleiter_ as Reich Defense Commissars, and\r\nhousing administration was placed under the _Gauleiter_ as _Gau_ Housing\r\nCommissar. Toward the end of the war, the _Gauleiter_ were charged even\r\nwith military and quasi military tasks. They were made commanders of the\r\n_Volkssturm_ in their areas and were entrusted with such important\r\nfunctions as the evacuation of civilian population in the path of the\r\nadvancing Allied armies, as well as measures for the destruction of\r\nvital installations.\r\n\r\nThe structure and organization of the Party _Gau_ were substantially\r\nrepeated in the lower levels of the Party organization such as the\r\n_Kreise_, _Ortsgruppen_, Cells, and Blocks. Each of these was headed by\r\na political leader who, subject to the Fuehrer principle and the orders\r\nof superior political leaders, was sovereign within his sphere. The\r\nLeadership Corps of the Nazi Party was in effect a “hierarchy of\r\ndescending caesars.” Each of the subordinate Party levels, such as\r\n_Kreise_, _Ortsgruppen_, and so on, was organized into offices or\r\n_Amter_ dealing with the various specialized functions of the Party. But\r\nthe number of such departments and offices diminished as the Party unit\r\ndropped in the hierarchy, so that, while the _Kreise_ office contained\r\nall, or most of the offices in the _Gau_ (such as the deputy, the staff\r\noffice leader, an organization leader, school leader, propaganda leader,\r\npress office leader, treasurer, judge of the Party Court, inspector, and\r\nthe like), the _Ortsgruppe_ had less and the _Zellen_ and _Blocke_ fewer\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n(2) _Kreisleiter_ (_County Leaders_). The _Kreisleiter_ was appointed\r\nand dismissed by Hitler upon the nomination of the _Gauleiter_ and\r\ndirectly subordinate to the _Gauleiter_ in the Party hierarchy. The\r\n_Kreis_ usually comprised a single county. The _Kreisleiter_, within the\r\n_Kreis_, had in general the same position, powers, and prerogatives\r\ngranted the _Gauleiter_ in the _Gau_. In cities they constituted the\r\nvery core of Party power and organization. According to the\r\n_Organization Book of the NSDAP_:\r\n\r\n    “The _Kreisleiter_ carries over-all responsibility towards the\r\n    _Gauleiter_ within his zone of sovereignty for the political and\r\n    ideological training and organization of the Political Leaders,\r\n    the Party members, as well as the population.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Ortsgruppenleiter_ (_Local Chapter Leaders_). The area of the\r\n_Ortsgruppenleiter_ comprised one or more communes or, in a town, a\r\ncertain district. The _Ortsgruppe_ was composed of a combination of\r\nblocks and cells and, according to local circumstances, contained up to\r\n1500 households. The _Ortsgruppenleiter_ also had a staff of office\r\nleaders to assist him in the various functional activities of the Party.\r\nAll other political leaders in his area of responsibility were\r\nsubordinate to and under the direction of the _Ortsgruppenleiter_. For\r\nexample, the leaders of the various affiliated organizations of the\r\nParty, within his area, such as the German Labor Front, and the Nazi\r\norganizations for lawyers, students, and civil servants, were all\r\nsubordinate to the _Ortsgruppenleiter_. In accordance with the Fuehrer\r\nprinciple, the _Ortsgruppenleiter_ or Local Chapter Leaders were\r\nappointed by the _Gauleiter_ and were directly under and subordinate to\r\nthe _Kreisleiter_.\r\n\r\nThe party Manual provides as follows with respect to the\r\n_Ortsgruppenleiter_:\r\n\r\n    “As _Hoheitstraeger_ [Bearer of Sovereignty] all expressions of\r\n    the Party will emanate from the _Ortsgruppenleiter_; he is\r\n    responsible for the political and ideological leadership and\r\n    organization within his zone of sovereignty.\r\n\r\n    “The _Ortsgruppenleiter_ carries the over-all responsibility for\r\n    the political results of all measures initiated by the offices,\r\n    organizations, and affiliated associations of the Party. * * *\r\n    The _Ortsgruppenleiter_ has the right to protest to the\r\n    _Kreisleiter_ against any measures contrary to the interests of\r\n    the Party with regard to an outside political appearance in\r\n    public.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Zellenleiter_ (_Cell Leaders_). The _Zellenleiter_ was responsible\r\nfor four to eight blocks. He was the immediate superior of and had\r\ncontrol and supervision over the _Blockleiter_ (Block Leader). His\r\nmission and duties, according to the Party Manual, corresponded to the\r\nmissions of the _Blockleiter_. (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _Blockleiter_ (_Block Leaders_). The _Blockleiter_ was the one Party\r\nofficial who was peculiarly in a position to have continuous contact\r\nwith the German people. The _block_ was the lowest unit in the Party\r\npyramidal organization. The _block_ of the Party comprised 40 to 60\r\nhouseholds and was regarded by the Party as the focal point upon which\r\nto press the weight of its propaganda. The _Organization Book of the\r\nNSDAP_ states:\r\n\r\n    “The household is the basic community upon which the block and\r\n    cell system is built. The household is the organizational focal\r\n    point of all Germans united in an apartment and includes\r\n    roomers, domestic help, etc. * * * The _Blockleiter_ has\r\n    jurisdiction over all matters within his zone relating to the\r\n    Movement and is fully responsible to the _Zellenleiter_. * * *”\r\n    (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe _Blockleiter_, as in the case of other political leaders, was\r\ncharged with planning, disseminating, and developing a receptivity to\r\nthe policies of the Nazi Party among the population in his area of\r\nresponsibility. It was also the expressed duty of the _Blockleiter_ to\r\nspy on the population. According to the Party Manual:\r\n\r\n    “It is the duty of the _Blockleiter_ to find people\r\n    disseminating damaging rumors and to report them to the\r\n    _Ortsgruppe_ so that they may be reported to the respective\r\n    State authorities.\r\n\r\n    “The _Blockleiter_ must not only be preacher and defender of the\r\n    National Socialist ideology towards the members of nation and\r\n    Party entrusted to his political care, but he must also strive\r\n    to achieve practical collaboration of the Party members within\r\n    his block zone * * *.”\r\n\r\n    “The _Blockleiter_ shall continuously remind the Party members\r\n    of their particular duties towards the people and the State * *\r\n    * The _Blockleiter_ keeps a list (card file) about the\r\n    households * * * In principle, the _Blockleiter_ will settle his\r\n    official business verbally and he will receive messages verbally\r\n    and pass them on in the same way. Correspondence will only be\r\n    used in cases of absolute necessity * * * The _Blockleiter_\r\n    conducts National Socialist propaganda from mouth to mouth. He\r\n    will eventually awaken the understanding of the eternally\r\n    dissatisfied as regards the frequently misunderstood or wrongly\r\n    interpreted measures and laws of the National Socialist\r\n    Government * * * It is not necessary to him to fall in with\r\n    complaints and gripes about possibly obvious shortcomings of any\r\n    kind in order to demonstrate * * * solidarity * * * A condition\r\n    to gain the confidence of all people is to maintain absolute\r\n    secrecy in all matters.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThere were in Germany around a half million of these _Blockleiter_.\r\nLarge though this figure may appear, there can be no doubt that these\r\nofficials were in and of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party. Though\r\nthey stood at the broad base of the Party pyramid rather than at its\r\nsummit, where rested the _Reichsleiter_, by virtue of this fact they\r\nwere stationed at close intervals throughout the German civil\r\npopulation. It may be doubted that the average German ever looked upon\r\nthe face of Heinrich Himmler. But the man in the street in Nazi Germany\r\ncould not have avoided an uneasy acquaintance with the _Blockleiter_ in\r\nhis neighbourhood. It was the block leaders who represented to the\r\npeople of Germany the police-state of Hitler’s Germany. In fact, the\r\n_Blockleiter_ were little fuehrers with real power over the civilians in\r\ntheir domains. The authority of the _Blockleiter_ to exercise coercion\r\nand the threat of force upon the civil population is shown in an excerpt\r\nfrom page 7 of the magazine published by the Chief Education Office of\r\nthe Party, entitled “The Face of the Party”:\r\n\r\n    “Advice and sometimes also the harsher form of education is\r\n    employed if the faulty conduct of an individual harms this\r\n    individual himself and thus also the community.”\r\n\r\n(6) _Hoheitstraeger._ Within the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party\r\ncertain of the Political Leaders possessed a higher degree of\r\nresponsibility than others, were vested with special prerogatives, and\r\nconstituted a distinctive and elite group. These were the so-called\r\n“_Hoheitstraeger_” (Bearers of Sovereignty) who represented the Party\r\nwithin their area of jurisdiction, the so-called _Hoheitsgebiet_. The\r\nParty Manual (_1893-PS_) states as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Among the Political Leaders, the _Hoheitstraeger_ assumed a\r\n    special position. Contrary to the other Political Leaders who\r\n    have departmental missions, the _Hoheitstraeger_ themselves are\r\n    in charge of a geographical sector known as the _Hoheitsgebiet_\r\n    [Sectors of Sovereignty].\r\n\r\n    “_Hoheitstraeger_ are:\r\n    “The _Fuehrer_\r\n    The _Gauleiter_\r\n    The _Kreisleiter_\r\n    The _Ortsgruppenleiter_\r\n    The _Zellenleiter_\r\n    The _Blockleiter_.\r\n    “_Hoheitsgebiet_ are:\r\n    “The _Reich_\r\n    The _Gau_\r\n    The _Kreis_\r\n    The _Ortsgruppe_\r\n    The _Zelle_\r\n    The _Block_.\r\n\r\n    “Within their sector of sovereignty the _Hoheitstraeger_ have\r\n    sovereign political rights. They represent the Party within\r\n    their sector. The _Hoheitstraeger_ supervise all Party Officers\r\n    within their jurisdiction and * * * are responsible for the\r\n    maintenance of discipline. * * * The directors of offices, etc.,\r\n    and of the affiliated organizations are responsible to their\r\n    respective _Hoheitstraeger_ as regards their special missions. *\r\n    * * The _Hoheitstraeger_ are superior to all Political Leaders,\r\n    managers, etc., within their sector. As regards personal\r\n    considerations, _Hoheitstraeger_ * * * are endowed with special\r\n    rights.\r\n\r\n    “The _Hoheitstraeger_ of the Party are not to be administrative\r\n    officials * * * but are to move in a continuous vital contact\r\n    with the Political Leaders of the population within their\r\n    sector. The _Hoheitstraeger_ are responsible for the proper and\r\n    good supervision of all members of the nation within their\r\n    sectors * * *.\r\n\r\n    “The Party intends to achieve a state of affairs in which the\r\n    individual German will find his way to the Party * * *.”\r\n    (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe distinctive character of the _Politischer Leiter_ (Political\r\nLeaders) constituting the _Hoheitstraeger_, and their existence and\r\noperation as an identifiable group, are indicated by the publication of\r\na magazine, entitled _Der Hoheitstraeger_, whose distribution was\r\nlimited by regulation of the Reich Organization Leader to the\r\n_Hoheitstraeger_ and certain other designated _Politischer Leiter_. The\r\ninside cover of this exclusive Party magazine reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_DER HOHEITSTRAEGER_, the contents of which is to be handled\r\n    confidentially, serves only for the orientation of the competent\r\n    leaders. It may not be loaned out to other persons * * *” [then\r\n    follows a list of the Hoheitstraeger and other Political Leaders\r\n    authorized to receive the magazine.] (_2660-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe magazine states that, in addition, the following were entitled to\r\nreceive it:\r\n\r\n    “Commandants, Unit Commanders and Candidates of Order Castles;\r\n    the Reich, Shock Troop and _Gaue_ Speakers of the NSDAP; the\r\n    Lieutenant Generals and Major Generals of SA, SS, NSFK, and\r\n    NSKK; Lieutenant Generals and Major Generals of the HJ.”\r\n    (_2660-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe fact that this magazine existed, that it derived its name from the\r\nCommanding Officers of the Leadership Corps, that it was distributed to\r\nthe elite of the Leadership Corps—that a House Bulletin was circulated\r\ndown the command channels of the Leadership Corps—demonstrates that the\r\nLeadership Corps of the Nazi Party was an identifiable group or\r\norganization within the meaning of Article 9 of the Charter.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the contents of the magazine _Der Hoheitstrager_\r\nreveals a continuing concern by the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party\r\nin measures and doctrines which were employed throughout the course of\r\nthe conspiracy. The plans and policies of the inner elite of the\r\nLeadership Corps gain clarity through a random sampling of articles\r\npublished and policies advocated in various issues of the magazine _Der\r\nHoheitstrager_. From February 1937 to October 1938 these included the\r\nfollowing: anti-Semitic articles, attacks on Catholicism and the\r\nChristian religion and clergy; the need for motorized armament; the\r\nurgent need for expanded _Lebensraum_ and colonies; persistent attacks\r\non the League of Nations; the use of the Block and Cell in achieving\r\nfavorable votes in Party plebiscites; the intimate association between\r\nthe _Wehrmacht_ and the Political Leadership; the racial doctrines of\r\nFascism; the cult of “leadership”; the role of the _Gaue_,\r\n_Ortsgruppen_, and _Zellen_ in the expansion of Germany; and related\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Organization of Political Leaders._ The Political Leaders were\r\norganized according to the leadership principle (_1893-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The basis of the Party organization is the Fuehrer thought. The\r\n    public is unable to rule itself either directly or indirectly *\r\n    * * All Political Leaders stand as appointed by the Fuehrer and\r\n    are responsible to him. They possess full authority toward the\r\n    lower echelons * * * Only a man who has absorbed the school of\r\n    subordinate functions within the Party has a claim to the higher\r\n    Fuehrer offices. We can only use Fuehrers who have served from\r\n    the ground up. Any Political Leader who does not conform to\r\n    these principles is to be dismissed or to be sent back to the\r\n    lower offices, as _Blockleiter_, _Zellenleiter_ for further\r\n    training * * *\r\n\r\n    “The Political Leader is not an office worker but the Political\r\n    Deputy of the Fuehrer * * * Within the Political Leadership, we\r\n    are building the Political Leadership of the state * * * The\r\n    type of the Political Leader is not characterized by the office\r\n    which he represents. There is no such thing as a Political\r\n    Leader of the NSBO, etc., but there is only the Political Leader\r\n    of the NSDAP.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nEach Political Leader was sworn in yearly. According to the Party Manual\r\n(_1893-PS_), the wording of the oath was as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I pledge eternal allegiance to Adolf Hitler. I pledge\r\n    unconditional obedience to him and the Fuehrers appointed by\r\n    him.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Organization Book of the NSDAP also provides:\r\n\r\n    “The Political Leader is inseparably tied to the ideology and\r\n    the organization of the NSDAP. His oath only ends with his death\r\n    or with his expulsion from the National Socialist community.”\r\n    (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Appointment of Political Leaders._ The appointment of the\r\npolitical leaders constituting the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party\r\nproceeded as follows, according to the Party Manual:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer appointed the following Political Leaders:\r\n\r\n    “a. All _Reichsleiter_ and all Political Leaders within the\r\n    _Reichsleitung_ [Reich Party Directorate], including women’s\r\n    leaders.\r\n\r\n    “b. All _Gauleiter_, including the Political Leaders holding\r\n    offices in the _Gauleitung_ [Gau Party Directorate], including\r\n    _Gau_ women leaders.\r\n\r\n    “c. All _Kreisleiter_.\r\n\r\n    “The _Gauleiter_ appointed:\r\n\r\n    “a. The Political Leaders and women’s leaders within the _Gau_\r\n    Party Directorate.\r\n\r\n    “b. The Political Leaders and directors of women’s leagues in\r\n    the _Kreis_ Party Directorate.\r\n\r\n    “c. All _Ortsgruppenleiter_.\r\n\r\n    “The _Kreisleiter_ appoints the Political Leaders and the\r\n    Directors of the Women’s Leagues of the _Ortsgruppen_ including\r\n    the Block and Cell Leaders.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\n_c._ Power _of Hoheitstraeger to Call Upon Party Formations_. The\r\n_Hoheitstraeger_ among the Leadership Corps were entitled to call upon\r\nand utilize the various Party Formations as necessary for the execution\r\nof Nazi Party policies.\r\n\r\nThe Party Manual makes it clear that the _Hoheitstrager_ has power and\r\nauthority to requisition the services of the SA:\r\n\r\n    “The _Hoheitstrager_ is responsible for the entire political\r\n    appearance of the Movement within his zone. The SA leader of\r\n    that zone is tied to the directives of the _Hoheitstrager_ in\r\n    that respect.\r\n\r\n    “The _Hoheitstrager_ is the ranking representative of the Party\r\n    to include all organizations within his zone. He may requisition\r\n    the SA located within his zone from the respective SA leader if\r\n    they are needed for the execution of a political mission. The\r\n    _Hoheitstrager_ will then assign the mission to the SA * * *\r\n\r\n    “Should the _Hoheitstrager_ need more SA for the execution of\r\n    political mission than is locally available, he then applies to\r\n    the next higher office of sovereignty which, in turn, requests\r\n    the SA from the SA office in his sector.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe _Hoheitstrager_ also had the same authority to call upon the\r\nservices of the SS and NSKK (_1893-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe _Hoheitstrager_ further, had authority to call upon the services of\r\nthe Hitler Youth (HJ):\r\n\r\n    “The Political Leader has the right to requisition the HJ in the\r\n    same manner as the SA for the execution of a political action.\r\n\r\n    “In appointing leaders of the HJ and the DJ, the office of the\r\n    HJ must procure the approval of the _Hoheitstrager_ of his zone.\r\n    This means that the _Hoheitstrager_ can prevent the appointment\r\n    of leaders unsuited for the leadership of youth. If his approval\r\n    has not been procured, an appointment may be cancelled if he so\r\n    requests.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn example of the use of the Party Formations at the call of the\r\nLeadership Corps of the Party is provided by the action taken by the\r\n_Reichsleiter_ for Party Organization of the NSDAP, Dr. Robert Ley,\r\nleading to the deliberate dissolution of the Free Trade Unions on 2 May\r\n1933. A directive issued by _Reichsleiter_ Ley on 21 April 1933\r\n(_392-PS_) ordered the employment of the SA and the SS in occupying\r\ntrade union properties and in taking trade union leaders into protective\r\ncustody:\r\n\r\n    “* * * SA as well as SS are to be employed for the occupation of\r\n    trade union properties and for the taking of personalities who\r\n    come into question into protective custody.\r\n\r\n    “The _Gauleiter_ (i.e. Regional Director) is to proceed with his\r\n    measures on a basis of the closest understanding with competent\r\n    Regional Factory Cells Director. * * *\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The following are to be taken into protective custody:\r\n\r\n    “All Trade Union Chairmen; the District Secretaries and the\r\n    Branch Directors of the ‘Bank for Workers, Employees and\r\n    Officials, Inc.’” (_392-PS_)\r\n\r\nA decree issued by Hess as Deputy of the Fuehrer, dated 25 October 1934,\r\nunderwrites the authority of the _Hoheitstrager_ with respect to the\r\nParty Formations:\r\n\r\n    “The political leadership within the Party and its political\r\n    representation towards all offices, State or others, which are\r\n    outside of the Party, lie solely and exclusively with the\r\n    _Hoheitstrager_, which is to say with me, the _Gauleiter_,\r\n    _Kreisleiter_, and _Ortsgruppenleiter_ * * *.\r\n\r\n    “The departmental workers of the Party organization, as well as\r\n    _Reichsleiter_, office directors, etc., as well as the leaders\r\n    of the SA, SS, HJ and the subordinate affiliations, may not\r\n    enter into binding agreements of a political nature with State\r\n    and other offices except when so authorized by their\r\n    _Hoheitstrager_.\r\n\r\n    “In places where the territories of the units of the SA, SS, HJ\r\n    and the subordinate affiliations do not coincide with the zones\r\n    of the _Hoheitstrager_, the _Hoheitstrager_ will give his\r\n    political directives to the ranking leader of each unit within\r\n    his zone of sovereignty.” (_2474-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was the official policy of the Leadership Corps to establish close\r\nand cooperative relations with the Gestapo. The Head of the German\r\nPolice and SS, Himmler, was a _Reichsleiter_ on the top level of the\r\nLeadership Corps. A decree issued by Bormann, as Chief of Staff of the\r\nDeputy of the Fuehrer, dated 26 June 1935, provided the following:\r\n\r\n    “In order to effect a closer contact between the offices of the\r\n    Party and its organizations with the Directors of the Secret\r\n    State Police [Gestapo], the Deputy of the Fuehrer requests that\r\n    the Directors of the Gestapo be invited to attend all of the\r\n    larger official rallies of the Party and its organization.”\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Meetings of the Political Leaders._ The contention of the\r\nProsecution that the members of the Leadership Corps constituted a\r\ndistinctive and identifiable group or organization is strongly supported\r\nby the fact that the various _Hoheitstraeger_ (such as the _Gauleiter_,\r\n_Kreisleiter_, _Ortsgruppenleiter_, and so on) were under an absolute\r\nobligation to meet and confer periodically, not only with the staff\r\nofficers on their own staffs, but with the political leaders and staff\r\nofficers immediately subordinate to them. For example, the _Gauleiter_\r\nwas bound to confer with his staff officers (such as his deputy, his\r\nstaff office leader, his organization leader, school leader, propaganda\r\nleader, press leader, his _Gau_ Party Judge, and so on) every 8 to 14\r\ndays. Furthermore, the _Gauleiter_ was obligated to meet with the\r\nvarious _Gauleiter_ subordinate to him once every 3 months for a 3-day\r\nconvention for the purpose of discussing and clarifying Nazi Party\r\npolicies and directives, for hearing basic lectures on Party policy, and\r\nfor the mutual exchange of information pertinent to the Party’s current\r\nprogram. The _Gauleiter_ was also obligated to meet at least once a\r\nmonth with the leaders of the Party formations and affiliated\r\norganizations within his _Gau_ area, such as the leaders of the SA, SS,\r\nHitler Youth and others. These matters are set forth in the\r\n_Organization Book of the NSDAP_ (_1893-PS_) as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Leader conferences in the District:\r\n\r\n    “(a) District Leaders (_Gauleiter_) with his staff every 8 to 14\r\n    days.\r\n\r\n    “(b) It is further absolutely necessary that the directors of\r\n    the _Gau_ offices will meet with the county directors of their\r\n    district once every three months for a three-day convention\r\n    (possibly at a district schooling castle) where they will have\r\n    an opportunity to overcome difficulties of personal and\r\n    professional nature, apart from hearing fundamental lectures, by\r\n    social gatherings in the presence of the bearer of the\r\n    sovereignty, by getting to know each other and by a mutual\r\n    exchange of ideas. Participation in these conferences is\r\n    compulsory and duty would not constitute an excuse under any\r\n    circumstances.\r\n\r\n    “(c) The arrangement of social meeting in the presence of\r\n    leaders of the organizations of RAD and NSFK of the respective\r\n    zone of sovereignty. In the course of these meetings differences\r\n    of opinion may be straightened out in discussions.\r\n\r\n    “(d) The bearer of sovereignty will meet at least once a month\r\n    with the leaders of the SA, SS, NSKK, HJ, as well as the RAD and\r\n    the NSFK who are within the zone for the purpose of mutual\r\n    orientation.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe _Organization Book of the Party_ imposes a similar requirement of\r\nregular and periodical conferences and meetings upon all the other\r\n_Hoheitstraeger_, including the _Kreisleiter_, _Ortsgruppenleiter_,\r\n_Zellenleiter_, and _Blockleiter_.\r\n\r\nThe clear consequence of such regular and obligatory conferences and\r\nmeetings by all the _Hoheitstraeger_, both with their own staff officers\r\nand with the political leaders and staff officers subordinate to them,\r\nwas that basic Nazi policies and directives issued by Hitler and the\r\nleader of the Party Chancellery, Bormann, directly through the chain of\r\ncommand of the _Hoheitstraeger_, and functional policies issued by the\r\nvarious _Reichsleiter_ and Reich office holders through functional and\r\ntechnical channels, were certain to be brought to the attention and\r\nunderstanding of the bulk of the membership of the Leadership Corps.\r\nWhen this fact is coupled with the further fact that all the members of\r\nthe Leadership Corps under the Leadership Principle and their sworn\r\noaths, were bound to obey blindly and without question orders received\r\nfrom their competent superiors, it is clear that the general membership\r\nof the Leadership Corps is responsible for measures taken or ordered by\r\nthat organization in furtherance of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\n(7) _Statistics Relating to the Leadership Corps._ As previously shown,\r\nthe Leadership Corps comprised the sum of officials of the Nazi Party,\r\nincluding, in addition to Hitler and the members of the _Reichsleitung_,\r\nsuch as the _Reichsleiter_ and the Reich office holders, a hierarchy of\r\n_Hoheitstraeger_ (ranging from the _Gauleiter_ down to the\r\n_Blockleiter_) as well as the staff officers attached to the\r\n_Hoheitstraeger_. According to page 10 of issue No. 8, 1939 of the\r\nauthoritative publication of the Leadership Corps, “_Der\r\nHoheitstrager_,” there were in 1939:\r\n\r\n       40 _Gaue_ and 1 Foreign\r\n          Organization _Gau_   each led by a _Gauleiter_.\r\n      808 _Kreise_             each led by a _Kreisleiter_.\r\n   28,376 _Ortsgruppen_        each led by a _Ortsgruppenleiter_.\r\n   89,378 _Zellen_             each led by a _Zellenleiter_.\r\n  463,048 _Blocke_             each led by a _Blockleiter_.\r\n                                                              (_2958-PS_)\r\n\r\nHowever, as shown by previous evidence, the Leadership Corps was\r\ncomposed not only of the _Hoheitstraeger_ (such as _Gauleiter_,\r\n_Kreisleiter_, _Ortsgruppenleiter_, _Zellenleiter_, and _Blockleiter_)\r\nbut also of the staff officers or office holders attached to these\r\n_Hoheitstraeger_. The _Gauleiter_, for example, was assisted by a deputy\r\n_Gauleiter_, several _Gau_ inspectors, and a staff which was divided\r\ninto main offices (_Hauptamter_) and offices (_Amter_), including such\r\ndepartments as the _Gau_ staff Office, Treasury, Education Office,\r\nPropaganda Office, Press Office, University Teachers, Communal Policy,\r\netc. As previously shown in evidence, the staff office structure of the\r\n_Gau_ was substantially represented in the lower levels of the\r\nLeadership Corps organization such as the _Kreise_, _Ortsgruppen_, and\r\nso on. The _Kreise_ and the smaller territorial areas of the Party were\r\nalso organized into staff offices dealing with the various activities of\r\nthe Leadership Corps. But, of course, the importance and the number of\r\nsuch staff offices diminished as the unit dropped in the hierarchy; so\r\nthat, while the _Kreisleiter_ staff contained all or most of the\r\ndepartments mentioned for the _Gau_, the _Ortsgruppe_ had fewer\r\ndepartments and the lower ones fewer still.\r\n\r\nFirm figures have not been found as to the total number of staff\r\nofficers, as distinguished from the _Hoheitstraeger_ or political\r\ncommanders themselves included within the Leadership Corps.\r\n\r\nIt is the view of the prosecution that in defining the scope and\r\ncomposition of the Leadership Corps, staff officers should be included\r\nonly down to and including the _Kreise_. Upon this basis, the Leadership\r\nCorps of the Nazi Party constituted the Fuehrer, the members of the\r\n_Reichsleitung_, the 5 levels of _Hoheitstraeger_ (ranging from\r\n_Gauleiter_ down through the _Blockleiter_), and the staff officers\r\nattached to the 40-odd _Gauleiter_ and the eight to nine hundred\r\n_Kreisleiter_. Adopting this definition of the Leadership Corps, it will\r\nbe seen that the total figure for the membership of that organization,\r\nbased upon the statistics cited from the basic handbook for Germany,\r\namounts to around 700,000.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this figure is based upon an admittedly limited view of\r\nthe size of the membership of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party;\r\nfor the evidence has shown that the Leadership Corps in effect embraced\r\nstaff officers attached to the subordinate _Hoheitstraeger_, and\r\ninclusion of such staff officers in the estimation of the size of the\r\nLeadership Corps would have very considerably enlarged the final figure\r\nestimated to a total of 2,000,000. The Prosecution, however, proposes to\r\nexclude such subordinate staff officers for the reason that their\r\nparticipation in and responsibility for the Conspiracy were measurably\r\nless extensive than those of the staff officers and office holders on\r\nthe higher levels of the Leadership Corps. The subordinate staff\r\nofficers thus excluded were responsible functionally to the higher staff\r\nofficers with respect to their particular specialty, such as propaganda,\r\nParty organization, and so on, and to their respective _Hoheitstraeger_\r\nwith respect to discipline and policy control. Likewise, such higher\r\nstaff officers participated in planning and policy discussions, and also\r\nissued orders through technical channels to lower staff officers.\r\n\r\n     B. _Participation of the Leadership Corps in the Conspiracy._\r\n\r\nThe Program of the Nazi Party, proclaimed by Hitler, the Fuehrer of the\r\nLeadership Corps, on 24 February 1920 (_1708-PS_), contained the chief\r\nelements of the Nazi plan for domination and conquest. The first point\r\nrequired the incorporation of all Germans into a Greater German Reich.\r\nPoint 2 demanded unilateral abolition of the Peace Treaties of\r\nVersailles and St. Germain. Point 3 stated the demand for “land and\r\nsoil” (colonies). Point 4 proclaimed the Nazi doctrines of racial\r\ndiscrimination and anti-Semitism. Point 6 proclaimed the fight against\r\nthe democratic-parliamentary system, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * We demand that every public office, of any sort,\r\n    whatsover, whether in the Reich, the county or municipality, be\r\n    filled only by citizens. We combat the corrupting parliamentary\r\n    economy, office-holding only according to Party inclinations\r\n    without consideration of character or abilities.” (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nPoint 22 expressed the Nazi plans and policies for rearmament as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “We demand the abolition of the mercenary troops and formation\r\n    of a National Army.” (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe official Party Program declares on its face that:\r\n\r\n    “The program is the political foundation of the NSDAP and\r\n    accordingly the primary political law of the State * * *\r\n\r\n    “All legal precepts are to be applied in the spirit of the Party\r\n    Program.\r\n\r\n    “Since the taking over of control, the Fuehrer has succeeded in\r\n    the realization of the essential portions of the Party Program\r\n    from the fundamentals to the details.\r\n\r\n    “The Party Program of the NSDAP was proclaimed on 24 February\r\n    1920 by Adolf Hitler at the first large Party gathering in\r\n    Munich and since that day has remained unaltered * * * The\r\n    National Socialist philosophy is summarized in 25 points.”\r\n    (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, the Party Program was binding upon the Political\r\nLeaders of the Leadership Corps, and they were under a duty to support\r\nand carry out that Program. As the Party Manual puts it:\r\n\r\n    “The Commandments of the National Socialists:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer is always right * * *.\r\n\r\n    “The Program be your dogma.\r\n\r\n    “It demands your utter devotion to the Movement * * *.\r\n\r\n    “Right is what serves the Movement and thus Germany.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * Leader Corps is responsible for the complete penetration\r\n    of the German Nation with the National Socialist spirit * * *.”\r\n    (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe oath of the Political Leader to Hitler has been previously referred\r\nto. In connection therewith, the Party Manual provides:\r\n\r\n    “The Political Leader is inseparably tied to the ideology and\r\n    the organization of the NSDAP. His oath only ends with his death\r\n    or with his expulsion from the National Socialist community.”\r\n    (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhile the leadership principle assured the binding nature of Hitler’s\r\nstatements, program, and policies upon the entire Party and the\r\nLeadership Corps, the leadership principle also established the full\r\nresponsibility of the individual Political Leader within the province\r\nand jurisdiction of his office or position.\r\n\r\nThe leadership principle applied not only to Hitler as the supreme\r\nleader, but also to the Political Leaders under him, and thus permeated\r\nthe entire Leadership Corps:\r\n\r\n    “The basis of the Party Organization is the Fuehrer thought * *\r\n    * All Political Leaders stand as appointed by the Fuehrer and\r\n    are responsible to him. They possess full authority toward the\r\n    lower echelons * * *.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe various _Hoheitstraeger_ of the Leadership Corps were, in their\r\nrespective areas of responsibility, themselves _Fuehrer_:\r\n\r\n    “Within their sector of sovereignty, the _Hoheitstraeger_\r\n    (_Gauleiter_, _Kreisleiter_, _Ortsgruppenleiter_,\r\n    _Zellenleiter_, _Blockleiter_) have sovereign political rights *\r\n    * * They are responsible for the entire political situation\r\n    within their sector * * *” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs stated in the _Organization Book of the NSDAP_\r\n\r\n    “The Party is an order of ‘Fuehrer’.” (_1814-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe subjection of the entire membership of the Leadership Corps to the\r\nfiat of the Fuehrer Principle is clearly shown in the following passage\r\nfrom the Party Manual:\r\n\r\n    “* * * a solid anchorage for all the organizations within the\r\n    party structure is provided and a firm connection with the\r\n    sovereign leaders of the NSDAP is created in accordance with the\r\n    Fuehrer Principle.” (_1814-PS_)\r\n\r\n(1) _Domination and Control of the German State and Government by the\r\nNazi Party, directed by the Leadership Corps._ On 23 March 1933 the\r\nReichstag enacted a law conferring power on the Reich Cabinet to\r\nlegislate on its own authority (_2001-PS_). Prominent members of the\r\nLeadership Corps of the Nazi Party were members of the Reich Cabinet.\r\nThe presence of _Reichsleiter_ and other prominent members of the\r\nLeadership Corps in the Cabinet facilitated the domination of the\r\nCabinet by the Nazi Party and the Leadership Corps. For example, a\r\ndecree of 13 March 1933 established the Ministry of Public Enlightenment\r\nand Propaganda. The head of this ministry was Goebbels, who\r\nsimultaneously was _Reichsleiter_ for Propaganda of the NSDAP\r\n(_2029-PS_). Examples of personal union between high officials in the\r\nLeadership and Cabinet membership existed in the case of the Food\r\nMinister, the Chief of the German Police, the Reich Labor Leader, the\r\nChief of the Party Organization in Foreign Countries, and the Reich\r\nYouth Fuehrer (_2473-PS_). Moreover, the majority of the Reich\r\nMinistries were occupied by leading old Party Members. All Reich\r\nMinisters were accepted by the Party on 30 January 1937 and were\r\ndecorated with the Golden Party Insignia. (_1774-PS_)\r\n\r\nA law of 14 July 1933 outlawed and forbade the formation of any\r\npolitical parties other than the Nazi Party and made violation of this\r\ndecree a punishable crime. Thereby the one party State was established\r\nand the Leadership Corps was rendered immune from the opposition of\r\norganized political groups. This Law Against the Formation of New\r\nPolitical Parties reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The National Socialist German Workers’ Party constitutes the\r\n    only political party in Germany. Whoever undertakes to maintain\r\n    the organizational structure of another political party or to\r\n    form a new political party will be punished with penal servitude\r\n    up to three years or with imprisonment of from six months to\r\n    three years, if the deed is not subject to a greater penalty\r\n    according to other regulations.” (_1388-PS_)\r\n\r\nA law was enacted on 20 July 1933 providing for the dismissal of\r\nofficials who belonged to the Communist Party or who were otherwise\r\nactive in furthering the aims of Communism. The law also provided for\r\nthe dismissal of those who were in the future active for Marxism,\r\nCommunism, or Social Democracy (Law to Supplement the Law for the\r\nRestoration of the Professional Civil Service, 20 July 1933, (1933\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 518)). (_1398-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 13 October 1933 a “law to guarantee public peace” was enacted which\r\nprovided, _inter alia_, that the death penalty or other severe\r\npunishment should be imposed upon any person who—\r\n\r\n    “* * * undertakes to kill a member of the SA or the SS, a\r\n    trustee or agent of the NSDAP * * * out of political motives or\r\n    on account of their official activity.” (_1394-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 1 December 1933 a law was enacted “to secure the unity of Party and\r\nState.” This law provided that the Nazi Party was the pillar of the\r\nGerman State, and was linked to it indissolubly; it also made the Deputy\r\nof the Fuehrer (then Hess) and the Chief of Staff of the SA (then Roehm)\r\nmembers of the Reich Cabinet (_1395-PS_). The pertinent provisions of\r\nthis law read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “After the victory of the National Socialist Revolution, the\r\n    National Socialistic German Labor Party is the bearer of the\r\n    concept of the German State and is inseparably the State. It\r\n    will be a part of the public law. Its organization will be\r\n    determined by the Fuehrer * * *.\r\n\r\n    “The Deputy of the Fuehrer and the Chief of Staff of the SA will\r\n    become members of the Reich Government in order to insure close\r\n    cooperation of the offices of the Party and SA with the public\r\n    authorities * * *.” (_1395-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis law was a basic measure in enthroning the Leadership Corps in a\r\nposition of supreme political power in Germany. For it laid it down that\r\nthe Party, directed by the Leadership Corps, was the embodiment of the\r\nState and, in fact, was the State. Moreover, this law made both the\r\nFuehrer’s Deputy and the Chief of Staff of the SA, which was a Party\r\nFormation subject to the call of the _Hoheitstraeger_, Cabinet Members.\r\nThus, the Leadership Corps’ control of the Cabinet was further\r\nsolidified. The dominant position of the Leadership Corps is further\r\nrevealed by the provision that the Reichs-Chancellor would issue the\r\nregulations carrying out this law in his capacity as Fuehrer of the Nazi\r\nParty. The fact that Hitler, as Fuehrer of the Leadership Corps, could\r\npromulgate rules which would have statutory force and be published in\r\nthe _Reichsgesetzblatt_, the proper compilation for State enactments, is\r\nbut a further reflection of the reality of the Party’s domination of the\r\nGerman State.\r\n\r\nIn a declaration to the 1935 Party Congress at Nurnberg, Hitler stated:\r\n\r\n    “It is not the State which gives orders to us, it is we who give\r\n    orders to the State.” (_2775-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat categorical statement of the Fuehrer of the Leadership Corps\r\naffirms the dominance of Party over State which the evidence makes\r\nundeniably clear.\r\n\r\nOn 30 June 1934 Hitler, as Head of the Nazi Party, directed the massacre\r\nof hundreds of SA-men and other political opponents. Hitler sought to\r\njustify these mass murders by declaring to the Reichstag that “at that\r\nhour I was responsible for the fate of the German nation and supreme\r\njudge of the German people.” (The evidence relating to these events is\r\ndiscussed in Section 4, infra.) On 3 July 1934 the Cabinet issued a\r\ndecree describing the murders of 30 June 1934, in effect, as legitimate\r\nself-defense by the State. By this law the Reich Cabinet made themselves\r\naccessories after the fact of these murders. The domination of State by\r\nParty, however, makes the Cabinet’s characterization of these criminal\r\nacts by Hitler and his top Party Leaders as state measures consistent\r\nwith political reality. The single article of the law of 3 July 1934\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The measures taken on 30 June and 1 and 2 July 1934 to\r\n    counteract attempt at treason and high treason shall be\r\n    considered as national emergency defense.” (_2057-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 12 July 1934 there was enacted a law defining the function of the\r\nAcademy for German law:\r\n\r\n    “Closely connected with the agencies competent for legislation,\r\n    it [the Academy] shall further the realization of the National\r\n    Socialist program in the realm of the law.” (_1391-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 30 January 1933, Hitler, the Leader of the Nazi Party and Fuehrer of\r\nthe Leadership Corps, was appointed Chancellor of the Reich. When\r\nPresident von Hindenburg died in 1934, the Fuehrer amalgamated in his\r\nperson the offices of Chancellor and Reich President. (_2003-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy a decree of 20 December 1934 Party uniforms and institutions were\r\ngranted the same protection as those of the State. This law was entitled\r\n“Law Concerning Treacherous Acts Against the State and Party, and for\r\nthe Protection of Party Uniforms.” This law imposed heavy penalties upon\r\nany person making false statements injuring the welfare or prestige of\r\nthe Nazi Party or its agencies. It authorized the imprisonment of\r\npersons making or circulating malicious or baiting statements against\r\nleading personalities of the Nazi Party. And it provided punishment by\r\nforced labor for the unauthorized wearing of Party uniforms or symbols.\r\n(_1393-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy a law of 15 September 1934, the Swastika flag of the Party was made\r\nthe official flag of the Reich (_2079-PS_). This law, enacted by the\r\nReichstag, indicates on its face that it issued from Nurnberg on the\r\nParty Day of 15 September 1935. Article 2 of this law reads as follows:\r\n\r\n“The Reich and National flag is the swastika flag.” (_2079-PS_) The\r\nSwastika was the flag and symbol of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi\r\nParty. The law making it the flag of the State constituted a recognition\r\nthat the Party and its Corps of Political Leaders were the sovereign\r\npowers in Germany.\r\n\r\nOn 23 April 1936, a law was enacted granting amnesty for crimes which\r\nthe offender had committed “in his eagerness to fight for the National\r\nSocialist Ideal.” (_1386-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of the Conspiracy to acquire totalitarian control over\r\nthe German people, a law was enacted on 1 December 1936, which\r\nincorporated the entire German youth within the Hitler Youth, thereby\r\nachieving a “total mobilization of German youth” (_1392-PS_). The law\r\nfurther provided that the task of educating the German youth through the\r\nHitler Youth was entrusted to the _Reichsleiter_ of German Youth in the\r\nNSDAP. By this law a monopoly control over the entire German youth was\r\nplaced in the hands of a top official, a _Reichsleiter_, of the\r\nLeadership Corps of the Nazi Party, the defendant von Schirach.\r\n\r\nOn 4 February 1938, the Fuehrer of the Leadership Corps of the NSDAP,\r\nHitler, issued a decree in which he took over directly the command of\r\nthe whole Armed Forces (_1915-PS_). In this decree, Hitler declared, in\r\npart, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “From now on, I take over directly the command of the whole\r\n    Armed Forces.” (_1915-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy the decree of 4 February 1938, Hitler became Supreme Commander of the\r\nArmed Forces. He was, at the time of its issuance, Fuehrer of the\r\nLeadership Corps of the Nazi Party. By virtue of the earlier law of 1\r\nAugust 1934, he combined the office of Reich President with that of the\r\nChancellorship. In the final result, therefore, Hitler was Supreme\r\nCommander of the Armed Forces, Head of the German State, and Fuehrer of\r\nthe Nazi Party.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the foregoing point, the Party Manual (_1893-PS_) states\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * the Fuehrer created the National Socialist German\r\n    Workers’ Party. He filled it with his spirit and his will and\r\n    with it he conquered the power of the State on 30 January 1933.\r\n    The Fuehrer’s will is supreme in the Party.\r\n\r\n    “By authority of the law about the Chief of State of the German\r\n    Reich, dated 1 August 1934, the office of the Reich President\r\n    has been combined with that of the Reich Chancellery.\r\n    Consequently, the powers heretofore possessed by the Reich\r\n    President were transferred to the Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler. Through\r\n    this law, the conduct of Party and State has been combined in\r\n    one hand. By desire of the Fuehrer, a plebiscite was conducted\r\n    on this law on 19 August 1934. On this day, the German people\r\n    chose Adolf Hitler to be their sole leader. He is responsible\r\n    only to his conscience and to the German nation.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nA decree of 16 January 1942 provided that the Party should participate\r\nin legislation, official appointments, and promotions (_2100-PS_). The\r\ndecree further provided that such participation should be undertaken\r\nexclusively by Bormann, Chief of the Party Chancellery and a\r\n_Reichsleiter_ of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party. The decree\r\nprovided that the Chief of the Party Chancellery was to take part in the\r\npreparation of all laws and decrees issued by Reich authorities,\r\nincluding those issued by the Ministerial Council for Defense of the\r\nReich, and to give his assent to those of the Laender and the Reich\r\ngovernors; all communications between State and Party authorities,\r\nunless within one _Gau_ only, were to pass through his hands. This\r\ndecree is of crucial importance in demonstrating the ultimate control\r\nand responsibility imputable to the Leadership Corps for governmental\r\npolicy and actions taken in furtherance of the conspiracy. (_2100-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn or about 26 April 1942, Hitler declared in a speech that, in his\r\ncapacity as Leader of the Nation, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces,\r\nSupreme Head of the Government, and as Fuehrer of the Party, his right\r\nmust be recognized to compel with all means at his disposal, every\r\nGerman, whether soldier, judge, State official, or party official, to\r\nfulfill his desire. He demanded that the Reichstag officially recognize\r\nthis asserted right. On 26 April 1942, the German Reichstag issued a\r\ndecision in which full recognition was given to the rights which the\r\nFuehrer had asserted (_1961-PS_). The Reichstag decreed as follows:\r\n\r\n    “At the proposal of the President of the Reichstag, on its\r\n    session of 26 April 1942, the greater German Reichstag has\r\n    approved of the rights which the Fuehrer has postulated in his\r\n    speech with the following decision:\r\n\r\n    “There can be no doubt, that in the present war, in which the\r\n    German people is faced with a struggle for its existence or\r\n    annihilation, the Fuehrer must have all the rights postulated by\r\n    him which serve to further or achieve victory.\r\n    Therefore—without being bound by existing legal regulations—in\r\n    his capacity as Leader of the Nation, Supreme Commander of the\r\n    Armed Forces, Governmental Chief and Supreme Executive Chief, as\r\n    Supreme Justice and Leader of the Party—the Fuehrer must be in\r\n    a position to force with all means at his disposal every German,\r\n    if necessary, whether he be common soldier or officer, low or\r\n    high official or judge, leading or subordinate official of the\r\n    Party, worker or employee—to fulfill his duties. In case of\r\n    violation of these duties, the Fuehrer is entitled, after\r\n    conscientious examination, regardless of so-called well-deserved\r\n    rights, to mete out due punishment and to remove the offender\r\n    from his post, rank and position without introducing prescribed\r\n    procedures.\r\n\r\n    “At the order of the Fuehrer, this decision is hereby made\r\n    public. Berlin, 26 April 1942.” (_1961-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler himself perhaps best summarized the political realities of his\r\nGermany, in showing the domination of the German State and Government by\r\nthe Leadership Corps and its following. The core of the matter was\r\nstated by Hitler in his speech to the Reichstag on 20 February 1938,\r\nwhen he declared in effect that every institution in Germany was under\r\nthe direction of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party:\r\n\r\n    “National Socialism has given the German people that leadership\r\n    which as Party not only mobilizes the nation but also organizes\r\n    it, so that on the basis of the natural principle of selection,\r\n    the continuance of a stable political leadership is safeguarded\r\n    forever * * * National Socialism * * * possesses Germany\r\n    entirely and completely since the day when, five years ago, I\r\n    left the house in Wilhelmsplatz as Reich Chancellor. There is no\r\n    institution in this state which is not National Socialist. Above\r\n    all, however, the National Socialist Party in these five years\r\n    not only has made the nation National Socialist, but also has\r\n    given itself that perfect organizational structure which\r\n    guarantees its permanence for all future. The greatest guarantee\r\n    of the National Socialist revolution lies in the complete\r\n    domination of the Reich and all its institutions and\r\n    organizations, internally and externally by the National\r\n    Socialist Party. Its protection against the world abroad,\r\n    however, lies in its new National Socialist armed forces. * * *\r\n    In this Reich, anybody who has a responsible position is a\r\n    National Socialist * * * Every institution of this Reich is\r\n    under the orders of the supreme political leadership * * * The\r\n    Party leads the Reich politically, the armed forces defend it\r\n    militarily * * * There is nobody in any responsible position in\r\n    this state who doubts that I am the authorized leader of this\r\n    Reich.” (_2715-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe supreme power which the Leadership Corps exercised over the German\r\nState and Government is sharply pointed up by an article published in\r\nthe February 1939 issue of the authoritative magazine, “_Der\r\nHoheitstrager_”. In this article, addressed to all _Hoheitstraeger_, the\r\nLeadership Corps is reminded that it has conquered the State and that it\r\npossesses absolute and total power in Germany. The article is\r\nsignificantly entitled, “Fight and Order—Not Peace and Order.” It\r\ntrumpets forth, in the accents of Caesarism, the battle call of the\r\nLeadership Corps of German life:\r\n\r\n    “Fight? Why do you always talk of fighting? You have conquered\r\n    the State, and if something does not please you, then just make\r\n    a law and regulate it differently? Why must you always talk of\r\n    fighting? For you have every power! Over what do you fight?\r\n    Outer-politically? You have the Wehrmacht—it will wage the\r\n    fight if it is required. Inner-politically? You have the law and\r\n    the police which can change everything which does not agree with\r\n    you.” (_3230-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn view of the domination of the German State and Government by the Nazi\r\nParty and the Leadership Corps thereof, as established by the foregoing\r\nevidence, the Leadership Corps is responsible for the measures,\r\nincluding legislative enactments, taken by the German State and\r\nGovernment in furtherance of the Conspiracy formulated and carried out\r\nby the co-conspirators and the organizations charged with criminality.\r\n\r\nFor example, as revealed by the above evidence, Point 4 of the original\r\nParty Program declared that a Jew was not a member of the German race\r\nand, therefore, was not entitled to citizenship. This premise was\r\nincorporated into the law of the Third Reich by numerous anti-Semitic\r\nand discriminatory laws. Consequently, it is submitted that, by virtue\r\nof their control over the German State and Government, the Nazi Party\r\nand the Leadership Corps share responsibility for, among other\r\nenactments and measures furthering the Conspiracy, discriminatory laws\r\nagainst the Jews.\r\n\r\n(2) _Overt Acts and Crimes of the Leadership Corps._ The membership of\r\nthe Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party actively participated in measures\r\ndesigned to further the progress of the Conspiracy. The evidence will\r\nshow that the participation by the Leadership Corps in the Conspiracy\r\nembraces such measures as anti-Semitic activities, war crimes committed\r\nagainst members of the Allied forces, the forced labor program, measures\r\nto subvert and undermine the Christian religion and persecute the\r\nChristian clergy, the plundering and spoliation of cultural and other\r\nproperty in German-occupied territories of Europe, and plans and\r\nmeasures leading to the initiation and prosecution of aggressive war.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Crimes against Jews._ The _Gauleiter_ and _Kreisleiter_\r\nparticipated in what were disingenuously described by the Nazis as the\r\n“spontaneous uprising of the people” against the Jews throughout Germany\r\non 9 and 10 November 1938 in connection with the assassination of an\r\nofficial of the German Embassy in Paris on 7 November. (The evidence\r\nrelating to these programs is discussed in Chapter XI on the\r\nconcentration camps, and Chapter XII on the persecution of the Jews.) It\r\nwill be recalled that in the teletyped directive from SS-Gruppenfuehrer\r\nHeydrich, issued on 10 November 1938, to all police headquarters and SD\r\ndistricts, all chiefs of the State Police were ordered to arrange with\r\nthe political leaders in the _Gaue_ and _Kreise_ the organization of the\r\nso-called spontaneous demonstrations against the Jews (_3051-PS_).\r\nPursuant to this directive, a large number of Jewish shops and\r\nbusinesses were pillaged and wrecked, synagogues were set on fire,\r\nindividual Jews were beaten up, and large numbers were taken off to\r\nconcentration camps. These events forcefully illustrate the employment\r\nand participation of all the _Kreisleiter_ and _Gauleiter_ in illegal\r\nmeasures designed to further the anti-Semitic program, which was an\r\noriginal and continuing objective of the Leadership Corps.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Crimes against Allied Airmen._ The members of the Leadership\r\nCorps of the Nazi Party participated in the murder, beating, and\r\nill-treatment of American airmen who landed in German or\r\nGerman-controlled territory. American airmen who bailed out of disabled\r\nplanes over Germany were not treated as prisoners of war, but were\r\nbeaten and murdered by German civilians with the active condonence,\r\nindeed at the instigation of the Leadership Corps. Such a course of\r\nconduct by the Leadership Corps represented a deliberate violation by\r\nthe German Government of its obligations, under the Geneva Prisoners of\r\nWar Convention, to protect prisoners of war against acts of violence and\r\nill-treatment.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Himmler was a _Reichsleiter_ of the Nazi Party and thus a top\r\nofficial in the Leadership Corps by virtue of his positions as\r\nReichsfuehrer of the SS and Delegate for German Folkdom (_2473-PS; Chart\r\nNo. 1_). An order signed by Himmler (_R-110_), dated 10 August 1943,\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “It is not the task of the police to interfere in clashes\r\n    between Germans and English and American terror fliers who have\r\n    bailed out.” (_R-110_)\r\n\r\nThis order was transmitted in writing to all senior executive SS and\r\npolice officers, and orally to their subordinate officers and to all\r\n_Gauleiter_.\r\n\r\nJoseph Goebbels was a top-flight official in the Leadership Corps of the\r\nNazi Party by virtue of his position as Propaganda Leader of the Party\r\n(_2473-PS; Chart No. 1_). In the issue of the _Voelkischer Beobachter_\r\nfor 26/29 May 1944, there appeared an article written by Goebbels, the\r\n_Reichsleiter_ for Party Propaganda, in which he openly invited the\r\nGerman civil population to murder Allied fliers shot down over Germany\r\n(_1676-PS_). After alleging that Anglo-American pilots have engaged in\r\nmachine gun attacks against civilians, Goebbels continues:\r\n\r\n    “It is only possible with the aid of arms to secure the lives of\r\n    enemy pilots who were shot down during such attacks, for they\r\n    would otherwise be killed by the sorely tried population. Who is\r\n    right here? The murderers who, after their cowardly misdeeds,\r\n    await a humane treatment on the part of their victims, or the\r\n    victims who wish to defend themselves according to the\r\n    principle: ‘An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth’? This\r\n    question is not hard to answer.” (_1676-PS_)\r\n\r\n_Reichsleiter_ Goebbels then proceeds to answer his question in the\r\nfollowing language:\r\n\r\n    “It seems to us hardly possible and tolerable to use German\r\n    police and soldiers against the German people when it treats\r\n    murderers of children as they deserve.” (_1676-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 30 May 1944, Bormann, _Reichsleiter_ and Chief of the Party\r\nChancellery, issued a circular letter on the subject which furnishes\r\nindisputable proof that British and American fliers who were shot down\r\nwere lynched by the German population (_057-PS_). After alleging that in\r\nrecent weeks English and American fliers had repeatedly shot children,\r\nwomen, peasants, and vehicles on the highway, Bormann then states:\r\n\r\n    “Several instances have occurred where members of the crews of\r\n    such aircraft, who have bailed out or who have made forced\r\n    landings, were lynched on the spot immediately after capture by\r\n    the populace, which was incensed to the highest degree. No\r\n    police measures or criminal proceedings were invoked against the\r\n    German civilians who participated in these incidents.”\r\n    (_057-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis letter of Bormann was distributed through the chain of command of\r\nthe Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party. Express mention on the\r\ndistribution list is made of _Reichsleiter_, _Gauleiter_, _Kreisleiter_,\r\nand leaders of the incorporated and affiliated organizations of the\r\nParty. Bormann requested that the local group leaders\r\n(_Ortsgruppenleiter_) be informed of the contents of his circular letter\r\nonly by oral means. (_057-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe effect of _Reichsleiter_ Bormann’s circular letter may be seen in an\r\norder dated 25 February 1945 (_L-154_). This is an order from Albert\r\nHoffman, an important member of the Leadership Corps by virtue of his\r\nposition as _Gauleiter_ and National Defense Commissioner of the Gau\r\nWestfalen-South, and it is addressed to all County Councillors, mayors,\r\nand police officials, and to county leaders and county staff chiefs of\r\nthe _Volkssturm_. The order reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Fighter bomber pilots who are shot down are not to be protected\r\n    against the fury of the people. I expect from all police\r\n    officers that they will refuse to lend their protection to these\r\n    gangster types. Authorities acting in contradiction to the\r\n    popular sentiment will have to account to me. All police and\r\n    gendarmerie officials are to be informed immediately of this, my\r\n    attitude.” (_L-154_)\r\n\r\nThe obligations of belligerents towards prisoners of war are clearly set\r\nforth in the Geneva Prisoners of War Convention of 27 July 1929, which\r\nwas ratified by both Germany and the United States. Article Two of the\r\nConvention provides as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Prisoners of war are in the power of the hostile power, but not\r\n    of the individuals or corps who have captured them.\r\n\r\n    “They must at all times be humanely treated and protected,\r\n    particularly against acts of violence, insults and public\r\n    curiosity.\r\n\r\n    “Measures of reprisal against them are prohibited.” (_3738-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Geneva Prisoners of War Convention clearly imposes upon its\r\nsignatories the strict obligation to protect prisoners of war from\r\nviolence. The evidence just discussed shows that the German State\r\nflagrantly violated its obligations under that Convention to protect\r\ncaptured airmen who were shot down in German hands. The evidence also\r\nproves that the entire hierarchy of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi\r\nParty participated in the conspiracy to incite the German civil\r\npopulation to murder Allied airmen and also ordered police and Party\r\nofficials to take no steps to secure the safety of these airmen.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Crimes against Foreign Labor and Civilians in Occupied Areas._\r\nAlfred Rosenberg and Robert Ley were both _Reichsleiter_ of the NSDAP.\r\n(_2473-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn agreement was concluded between the Reich Minister for the Occupied\r\nEastern Territories, _Reichsleiter_ Rosenberg, and the Director of the\r\nGerman Labor Front, _Reichsorganisationleiter_ Ley, relating to the\r\ninspection and care of foreign workers. This agreement was based on an\r\nearlier agreement of 2 June 1943 between the Deputy General for the\r\n_Arbeitseinsatz, Gauleiter_ Fritz Sauckel, and the Leader of the German\r\nLabor Front, _Reichsleiter_ for the Party Organization, Dr. Ley,\r\nconcerning a “central inspection for the care of foreign workers”\r\n(_1913-PS_). The purpose of the two agreements was to coordinate\r\nactivities of the organizations concerned with respect to the\r\nadministration of plants and camps in which foreign workers were\r\nemployed. (_1914-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 17 October 1944, _Reichsleiter_ Rosenberg sent a letter to\r\n_Reichsleiter_ Bormann, Chief of the Party Chancery, informing the\r\nlatter that he had sent a telegram to _Gauleiter_ urging them not to\r\ninterfere in the liquidation of certain listed companies and banks under\r\nhis supervision. Rosenberg emphasized to Bormann that any “delay of\r\nliquidation or * * * independent confiscation of the property by the\r\n_Gauleiter_ would impair or destroy an organized plan” for the\r\nliquidation of a vast amount of property. (_327-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 7 November 1943, the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces\r\ndelivered a lecture at Munich to the _Reichsleiter_ and _Gauleiter_. The\r\nChief of Staff stated that his object was to give a review of the\r\nstrategic position at the outset of the fifth year of war. He stated his\r\nrealization that the Political Leaders in the Reich and Gau areas, in\r\nview of their burdensome tasks in supporting the German War Effort, were\r\nin need of information he could give. He stated, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_Reichsleiter_ Bormann has requested me to give you a review\r\n    today of the strategic position in the beginning of the fifth\r\n    year of war.\r\n\r\n    “No one—the Fuehrer has ordered—may know more or be told more\r\n    than he needs for his immediate task, but I have no doubt at all\r\n    in my mind, gentlemen, but that you need a great deal in order\r\n    to be able to cope with your tasks. It is in your _Gau_, after\r\n    all * * * that all the enemy propaganda, and the malicious\r\n    rumors concentrate that try to find themselves a place among our\r\n    people * * * Against this wave of enemy propaganda and cowardice\r\n    you need to know the true situation, and, for this reason, I\r\n    believe that I am justified in giving you a perfectly open and\r\n    uncovered account of the state of affairs * * *.” (_L-172_)\r\n\r\n_Reichsleiter_ Bormann distributed to all _Reichsleiter_, _Gauleiter_,\r\nand leaders of Party affiliated organizations, by an undated letter of\r\ntransmittal, an order of the Supreme Command of the _Wehrmacht_ relating\r\nto self-defense by German guard personnel and German contractors and\r\nworkers against prisoners of war (_656-PS_). The order of the\r\n_Wehrmacht_ states that the question of treatment of prisoners of war is\r\ncontinually being discussed by _Wehrmacht_ and Party bureaus. The order\r\nstates that should prisoners of war refuse to obey orders to work, the\r\nguard has “in the case of the most pressing need and danger, the right\r\nto force obedience with the weapon if he has no other means. He can use\r\nthe weapon as much as is necessary to attain his goal * * *.” (_656-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 18 April 1944, Reich Commissar Lohse, Reich Minister for the Occupied\r\nEastern Territories, in a letter to Reich Youth Leader Axmann, proposed\r\nthat the Hitler Youth participate in and supervise the military\r\neducation of the Estonian and Latvian youth (_347-PS_). Lohse stated in\r\nthis letter that “in the military education camps, the young Latvians\r\nare trained under Latvian leaders in the Latvian language not because\r\nthis is our ideal, but because absolute military necessity demands\r\nthis.” Lohse further stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * in contrast to the Germanic peoples of the West, military\r\n    education is no longer to be carried out through voluntary\r\n    enlistments but through _legal conscription_. The camps in\r\n    Estonia and Latvia * * * will have to be under German Leadership\r\n    and, as military education camps of the Hitler Youth, they must\r\n    be a symbol of our educational mission beyond Germany’s borders\r\n    * * * I consider the execution of the military education of the\r\n    Estonian and Latvian youth not only a military necessity, but\r\n    also a war mission of the Hitler Youth especially. I would be\r\n    thankful to you, Party member Axmann, if the Hitler Youth would\r\n    put itself at our disposal with the same readiness with which\r\n    they have so far supported our work in the Baltic area.”\r\n    (_347-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe _Reichsfuehrer_ of the SS, as shown earlier, was a _Reichsleiter_ of\r\nthe NSDAP (_2473-PS_). An order of the Reich Minister of the Interior,\r\nFrick, dated 22 October 1938, provided as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsfuehrer SS and the Chief of the German Police * * *\r\n    can take the administrative measures necessary for the\r\n    maintenance of security and order, even beyond the legal limits\r\n    otherwise set on such measures.” (_1438-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis order related to the administration of the Sudeten-German\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated 23 June 1943 (_407-VI-PS_) _Gauleiter_ and\r\nPlenipotentiary for the Direction of Labor, Fritz Sauckel, wrote to\r\nHitler advising him of the success of the forced labor program as of\r\nthat date. Sauckel stated:\r\n\r\n    “You can be assured that the District of Thueringen [_Gau_] and\r\n    I will serve you and our dear people with the employment of all\r\n    strength * * *.” (_407-VI-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 1 September 1939, Hitler wrote a memorandum stating:\r\n\r\n    “_Reichsleiter_ Bouhler and Dr. Brandt, M.D., are charged with\r\n    the responsibility of enlarging the authority of certain\r\n    physicians to be designated by name in such a manner that\r\n    persons who, according to human judgment, are incurable can,\r\n    upon a most careful diagnosis of their condition of sickness, be\r\n    accorded a mercy death.\r\n\r\n    “(Signed) A. Hitler.” (_630-PS_)\r\n\r\nA handwritten note on the face of the document states:\r\n\r\n    “Given to me by Bouhler on 27 August 1940, [signed] Dr.\r\n    Guertner.” (_630-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum recording an agreement between himself and Himmler, the\r\nMinister of Justice Thierack stated that, on the suggestion of\r\n_Reichsleiter_ Bormann, an agreement had been reached between Himmler\r\nand himself with respect to “special treatment at the hands of the\r\npolice in cases where judicial sentences are not severe enough”\r\n(_654-PS_). The agreement related that:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Minister for Justice will decide whether and when\r\n    special treatment at the hands of the police is to be applied.\r\n    The Reich Fuehrer of SS will send the reports, which he sent\r\n    hitherto to Reichsleiter Bormann, to the Reich Minister for\r\n    Justice.” (_654-PS_)\r\n\r\nIf the views of the Reich Fuehrer of SS and the Reich Minister for\r\nJustice disagreed,\r\n\r\n    “the opinion of Reichsleiter Bormann will be brought to bear on\r\n    the case, and he will possibly inform the Fuehrer * * *.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The delivery of antisocial elements from execution of their\r\n    sentence to the Reich Fuehrer of SS to be worked to death.\r\n    Persons under protective arrest, Jews, Gypsies, Russians and\r\n    Ukrainians, Poles with more than 3-year sentences, Czechs and\r\n    Germans with more than 8-year sentences, according to the\r\n    decision of the Reich Minister of Justice. First of all the\r\n    worst antisocial elements amongst those just mentioned are to be\r\n    handed over. I shall inform the Fuehrer of this through\r\n    Reichsleiter Bormann.” (_654-PS_)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the “administration of justice by the people,” the\r\nmemorandum states:\r\n\r\n    “This is to be carried out step by step as soon as possible * *\r\n    * I shall rouse the Party particularly to cooperate in this\r\n    scheme by an article in the _Hoheitstrager_ [NSDAP publication]\r\n    * * *.” (_654-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the NSDAP in Kiev, the theory of the master race as the\r\nbasis of German administrative policy in the East was expressed by Koch,\r\nReich Commissioner for the Ukraine:\r\n\r\n    “We are the master race * * * I will squeeze the last drop out\r\n    of the country . . . the people must work, work and work. We are\r\n    a master race * * * the lowest German worker is racially and\r\n    biologically a thousand times more valuable than the people\r\n    here.” (_1130-PS_)\r\n\r\nA letter from RSHA (Reich Security Main Office) to police chiefs, dated\r\n5 November 1942, recites an agreement between the Reich Fuehrer SS and\r\nthe Reich Minister of Justice, approved by Hitler, providing that\r\nordinary criminal procedure was no longer to be applied to Poles and\r\nmembers of the Eastern populations (_L-316_). The agreement provided\r\nthat such people, including Jews and Gypsies, should henceforth be\r\nturned over to the police. The principles applicable to a determination\r\nof the punishment of German offenders, including appraisal of the\r\nmotives of the offender, were not to be applied to foreign offenders.\r\nThe letter stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * the offense committed by a person of foreign extraction\r\n    is not to be regarded from the view of legal retribution by way\r\n    of justice, but from the point of view of preventing dangers\r\n    through police action. From this it follows that the criminal\r\n    procedure against persons of foreign extraction must be\r\n    transferred from Justice to the Police. The preceding statements\r\n    serve for personal information. There are no objections if the\r\n    _Gauleiter_ are informed in the usual form should the need arise\r\n    * * *.” (_L-316_)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the evacuation, deportation, and Germanization of the\r\ncivilian population of the incorporated eastern territories,\r\nReichsfuehrer SS Himmler, in his capacity as Reich Commissioner for the\r\nConsolidation of German Nationhood, issued several decrees requiring the\r\ndeportation to Germany of all Germans from such territories who had\r\nrenounced their nationality during the existence of the Polish State\r\n(_R-112_). These decrees directed that persons affected by the\r\nprovisions thereof who failed to comply were to be sent to concentration\r\ncamps. After deportation to Germany, such persons were to be closely\r\nsupervised by NSDAP “Counsellors” and secret police to insure their\r\nGermanization. Certain of the decrees directing such deportation are\r\naddressed, _inter alia_, to the “_Gauleiter_” and the “Reich Governors\r\nin the Reich _Gaue_.” (_R-112_)\r\n\r\nIn a conference with _Reichsleiter_ Rosenberg, Hitler emphasized that he\r\n“wished to have the Crimea cleaned out,” and Rosenberg stated that he\r\nhad given much consideration to renaming the towns in the Crimea in\r\norder to invest the area with a German character. (_1517-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a speech to a gathering of persons intimately concerned with the\r\nEastern problem on 20 June 1941, _Reichsleiter_ Rosenberg stated that\r\nthe southern Russian territories and the northern Caucasus would have to\r\nprovide food for the German people:\r\n\r\n    “We see absolutely no obligation on our part to feed also the\r\n    Russian people with the products of that surplus territory. We\r\n    know that this is a harsh necessity, bare of any feelings * *\r\n    *.” (_1058-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg stated that, as a consequence of the above policy, extensive\r\nevacuations of Russians from that Area would have to take place.\r\n(_1058-PS_)\r\n\r\n_Gauleiter_ Wagner of the German-occupied Areas of Alsace prepared plans\r\nand took measures leading to the expulsion and deportation of certain\r\ngroups within the Alsatian civil population. His plans called for the\r\nforcible expulsion of certain categories of so-called undesirable\r\npersons, as a means of punishment and compulsory Germanization. The\r\n_Gauleiter_ supervised deportation measures in Alsace from July to\r\nDecember 1940, in the course of which 105,000 persons were either\r\nexpelled or prevented from returning. A memorandum, dated 4 August 1942,\r\nof a meeting of high SS and police officials, convened to receive the\r\nreports and plans of the _Gauleiter_ relating to the Alsatian\r\nevacuations, states that the persons deported were mainly—\r\n\r\n    “Jews, Gypsies and other foreign racial elements, criminals,\r\n    asocial and incurably insane persons, as well as Frenchmen and\r\n    Francophiles.” (_R-114_)\r\n\r\nAccording to the memorandum, the _Gauleiter_ stated that the Fuehrer had\r\ngiven him permission “to cleanse Alsace of all foreign, sick, or\r\nunreliable elements,” and emphasized the political necessity of further\r\ndeportation. The memorandum further records that the SS and police\r\nofficials present at the above conference approved the _Gauleiter’s_\r\nproposals for further evacuation. (_R-114_)\r\n\r\nA second memorandum, dated 17 August 1942, relating to a conference\r\ncalled by SS-Gruppenfuehrer Kaul, held at the _Gauleiter_ office at\r\nKarlsruhe for the purpose of considering the deportation of Alsatians\r\ninto Germany, states that the _Gauleiter_ had reported to the Fuehrer\r\nwith respect to the proposed evacuation of Alsatians. It is further\r\nstated that the Fuehrer verbally declared that “asocial and criminal\r\npersons” were to be expelled. The _Gauleiter_ stated at the above\r\nconference that the action leading to such evacuation had already begun.\r\nThe _Gauleiter_ further declared that he intended to offset the loss of\r\npopulation as far as possible by transplantation of people from Baden,\r\n“thus creating a uniform race mixture.” (_R-114_)\r\n\r\nA memorandum by _Reichsleiter_ Bormann of a conference called by Hitler\r\nat his headquarters on 16 July 1941 (_L-221_), states, in part, as\r\nfollows with respect to the maintenance of order in the occupied Eastern\r\nareas:\r\n\r\n    “The Crimea has to be evacuated by all foreigners and to be\r\n    settled by Germans only * * *. We have now to face the task of\r\n    cutting up the giant cake according to our needs in order to be\r\n    able first, to dominate it, second, to administer it, and third,\r\n    to exploit it. The Russians have now ordered partisan warfare\r\n    behind our front. This partisan war * * * has some advantage for\r\n    us; it enables us to eradicate everyone who opposes us. * * *\r\n    Our iron principle is and has to remain: we must never permit\r\n    anybody but the Germans to carry arms * * *.” (_L-221_)\r\n\r\nAccording to the above memorandum, the foregoing conference was attended\r\nby _Reichsleiter_ Rosenberg, Reich Minister Lammers, Field Marshal\r\nKeitel, Reich Marshal Goering, and Bormann, and lasted about 20 hours.\r\nThe memorandum states that discussion occurred with respect to the\r\nannexation by Germany of various parts of conquered Europe. The\r\nmemorandum also states that a long discussion took place with respect to\r\nthe qualifications of _Gauleiter_ Lohse, who was proposed by Rosenberg\r\nat the conference as governor of the Baltic country. Discussion also\r\noccurred with respect to the qualifications of other _Gauleiter_ and\r\ncommissioners for the administration of various areas of occupied\r\nRussia. Goering stated that he intended to appoint _Gauleiter_ Terboven\r\nfor the “exploitation of the Kola Peninsula: the Fuehrer agrees.” With\r\nrespect to the security of the German administration in the eastern\r\nareas, the memorandum states:\r\n\r\n    “This giant area would have to be pacified as quickly as\r\n    possible; the best solution was to shoot anybody who looked\r\n    sideways * * * Field Marshal Keitel emphasizes the inhabitants\r\n    themselves ought to be made responsible for their things because\r\n    it was, of course, impossible to put a sentry in front of every\r\n    shed or railway station. The inhabitants had to understand that\r\n    anybody who did not perform their duties properly would be shot,\r\n    and that they would be held responsible for each offense.”\r\n    (_L-221_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Subversion of Christian Church and Persecution of the Clergy._\r\nThe evidence relating to the systematic effort of the conspirators to\r\neliminate the Christian churches in Germany is discussed in Section 6 of\r\nChapter VII. The evidence hereinafter taken up is limited to proving the\r\nresponsibility of the Leadership Corps and its members for participation\r\nin illegal activities against the Christian church and clergy.\r\n\r\nBormann, who was a _Reichsleiter_ and Chief of the Nazi Party\r\nChancellery, issued a secret decree addressed to all _Gauleiter_,\r\nentitled “Relationship of National Socialism and Christianity” (_D-75_).\r\nIn this decree _Reichsleiter_ Bormann flatly declared that National\r\nSocialism and Christianity are incompatible and that the influence of\r\nthe churches in Germany must be eliminated:\r\n\r\n    “National Socialist and Christian concepts are irreconcilable. *\r\n    * * Our National Socialist ideology is far loftier than the\r\n    concepts of Christianity, which, in their essential points, have\r\n    been taken over from Jewry. For this reason also, we do not need\r\n    Christianity. * * * If, therefore, in the future our youth\r\n    learns nothing more of this Christianity, whose doctrines are\r\n    far below ours, Christianity will disappear by itself. * * * It\r\n    follows from the irreconcilability of National Socialist and\r\n    Christian concepts that a strengthening of existing confessions\r\n    and every demand of originating Christian confessions is to be\r\n    rejected by us. A differentiation between the various Christian\r\n    confessions is not to be made here. For this reason, also, the\r\n    thought of an erection of an Evangelical National Church by\r\n    merger of the various Evangelical churches has been definitely\r\n    given up, because the Evangelical Church is just as inimicable\r\n    to us as the Catholic Church. Any strengthening of the\r\n    Evangelical Church would merely react against us. * * *\r\n\r\n    “For the first time in German history, the Fuehrer consciously\r\n    and completely has the leadership of the people in his own hand.\r\n    With the Party, its components, and attached units, the Fuehrer\r\n    has created for himself, and thereby the German Reich\r\n    leadership, an instrument which makes him independent of the\r\n    Church. All influences which might impair or damage the\r\n    leadership of the people exercised by the Fuehrer, with the help\r\n    of the NSDAP, must be eliminated. More and more the people must\r\n    be separated from the churches and their organs, the pastors. Of\r\n    course, the churches must and will, seen from their viewpoint,\r\n    defend themselves against this loss of power. But never again\r\n    must an influence on leadership of the people be yielded to the\r\n    churches. This influence must be broken completely and finally.\r\n\r\n    “Only the Reich Government and, by its direction, the Party, its\r\n    components and attached units have a right to leadership of the\r\n    people. Just as the deleterious influences of astrologers, seers\r\n    and other fakers are eliminated and suppressed by the State, so\r\n    must the possibility of Church influence also be totally\r\n    removed. Not until this has happened, does the State leadership\r\n    have influence on the individual citizens. Not until then are\r\n    people and Reich secure in their existence for all the future.”\r\n    (_D-75_)\r\n\r\nOn 25 April 1941 a letter was issued from Bormann’s office to Rosenberg,\r\nin his capacity as the Fuehrer’s Representative for the Supervision of\r\nthe Entire Mental and Ideological Training and Education of the NSDAP\r\n(_070-PS_). In this letter Bormann’s office stated that measures had\r\nbeen taken leading to the progressive cancellation of morning prayers\r\nand other religious services and their substitution by Nazi mottos and\r\nslogans:\r\n\r\n    “We are inducing schools more and more to reduce and abolish\r\n    religious morning services. Similarly the confessional and\r\n    general prayers in several parts of the Reich have already been\r\n    replaced by national socialist mottos. I would be grateful, to\r\n    know your opinion on a future national socialist morning service\r\n    instead of the present confessional morning services which are\r\n    usually conducted once per week * * *.” (_070-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a letter from _Reichsleiter_ Bormann to _Reichsleiter_ Rosenberg,\r\ndated 22 February 1940, Bormann declared to Rosenberg that the Christian\r\nreligion and National Socialism are incompatible (_098-PS_). Bormann\r\ncited, as examples of hostile divergence between Naziism and the\r\nchurches, the attitude of the latter on the racial question, celibacy of\r\nthe priests, monasteries and nunneries, etc. Bormann further declared\r\nthat the churches could not be subjugated through compromise, but only\r\nthrough a new philosophy of life as prophesied in Rosenberg’s writings.\r\nIn this letter, Bormann proposed the creation of a National Socialist\r\nCatechism, in order to give that part of the German youth which declines\r\nto practice confessional religion, a moral foundation, and to lay a\r\nmoral basis for National Socialist doctrines, which were gradually to\r\nsupplant the Christian religions. Bormann suggested that some of the Ten\r\nCommandments could be merged with the National Socialist Catechism and\r\nstated that a few new Commandments should be added, such as: Thou shalt\r\nbe courageous; Thou shalt not be cowardly; Thou shalt believe in God’s\r\npresence in the living nature, animals, and plants; Thou shalt keep thy\r\nblood pure; etc. Deputy of the Fuehrer Bormann concluded that he\r\nconsidered the problem so important that it should be discussed with the\r\nmembers of the Reich Directorate, comprising the top leaders of the\r\nLeadership Corps of the Nazi Party, as soon as possible. (_098-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt one point in this letter, Bormann stated:\r\n\r\n    “Christianity and National Socialism are phenomena which\r\n    originated from entirely different basic causes. Both differ\r\n    fundamentally so strongly, that it will not be possible to\r\n    construct a Christian teaching which would be completely\r\n    compatible with the point of view of the National Socialist\r\n    ideology; just as the communications of Christian faith would\r\n    never be able to stand by the ideology of National Socialism in\r\n    its entirety * * *.” (_098-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter discussing various proposals for the formulation of a Nazi\r\nreligious credo for instruction in the German school system, Bormann\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer’s deputy finds it necessary that all these\r\n    questions should be thoroughly discussed in the near future in\r\n    the presence of the Reich Leaders [_Reichsleiter_] who are\r\n    especially effected by them * * *.” (_098-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a circular letter, dated 17 June 1938, addressed by Bormann as\r\n_Reichsleiter_ and Deputy of the Fuehrer to all _Reichsleiter_ and\r\n_Gauleiter_, there was enclosed a copy of rules prepared by\r\n_Reichsleiter_ Hierl, setting forth certain restrictive regulations with\r\nrespect to participation of the Reich Labor Service in religious\r\ncelebrations (_107-PS_). Pertinent portions of the directives issued by\r\n_Reichsleiter_ Hierl read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Labor Service is a training school in which the\r\n    German youth should be educated to national unity in the spirit\r\n    of National Socialism * * *.\r\n\r\n    “What religious beliefs a person has is not a decisive factor,\r\n    but it is decisive that he first of all feels himself a German.\r\n\r\n    “Every religious practice is forbidden in the Reich Labor\r\n    Service because it disturbs the comradelike harmony of all\r\n    working men and women.\r\n\r\n    “On this basis, every participation of the Reich Labor Service\r\n    in churchly, that is religious, arrangements and celebrations is\r\n    not possible.” (_107-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe position of Bormann as Deputy of the Fuehrer and chief of the Nazi\r\nParty Chancellery, and the position of Rosenberg as the Fuehrer’s\r\nRepresentative for the Whole Spiritual and Philosophical Education of\r\nthe Nazi Party, give to the foregoing views on religion and religious\r\npolicy the highest official backing. The anti-Christian utterances and\r\npolicies of these two conspirator-defendants reveal a community of mind\r\nand intention amongst the most powerful leaders of the party which was\r\namply confirmed by the actual treatment of the churches since 1933 and\r\nthroughout the course of the conspiracy. An excerpt from page 514 of\r\n“The Myth of the 20th Century,” written by Rosenberg, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The idea of honor—national honor—is for us the beginning and\r\n    the end of our entire thinking and doing. It does not admit of\r\n    any equal-valued center of force along side of it, no matter of\r\n    what kind, neither Christian love, nor the Free-Masonic\r\n    humanity, nor the Roman philosophy.” (_2349-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition to promoting beliefs and practices fundamentally\r\nincompatible with Christianity, the Leadership Corps participated in the\r\npersecution of priests, clergy, and members of religious orders. A\r\nGestapo telegram, dated 24 July 1938, dispatched from Berlin to\r\nNurnberg, deals with demonstrations and acts of violence against Bishop\r\nSproll in Rottenburg (_848-PS_). The Gestapo office in Berlin wired its\r\nNurnberg office the following teletype account received from its\r\nStuttgart office of disorderly conduct and vandalism carried out by Nazi\r\nParty members against Bishop Sproll:\r\n\r\n    “The Party on 23 July 1939 from 2100 on carried out the third\r\n    demonstration against Bishop Sproll. Participants, about\r\n    2500-3000, were brought in from outside by bus, etc. The\r\n    Rottenburg populace again did not participate in the\r\n    demonstration. This town took rather hostile attitude toward the\r\n    demonstrations. The action got completely out of hand of the\r\n    Party member responsible for it. The demonstrators stormed the\r\n    palace, beat in the gates and doors. About 150 to 200 people\r\n    forced their way into the palace, searched through the rooms,\r\n    threw files out of the windows and rummaged through the beds in\r\n    the rooms of the palace. One bed was ignited * * * The Bishop\r\n    was with Archbishop Groeber of Freiburg and the ladies and\r\n    gentlemen of his menage in the chapel at prayer. About 25 to 30\r\n    people pressed into this chapel and molested those present.\r\n    Bishop Groeber was taken for Bishop Sproll. He was grabbed by\r\n    the robe and dragged back and forth * * *.” (_848-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Gestapo official in Stuttgart added that Bishop Groeber desired “to\r\nturn to the Fuehrer and Reich Minister of the Interior, Dr. Frick,\r\nanew”; and that he had found a full report of the demonstration after\r\n“suppressing counter mass meetings.” (_848-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 23 July 1938 the Reich Minister for Church Affairs, Kerrl, sent a\r\nletter to the Minister of State and Chief of the Praesidium Chancellery,\r\nBerlin, stating that Bishop Sproll had angered the population by\r\nabstaining from the plebiscite of 10 April (_849-PS_). In this letter\r\nKerrl stated that the _Gauleiter_ and Governor of Wuerttemberg had\r\ndecided that, in the interest of preserving the State’s authority and in\r\nthe interest of quiet and order, Bishop Sproll could no longer remain in\r\noffice. The letter reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The Reich Governor had explained to the Ecclesiastical\r\n    Board that he would no longer regard Bishop Sproll as Head of\r\n    the Diocese of Rottenburg on account of his refraining from the\r\n    election in the office and that he desired Bishop Sproll to\r\n    leave the Gau area * * * because he could assume no guarantee\r\n    for his personal safety; that in the case of the return of the\r\n    Bishop of Rottenburg he would see to it that all personal and\r\n    official intercourse with him on the part of State offices as\r\n    well as Party offices and the Armed Forces would be denied.”\r\n    (_849-PS_)\r\n\r\nKerrl further stated in the foregoing letter that his Deputy had moved\r\nthe Foreign Office, through the German Embassy at the Vatican, to urge\r\nthe Holy See to persuade Bishop Sproll to resign his Bishopric. Kerrl\r\nconcluded by stating that should the effort to procure the Bishop’s\r\nresignation prove unsuccessful\r\n\r\n    “* * * the Bishop would have to be exiled from the land or there\r\n    would have to be a complete boycott of the Bishop by the\r\n    authorities * * *.” (_849-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 14 July 1939 Bormann, in his capacity as Deputy of the Fuehrer,\r\nissued a party regulation which required party members entering the\r\nclergy or undertaking the study of theology to leave the party\r\n(_840-PS_). The last paragraph of the regulation reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I decree that in the future party members who enter the clergy\r\n    or who turn to the study of theology have to leave the party.”\r\n    (_840-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn this directive Bormann also referred to an earlier decree, dated 9\r\nFebruary 1937, in which he had ruled that the admission of members of\r\nthe clergy into the party was to be avoided. In that decree also Bormann\r\nreferred with approval to a regulation of the Reich Treasurer of the\r\nNSDAP, dated 10 May 1939, providing that—\r\n\r\n    “clergymen, as well as other fellow Germans, who are also\r\n    closely connected with the church, cannot be admitted into the\r\n    party.” (_840-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the Allocution of His Holiness, Pope Pius XII, to the Sacred College\r\non 2 June 1945, His Holiness, after declaring that he had acquired an\r\nappreciation of the great qualities of the German people in the course\r\nof 12 years of residence in their midst, expressed the hope that Germany\r\ncould rise to new dignity and new life once it had laid the satanic\r\nspecter raised by National Socialism, and after the guilty had expiated\r\nthe crimes they have committed (_3268-PS_). After referring to repeated\r\nviolations by the German government of the Concordat concluded in 1933,\r\nHis Holiness declared:\r\n\r\n    “The struggle against the Church did, in fact, become ever more\r\n    bitter: there was the dissolution of Catholic organizations; the\r\n    gradual suppression of the flourishing Catholic schools, both\r\n    public and private; the enforced weaning of youth from family\r\n    and Church; the pressure brought to bear on the conscience of\r\n    citizens, and especially of civil servants; the systematic\r\n    defamation, by means of a clever, closely-organized propaganda,\r\n    of the Church, the clergy, the faithful, the Church’s\r\n    institutions, teachings and history; the closing, dissolution,\r\n    confiscation of religious houses and other ecclesiastical\r\n    institutions; the complete suppression of the Catholic press and\r\n    publishing houses * * *.\r\n\r\n    “In the meantime the Holy See itself multiplied its\r\n    representations and protests to governing authorities in\r\n    Germany, reminding them, in clear and energetic language, of\r\n    their duty to respect and fulfill the obligations of the natural\r\n    law itself that were confirmed by the Concordat. In those\r\n    critical years, joining the alert vigilance of a Pastor to the\r\n    long-suffering patience of a father, Our great Predecessor Pius\r\n    XI fulfilled his mission as Supreme Pontiff with intrepid\r\n    courage.\r\n\r\n    “But when, after he had tried all means of persuasion in vain,\r\n    he saw himself clearly faced with deliberate violations of a\r\n    solemn pact, with a religious persecution masked or open, but\r\n    always rigorously organized, he proclaimed to the world, on\r\n    Passion Sunday 1937, in his Encyclical _Mit brennender Sorge_,\r\n    what National-Socialism really was; the arrogant apostasy from\r\n    Jesus Christ, the denial of His doctrine and of His work of\r\n    redemption, the cult of violence, the idolatry of race and\r\n    blood, the overthrow of human liberty and dignity * * *.\r\n\r\n    “From the prisons, concentration camps and fortresses are now\r\n    pouring out, together with the political prisoners, also the\r\n    crowds of those, whether clergy or laymen, whose only crime was\r\n    their fidelity to Christ and to the faith of their fathers or\r\n    the dauntless fulfillment of their duties as priests * * *.\r\n\r\n    “In the forefront, the number and harshness of the treatment\r\n    meted out to them, were the Polish priests. From 1940 to 1945,\r\n    2,800 Polish ecclesiastica and religious were imprisoned in that\r\n    camp; among them was the Auxiliary bishop of Wloclawek, who died\r\n    there of typhus. In April last there were left only 816, all the\r\n    others being dead except for two or three transferred to another\r\n    camp. In the summer of 1942, 480 German-speaking ministers of\r\n    religion were known to be gathered there; of these, 45 were\r\n    Protestants, all the others Catholic priests. In spite of the\r\n    continuous inflow of new internees, especially from some\r\n    dioceses of Bavaria, Rhenania and Westphalia, their number, as a\r\n    result of the high rate of mortality, at the beginning of this\r\n    year, did not surpass 350. Nor should we pass over in silence\r\n    those belonging to occupied territories, Holland, Belgium,\r\n    France (among whom the Bishop of Clermont), Luxembourg,\r\n    Slovenia, Italy. Many of those priests and laymen endured\r\n    indescribable sufferings for their faith and for their vocation.\r\n    In one case the hatred of the impious against Christ reached the\r\n    point of parodying on the person of an interned priest, with\r\n    barbed wire, the scourging and crowning with thorns of our\r\n    Redeemer.” (_3268-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Leadership Corps participated in the confiscation of church and\r\nreligious property. A letter dated 19 April 1941 from _Reichsleiter_\r\nBormann to _Reichsleiter_ Rosenberg exposes the participation of the\r\n_Gauleiter_ in measures relating to the confiscation of religious\r\nproperty (_072-PS_). The letter reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The libraries and art objects of the monasteries confiscated in\r\n    the Reich were to remain for the time being in these\r\n    monasteries, insofar as the Gauleiter had not determined\r\n    otherwise.” (_072-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 21 February 1940, the Chief of the Security Police and SD, Heydrich,\r\nwrote a letter to the Reichsfuehrer SS, Himmler, proposing that certain\r\nlisted churches and monasteries be confiscated for the accommodation of\r\nso-called racial Germans. (Himmler was a _Reichsleiter_ in the\r\nLeadership Corps by virtue of his position as Reichsfuehrer of the SS.)\r\nAfter pointing out that, on political grounds, outright expropriation of\r\nreligious property would not be feasible at the time, Heydrich suggested\r\ncertain specious interim actions with respect to the church properties\r\nin question, to be followed progressively by outright confiscation\r\n(_R-101-A_). Heydrich’s letter makes the following statements:\r\n\r\n    “Enclosed is a list of church possessions which might be\r\n    available for the accommodation of Racial Germans. The list,\r\n    which please return, is supplemented by correspondence and\r\n    illustrated material pertinent to the subject.\r\n\r\n    “For political reasons, expropriation without indemnity of the\r\n    entire property of the churches and religious orders will hardly\r\n    be possible at this time.\r\n\r\n    “Expropriation with indemnity or in return for assignment of\r\n    other lands and grounds will be even less possible.\r\n\r\n    “It is therefore suggested that the respective authorities of\r\n    the Orders be instructed that they make available the\r\n    monasteries concerned for the accommodation of Racial Germans\r\n    and remove their own members to other less populous monasteries.\r\n    [Marginal note in pencil opposite this paragraph: “Very good!”]\r\n\r\n    “The final expropriation of these properties thus placed at our\r\n    disposal can then be carried out step by step in course of\r\n    time.” (_R-101-A_)\r\n\r\nOn 5 April 1940, the Chief of the Security Police and of the Security\r\nService SS sent a letter to the Reich Commissioner for the consolidation\r\nof Germandom, enclosing a copy of the foregoing letter from Heydrich to\r\nHimmler proposing the confiscation of church properties (_R-101-A_). The\r\nletter of 5 April 1940 stated:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Leader SS has agreed to the proposals made in the\r\n    enclosed letter and has ordered the matter to be dealt with by\r\n    collaboration between the Chief of the Security Police and\r\n    Security Service and your office.” (_R-101-A_)\r\n\r\nA letter dated 30 July 1941 (_R-101-C_) written by an\r\nSS-Standartenfuehrer whose signature is illegible, to the Reich Leader\r\nof the SS, supplies further evidence of the participation of the\r\n_Gauleiter_ in the seizure of church property:\r\n\r\n    “Further to report of 30 May 1941 this office considers it its\r\n    duty to call the Reich Leader’s attention to the development\r\n    which is currently taking place in the incorporated Eastern\r\n    countries with regard to seizure and confiscation of Church\r\n    property.\r\n\r\n    “As soon as the Reich Laws on expropriation had been introduced,\r\n    the Reich Governor and _Gauleiter_ in the Wartheland adopted the\r\n    practice of expropriating real estate belonging to churches for\r\n    use as dwellings. He grants compensation to the extent of the\r\n    assessed value and pays the equivalent amount into blocked\r\n    accounts.\r\n\r\n    “Moreover the East German Estate Administration Limited reports\r\n    that in the ‘_Warthegau_’ all real estate owned by the churches\r\n    is being claimed by the local _Gau_ administration\r\n    [_Gauselbstverwaltung_].” (_R-101-C_)\r\n\r\nAnother letter, this one from the Chief of the Staff Main Office to\r\nHimmler, dated 30 March 1942, dealing with the confiscation of church\r\nproperty, evidences the active participation of the Party Chancellery in\r\nthe confiscation of religious property (_R-101-D_). In this letter the\r\nChief of the Staff Main Office reports to Himmler concerning the policy\r\nof the SS in suspending all payments of rent to monasteries and other\r\nchurch institutions whose property had been expropriated. The letter\r\ndiscusses a proposal made by the Reich Minister of the Interior, in\r\nwhich the Party Chancery prominently participated, to the effect that\r\nthe church institutions should be paid amounts corresponding to current\r\nmortgage charges on the premises without realizing any profit. The\r\nwriter further suggests that such payments should never be made directly\r\nto the ecclesiastical institutions but rather should be made to the\r\ncreditors of such institutions:\r\n\r\n    “Such an arrangement would be in line with the basic idea of the\r\n    settlement originally worked out between the Party Chancery and\r\n    the Reich Minister of the Interior.” (_R-101-D_)\r\n\r\nThe Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party participated in the suppression\r\nof religious publications and interfered with free religious education.\r\nIn a letter dated 27 September 1940, _Reichsleiter_ and Deputy of the\r\nFuehrer Bormann transmitted to Rosenberg a photostatic copy of a letter\r\nfrom _Gauleiter_ Florian to Hess, dated 23 September 1940, which\r\nexpresses the _Gauleiter’s_ intense disapproval on Nazi ideological\r\ngrounds of a religious pamphlet entitled “The Spirit and Soul of the\r\nSoldiers,” written by a Major General von Rabenau (_064-PS_). The\r\n_Gauleiter_ urges that the religious writings of General von Rabenau be\r\nsuppressed. Florian also discusses a conversation he had with General\r\nvon Rabenau at the close of a lecture delivered by the General to a\r\ngroup of younger Army officers at Aachen. This conversation illumines\r\nthe hostile attitude of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party toward\r\nthe Christian churches:\r\n\r\n    “After he had affirmed the necessity of the churches, Rabenau\r\n    said, with emphasized self-assurance, something like the\r\n    following: ‘Dear Gauleiter, the Party is making mistake after\r\n    mistake in the business with the churches. Obtain for me the\r\n    necessary powers from the Fuehrer and I guarantee that I shall\r\n    succeed in a few months in establishing peace with the churches\r\n    for all times.’ After this catastrophic ignorance, I gave up the\r\n    conversation. Dear Party Member Hess: the reading of von\r\n    Rabenau’s pamphlet ‘Spirit and Soul of the Soldier’ has reminded\r\n    me again of this. In this brochure, Rabenau affirms the\r\n    necessity of the Church straight-forward and clearly, even if it\r\n    is prudently careful. He writes on page 28 ‘There could be more\r\n    examples; they would suffice to show that a soldier in this\r\n    world can scarcely get along without thoughts about the next\r\n    one.’ Because von Rabenau is falsely based spiritually, I\r\n    consider his activities as an educator in spiritual affairs as\r\n    dangerous, and I am of the opinion that his educational writings\r\n    are to be dispensed with absolutely and that the publication\r\n    section of the NSDAP can and must renounce these writings * * *\r\n    The churches with their Christianity are this danger against\r\n    which the struggle must always be carried on.” (_064-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat the Party Chancellery shared the _Gauleiter’s_ hostility to the\r\nChristian churches is further revealed by Bormann’s instruction to\r\nRosenberg to “take action” on the _Gauleiter’s_ recommendation that the\r\nGeneral’s writings be suppressed. (_064-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother letter from Bormann to Rosenberg, dated 8 March 1940, enclosed a\r\ncopy of Bormann’s letter of the same date to _Reichsleiter_ Amann\r\n(_089-PS_). Amann was a top member of the Leadership Corps by virtue of\r\nhis position as _Reichsleiter_ for the Press and Leader of the Party\r\nPublishing Company. In this letter to Amann, Bormann expressed his\r\ndismay and dissatisfaction that only 10 percent of the 3,000 Protestant\r\nperiodicals in Germany had ceased publication for what are described as\r\n“paper saving” reasons. Bormann then advised Amann that “the\r\ndistribution of any paper whatsoever for such periodicals” was barred\r\n(_089-PS_). Bormann also instructed Amann to make sharper restrictions\r\nin the distribution of paper against religious writings in favor of\r\npublications more acceptable to the Nazi ideology:\r\n\r\n    “I urge you [Bormann is addressing _Reichsleiter_ Amann] to see\r\n    to it in any redistribution of paper to be considered later that\r\n    the confessional writing, which according to experiences so far\r\n    gathered possesses very doubtful value for strengthening the\r\n    power of resistance of the people toward the external foe\r\n    receives still sharper restrictions in favor of literature,\r\n    politically and ideologically more valuable.” (_089-PS_)\r\n\r\nA further letter from Bormann to Rosenberg, dated 17 January 1940,\r\nexpressed the Party’s opposition to the circulation of religious\r\nliterature to the members of the German Armed Forces (_101-PS_).\r\nPertinent excerpts from Bormann’s letter read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Nearly all the districts [_Gaue_] report to me regularly that\r\n    the churches of both confessions are administering spiritually\r\n    to members of the Armed Forces. This administering finds its\r\n    expression especially in the fact that soldiers are being sent\r\n    religious publications by the spiritual leaders of the home\r\n    congregations. These publications are, in part, very cleverly\r\n    composed. I have repeated reports that these publications are\r\n    being read by the troops and thereby exercise a certain\r\n    influence on the morale.\r\n\r\n    “I have, in the past, sought by sounding out the General Field\r\n    Marshal, the High Command of the Armed Forces, and * * * Reich\r\n    Director Amann, to restrict considerably the production and\r\n    shipment of publications of this type. The result of these\r\n    efforts remains unsatisfactory. As _Reichsleiter_ Amann has\r\n    repeatedly informed me, the restriction of these pamphlets by\r\n    means of the * * * paper rationing has not been achieved because\r\n    the paper * * * is being purchased on the open market.\r\n\r\n    “If the influencing of the soldiers by the church is to be\r\n    effectively combatted, this will only be accomplished by\r\n    producing many good publications in the shortest possible time\r\n    under the supervision of the Party * * *.\r\n\r\n    “Thus at the last meeting of the Deputy _Gauleiters_, comments\r\n    were uttered on this matter to the effect that a considerable\r\n    quantity of such publications are not available.\r\n\r\n    “I maintain that it is necessary that in the near future we\r\n    transmit to the Party Service Office down to\r\n    _Ortsgruppenleitern_ a list of additional publications of this\r\n    sort which should be sent to our soldiers by the _Ortsgruppen_.\r\n    * * *” (_101-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Leadership Corps also participated in measures leading to the\r\nclosing and dissolution of theological schools and other religious\r\ninstitutions. In a letter dated 17 April 1939 Bormann transmitted to\r\nRosenberg photostatic copy of a plan suggested by the Reich Minister for\r\nScience, Education, and Training for the combining and closing of\r\ncertain specifically listed theological faculties (_122-PS_). In his\r\nletter of transmittal Bormann requested Rosenberg to take “cognizance\r\nand prompt action” with respect to proposed suppression of religious\r\ninstitutions. The plan to suppress the religious institutions was\r\nsummarized as follows:\r\n\r\n    “To recapitulate, this plan would include the complete closing\r\n    of the theological faculties at Innsbruck, Salzburg, and Munich,\r\n    the transfer of the faculty of Graz to Vienna, and the vanishing\r\n    of four Catholic faculties; closing of three Catholic\r\n    theological faculties or higher schools, and of four evangelical\r\n    faculties in the Winter semester 1939/1940; closing of one\r\n    further Catholic and of three further evangelical faculties in\r\n    the near future.” (_122-PS_)\r\n\r\nA final letter from Bormann to Rosenberg, dated 24 January 1939,\r\nenclosed for Rosenberg’s cognizance a copy of Bormann’s letter to the\r\nReich Minister for Knowledge and Education (_116-PS_). In the enclosed\r\nletter, Bormann informed the Minister as to the Party’s position in\r\nfavor of restricting and suppressing theological faculties. Bormann\r\nstated that, owing to the effects of the introduction of military\r\nservice, the consequences of the Four Year Plan, and the extraordinary\r\nlack of replacements, it would become necessary to carry out a\r\nreorganization of the German high schools. In view of these\r\ndevelopments, he requested the Minister to restrict and suppress the\r\ntheological faculties:\r\n\r\n    “* * * I would appreciate it very much if you would restrict the\r\n    theological faculties in so far as they cannot be wholly\r\n    suppressed in accordance with the above statement. I request in\r\n    this instance the omission of any expressed declaration to the\r\n    Churches or to other places, as well as the avoiding of a public\r\n    announcement of these measures. Complaints and the like must be\r\n    answered (if they are to be replied to) in the fashion that\r\n    these measures are being executed in the course of the economic\r\n    plan of reorganization and that similar things are happening to\r\n    other faculties.\r\n\r\n    “I would appreciate it very much if professional chairs thus\r\n    vacated can be then turned over to the newly created fields of\r\n    inquiry of these last years, such as Racial Research,\r\n    Archeological Studies, etc.” (_116-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing evidence it is clear the Leadership Corps of the Nazi\r\nParty shares in the responsibility for the measures taken to subvert the\r\nChristian churches and persecute the Christian clergy, both in Germany\r\nand in German-occupied territories of Europe. The Prosecution stresses\r\nthe significance of the appointment of Rosenberg, whose anti-Christian\r\nviews are open and notorious, as the Fuehrer’s Representative for the\r\nWhole Spiritual and Philosophical Education of the Nazi Party. It was\r\nprecisely this position which gave Rosenberg his seat in the\r\n_Reichsleitung_. But emphasis is placed not merely upon the fact that\r\nanti-Christs such as Bormann and Rosenberg held directive positions\r\nwithin the Leadership Corps, but upon the further fact that their\r\ndirectives and orders were passed down the chain of command of the\r\nLeadership Corps and caused the participation of its membership in acts\r\nsubversive of the Christian Church.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Destruction of the Free Trade Unions, Imposition of Nazi Control\r\nover the Productive Labor Capacity of Germany._ The evidence relating to\r\nthe destruction of the independent trade unions is discussed in Section\r\n5 of Chapter VII. The evidence hereinafter taken up is offered to prove\r\nthe responsibility of the Leadership Corps for participation in the\r\nsmashing of the unions and the imposition of Nazi Party control over the\r\nproductive labor capacity of the German nation.\r\n\r\nSoon after the seizure of power (mid-April 1933), _Reichsleiter_ Robert\r\nLey was directed by Hitler to smash the independent unions.\r\n_Reichsleiter_ Ley, in his speech to the Nurnberg Party Congress of\r\n1936, declared:\r\n\r\n    “* * * My Fuehrer! When you, my Fuehrer, ordered me in mid-April\r\n    1933 to take over the trade unions, I could not understand why\r\n    you gave this order to me since I could not see any connection\r\n    between my task as Organizational Leader of the Party and my new\r\n    task. Very soon, however, your decision, my Fuehrer, became\r\n    clear to me and I recognized that the organizational measures of\r\n    the Party could only come to full fruition when supplemented by\r\n    the organization of the people, that is to say, by the\r\n    mobilization of the energies of the people and by their\r\n    concentration and alignment. If the _Party_ represents the\r\n    _concentration of the Political Leaders of the people_—as you,\r\n    my Fuehrer, have told us again and again—then the _people_ is\r\n    the _retinue_ and must be organized and trained according to the\r\n    same principles. _Leader and retinue, elite and community at\r\n    large_—these were the clear directives for my work. These were\r\n    the consequences:\r\n\r\n    “(1) _My tasks as Organizational Leader of the Party and as the\r\n    leader of the German Labor Front were a completely homogeneous\r\n    task: in other words, in everything I did I acted as Reich\r\n    Organization Leader of the NSDAP._\r\n\r\n    “(2) _The German Labor Front was an institution of the Party and\r\n    was led by it._\r\n\r\n    “(3) _The German Labor Front had to be organized regionally and\r\n    professionally according to the same principles as the Party._\r\n\r\n    “That is why trade union and employer associations had to be\r\n    smashed unrelentingly, and the basis of construction was formed,\r\n    as in the Party, by the cell and the local section\r\n    [_Ortsgruppe_].\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_National Socialism has conquered the factory._ Factory troops\r\n    [_Die Werkschar_] are the National Socialist shock troops within\r\n    the factory, and their motto is:\r\n\r\n              ‘THE FUEHRER IS ALWAYS RIGHT’.” (_2283-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of the Nazi policy to destroy the independent trade\r\nunions of Germany, Ley issued a Party directive on 21 April 1933\r\noutlining what was termed a “coordination action” scheduled for 2 May\r\n1933 against the General German Trade Union Federation and the General\r\nIndependent Employee Federation (_392-PS_). This directive ordered the\r\nSA and the SS to occupy trade union premises, seize trade union funds,\r\nand take into protective custody the higher union leaders.\r\n\r\nPertinent portions of Ley’s order provide:\r\n\r\n    “On Tuesday, 2 May 1933, the coordination action of the free\r\n    trade unions begins.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The essential part of the action is to be directed against the\r\n    General German Trade Union Federation and the General\r\n    Independent Employees Federation.\r\n\r\n    “Anything beyond that which is dependent upon the free trade\r\n    unions is left to the discretion of the _Gauleiter’s_ judgment.\r\n\r\n    “The _Gauleiter_ are responsible for the execution of the\r\n    coordination action in the individual areas. Supporters of the\r\n    action should be members of the National Socialist Factory Cell\r\n    Organizations * * *.\r\n\r\n    “SA as well as SS are to be employed for the occupation of trade\r\n    union properties and for taking into protective custody of\r\n    personalities who come into question.\r\n\r\n    “The _Gauleiter_ is to proceed with his measures on a basis of\r\n    the closest understanding with competent gau or regional factory\r\n    cells directors.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In the Reich, the following will be occupied:\r\n\r\n        The directing offices of the unions;\r\n\r\n        The trade union houses and offices of the fur trade\r\n        unions;\r\n\r\n        The Party houses of the Socialist Democratic Party of\r\n        Germany in so far as trade unions are involved there;\r\n\r\n        The branches and paying offices of the ‘Bank for\r\n        Workers, Employees and Officials, Inc.’\r\n\r\n        The district committees of the General German Trade\r\n        Union Federation and of the General Independent\r\n        Employees Federation.\r\n\r\n        The local committees of the General German Trade Union\r\n        Federation and of the General Independent Employees\r\n        Federation.\r\n\r\n    “The following are to be taken into protective custody:\r\n\r\n        All trade union chairmen;\r\n\r\n        The district secretaries and branch directors of the\r\n        Bank for Workers, Employees and Officials, Inc.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Exceptions are granted only with the permission of the\r\n    _Gauleiter_.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It is understood that this action is to proceed in a strongly\r\n    disciplined fashion.

Trade union premises all over\r\nGermany were occupied by the SA and the unions dissolved. On 2 May 1933,\r\nthe official NSDAP Press Service reported that the National Socialist\r\nFactory Cells Organization (NSBO) had “eliminated the old leadership” of\r\n“Free Trade Unions” and taken over their leadership (_2224-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “National Socialism, which today has assumed leadership of the\r\n    German working class, can no longer bear the responsibility for\r\n    leaving the men and women of the German working class, the\r\n    members of the largest trade organization in the world, the\r\n    German Trade Union Movement, in the hands of a people who do not\r\n    know a fatherland that is called Germany. Because of that, the\r\n    National Socialist Factory Cell Organization (NSBO) has taken\r\n    over the leadership of the trade unions. The NSBO has eliminated\r\n    the old leadership of the trade unions of the General German\r\n    Trade Unions League and of the General Independent Employees’\r\n    Federation * * *.\r\n\r\n    “On 2 May 1933, the National Socialist Factory Cell Organization\r\n    (NSBO) took over the leadership of all trade unions; all trade\r\n    union buildings were occupied and most stringent control has\r\n    been organized over financial and personnel matters of the\r\n    organization.” (_2224-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis assault on the independent unions directed by Ley in his capacity\r\nas _Reichsleiter_ in charge of Party Organization, assisted by the\r\n_Gauleiter_, and Party Formations, included the seizure of trade union\r\nfunds and property. In a speech on 11 September 1937 to the 5th Annual\r\nSession of the German Labor Front (_1678-PS_), Ley admitted the\r\nconfiscation of trade union funds.\r\n\r\n    “Once I said to the Fuehrer: ‘My Fuehrer, actually I am standing\r\n    with one foot in jail, for today I am still the trustee of the\r\n    comrades “Leipart” and “Imbusch,” and should they some day ask\r\n    me to return their money, then it will be found that I have\r\n    spent it, either by building things, or otherwise. But they\r\n    shall never again find their property in the condition in which\r\n    they handed it over to me. Therefore I would have to be\r\n    convicted.’\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer laughed then and remarked that apparently I felt\r\n    extremely well in this condition.\r\n\r\n    “It was very difficult for us all. Today we laugh about it * *\r\n    *.” (_1678-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Nazi conspirators to eliminate the Free Trade Unions was\r\nadvanced by the enactment on 19 May 1933 of a law which abolished\r\ncollective bargaining between workers and employers and replaced it with\r\na regulation of working conditions by Labor Trustees appointed by Hitler\r\n(_405-PS_). After providing in Section 1 for the appointment by Hitler\r\nof trustees of labor, this law provides, in Section 2:\r\n\r\n    “Until a new revision of the social constitution, the trustees\r\n    are to regulate the conditions for the conclusion of labor\r\n    contracts. This practice is to be legally binding for all\r\n    persons and replaces the system found on combinations of\r\n    workers, of individual employers or of combinations of employers\r\n    * * *.”(_405-PS_)\r\n\r\nHaving destroyed the independent unions and collective bargaining, the\r\nnext step of the Nazi conspirators was to Nazify industrial relations.\r\nThe Law of 20 January 1934, entitled “Law Regulating National Labor,”\r\nimposed the Leadership Principle upon industrial enterprisers\r\n(_1861-PS_). Section I, paragraph 1, provided that the enterpriser\r\nshould be the leader of the plant and the workers would “constitute his\r\nfollowers.” Section 1, paragraph 2 reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Leader of the plant makes the decisions for the employees\r\n    and laborers in all matters concerning the enterprise, as far as\r\n    they are regulated by this law.\r\n\r\n    “He is responsible for the well-being of the employees and\r\n    laborers. The employees and laborers owe him faithfulness\r\n    according to the principles of the factory community.”\r\n    (_1861-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe trade unions having been dissolved and the Leadership Principle\r\nsuperimposed upon the relationship of management and labor, the members\r\nof the Leadership Corps joined in and directed measures designed to\r\nreplace the independent unions by the German Labor Front, the DAF, an\r\naffiliated Party organization. On the very day the Nazi conspirators\r\nseized and dissolved the Free Trade Unions, 2 May 1933, they publicly\r\nproclaimed that a “united front of German workers” would be formed with\r\nHitler as honorary patron at a workers’ congress on 10 May 1933\r\n(_2224-PS_). A release of the Nazi Party Press Agency stated:\r\n\r\n    “The National Socialist Party Press Agency is informed that a\r\n    great workers’ congress will take place on Wednesday, 10 May, in\r\n    the Russian House of Lords in Berlin. The United Front of German\r\n    workers will be formed there. Adolf Hitler will be asked to\r\n    assume the position of Honorary Patron.” (_2224-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe action committee, which supervised the smashing of the unions under\r\n_Reichsleiter_ Ley, met with Hitler and reported that the independent\r\nunions had been effectively dissolved. The Fuehrer then consented to be\r\nHonorary Patron at the Great Workers’ Congress. (_2224-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party was not only employed in measures\r\ntaken to dissolve the independent unions, but certain of its members\r\nwere given important and directive positions within the German Labor\r\nFront, the Nazi Organization which replaced the free trade unions. On 10\r\nMay 1933, Hitler appointed Ley Leader of the German Labor Front (DAF)\r\n(_1940-PS_). By the same edict, Hitler appointed _Gauleiter_ Forster as\r\nLeader of the Employees’ Associations, and Schumann, Leader of the Nazi\r\nFactory Cell Organization (NSBO), as Leader of the Workers’\r\nAssociations. The Hitler edict stated:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler, has issued the following edict:\r\n\r\n    “I appoint the Chief of Staff of the Political Organization of\r\n    the NSDAP, Dr. Robert Ley, as leader of the German Labor Front.\r\n\r\n    “I appoint _Gauleiter_ Forster, Danzig, as leader of the\r\n    Employees’ Associations.\r\n\r\n    “I appoint the leader of the National Socialist Factory Cell\r\n    Organizations (NSBO), Schumann, as leader of the Workers’\r\n    Associations.\r\n\r\n                                             “Berlin, 10 May\r\n                                             “Adolf Hitler.” (_1940-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators employed the German Labor Front (DAF) as an\r\ninstrument for propagandizing its millions of compulsory members with\r\nNazi ideology. The control of the Leadership Corps over the German Labor\r\nFront was assured not only by the designation of _Reichsleiter_ Ley as\r\nhead of the DAF, but by the employment of a large number of _Politischen\r\nLeiter_ (political leaders) charged with disseminating Nazi ideology to\r\nthe large membership of the DAF. These facts are apparent from pages\r\n185-187 of the _Organization Book of the NSDAP_ (_2271-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The National Socialist Factory Cells Organization [NSBO], is a\r\n    union of the political leaders [_Politischen Leiter_] of the\r\n    NSDAP in the German Labor Front.\r\n\r\n    “The NSBO is the carrier of the organization of the German Labor\r\n    Front.\r\n\r\n    “The duties and responsibilities of the NSBO have passed over to\r\n    the DAF.\r\n\r\n    “The political leaders who have been transferred from the NSBO\r\n    to the German Labor Front guarantee the ideological education of\r\n    the DAF in the spirit of the National Socialistic idea.”\r\n    (_2271-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe foregoing evidence fixes upon the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party\r\nresponsibility for participation in the measures leading to the\r\ndestruction of the independent trade unions and to Nazi Party control\r\nover the productive capacity of the German Labor Movement. Not only were\r\nthese actions directed by Ley in his capacity as _Reichsleiter_, but\r\nthey were supervised on a regional basis by the _Gauleiter_ as district\r\nrepresentatives of the Leadership Corps.

THE REICH CABINET\r\n\r\nThe Reich Cabinet, or _Reichsregierung_, unlike most of the other Nazi\r\norganizations, was not especially created by the Nazi Party to carry out\r\nor implement its purposes. The _Reichsregierung_ had, before the Nazis\r\ncame to power, a place in the constitutional and political history of\r\nthe country. As with other cabinets of duly constituted governments, the\r\nexecutive power of the realm was concentrated in that body. The Nazi\r\nconspirators well realized this fact. Their aim for totalitarian control\r\nover the State could not be secured, they realized, except by acquiring,\r\nholding, and utilizing the machinery of the State. And this they did.\r\nUnder the Nazi regime the _Reichsregierung_ gradually became a primary\r\nagent of the Nazi Party, with functions and policies formulated in\r\naccordance with the objectives and methods of the Party itself. The\r\n_Reichsregierung_ became—at first gradually and then with more\r\nrapidity—polluted by the infusion of the Nazi conspirators sixteen of\r\nwhom are accused in the Indictment. Its purpose came to be to clothe\r\nevery scheme and purpose of the Party, however vile, with the semblance\r\nof legality.\r\n\r\n          A. _Composition and Nature of the Reichsregierung._\r\n\r\nThe term _Reichsregierung_ literally translated means “Reich\r\nGovernment”. Actually, it was commonly taken to refer to the ordinary\r\nReich Cabinet. In the Indictment the term _Reichsregierung_ is defined\r\nto include not only those persons who were members of the ordinary Reich\r\nCabinet, but also persons who were members of the Council of Ministers\r\nfor the Defense of the Reich (_Ministerrat fuer die Reichsverteidigung_)\r\nand the Secret Cabinet Council (_Geheimer Kabinettsrat_). The most\r\nimportant body, however, was the ordinary cabinet. Between it and the\r\nother two groups there was in reality only an artificial distinction.\r\nThere existed, in fact, a unity of personnel, action, function, and\r\npurpose that obliterated any academic separation. As used in the\r\nIndictment, the term “ordinary cabinet” means Reich Ministers, i.e.,\r\nheads of departments of the central government; Reich Ministers without\r\nportfolio; State Ministers acting as Reich Ministers; and other\r\nofficials entitled to take part in Cabinet meetings. Altogether, 48\r\npersons held positions in the ordinary cabinet. 17 of them have been\r\nindicted as defendants. Of the remaining 31, eight are believed to be\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Ordinary Cabinet._ Into the ordinary cabinet were placed the\r\nleading Nazi trusted henchmen. Then, when new governmental agencies or\r\nbodies were created, either by Hitler or by the Cabinet itself, the\r\nconstituents of these new bodies were taken from the rolls of the\r\nordinary cabinet.\r\n\r\nWhen the first Hitler Cabinet was formed on 30 January 1933, there were\r\n10 ministries which could be classified as departments of the central\r\ngovernment. This fact appears from the minutes of the first meeting of\r\nthat cabinet, which were found in the files of the Reich Chancellery and\r\nbear the typed signature of one Weinstein, who is described in the\r\nminutes as “Responsible for the Protocol—Counsellor in the Ministry”\r\n(_351-PS_). The ten ministers who attended are set forth:\r\n\r\n    “Reichs Minister of Foreign Affairs (von Neurath); Reichs\r\n    Minister of the Interior (Frick); Reichs Minister of Finance\r\n    (Graf Schwerin von Krosigk); Reichs Minister of Economy; Reichs\r\n    Minister for Food and Agriculture (Dr. Hugenberg); Reichs\r\n    Minister of Labor (Seldte); Reichs Minister of Justice [no name\r\n    given; the post was filled two days later by Gurtner]; Reichs\r\n    Defense Minister (von Blomberg); the Reichs Postmaster General;\r\n    and Reichs Minister for Transportation (Freiherr von\r\n    Eltz-Ruebanach).” (_351-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition, Goering attended as Reichs Minister (he held no portfolio\r\nat that time) and Reichs Commissar for Aviation. Dr. Perecke attended as\r\nReich Commissar for Procurement of Labor. Two state secretaries were\r\npresent—Dr. Lammers of the Reichs Chancellery and Dr. Meissner of the\r\nReich’s Presidential Chancellery. In addition, Funk was present as\r\nReichs Press Chief, and von Papen was present as Deputy of the Reichs\r\nChancellor and Reichs Commissar for the State of Prussia. (_351-PS_)\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards new ministries or departments were created, into\r\nwhich leading Nazi figures were placed. On 13 March 1933, the Ministry\r\nof Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda was created, and Paul Josef\r\nGoebbels was named as Reich Minister of Popular Enlightenment and\r\nPropaganda (_2029-PS_). On 5 May 1933 the Ministry of Air (_2089-PS_),\r\non 1 May 1934 the Ministry of Education (_2078-PS_), and on 16 July 1935\r\nthe Ministry for Church Affairs (_2090-PS_) were created. Goering was\r\nmade Air Minister; Bernhard Rust, Gauleiter of South Hanover, was named\r\nEducation Minister; and Hans Kerrl was named Minister for Church\r\nAffairs. Two Ministries were added after the war started. On 17 March\r\n1940 the Ministry of Armaments and Munitions was established\r\n(_2091-PS_). Dr. Fritz Todt, a high party official, was appointed to\r\nthis post. Speer succeeded him. The name of this department was changed\r\nto “Armaments and War Production” in 1943 (_2092-PS_). On 17 July 1941,\r\nwhen the seizure of Eastern territories was in progress, the Ministry\r\nfor the Occupied Eastern Territories was created. There was no published\r\ndecree for this act. A file found in the Presidential Chancellery\r\ncontains a typewritten copy of the decree of Hitler establishing that\r\npost (_1997-PS_). The decree provides:\r\n\r\n    “Decree of the Fuehrer concerning the administration of the\r\n    newly-occupied Eastern Territories dated 17 July 1941.”\r\n\r\n    “In order to maintain public order and public life in the\r\n    newly-occupied Eastern territories I decree that:\r\n\r\n    “As soon as the military operations in the newly-occupied\r\n    territories are over, the administration of these territories\r\n    shall be transferred from the military establishments to the\r\n    civil-administration establishments. I shall from time to time\r\n    determine by special decree, the territories which according to\r\n    this are to be transferred to the civil administration and the\r\n    time when this is to take place.\r\n\r\n    “The Civil Administration in the newly occupied Eastern\r\n    territories, where these territories are not included in the\r\n    administration of the territories bordering on the Reich or the\r\n    General government, is subject to the ‘Reich Minister for the\r\n    Occupied Eastern territories.’\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I appoint Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg as Reich Minister for\r\n    the Occupied Eastern Territories. He will hold office in\r\n    Berlin.” (_1997-PS_)\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1933 to 1945, one ministry was dropped—the Ministry of\r\nDefense (later called War). This took place on 4 February 1938, when\r\nHitler took over command of the whole Armed Forces. At the same time he\r\ncreated the office of the “Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed\r\nForces” or Chief of the OKW. This was held by Keitel. The decree\r\naccomplishing this change provides in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “He [the Chief of the supreme command of the armed forces] is\r\n    equal in rank to a Reich Minister. At the same time, the supreme\r\n    command takes the responsibility for the affairs of the Reichs\r\n    Ministry of War, and by my order, the chief of the supreme\r\n    command of the Armed Forces exercises the authority formerly\r\n    belonging to the Reichs Minister.” (_1915-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother change in the composition of the cabinet during the years in\r\nquestion should be noted. The post of vice-chancellor was never refilled\r\nafter the departure of von Papen on 30 July 1934.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the heads of departments mentioned above, the ordinary\r\ncabinet also contained Reich Ministers without portfolio. Among these\r\nwere Frank, Seyss-Inquart, Schacht (after he left the Economics\r\nMinistry), and von Neurath (after he was replaced as Ministry of the\r\nInterior). Other positions also formed an integral part of the cabinet.\r\nThose were the Deputy of the Fuehrer, Hess, and later his successor, the\r\nLeader of the Party Chancellery, Bormann; the Chief of Staff of the SA,\r\nErnst Roehm, for the seven months prior to his assassination; the Chief\r\nof the Reich Chancellery, Lammers; and, as already mentioned, the Chief\r\nof the OKW, Keitel. These men had either the title or rank of Reich\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet also contained other functionaries, such as State Ministers\r\nacting as Reich Ministers. Only two persons fell within this\r\ncategory—the Chief of the Presidential Chancellery, Otto Meissner, and\r\nthe State Minister of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Karl\r\nHermann Frank. In addition, as named in the Indictment, the ordinary\r\ncabinet included “others entitled to take part in Cabinet meetings”.\r\nMany governmental agencies were created by the Nazis between the years\r\n1933 and 1945, but the peculiarity of these creations was that in most\r\ninstances the new officials were given the right to participate in\r\ncabinet meetings. Among those entitled to take part in Cabinet meetings\r\nwere the Commanders in Chief of the Army and the Navy; the Reich Forest\r\nMaster; the Inspector General for Water and Power; the Inspector General\r\nof German Roads; the Reich Labor Leader; the Reich Youth Leader; the\r\nChief of the Foreign Organization in the Foreign Office; the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police in the Reich Ministry of\r\nthe Interior; the Prussian Finance Minister; and the Cabinet Press\r\nChief. These posts and officials comprising the ordinary cabinet all\r\nappear on the chart entitled “Organization of the Reich Government,” and\r\nauthenticated by Frick (_Chart Number 18_). The persons who held these\r\nposts in the ordinary cabinet varied between the years 1933 to 1945.\r\nTheir names are listed in the chart (_Chart Number 18_), which discloses\r\nthat 17 of these officials are defendants in these proceedings.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Secret Cabinet Council._ Proof that there was only an\r\nartificial distinction between the ordinary cabinet, the Secret Cabinet\r\nCouncil, and the Council of Ministers for the Defense of the Reich, is\r\nshown by the unity of personnel among the three subdivisions. Thus, on 4\r\nFebruary 1938, Hitler created the Secret Cabinet Council (_2031-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “To advise me in conducting the foreign policy I am setting up a\r\n    secret cabinet council.\r\n\r\n    “As president of the secret cabinet council, I nominate:\r\n    Reichsminister Freiherr von Neurath\r\n\r\n    “As members of the secret cabinet council I nominate:\r\n    Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs, Joachim von Ribbentrop\r\n\r\n    Prussian Prime Minister, Reichsminister of the Air, Supreme\r\n    Commander of the Air Forces, General Field Marshall Hermann\r\n    Goering\r\n\r\n    The Fuehrer’s Deputy, Reichsminister Rudolf Hess\r\n\r\n    Reichsminister for the Enlightenment of the people and of\r\n    Propaganda, Dr. Joseph Goebbels\r\n\r\n    Reichsminister and Chief of the Reichs Chancellery Dr.\r\n    Hans-Heinrich Lammers\r\n\r\n    The Supreme Commander of the Army, General Walther von\r\n    Brauchitsch\r\n\r\n    The Supreme Commander of the Navy, Grand Admiral Dr. (honorary)\r\n    Erich Raeder\r\n\r\n    The Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces Lt. Gen.\r\n    Wilhelm Keitel.” (_2031-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that every member of this group was either a\r\nReichsminister or, as, in the case of the Army, Navy, and OKW heads, had\r\nthe rank and authority of a Reich Minister.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Council of Ministers for the Defense of the Reich._ On 30\r\nAugust 1939 Hitler established the Council of Ministers for the Defense\r\nof the Reich (better known as the Ministerial Council). This was the\r\nso-called war cabinet. The decree establishing this Council provided\r\n(_2018-PS_):\r\n\r\n                               “Article I\r\n\r\n    “(1) A Ministerial Council for Reich Defense shall be\r\n    established as a standing committee out of the Reich Defense\r\n    Council.\r\n\r\n    “(2) The standing members of the Ministerial Council for Reich\r\n    Defense shall include: General Field Marshall Goering as\r\n    chairman; Fuehrer’s Deputy [Hess]; Commissioner General (or\r\n    Plenipotentiary) for Reich Administration [Frick]; Commissioner\r\n    General (or Plenipotentiary) for Economy [Funk]; Reich Minister\r\n    and Chief of the Reich Chancellery [Dr. Lammers]; Chief of the\r\n    High Command for the Armed Forces [Keitel].\r\n\r\n    “(3) The chairman may draw on other members of the Reich Defense\r\n    Council including further personalities for advice.”\r\n    (_2018-PS_).\r\n\r\nAgain, all members of this group were also members of the ordinary\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Defense Council, for secret war planning, was created by the\r\nCabinet on 4 April 1933 (cf. the unpublished Reich Defense Law of 21 May\r\n1935 (_2261-PS_)). The membership of that Council when first created is\r\nshown by the minutes of the second session of the working committee of\r\nthe delegates for Reich Defense, dated 22 May 1933 and signed by Keitel\r\n(_EC-177_):\r\n\r\n   “_Composition of the Reich Defense Council_:\r\n _President_: Reichs Chancellor\r\n _Deputy_: Reichswehr Minister\r\n _Permanent Members_:      Minister of the:\r\n                           Reichswehr\r\n                           Foreign Affairs\r\n                           Interior\r\n                           Finance\r\n                           Economic Affairs\r\n                           Public Enlightenment and Propaganda\r\n                           Air\r\n                           Chief of the Army Command Staff\r\n                           Chief of the Navy Command Staff\r\n\r\n    “Depending on the case: The remaining ministers, other\r\n    personalities, e.g., leading industrialists, etc.” (_EC-177_)\r\n\r\nAll but the Chiefs of the Army and Navy Command Staff were at that time\r\nmembers of the ordinary cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe composition of this Reich Defense Council was changed by an\r\nunpublished law on 4 September 1938, which provided as follows\r\n(_2194-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * (2) The leader and Reich Chancellor is chairman in the\r\n    RVR. His permanent deputy is General Field Marshall Goering. He\r\n    has the right to call conferences of the RVR. Permanent members\r\n    of the RVR are\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Minister of Air and Supreme Commander of the Air Force,\r\n    The Supreme Commander of the Army,\r\n    The Supreme Commander of the Navy,\r\n    The Chief of the OKW,\r\n    The Deputy of the Fuehrer,\r\n    The Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery,\r\n    The President of the Secret Cabinet Council,\r\n    The Chief Plenipotentiary for the Reich Administration,\r\n    The Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics,\r\n    The Reich Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\n    The Reich Minister of the Interior,\r\n    The Reich Finance Minister,\r\n    The Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda,\r\n    The President of the Reichsbank Directorate.\r\n\r\n    “The other Reich Ministers and the Reich offices directly\r\n    subordinate to the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor are consulted if\r\n    necessary. Further personalities can be called as the case\r\n    demands.” (_2194-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn that date all the members also belonged to the ordinary cabinet, for\r\nby that time the supreme commanders of the Army and Navy had been given\r\nministerial rank and authorized to participate in cabinet meetings\r\n(_2098-PS_). It is also worth noting that two members of the Reich\r\nDefense Council also appear in the Ministerial Council under the same\r\ntitle—The Plenipotentiary for Administration, and the Plenipotentiary\r\nfor Economy. The former post was held by Frick, while the latter was\r\nfirst held by Schacht and then by Funk. These facts are verified by\r\nFrick on the Nazi governmental organization chart (_Chart Number 18_).\r\nMany other ministries were subordinated to these two posts for\r\nwar-planning aims and purposes. These two officials, together with the\r\nChief of the OKW, formed a powerful triumvirate known as the “Three-Man\r\nCollege” (Frick, Funk, and Keitel) which figured prominently in war\r\nplans and preparations.\r\n\r\n                 B. _Functions of the Reichsregierung._\r\n\r\nThe utilization of the ordinary cabinet as a manpower reservoir for\r\nother governmental agencies, the chronological development of the\r\noffshoots of the ordinary cabinet, and the cohesion between all of these\r\ngroups, is apparent from the Nazi governmental organization chart\r\n(_Chart Number 18_). The chart shows the following offshoots of the\r\nordinary cabinet: 1933, the Reich Defense Council; 1935, the Three-Man\r\nCollege; 1936, the Delegate for the Four Year Plan; 1938, the Secret\r\nCabinet Council; 1939, The Ministerial Defense Council; and 1944, the\r\nDelegate for Total War Effort (Goebbels). In every case these important\r\nNazi agencies were staffed with personnel taken from the ordinary\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Ordinary Cabinet._ The unity, cohesion, and interrelationship\r\nof the sub-divisions of the _Reichsregierung_ was not the result of a\r\nco-mixture of personnel alone. It was also realized by the method in\r\nwhich it operated. The ordinary cabinet consulted together both by\r\nmeetings and through the so-called circulation procedure. Under the\r\nlatter procedure, which was chiefly used when meetings were not held,\r\ndrafts of laws prepared in individual ministries were distributed to\r\nother cabinet members for approval or disapproval.\r\n\r\nThe man primarily responsible for the circulation of drafts of laws\r\nunder this procedure was Dr. Lammers, the Leader and Chief of the Reich\r\nChancellery. Lammers has described that procedure in an affidavit\r\n(_2999-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * I was Leader of the Reich Chancellery (_Leiter der\r\n    Reichskanzlei_) from 30 January 1933 until the end of the war.\r\n    In this capacity I circulated drafts of proposed laws and\r\n    decrees submitted to me by the Minister who had drafted the law\r\n    or decree, to all members of the Reich Cabinet. A period of time\r\n    was allowed for objections, after which the law considered as\r\n    being accepted by the various members of the Cabinet. This\r\n    procedure continued throughout the whole war. It was followed\r\n    also in the Council of Ministers for Defense of the Reich\r\n    (_Ministerrat fuer die Reichsverteidigung_).” (_2999-PS_)\r\n\r\nA memorandum dated 9 August 1943, which bears the facsimile signature of\r\nFrick and is addressed to the Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich\r\nChancellery, illustrates how the circulation procedure worked\r\n(_1701-PS_). Attached to the memorandum is a draft of the law in\r\nquestion and a carbon copy of a letter dated 22 December 1943 from\r\nRosenberg to the Reich Minister of the Interior, containing his comments\r\non the draft:\r\n\r\n    “To the Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery, in\r\n    _Berlin W8_.\r\n\r\n    “For the information of the other Reich ministers.\r\n\r\n    “Subj: Law on the treatment of enemies of the society.\r\n\r\n    “In addition to my letter of 19 March, 1942.\r\n\r\n    “_Enclosures: 55.—_\r\n\r\n    “After the draft of the law on the treatment of enemies of the\r\n    society has been completely rewritten, I am sending the enclosed\r\n    new draft with the consent of the Reich Minister of Justice, Dr.\r\n    Thierack, and ask that the law be approved in a circulatory\r\n    manner. The necessary number of prints is attached.” (_1701-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Council of Ministers for the Defense of the Reich._ The same\r\nprocedure was followed in the Council of Ministers when that body was\r\ncreated. And the decrees of the Council of Ministers were also\r\ncirculated to the members of the ordinary Cabinet. A memorandum found in\r\nthe files of the Reich Chancellery and addressed to the members of the\r\nCouncil of Ministers, dated 17 September 1939, and bearing the typed\r\nsignature of Dr. Lammers, Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich\r\nChancellery, states (_1141-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “Matters submitted to the Council of Ministers for the Reich\r\n    Defense have heretofore been distributed only to the members of\r\n    the Council. I have been requested by some of the\r\n    Reichsministers who are not permanent members of the Council to\r\n    inform them of the drafts of decrees which are being submitted\r\n    to the Council, so as to enable them to check these drafts from\r\n    the point of view of their respective offices. I shall follow\r\n    this request so that all the Reichsministers will in future be\r\n    informed of the drafts of decrees which are to be acted upon by\r\n    the Council for the Reich Defense. I therefore request to add\r\n    forty-five additional copies of the drafts, as well as of the\r\n    letters which usually contain the arguments for the drafts, to\r\n    the folders submitted to the Council.” (_1141-PS_)\r\n\r\nVon Stutterheim, who was an official of the Reich Chancellery, comments\r\non this procedure at page 34 of a pamphlet entitled “_Die\r\nReichskanzlei_”:\r\n\r\n    “* * * It must be noted that the peculiarity in this case is\r\n    that the subjects dealt with by the Cabinet Council—(Council of\r\n    Ministers for the Defense of the Reich), are distributed not\r\n    merely among the members of the Cabinet Council, but also among\r\n    all the members of the Cabinet (_Kabinett_) who are thereby\r\n    given the opportunity of guarding the interests of their spheres\r\n    of office by adding their appropriate standpoints in the Cabinet\r\n    Council legislation, even if they do not participate in making\r\n    the decree.” (_2231-PS_)\r\n\r\nFor a time the Cabinet consulted together through actual meetings. The\r\nCouncil of Ministers did likewise, but those members of the Cabinet who\r\nwere not already members of the Council also attended the meetings of\r\nthe Ministerial Council. And where they did not attend in person, they\r\nwere usually represented by the state secretaries of their Ministries.\r\nThe minutes of six meetings of the Council of Ministers, on 1, 4, 8, and\r\n19 September 1939, on 16 October 1939, and on 15 November 1939,\r\ndemonstrate this procedure. (_2852-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt the meeting held on 1 September 1939, which was probably the first\r\nmeeting since the Council was created on 30 August 1939, the following\r\nwere in attendance:\r\n\r\n    “Present were the permanent members of the Council of Ministers\r\n    for the Reich Defense: The Chairman and Generalfield Marshall,\r\n    Goering; the Deputy of the Fuehrer, Hess [a line appears through\r\n    the name Hess]; the Plenipotentiary for Reich Administration,\r\n    Dr. Frick; the Plenipotentiary for Economy, Funk; the Reich\r\n    Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery, Dr. Lammers; and\r\n    the Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces, Keitel,\r\n    represented by Major General Thomas.” (_2852-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese were the regular members of the Council. Also present was the\r\nReich Minister for Food and Agriculture, Darré, and seven State\r\nSecretaries: Koerner, Neumann, Stuckart, Posse, Landfried, Backe, and\r\nSyrup (_2852-PS_). These State Secretaries were from the several\r\nMinistries or other supreme Reich authorities. Koerner was the Deputy of\r\nGoering in the Four-Year Plan; Stuckart was in the Ministry of the\r\nInterior; Landfried was in the Ministry of Economics; Syrup was in the\r\nMinistry of Labor.\r\n\r\nThe minutes dated 8 September 1939 (_2852-PS_) note that in addition to\r\nall members of the Ministerial Council, the following also were present:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Minister for Food and Agriculture * * * Darré; State\r\n    Minister * * * Popitz;”\r\n\r\nThen come the names of nine State Secretaries from the several\r\nMinistries, and then:\r\n\r\n    “SS Gruppenfuehrer * * * Heydrich;”\r\n\r\nThe close integration of the Ministerial Council with the ordinary\r\nCabinet is seen by the following excerpt from the minutes of the same\r\ndate (8 September 1939):\r\n\r\n    “The Council of Ministers for the Reich Defense ratified the\r\n    decree for the change of the Labor Service Law which had already\r\n    been passed as law by the Reich Cabinet. (_Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\n    Part I, page 1744.)”\r\n\r\nThe minutes of the meeting of 19 September 1939 (_2852-PS_) show the\r\nfollowing Reich Ministers to be present in addition to four members of\r\nthe Council:\r\n\r\n    “Also: The Reich Minister for Finance, Count Schwerin von\r\n    Krosigk.\r\n\r\n    The Reich Minister for Food and Agriculture, Darré.\r\n\r\n    The Reich Minister for Enlightenment and Propaganda, Dr.\r\n    Goebbels.\r\n\r\n    State Minister * * * Dr. Popitz.” (_2852-PS_)\r\n\r\nThen come the names of eight State Secretaries. Others present included:\r\n\r\n    “SS Gruppenfuehrer * * * Heydrich; General of the Police\r\n    (_Ordnungpolizei_) Daluege.” (_2852-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe minutes dated 15 November 1939 show the same co-mixture of\r\nMinisters, State Secretaries, and similar functionaries. In addition,\r\nthe following were also present:\r\n\r\n    “Reichsleiter, Dr. Ley; Reichsleiter, Bouhler; Reichsfuehrer SS,\r\n    Chief of German Police in the Reich Ministry of Interior,\r\n    Himmler; The Reich Labor Service Leader, Hierl * * * Reich\r\n    Commissioner for Price Control, Wagner * * * as well as experts\r\n    (_Sachbearbeiter_) of the German Labor Front and the Reich Labor\r\n    Service.” (_2852-PS_)\r\n\r\nSome of the decrees passed and matters discussed at these meetings of\r\nthe Ministerial Council are significant. At the first meeting of 1\r\nSeptember 1939 14 decrees were ratified by the Council. Decree No. 6\r\nconcerned\r\n\r\n    “* * * the organization of the administration and about the\r\n    German safety police in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.\r\n    (_RGBl_, I, page 1681).” (_2852-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Council on 19 September 1939 the following\r\noccurred;\r\n\r\n    “The Chairman of the Council, Generalfieldmarshall Goering, made\r\n    comments regarding the structure of civil administration in the\r\n    occupied Polish territory. He expressed his intentions regarding\r\n    the economic evacuation measures in this territory. Then the\r\n    questions of decreasing wages and the questions of working hours\r\n    and the support of members of families of inducted workers were\r\n    discussed.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Chairman directed that all members of the Council regularly\r\n    receive the situation reports of the Reichsfuehrer SS. Then the\r\n    question of the population of the future Polish Protectorate was\r\n    discussed and the placement of Jews living in Germany.”\r\n    (_2852-PS_)\r\n\r\nFinally, at the meeting of 15 November 1939 the discussion concerned,\r\namong other things, the “treatment of Polish Prisoners of War”.\r\n(_2852-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe minutes of these meetings (_2852-PS_) not only establish the close\r\nworking union between agencies of the state and the party, especially\r\nthe SS, but also tends to establish that the _Reichsregierung_ was\r\nresponsible for the policies adopted and put into effect by the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n                  C. _Powers of The Reichsregierung._\r\n\r\nBut mere working alliances would be meaningless unless there was power.\r\nAnd the _Reichsregierung_ had power. Short of Hitler himself, it had\r\npractically all the power a government can exercise.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Ordinary Cabinet._ The Nazi conspirators secured the passage by\r\nthe Reichstag of the “Law for the Protection of the People and the\r\nReich,” of 24 March 1933 (_2001-PS_), which vested the Cabinet with\r\nlegislative powers even to the extent of deviating from previously\r\nexisting constitutional law. These powers were retained even after the\r\nmembers of the cabinet were changed, and the several states, provinces,\r\nand municipalities, which had formerly exercised semi-autonomous powers,\r\nwere transformed into mere administrative organs of the central\r\ngovernment. The ordinary cabinet emerged all-powerful from this rapid\r\nsuccession of events. Frick waxed eloquent upon that achievement in an\r\narticle which he wrote for the 1935 National Socialist Year Book:\r\n\r\n    “The relationship between the Reich and the States has been put\r\n    on an entirely new basis, never known in the history of the\r\n    German people. It gives to the Reich cabinet (_Reichsregierung_)\r\n    unlimited power. It even makes it its duty, to build a\r\n    completely unified leadership and administration of the Reich.\r\n    From now on, there is only one national authority: The one of\r\n    the Reich! Thus, the German Reich has become a unified state,\r\n    and the entire administration in the states is only carried out\r\n    by order or in the name of the Reich. The state borders are now\r\n    only administration, technical are boundaries but no longer\r\n    boundaries of sovereignty! In calm determination, the Reich\r\n    Cabinet (_Reichsregierung_) realizes step by step, supported by\r\n    the confidence of the entire German people, the great longing of\r\n    the Nation. The creation of the national socialist German,\r\n    unified state.” (_2380-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe heightened legislative power of the Cabinet is also emphasized in an\r\narticle written by Dr. Franz Medicus, an official in the Reich Ministry\r\nof the Interior, and published in 1939 in Volume 4 of “_Das Dritte Reich\r\nin Aufbau_”:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Worked out by the Reich Minister of the Interior, the\r\n    ‘Law for Alleviation of the Distress of People and Reich’, in\r\n    short called ‘Enabling Law’, was issued on 24 March 1933, broke\r\n    with the liberal principle of ‘division of power’ by\r\n    transferring the legislature from the Reichstag to the Reich\r\n    Cabinet, so that legislation by _personally responsible persons_\r\n    took the place of ‘anonymous’ legislation.” (_2849-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhen the Ministerial Council was formed in 1939, it too was given\r\nlegislative powers (cf. Article II of the decree of 30 August 1939\r\n(_2018-PS_)). The ordinary cabinet also continued to legislate\r\nthroughout the war. Because of the fusion of personnel between the\r\nMinisterial Council and the ordinary cabinet, questions were bound to\r\narise as to what forum should lend its name to a particular law. Dr.\r\nLammers, Chief of the Reich Chancellery and a member of both agencies,\r\nwrote a letter on 14 June 1942 to the Plenipotentiary for Reich\r\nAdministration about these questions (_352-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “To the Plenipotentiary for the Reich Administration\r\n    (_Generalbevollmaechtigter die Reich Verwaltung_)\r\n\r\n    “Subject: The Jurisdiction of the Council of Ministers for the\r\n    Defense of the Reich (_Ministerat fuer die Reichsverteidigung_)\r\n\r\n    “Your letter of 3 June 1942, No. 493/42/2882.—Recently the\r\n    Fuehrer announced in accord with the opinions of the Reich\r\n    Marshal of the Greater German Reich as shown in my letter of 20\r\n    Feb. 1940-RK. 624-B—that he believes it practical to reserve\r\n    certain legislative missions for the Reich Cabinet. With this he\r\n    has not limited the competency of the Council of Ministers for\r\n    the defense of the Reich but given a directive as to how\r\n    legislation should be handled under the point of view of\r\n    practicability. I have no doubt that the Fuehrer, as well as the\r\n    Reich Marshal, have not changed their point of view, in\r\n    particular, regarding the fact, that at the present there should\r\n    be only legislation important in the cause of war, and that they\r\n    will stress the fact that the Fuehrer himself and the Reich\r\n    Cabinet should not be eliminated from the powers of legislation.\r\n    It will have to be tested from time to time what measures will\r\n    be reserved for the Reich Cabinet. My letter of 20 February\r\n    1940, and the opinions of the Fuehrer therein expressed may\r\n    serve as a directive even if the limitations indicated by me are\r\n    no longer applicable in their full meaning. I would therefore\r\n    suggest not basing the discussions with the Reich Minister of\r\n    Finance on the question of competency of the Reich Cabinet or\r\n    the Council of Ministers for the Defence of the Reich, but on\r\n    the question of whether it would be practical to achieve\r\n    settlement through either Reich law or a Decree from the Council\r\n    of Ministers for the defense of the Reich in the sense of the\r\n    opinions voiced by the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n                                 (signed)  Dr. Lammers” (_352-PS_).\r\n\r\nOther officials possessed legislative powers. Hitler was of course one.\r\nGoering, as Deputy of the Four Year Plan, could and did issue decrees\r\nwith the effect of law. The Cabinet delegated power to issue laws\r\ndeviating from existing law to the Plenipotentiaries of Economy and\r\nAdministration and the Chief of the OKW, the so-called Three-Man\r\nCollege. This was done in the Secret Defense Law of 1938 (_2194-PS_).\r\nThese three officials—Frick, Funk, and Keitel—however, were also\r\nmembers of the Council of Ministers and of the ordinary cabinet as well.\r\nIt can therefore be said, in the language of the Indictment, that the\r\n_Reichsregierung_ “possessed * * * legislative * * * powers of a very\r\nhigh order in the system of the German government.”\r\n\r\nThe executive and administrative powers of the Reich were concentrated\r\nin the central government primarily as the result of two basic Nazi laws\r\nthat reduced the separate states (called _Laender_) to mere geographical\r\ndivisions. One was the law of 30 January 1934, known as the Law for the\r\nReconstruction of the Reich (_2006-PS_). By that law the States were\r\ndeprived of their independent status as States, their legislative\r\nassemblies were abolished, and their sovereign powers were transferred\r\nto the Reich. The other was the Reich Governor’s Law, enacted by the\r\nCabinet on 30 January 1935 (_2008-PS_), which made all Reich Governors\r\n(_Statthalters_) permanent delegates of and subject to the order of the\r\ncabinet and, more especially, of the Reich Minister of the Interior. As\r\na result, the ordinary cabinet was possessed of wide powers, which are\r\nset forth in “Administration Law,” periodical published in 1944 which\r\nwas edited by Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart, State Secretary in the Reich\r\nMinistry of the Interior, and Dr. Harry V. Rosen-v. Hoewel, an\r\n_Oberregierungsrat_ in the Reich Ministry of the Interior (_2959-PS_).\r\nThe description of the powers and functions of all the ministries of the\r\nordinary cabinet illustrates the extent of control vested in the\r\n_Reichsregierung_:\r\n\r\n                       III. _The Reich Ministers_\r\n\r\n    “There are at present twenty-one Reich Ministers, namely:\r\n\r\n    “I. 15 Reich Ministers with a definite portfolio.\r\n\r\n    The Ministries of the Reich Ministers mentioned under 2, 6, 7,\r\n    8, 9, 10, 11, 12 are united with the corresponding Ministries of\r\n    Prussia.\r\n\r\n    “1. The Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs (Foreign Office).\r\n\r\n    (_a_) He handles all matters touching on the relations of the\r\n    Reich to foreign countries.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Under him are the diplomatic and consular representatives\r\n    as well as the Reich office for Foreign Trade.\r\n\r\n    “2. The Reich Minister of the Interior.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) To his portfolio belong general administration, local\r\n    administration, police administration, administration of\r\n    officials, public health, welfare, geodetic system, sport system\r\n    and the Reich Labor Service.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Under him are the general and internal administrations,\r\n    for example, the Reich Governors, the state governments\r\n    (_Landesregierung_) the superior Presidents, the governmental\r\n    Presidents, as well as police officials and the Reich Labor\r\n    Service.\r\n\r\n    Furthermore, there are under him numerous central intermediary\r\n    boards, for example, the Reich Health Office, the Reich\r\n    Archives, the Reich Genealogical Office.\r\n\r\n    “3. The Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) To his portfolio belong the intellectual influences on the\r\n    nation, recruiting for the state, culture and economics, and the\r\n    instruction of domestic and foreign public opinion.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Under him are, among other things, the Reich Propaganda\r\n    Offices and the film censorship offices. Furthermore, he\r\n    exercises supervision over the Reich Chamber of Culture, the\r\n    Recruiting Council of German Economics, the Reich Radio Company,\r\n    and the Institute of Politics (_Hochschule fuer Politik_).\r\n\r\n    “4. The Reich Minister of Aviation and Supreme Commander of the\r\n    Air Force.\r\n\r\n    He administers civil and military aviation.\r\n\r\n    “5. The Reich Minister of Finances.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) To his portfolio belong the budget and financial system of\r\n    the Reich, as well as the administration of taxes; monopolies,\r\n    and tariffs.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Under him are namely: the administration of taxes and\r\n    tariffs, as well as the administration of Reich monopolies.\r\n\r\n    “6. The Reich Minister of Justice.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) He is in charge of all matters related to the judicial\r\n    system.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Under him are all judicial agencies and the Reich Patent\r\n    Office.\r\n\r\n    “7. The Reich Ministry of Economics.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) To his portfolio belong the basic economic political\r\n    questions of German economy, the supply of the civilian\r\n    population with goods for consumption and the regulation of\r\n    their distribution, the handling of foreign economic questions\r\n    in the framework of policy on foreign trade of the Reich and the\r\n    supreme supervision over the institutes of credit.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Under him are the Reich administration of mines, the Reich\r\n    office of Statistics, the Supervisory Office for Private\r\n    Insurance, the Gau Chambers of Economy, the State Economic\r\n    Offices, (_Landeswirtschaftsamt_) the Savings Banks, and the\r\n    State Insurance Offices.\r\n\r\n    “8. The Reich Minister for Food and Agriculture.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) He is in charge of all farmers and of the agriculture, as\r\n    well as the food administration.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Under him are the State Food Offices\r\n    (_Landesernaechrungsamt_) the State Administration of Large\r\n    Estates (_Domaenen verwaltung_) the Administration of Rural\r\n    Affairs and the Agricultural Credit Offices. Furthermore, he\r\n    exercises state supervision over the Reich Food Supply of which\r\n    he is the leader.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “14. Reich Minister for Armament and War Production.\r\n\r\n    He has to bring to a level of highest production all offices\r\n    active in producing arms and munitions. Furthermore, he is\r\n    responsible for the field of raw materials and production in\r\n    industry and manual labor.\r\n\r\n    “15. The Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) He administers the recently occupied (i.e. former\r\n    Soviet-Russian) Eastern territories, insofar as they are under\r\n    civil administration and not subordinated to the Chief of Civil\r\n    Administration for the district of Bialystok (cf. page 70) or\r\n    insofar as they are incorporated in the General Gouvernment (cf.\r\n    page 100).\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Under him are the Reich Commissars, the General\r\n    Commissars, Head Commissars, and District Commissars, in the\r\n    recently occupied Eastern territories.” (_2959-PS_)\r\n\r\nOther important powers and functions contained in the ordinary cabinet\r\nwere not included in the foregoing list. For example, upon the creation\r\nof the People’s Court on 24 April 1934, it was placed within the\r\njurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice (_2014-PS_). With the\r\nacquisition and occupation of new territories, the integration and\r\ncoordination thereof were placed within the Ministry of the Interior.\r\nThe Reich Minister of the Interior, Frick, (in some cases in cooperation\r\nwith other Reich Ministers) was, by law, given regulatory powers over\r\nsuch territories. The territory and the applicable law may be listed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    (1) The Saar (1935, _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 66).\r\n\r\n    (2) Austria (1938, _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 237).\r\n\r\n    (3) Memel (1939, _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 54).\r\n\r\n    (4) Bohemia and Moravia (1939, _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page\r\n    485).\r\n\r\n    (5) Sudetenland (1939, _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 780).\r\n\r\n    (6) Danzig (1939, _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 1547).\r\n\r\n    (7) Incorporated Poland (1939, _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page\r\n    2042).\r\n\r\n    (8) Occupied Poland (1939, _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page\r\n    2077).\r\n\r\n    (9) Eupen, Malmedy and Moresnet (1940, _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part\r\n    I, page 803).\r\n\r\n    (10) Norway (1941, _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 765).\r\n\r\nSuch were the powers and functions of the ordinary cabinet.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Secret Cabinet Council._ Of the other two subdivisions of the\r\n_Reichsregierung_—the Secret Cabinet Council and the Ministerial\r\nCouncil—the Secret Cabinet Council had no legislative or administrative\r\npowers. It was created by Hitler on 4 February 1938\r\n\r\n    “To advise me in conducting the foreign policy * * *.”\r\n    (_2031-PS_)\r\n\r\nIts position in the Nazi regime is described by Ernst Rudolf Huber, a\r\nleading Nazi Constitutional Lawyer, in his book entitled\r\n“_Verfassungsrecht des Grossdeutschen Reiches_” (“Constitutional Law of\r\nthe Greater German Reich”). In this book, which was an authoritative,\r\nwidely used work on Nazi Constitutional Law, Huber states (_1774-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “A privy cabinet council, to advise the Fuehrer in the basic\r\n    problems of foreign policy, has been created by the decree of 4\r\n    February 1938 (_RGBl._ I, 112). This privy cabinet council is\r\n    under the direction of Reich Minister v. Neurath, and includes\r\n    the Foreign Minister, the Air Minister, the Deputy Commander for\r\n    the Fuehrer, the Propaganda Minister, the Chief of the Reich\r\n    Chancellery, the Commanders-in-Chief of the Supreme Command of\r\n    the Armed Forces. The privy cabinet council constitutes a select\r\n    staff of collaborators of the Fuehrer which consists exclusively\r\n    of members of the Government of the Reich; thus, it represents a\r\n    select committee of the Reich Government for the deliberation on\r\n    foreign affairs.” (_1774-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _The Council of Ministers for the Defense of the Reich._ The powers\r\nconcentrated in the Ministerial Council, which did possess legislative\r\nand administrative functions, at its creation in 1939, are best\r\nexpressed by the lecture which Frick gave before the University of\r\nFreiburg on 7 March 1940. The lecture, published in a pamphlet entitled\r\n“The Administration in Wartime,” contains these statements (_2608-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * The composition of the Ministerial Council for the\r\n    defense of the Reich shows the real concentration of power in\r\n    it. General Field Marshal Goering is the chairman and also the\r\n    Supreme Director of the War Economy and Commissioner for the\r\n    Four Year Plan. He is joined by the Plenipotentiary General for\r\n    the Reich Administration, who directs the entire civilian\r\n    administration with the exception of the economic\r\n    administration, and the Plenipotentiary General for Economy. The\r\n    Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces is the liaison man\r\n    to the Armed Forces. It is primarily his duty to coordinate the\r\n    measures for civilian defense in the area of administration and\r\n    economy with the genuine military measures for the defense of\r\n    the Reich. The Deputy of the Fuehrer represents the Party, thus\r\n    guaranteeing the unity between Party and State also within the\r\n    Ministerial Council for the Defense of the Reich. The Reich\r\n    Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery is in charge of the\r\n    business management of the Ministerial Council for the Defense\r\n    of the Reich.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Ministerial Council for the Defense of the Reich, the\r\n    highest legislative and executive organ in wartime next to the\r\n    Fuehrer, created a subordinate organ for the purpose of the\r\n    defense of the Reich: The Commissioners for the Reich Defense,\r\n    who have their headquarters at the seat of the individual corps\r\n    area.” (_2608-PS_)\r\n\r\nWith such power concentrated in the _Reichsregierung_ and to such a high\r\ndegree, the Nazi conspirators possessed a formidable weapon to\r\neffectuate their plans.\r\n\r\n             D. _Acts and Decrees of the Reichsregierung._\r\n\r\nUnder the Nazi regime the _Reichsregierung_ became the instrument of the\r\nNazi party.\r\n\r\n(1) _Execution of the Nazi Party Program._ In the original Cabinet of 30\r\nJanuary 1933 only three cabinet members were members of the\r\nParty—Goering, Frick, and Hitler. As new Ministries were added to the\r\nCabinet, prominent Nazis were placed at their head. On 30 January, 1937,\r\nHitler accepted into the Party those Cabinet members who were not\r\nalready members. This action is reported in the _Voelkischer\r\nBeobachter_, South German Edition, of 1 February 1937 (_2964-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “In view of the anticipated lifting of the ban for party\r\n    membership, the Fuehrer, as the first step in this regard,\r\n    personally carried out the enlistment into the party of the\r\n    members of the Cabinet, who so far had not belonged to it and he\r\n    handed them simultaneously the Gold Party Badge, the supreme\r\n    badge of honor of the party. In addition, the Fuehrer awarded\r\n    the Gold Party Badge to Generaloberst Freiherr von Fritsch;\r\n    Generaladmiral Dr. H. C. Raeder; the Prussian Minister of\r\n    Finance, Professor Popitz; and the Secretary of State and Chief\r\n    of the Presidential Chancellery, Dr. Meissner.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer also honored with the gold party badge the party\r\n    members State Secretary Dr. Lammers, State Secretary Funk, State\r\n    Secretary Koerner and State Secretary General of the Airforce\r\n    Milch.” (_2964-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was possible to refuse the party membership thus conferred. Only one\r\nman, von Eltz-Ruebenach, who was the Minister of Post and Minister of\r\nTransport at the time, did this. His letter from von Eltz-Ruebenach to\r\nHitler, dated 30 January 1937, reads as follows (_1534-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “My Fuehrer:\r\n\r\n    “I thank you for the confidence you have placed in me during the\r\n    four years of your leadership and for the honor you do me in\r\n    offering to admit me to the party. My conscience forbids me\r\n    however to accept this offer. I believe in the principles of\r\n    positive Christianity and must remain faithful to my Lord and to\r\n    myself. Party membership however would mean that I should have\r\n    to face without contradiction the steadily aggravating attacks\r\n    by party offices on the Christian confessions and those who want\r\n    to remain faithful to their religious convictions.\r\n\r\n    “This decision has been infinitely difficult for me. For never\r\n    in my life have I performed my duty with greater joy and\r\n    satisfaction than under your wise state leadership.\r\n\r\n    “I ask to be permitted to resign.\r\n\r\n                                          “With German Greetings:\r\n                                           Yours very obediently,\r\n                             “(signed)  Baron v. Eltz” (_1534-PS_).\r\n\r\nBut the Nazis did not wait until all members of the cabinet were party\r\nmembers. Shortly after they came to power, they quickly assured\r\nthemselves of active participation in the work of the Cabinet. On 1\r\nDecember 1933, the Cabinet passed a law securing the unity of party and\r\nstate (_1395-PS_). In Article 2 of that law the Deputy of the Fuehrer,\r\nHess, and the Chief of Staff of the SA, Roehm, were made members of the\r\nCabinet (_1395-PS_). Lest mere membership in the Cabinet would not be\r\neffective, Hitler endowed his deputy with greater powers of\r\nparticipation. An unpublished decree signed by Hitler, dated 27 July\r\n1934, and addressed to the Reich Ministers, provides (_D-138_):\r\n\r\n    “I decree that the Deputy of the Fuehrer, Reich Minister Hess,\r\n    will have the capacity of a participating Reich Minister in\r\n    connection with the preparation of drafts for laws in all Reich\r\n    Administrative spheres. All legislative work is to be sent to\r\n    him when it is received by the other Reich Minister concerned.\r\n    This also applies in cases where no one else participates except\r\n    the Reich Minister making the draft. Reich Minister Hess will be\r\n    given the opportunity to comment on drafts suggested by experts.\r\n\r\n    “This order will apply in the same sense to legislative\r\n    ordinances. The Deputy of the Fuehrer in his capacity of Reich\r\n    Minister can send as representative an expert on his staff.\r\n    These experts are entitled to make statements to the Reich\r\n    Ministers on his behalf.\r\n\r\n                               “[signed]  Adolph Hitler” (_D-138_).\r\n\r\nHess himself made pertinent comment on his right of participation on\r\nbehalf of the party, in a letter dated 9 October 1934, on the stationery\r\nof the NSDAP, addressed to the Reich Minister for Enlightenment of the\r\nPeople and Propaganda (_D-139_):\r\n\r\n    “By a decree of the Fuehrer dated 27 July 1934, I have been\r\n    granted the right to participate in the legislation of the Reich\r\n    as regards both formal laws and legal ordinances. This right\r\n    must not be rendered illusory by the fact that I am sent the\r\n    drafts of laws and decrees so late and am then given a limited\r\n    time, so that it becomes impossible for me to deal with the\r\n    material concerned during the given time. I must point out that\r\n    my participation means the taking into account of the opinion of\r\n    the NSDAP as such, and that in the case of the majority of\r\n    drafts of laws and decrees, consult with the appropriate\r\n    departments of the Party before making my comment. Only by\r\n    proceeding in this manner can I do justice to the wish of the\r\n    Fuehrer as expressed in the decree of the Fuehrer of 27 July\r\n    1934.\r\n\r\n    “I must therefore ask the Reich Ministers to arrange that drafts\r\n    of laws and decrees reach me in sufficient time. Failing this, I\r\n    would be obliged in future to refuse my agreement to such drafts\r\n    from the beginning and without giving the matter detailed\r\n    attention, in all cases where I am not given a sufficiently long\r\n    period for dealing with them.\r\n\r\n                                                            “Heil,\r\n                                    “[signed]  R. Hess.” (_D-139_).\r\n\r\nA handwritten note attached to the letter reads:\r\n\r\n    “1. The identical letter seems to have been addressed to all\r\n    Reich Ministers. In our special field the decree of 27 July 1934\r\n    has hardly become applicable so far. A reply does not seem\r\n    called for.\r\n\r\n    “2.

Where the Reich Ministers have\r\n    already, at an earlier date been engaged in the preparation of\r\n    such laws or legislative ordinances, or have participated in\r\n    such preparation, the Deputy of the Fuehrer likewise becomes\r\n    participating Reich Minister.

He was given the authority of\r\na Reich Minister and made a member of the cabinet. (_2099-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi constitutional lawyer, Ernst Rudolf Huber, has this to say\r\nabout the unity of party and Cabinet (_1774-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “Unity of party and Reich-Cabinet (_Reichsregierung_) is\r\n    furthermore secured by the numerous personal unions i.e.\r\n    association of Central State Offices with corresponding party\r\n    offices. Such personal unions exist in the cases of Food\r\n    Minister and the Propaganda Minister, the Chief of the German\r\n    Police and the Reich Labor Leader, the Chief of the Organization\r\n    in foreign countries, and the Reich Youth Fuehrer. Furthermore,\r\n    the majority of the Reich Ministries is occupied by leading old\r\n    party members. Finally, all Reich Ministers have been accepted\r\n    by the party on 30 January 1937 and have been decorated with\r\n    golden party insignia.” (_1774-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1943, out of 16 Reich Leaders (_Reichsleiters_) of the NSDAP, eight\r\nwere members of the Cabinet: Martin Bormann; Walter Darré; Otto\r\nDietrich; Wilhelm Frick; Paul Josef Goebbels; Constantin Hierl; Heinrich\r\nHimmler; Alfred Rosenberg (_2473-PS_). Through its domination of the\r\nCabinet the Nazi Party strove to secure the fulfilment of its program\r\nunder a facade of legality.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Decrees of the Ordinary Cabinet._ To the Nazi Cabinet, the Nazi\r\nParty program of 25 points (_1708-PS_) was more than a mere political\r\nplatform; it was a mandate for action. And the Cabinet acted.\r\n\r\nPoint 1 of this program declared:\r\n\r\n    “We demand the inclusion of all Germans in a greater Germany on\r\n    the grounds of the right of self-determination.” (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn implication of this demand the Nazi Cabinet enacted, among others,\r\nthe following laws: the law of 3 February 1938 concerning the obligation\r\nof German citizens in foreign countries to register (1938\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 113); the law of 13 March 1938 for the\r\nreunion of Austria with Germany (1938 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page\r\n237) (_2307-PS_); the law of November 1938 for the reintegration of the\r\nGerman Sudetenland with Germany (1938 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page\r\n1641); the law of 23 March 1939 for the reintegration of Memel in\r\nGermany (1939 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 559).\r\n\r\nPoint 2 of the Party platform stated in part:\r\n\r\n    “We demand * * * the cancellation of the treaties of Versailles\r\n    and St. Germain.” (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe following acts of the Cabinet supported this part of the program:\r\nThe proclamation of 14 October 1933 to the German people concerning\r\nGermany’s withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament\r\nConference (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 730); the\r\nproclamation and law of 16 March 1935, for the establishment of the\r\n_Wehrmacht_ and compulsory military service (1935 _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\nPart I, pages 369, 375) (_1654-PS_); and the defense law of 21 May 1935\r\nimplementing the last-named law (1935 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page\r\n609).\r\n\r\nPoint 4 of the Party platform read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Only those who are members of the ‘Volk’ can be citizens. Only\r\n    those who are of German blood, without regard to religion, can\r\n    be members of the ‘Volk’. No Jew, therefore, can be a member of\r\n    the ‘Volk’.” (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nAmong the cabinet laws which implemented this point were these: the law\r\nof 14 July 1933 for the recall of naturalization and the deprivation of\r\ncitizenship (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 480); the law of 7\r\nApril 1933 permitting persons of non-Aryan descent to be refused\r\npermission to practice law (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 188)\r\n(_1401-PS_); the law of 25 April 1933 restricting the number of\r\nnon-Aryans in schools and higher institutions (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\nPart I, page 225) (_2022-PS_); the law of 29 September 1933 excluding\r\npersons of Jewish blood from the peasantry (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\nPart I, page 685) (_1402-PS_); the law of 26 June 1936, forbidding\r\npeople of Jewish blood to hold positions of authority in the army (1936\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 518) (_1398-PS_); the law of 19 March\r\n1937 excluding Jews from the Reich Labor Service (1937\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 325); the law of 28 March 1938 on the\r\nlegal status of Jewish religious communities (1938 _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\nPart I, page 338); and the law of 6 July 1938 prohibiting Jews from\r\nparticipating in six different types of business (1938\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 823).\r\n\r\nPoint 23 of the platform proclaimed:\r\n\r\n    “We demand legislative action against conscious political lies\r\n    and their broadcasting through the press.” (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nTo carry out this point numerous Cabinet laws were passed, of which the\r\nfollowing are merely examples: the law of 22 September 1933 for the\r\nestablishment of the Reich Culture Chamber (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\nPart I, page 661) (_2082-PS_); the law of 4 October, 1933 regarding\r\neditors (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 713) (_2083-PS_); and\r\nthe law of 15 May 1934 regarding the theater (1934 _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\nPart I, page 411).\r\n\r\nAll the laws referred to above and hereafter were enacted specifically\r\nin the name of the Cabinet (_Reichsregierung_). A typical introductory\r\nparagraph reads:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Cabinet (_die Reichsregierung_) has enacted the\r\n    following law which is hereby promulgated. * * *” [Law of 1\r\n    August 1934, 1934 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 747].\r\n    (_2003-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of the Nazi plans to acquire totalitarian control of\r\nGermany (cf. Section 1-2 of Chapter VII), the Cabinet passed the\r\nfollowing laws: Law of 26 May 1933, providing for the confiscation of\r\nCommunist property (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 293)\r\n(_1396-PS_); Law of 14 July 1933 against the new establishment of\r\nparties (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 479); Law of 14 July\r\n1933 providing for the confiscation of property of Social Democrats and\r\nothers (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 479) (_1388-PS_); and Law\r\nof 1 December 1933 securing the unity of party and state (1933\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 1016). (_1395-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the course of consolidating Nazi control of Germany, (cf. Section 3\r\nof Chapter VII) the following laws were enacted by the Cabinet: Decree\r\nof the Cabinet, 21 March 1933, creating special courts (1933\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 136) (_2076-PS_); Law of 31 March 1933\r\nfor the integration of States into the Reich (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\nPart I, page 153) (_2004-PS_); Law of 7 April 1933 for the\r\nreestablishment of the Professional Civil Service (1933\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 175) (_1397-PS_); Law of 7 April 1933\r\nfor the integration of states into the Reich (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\nPart I, page 173) (_2005-PS_); Law of 30 June 1933 eliminating non-Aryan\r\ncivil servants or civil servants married to non-Aryans (1933\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 433) (_1400-PS_); Law of 20 July 1933\r\nproviding for the discharge of Communist officials (1933\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 518) (_1398-PS_); Law of 24 April 1934\r\ncreating the People’s Court (1934 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 341)\r\n(_2014-PS_); Law of 1 August 1934 uniting the office of President and\r\nChancellor (1934 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 747) (_2003-PS_); Law\r\nof 30 January 1935, Reich Governors Law, further reducing the\r\nindependence of the states (1935 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 65);\r\nLaw of 30 January 1935 providing for the abolition of representatives or\r\ndeliberative bodies in the municipalities (1935 _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\nPart I, page 49) (_2008-PS_); Law of 26 January 1937, the comprehensive\r\ncivil service law (1937 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 39); and Law\r\nof 18 March 1938 providing for the submission of one list of candidates\r\nto the electorate for the entire Reich (1938 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part\r\nI, page 258). (_2355-PS_)\r\n\r\nNazi extermination of political internal resistance in Germany, through\r\nthe purge of political opponents and through acts of terror, (cf.\r\nSection 4 of Chapter VII), was facilitated and legalized by the\r\nfollowing Cabinet laws: Law of 14 July 1933 against the new\r\nestablishment of parties (containing a penal clause) (1933\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 479) (_1388-PS_); Law of 3 July 1934\r\nconcerning measures for emergency defense of the State (legalizing the\r\nRoehm purge) (1934 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 529) (_2057-PS_);\r\nLaw of 20 December 1934 on treacherous acts against state and party and\r\nfor the protection of party uniforms (1934 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I,\r\npage 1269) (_1393-PS_); Law of 24 April 1934 making the creation of new\r\nor continuance of existing parties an act of treason (1934\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 341) (_2014-PS_); Law of 28 June 1935\r\nchanging the Penal Code permitting punishment under analogous law (1935\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 839) (_1962-PS_); Law of 16 September\r\n1939 permitting second prosecution of an acquitted person before a\r\nspecial court, the members of which were named by Hitler (1939\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 1841). (_2550-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the free trade unions in Germany, (cf. Section 5 of\r\nChapter VII), was made possible by the following Cabinet laws: Law of 4\r\nApril 1933 concerning factory representative councils and economic\r\norganizations (controlling employee representation) (1933\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 161) (_1770-PS_); Law of 19 May 1933\r\nconcerning Trustees of Labor (abolishing collective bargaining) (1933\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 285) (_405-PS_); Law of 20 January\r\n1934 regulating National Labor (introducing leadership principle into\r\nindustrial relations (1934 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 45)\r\n(_1861-PS_); and Law of 26 June 1935 establishing Reich Labor Service\r\n(compulsory labor service) (1935 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 769).\r\n(_1389-PS_)\r\n\r\nEven the anti-Jewish Nurnberg laws of 15 September 1935, although\r\ntechnically passed by the Reichstag, were nevertheless worked out by the\r\nMinistry of the Interior. Dr. Franz A. Medicus, who served as\r\n_Ministerialdirigent_ in the Ministry of the Interior, made this\r\nstatement in a book published in 1940 (_2960-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * The work of the Reich Ministry of Interior forms the\r\n    basis for the three Nurnberg Laws passed by a resolution of the\r\n    Reichstag on the occasion of the Reich party meeting of Freedom.\r\n\r\n    “The ‘Reich Citizenship Law’ as well as the ‘Law for the\r\n    protection of German blood and German honor’ (Blood Protection\r\n    Law) opened extensive tasks for the Ministry of Interior not\r\n    only in the field of administration. The same applies to the\r\n    ‘Reich Flag Law’ that gives the foundation for the complete\r\n    re-organization of the use of the flag * * *” (_2960-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Decrees of The Council of Ministers._ Decrees of the Council of\r\nMinisters similarly supplied the “legal” basis for other criminal\r\nactions of the Nazi conspirators. Among these laws are the following:\r\nDecree of 5 August 1940 imposing a discriminatory tax on Polish workers\r\nin Germany (1940 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 1077); Decree of 4\r\nDecember 1941 regarding penal measures against Jews and Poles in the\r\noccupied Eastern Territories (1941 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page\r\n759) (_2746-PS_); and Decree of 30 June 1942 concerning the employment\r\nof Eastern Workers (1942 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 419).\r\n(_2039-PS_)\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately upon Hitler’s coming to power, the Cabinet\r\nparticipated in the Nazi conspiracy to wage aggressive war. This fact\r\nappears clearly from the minutes of the second session of the working\r\ncommittee of the Delegates for Reich Defense, dated 22 May 1933 and\r\nsigned by Keitel (_EC-177_); from a letter dated 24 June 1935 and signed\r\nby von Blomberg, the Reichs Minister of War, which transmits a copy of\r\nthe secret, unpublished Reich Defense Law of 21 May 1935 and also a copy\r\nof the decision of the Reich Cabinet of 21 May 1935 in the Council for\r\nthe Defense of the Reich (_2261-PS_); and from a letter dated 5\r\nSeptember 1939 transmitting a copy of the secret, unpublished Reich\r\nDefense Law of 4 September 1938 (a note dated 4 September 1938 attached\r\nto this law states that the Reich Defense law of 21 May 1935 and the\r\ndecisions of the Cabinet previously mentioned are repeated) (_2194-PS_).\r\nThese three documents, important in the conspiracy to wage aggressive\r\nwar emphasize the participation of the Reich Cabinet and Reich\r\nMinisters, through legislative enactments, in the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Defense Council was a creation of the Cabinet. On 4 April 1933\r\nthe Cabinet decided to form that agency (_2261-PS_). The circumstances\r\nof its creation were discussed at the meeting of 22 May 1933 (_EC-177_):\r\n\r\n    “_Thoughts about a Reich Defense Council_\r\n\r\n    “All great European powers which are at freedom to arm, have a\r\n    RVR. One does not have to refer to history to prove the\r\n    necessity of this institution. The war has shown conclusively\r\n    that the cooperation with the various ministries has not been\r\n    close enough. The consequences did not fail to materialize. The\r\n    soldier is not in a position to have a say in all matters. The\r\n    disadvantages of the past system were caused by parallel efforts\r\n    of the various ministries in matters of the Reich defense. To\r\n    avoid these mistakes a _central agency_ has been created which\r\n    occupies itself already in peacetime in the widest sense with\r\n    the problems of Reich Defense. This working staff will continue\r\n    its existence in time of war.\r\n\r\n    “In accordance with the cabinet decision of the 4 April 1933 the\r\n    Reich Defense Council, which until now had been prepared for war\r\n    emergency, will go into immediate action.\r\n\r\n    “In time of peace its task will be to decide about all measures\r\n    for the preparation of the defense of the Reich, while surveying\r\n    and utilizing all powers and means of the nation.” (_EC-177_)\r\n\r\nThe composition of the Reich Defense Council is thereupon set out.\r\nHitler was President; the Minister of Defense was his deputy; and he,\r\nplus six more ministers (there were only ten at that time) and the\r\nChiefs of the Army and Navy Command Staffs were permanent members. The\r\nremaining ministers, as well as “leading industrialists”, were subject\r\nto call. Of the defendants who were then members of the Council, there\r\nwas von Neurath as Foreign Affairs Minister; Frick as Interior Minister,\r\nGoering as Air Minister; and Raeder as Chief of the Navy Command Staff.\r\n(_EC-177_)\r\n\r\nThe presence of Cabinet ministers was indispensable. The cabinet by that\r\ntime could legislate for the Reich. It had a definite role to play in\r\nthis planning, as Keitel pointed out (_EC-177_):\r\n\r\n    “_Col. Keitel_:—Points out once more the urgency of the tasks,\r\n    since it had been possible to do only very little in this\r\n    connection during the last years. He asks the delegates to\r\n    consider the Reich Defense at all times and represent it\r\n    accordingly at the drafting of new laws. Experiences of the wars\r\n    are available and are at the disposal of the various ministries;\r\n    (e.g. Reich Archives, Memorandum of an administrative official\r\n    about gasoline supply). All these sources must be taken\r\n    advantage of for the future. The task of the full time delegates\r\n    is also to bring about a close cooperation of the ministries\r\n    with each other.” (_EC-177_)\r\n\r\nEach separate ministry, moreover, was scheduled for a definite task.\r\n\r\n    “* * * In the work plans the questions and ideas are laid down,\r\n    which have come up in the _Reichswehr_ Ministry and must be\r\n    considered in case of mobilization. Up to the present time the\r\n    support on the part of other Ministries was frequently based\r\n    only on personal helpfulness since any authority from above was\r\n    lacking. The following work plans are finished.\r\n\r\n    “_a._ Work Plan for the Reich Ministry of Economics.\r\n    Work Plan for the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture.\r\n    Work Plan for the Reich Ministry of Labor.\r\n\r\n    “These three are composed in one work plan for the preparation\r\n    of a war economy.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ Work Plan for the Reich Postal Ministry.\r\n\r\n    “_c._ Work Plan for the Reich Traffic Ministry.\r\n\r\n    “Request the plans to be worked through carefully by the\r\n    competent Ministries. The plans will be discussed beginning of\r\n    June, when proposals for improvements may be made. The other\r\n    Ministries which have no work plans yet will receive them later\r\n    on. The Office of Air Raid Protection will work out a work plan\r\n    in conjunction with the Reich Commissariat for Aviation.”\r\n    (_EC-177_)\r\n\r\nThe secrecy of all undertakings was stressed:\r\n\r\n                       “_Security and Secrecy._”\r\n\r\n    “Question has been brought up by the Reich Ministries.\r\n\r\n    “The secrecy of all Reich Defense work has to be maintained very\r\n    carefully. Communications with the outside by _messenger\r\n    service_ only, has been settled already with the Post Office,\r\n    Finance Ministry, Prussian Ministry of the Interior and the\r\n    Reichswehr Ministry. _Main Principle of security_: No document\r\n    must be lost since, otherwise, the enemy propaganda would make\r\n    use of it. Matters communicated orally cannot be proven; they\r\n    can be denied by us in Geneva. Therefore, the _Reichswehr_\r\n    Ministry has worked out security directives for the Reich\r\n    Ministries and the Prussian Ministry of the Interior.”\r\n    (_EC-177_)\r\n\r\nAs time went on and greater concentration of power was needed, the\r\nCabinet made changes and additions to this secret war planning body.\r\nArticle 6 of the Secret Defense Law of 1935 (_2261-PS_) provided:\r\n\r\n    “(1) The Fuehrer and Reichschancellor will appoint a\r\n    plenipotentiary-general for war economy to direct the entire war\r\n    economy.\r\n\r\n    “(2) It is the task of the plenipotentiary-general for war\r\n    economy to put all economic forces in the service of carrying on\r\n    the war and to secure the life of the German people\r\n    economically.\r\n\r\n    “(3) Subordinate to him are:\r\n\r\n    The Reichsminister for Economy.\r\n    The Reichsminister for Food and Agriculture.\r\n    The Reichs Labor Minister.\r\n\r\n    The Reichs Forest Master, and all Reichs’ agencies immediately\r\n    subordinate to the Fuehrer and Reichschancellor. Furthermore the\r\n    financing of the war effort (in the province of the Reichs\r\n    Finance Ministry and of the Reichsbank) will be carried on under\r\n    his responsibility.\r\n\r\n    “(4) The Plenipotentiary-General for War Economy is authorized,\r\n    within his realm of responsibility to issue legal regulations,\r\n    which may deviate from the existing laws.” (_2261-PS_)\r\n\r\nSchacht was named as Plenipotentiary for War Economy. It will be noted\r\nthat the Reich Ministers for Food and Agriculture and for Labor, and the\r\nReichs Forest Master (who by this time had Cabinet rank) had not been\r\nincluded in the original membership of the Reichs Defense Council. Darré\r\nwas Minister for Food and Agriculture, Seldte for Labor, and Goering was\r\nReich Forest Master.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the Law was passed, the Cabinet made these decisions\r\ncovering the newly-created Plenipotentiary-General for War Economy\r\n(_EC-177_):\r\n\r\n    “1. The Plenipotentiary-General for War Economy appointed by the\r\n    Fuehrer and Reichschancellor will begin his work already in\r\n    peacetime * * *.\r\n\r\n    “2. The Reichsminister of War and the Plenipotentiary for War\r\n    Economy will effect the preparations for mobilization in closest\r\n    cooperation on both sides.\r\n\r\n    “3. The Plenipotentiary-General for War Economy will be a\r\n    permanent member of the Reich Defense Council\r\n    (_Reichsverteidigungsrat_). Within the working committee he\r\n    represents through his leadership staff the interests of war\r\n    economy.” (_EC-177_)\r\n\r\nThe complete reorganization of this Reich Defense Council took place in\r\n1938, under the Secret Defense Law of 4th September of that year. By\r\nthat time, there had been a reorganization of the Armed Forces: the\r\nchief of the OKW had been created and the War Ministry had been\r\nabolished (_2194-PS_). The Reich Defense Council in 1938 was composed of\r\nGoering, as permanent deputy and Minister of Air and Supreme Commander\r\nof the Air Force; Raeder as Supreme Commander of the Navy; Hess as\r\nDeputy of the Fuehrer; von Neurath as President of the Secret Cabinet\r\nCouncil; Frick as Plenipotentiary for the Reich Administration; Keitel\r\nas Chief of the OKW; Funk as Plenipotentiary for Economics; Ribbentrop\r\nas Minister of Foreign Affairs; Schacht as President of the Reichsbank\r\ndirectorate (_2261-PS_). An important part of the Reich Defense Council\r\nwas the Working Committee. The minutes of the twelfth meeting of the\r\nReich Defense Working Committee, on 14 May 1936, read (_EC-407_):\r\n\r\n    “1. _The National Minister of War and Supreme Commander of the\r\n    Armed Forces_, General Field Marshal von Blomberg, opened the\r\n    12th meeting of the Reichs Defense Committee by expressing\r\n    thanks for the work accomplished and pointing out in principle\r\n    the necessity of a preparation for a total mobilization with\r\n    emphasis on the most important measures to be taken at this\r\n    time. (Among others; mobilization schedule, legal basis,\r\n    preparations in the demilitarized zone.) He further indicates\r\n    the assignment of the national resources (_Reichsressort_) to\r\n    finance its measures for preparation of the Reichs defense out\r\n    of its budget.\r\n\r\n    “2. The _chairman_ of the _Reichs Defense_ Committee, Lieutenant\r\n    General Keitel, states:\r\n\r\n    “In today’s and future meetings of the Reichs Defense Committee\r\n    a cross section of the general situation concerning all matters\r\n    of the national defense is presented. The picture of the\r\n    situation does not appear in the reports of the meetings.\r\n\r\n    “The open discussion of State secrets before our large committee\r\n    gives the special obligation to the chairman of the Reichs\r\n    Defense Committee of pointing out its _secrecy_.\r\n\r\n    “Today’s sessions takes place under the auspices of the\r\n    restoration of the State authority in the demilitarized zone.\r\n\r\n    “The difficulties of the economic situation, which are presented\r\n    today, must be mastered.” (_EC-407_)\r\n\r\nThis Working Committee was still functioning in 1939. The Mobilization\r\nBook for Civil Administration of 1939 states, in part (_1639-A-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “D. _Terms for Mobilization Preparations by the Civil\r\n    Administration._\r\n\r\n    “The acceptance of all new measures in the Mobilization Book for\r\n    Civil Administration must be requested from the Chief of the\r\n    Reich Defense Committee (Department of State Defense in the\r\n    Armed Forces High Command).” (_1639-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe composition of the Working Committee was redefined by the Secret Law\r\nof 1938 as follows (_2194-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “_The Reich Defense Committee_ [_Reichsverteidigungsausschuss_]\r\n    (RVA):\r\n\r\n    “(1) The Reich Defense Committee is the working Committee of the\r\n    RVR. It prepares the decisions of the RVR, sees to their\r\n    execution, and secures collaboration between armed forces, chief\r\n    Reich offices, and party.\r\n\r\n    “(2) Presiding is the chief of the OKW. He regulates the\r\n    activity of the committee and gives the directions to the GBV\r\n    and GBW and to the Reich ministries not subordinated to them and\r\n    to the chief Reich offices according to the decisions of the\r\n    RVR, which directions are necessary for securing their uniform\r\n    execution.\r\n\r\n    “(3) The RVA is composed of the OKW, deputy of the commissioner\r\n    for the four year plan, the leader staffs of the GBV and GBW,\r\n    and the Reich Defense officials.\r\n\r\n    “(4) Chief office officials for the Reich defense\r\n    (_RV-Referenten_) and their deputies are commissioned by the\r\n    deputy of the leader, by the Reich Chancellery, by each Reich\r\n    Ministry, by the Reich Leader of the SS and chief of the German\r\n    police, by the Reich work leaders, by the Reich Forest Master,\r\n    by the Chief Inspector for the German Road Net, by the Reich\r\n    Office for Regional Order, by the Reichsbank directorate, and in\r\n    the Prussian state ministry. RV-Referent and his deputy are\r\n    immediately subordinate to the minister or the state secretary,\r\n    and to the chief of the Reich office, resp.” (_2194-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe GBV and the GBW mentioned in the portion quoted above are,\r\nrespectively, the Plenipotentiaries for Administration and for Economy.\r\nUnder them were grouped other ministries, some of which were already\r\npermanent members of the Council. By paragraph 3 of the Secret Law the\r\nfollowing were made subordinate to the Plenipotentiary for\r\nAdministration: the Ministers of the Interior, Justice, Science and\r\nEducation, Churches; the Reich Authority for Spatial Planning; and, for\r\nlimited purposes, the Minister of Finance. Subordinate to and under the\r\ndirection of the Plenipotentiary for Economy (a position formerly held\r\nby Schacht under the title “War Economy” and later held by Funk) were\r\nthe ministers of Economics, Food, Agriculture, Labor, and for limited\r\npurposes, the Reich Finance Ministry and the Reichsbank; the Reich\r\nForest Master; and the Commissioner for Price Control from the 4-Year\r\nPlan.\r\n\r\nParagraph 5 of the law (_2194-PS_) shows that subordinated to the Chief\r\nof the OKW were the Reich Postal Minister, the Reich Transportation\r\nMinister, and the General Inspector for German Highways.\r\n\r\nThis concentration of power by the Cabinet was for one purpose only: to\r\nplan secretly with the strongest means at hand for the waging of\r\naggressive war. Further evidence of this objective is contained in an\r\naffidavit by Frick covering the place, activities, and scope of the\r\nReich Defense Council, including the Three-Man College (_2986-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “I, Wilhelm Frick, being first duly sworn, depose and say:\r\n\r\n    “I was Plenipotentiary for Reich Administration\r\n    (_Generalbevollmaechtigter fuer die Reichsverwaltung_) from the\r\n    time when this office was created, until 20 August 1943.\r\n    Heinrich Himmler was my deputy in this capacity. Before the\r\n    outbreak of the war my task as Plenipotentiary for Reich\r\n    Administration was the preparation of organization in the event\r\n    of war, such as, for instance, the appointment of liaison men in\r\n    the different ministries who would keep in touch with me. As\r\n    Plenipotentiary for Reich Administration, I, together with the\r\n    Plenipotentiary for Economy and OKW formed what was called a\r\n    ‘3-Man College’ (_Dreierkollegium_). We also were members of the\r\n    Reich defense Council (_Reichsverteidigungsrat_), which was\r\n    supposed to plan preparations and decrees in case of war which\r\n    later on were published by the Ministerial Council for the\r\n    Defense of the Reich. Since, as soon as the war started,\r\n    everything had to be done speedily and there would have been no\r\n    time for planning, such measures and decrees were prepared in\r\n    advance in case of war. All one then still had to do was to pull\r\n    out of the drawer the war orders that had been prepared. Later\r\n    on, after the outbreak of the war, these decrees were enacted by\r\n    the Ministerial Council for the defense of the Reich.\r\n\r\n                    “(_Signed_)  _Dr. Wilhelm Frick_”  (_2986-PS_).\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n  LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE REICH CABINET\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 9.                │  I   │       6\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix B.                         │  I   │  29, 68\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

THE STURMABTEILUNG (SA)\r\n\r\nThe _Sturmabteilung_, or SA, is the organization which the world\r\nremembers as the “Brown Shirts” or Storm Troops—the gangsters of the\r\nearly days of Nazi terrorism. Since it was the first of the\r\norganizations created by the Nazis as instruments to effectuate their\r\nillegal objectives, the SA occupied a place of peculiar importance in\r\nthe scheme of the conspirators. Unlike some of the other organizations,\r\nthe functions of the SA were not fixed or static. The SA was an agency\r\nadapted to many designs and purposes, and its role in the conspiracy\r\nchanged from time to time various phases toward the final\r\nobjective—abrogation of the Versailles Treaty and acquisition of the\r\nterritory of other peoples and nations. If the conspiracy is likened to\r\na pattern, with its various parts fitting together like the pieces of a\r\njig-saw puzzle, the piece representing the SA would be found to\r\nconstitute the essential link in the pattern.\r\n\r\nThe SA participated in the conspiracy as a distinct and separate unit,\r\nhaving a legal character of its own. An ordinance passed in March, 1935,\r\nprovided that the SA and certain other agencies were thereafter to be\r\nconsidered “components” of the Nazi Party (_1725-PS_). This ordinance\r\nfurther provided, in Article 5, that:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The affiliated organizations can possess their own legal\r\n    character.” (_1725-PS_)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the 1943 Organization Book of the Nazi Party which\r\ncharacterizes the SA as an “entity,” declares:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer prescribes the law of conduct; he commands its use.\r\n    The Chief of Staff represents the SA as a complete entity on the\r\n    mandate of the Fuehrer.” (_3220-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhile the SA was composed of many individual members, they acted as a\r\nunit. They were closely bound together by many common factors, including\r\nuniform membership standards and disciplinary regulations; a common and\r\ndistinctive uniform; common aims and objectives; common activities,\r\nduties, and responsibilities; and a fanatical adherence to the\r\nideologies conceived by the Nazis. Although membership in the SA was\r\nvoluntary, the SA man was expected to withdraw if\r\n\r\n    “he can no longer agree with SA views or if he is not in a\r\n    position to fulfill completely the duties imposed upon him as a\r\n    member of the SA.” (_2354-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe SA man was well schooled in the philosophies and activities which he\r\nwas required to adopt in his daily life. Uniformity of action and\r\nthought in such matters was in part obtained by the publication and\r\ndistribution of a weekly periodical entitled “_Der SA-Mann_.” This\r\npublication was principally devoted to fostering various aspects of Nazi\r\nideology. In addition, “_Der SA-Mann_” reported upon the activities of\r\nthe SA and its constituent groups.\r\n\r\nThe SA developed from scattered bands of street ruffians into a cohesive\r\nunit organized on a military basis, with military training and military\r\nfunctions, and with an aggressive spirit and philosophy. The\r\norganization extended throughout the entire Reich and was organized\r\nvertically into local subdivisions. Horizontally, there were special\r\nunits including military, cavalry, communications, engineer, and medical\r\nunits. These various groups and branches were coordinated by the SA\r\nHeadquarters and operational offices, located in Munich.\r\n\r\n        A. _The Relationship Between The SA and The Nazi Party._\r\n\r\nThe affiliation between the SA and the Nazi leaders was closely\r\nmaintained, for the purpose of enabling the conspirators to employ the\r\nSA for any activity necessary in effectuating the objectives of the\r\nconspiracy. The SA was conceived and created by Hitler, in 1921, at the\r\nvery inception of the conspiracy. Hitler retained the direction of the\r\nSA throughout the conspiracy, delegating responsibility for its\r\nleadership to a Chief of Staff. Goering was an early leader of the SA,\r\nand maintained close connection with it throughout the conspiracy. Hess\r\nparticipated in many of the early battles of the SA and was leader of an\r\nSA group in Munich. Frank, Streicher, von Schirach, and Sauckel each\r\nheld the position of _Obergruppenfuehrer_ in the SA, a position\r\ncorresponding to the rank of Lieutenant General; and Bormann was a\r\nmember of the Staff of the SA High Command.\r\n\r\nThe close relationship between the SA and leaders of the Nazi Party is\r\ndemonstrated by the fact that the _Hoheitstraeger_ (Bearers of\r\nSovereignty) of the Nazi Leadership Corps were authorized to call upon\r\nthe SA for assistance in carrying out particular phases of the Party\r\nprogram. For example, at page 71 of the Organization Book of the Nazi\r\nParty (1943 edition) the following statement is made (_1893-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The _Hoheitstraeger_ is responsible for the entire political\r\n    appearance of the Movement within this zone. The SA leader of\r\n    that zone is tied to the directives of the _Hoheitstraeger_ in\r\n    that respect.\r\n\r\n    “The _Hoheitstraeger_ is the ranking representative of the Party\r\n    to include all organizations within his zone. He may requisition\r\n    the SA located within his zone for the respective SA leader if\r\n    they are needed for the execution of a political mission. The\r\n    _Hoheitstraeger_ will then assign the mission to the SA * * *.\r\n\r\n    “Should the _Hoheitstraeger_ need more SA for the execution of\r\n    political mission than is locally available, he then applies to\r\n    the next higher office of sovereignty which, in turn, requests\r\n    the SA from the SA office in his sector.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis close relationship is further shown by an ordinance for the\r\nexecution of a Hitler decree (_2383-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The leader of affiliated organizations, as well as the leaders\r\n    of the party women’s organization, are subordinate to the\r\n    sovereign bearer (_Hoheitstraeger_) politically, functionally,\r\n    disciplinarily, and personally.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The formations of the NSDAP, with exception of the SS, for whom\r\n    special provisions apply, are subordinated to the sovereign\r\n    bearer (_Hoheitstraeger_) politically and in respect to\r\n    commitment. Responsibility for the leadership of the units rests\r\n    in the hands of the unit leader.” (_2383-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was in compliance with the authority of the Leadership Corps that the\r\nSA was used in the seizure of trade union properties.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the SA demonstrated its close affiliation to the Nazi Party\r\nby participating in various ways in election proceedings. A pamphlet\r\nentitled “The SA,” depicting the history and general activities of the\r\nSA, written by an SA Sturmfuehrer upon orders from SA Headquarters,\r\ndeclares that the SA stood—\r\n\r\n    “at the foremost front of election fights.” (_2168-PS_)\r\n\r\nFurther evidence of the close relationship between the SA and Nazi\r\nleaders is found in the distribution list of the confidential\r\npublication of the Nazi Leadership Corps, which shows that this strictly\r\nconfidential magazine was distributed to Lieutenant-Generals and\r\nMajor-Generals of the SA. (_2660-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe interest and participation of Nazi leaders in the activities of the\r\nSA is clearly shown in the issues of “_Der SA-Mann_” for the period from\r\n1934 to March 1939 (_3050-A-E-PS_). Throughout these volumes there\r\nappear photographs of Nazi leaders participating in SA activities. The\r\nfollowing are descriptions of a few of these photographs, together with\r\nthe page numbers upon which they appear:\r\n\r\n        Photograph of Himmler, Huhnlein (Fuehrer of NSKK) and\r\n        Lutze, bearing caption: “They lead the soldiers of\r\n        National Socialism,” 15 June, 1935, p. 1.\r\n\r\n        Photograph of Hitler at SA Ceremony, carrying SA Battle\r\n        Flag. The picture bears the caption: “As in the fighting\r\n        years the Fuehrer, on Party Day of Freedom, dedicates\r\n        the new regiments with the Blood Banner,” 21 September,\r\n        1935, p. 4.\r\n\r\n        Photograph of Lutze and Hitler, 19 September, 1936, p.\r\n        4.\r\n\r\n        Photograph of Hitler and SA officers, 1 January, 1938,\r\n        p. 3.\r\n\r\n        Photograph of Streicher with SA men, and reviewing SA\r\n        Troops, 25 November, 1938, p. 1.\r\n\r\n        Photograph of Goering in SA uniform reviewing SA\r\n        marching troops under the caption: “Honor Day of the\r\n        SA,” 21 September, 1935, p. 3.\r\n\r\n        Photographs of Goering, Hess, and Hitler in SA uniform\r\n        at the ceremonies dedicated to SA men killed in the\r\n        Munich Putsch, 16 November, 1935, p. 3.\r\n\r\n        Photograph of Goering marching in SA uniform, 19\r\n        September, 1936, p. 3.\r\n\r\n        Photographs of Goering at ceremonies held upon occasion\r\n        of his being made Obergruppenfuehrer of the\r\n        Feldherrnhalle Regiment of the SA, 23 January, 1937, p.\r\n        3.\r\n\r\n        Photograph of Goering leading Feldherrnhalle Regiment of\r\n        SA in parade, 18 September, 1937, p. 3.\r\n\r\nThe work of the SA did not end with the seizure of the German government\r\nby the Nazis, but affiliation between the SA and Nazi leaders continued\r\nthereafter. The importance of the SA in connection with the Nazi\r\nGovernment and control of Germany is shown by the law of 1 December 1933\r\nentitled, “The Law on Securing the Unity of Party and State”\r\n(_1395-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * The Deputy of the Fuehrer and the Chief of Staff of SA\r\n    become members of the Reich Government in order to insure close\r\n    cooperation of the offices of the Party and SA with the public\r\n    authorities.” (_1395-PS_)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a decree promulgated by Hitler providing for supervision of\r\npremilitary training by the SA declares:\r\n\r\n    “The offices of the Party and State are to support the SA in\r\n    this training program and to value the possession of the\r\n    certificate for the SA military insignia.” (_2383-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe complete control of the SA by the Nazis at all times is shown by the\r\nso-called “Roehm Purge” of June 1934 (see _2407-PS_). Roehm had been\r\nChief of Staff of the SA for several years, and was responsible for the\r\ndevelopment of SA into a powerful, organization. SA members were\r\nrequired to take a personal oath of fidelity to Roehm. But when his\r\npolicies conflicted with those of the Nazi leaders, he was removed,\r\nmurdered, and replaced by Victor Lutze. This drastic action was\r\naccomplished without revolt or dissension in the ranks of the SA, and\r\nwith no change in its objectives or program. The SA remained “a reliable\r\nand strong part of the National Socialist Movement * * * full of\r\nobedience and blind discipline,” whose function was to “create and form\r\nthe new German citizens.” (_2407-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe importance of the SA in the Nazi plan for the utilization of the\r\npeople of Germany is shown in Hitler’s pronouncement “The Course for the\r\nGerman Person,” which appears in the issue of “_Der SA-Mann_” for 5\r\nSeptember 1936, at page 22. Hitler’s statement reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The boy, he will enter the Young Volk, and the lad, he will\r\n    enter the Hitler Youth, the young man will go into the SA, in\r\n    the SS, and in other units, and the SA and SS men will one day\r\n    enter into the labor service and from there to the Army, and the\r\n    soldier of the Volk will return again into the Organization of\r\n    the Movement, the Party, in the SA and SS and never again will\r\n    our Volk decay as it once was decayed”.\r\n\r\nThus the SA was constantly available to the conspirators as an\r\ninstrument to further their aims. It was natural that Victor Lutze, the\r\nformer Chief of Staff of the SA, in a pamphlet entitled “The Nature and\r\nTasks of the SA,” declared:\r\n\r\n    “The SA cannot be independent of the National Socialist Movement\r\n    but can only exist as a part of it.” (_2471-PS_)\r\n\r\n            B. _Participation by the SA in the Conspiracy._\r\n\r\nThe principal functions performed by the SA in furtherance of the\r\nobjectives of the conspiracy may be classified into four distinct\r\nphases, each of which corresponds with a particular phase in the\r\nprogression of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe first phase consists of the use of the SA and its members as the\r\ninstrument for the dissemination of Nazi ideology throughout Germany.\r\nThe employment of SA for this purpose continued throughout the entire\r\nperiod of the conspiracy. In the second phase, the period prior to the\r\nNazi seizure of power, the SA was a militant group of fighters whose\r\nfunction was to combat all opponents of the Party. In the third phase,\r\nthe period of several years following the Nazi seizure of power, the SA\r\nparticipated in various measures designed to consolidate the control of\r\nthe Nazis, including the dissolution of the trade unions, the\r\npersecution of the church, and Jewish persecutions. During this period\r\nthe SA continued to serve as a force of political soldiers whose purpose\r\nwas to combat members of political parties considered hostile to the\r\nNazi Party. The fourth aspect of SA activities consisted of its\r\nemployment as an agency for the building up of an armed force in Germany\r\nin violation of the Treaty of Versailles, and for the preparation of the\r\nyouth of Germany for the waging of an aggressive war.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Propagation of Nazi Doctrine._ From the very start the Nazi\r\nleaders emphasized the importance of the SA’s mission to disseminate\r\nNazi doctrines. The responsibility of propagating National Socialist\r\nideology remained constant throughout. This is shown in an excerpt from\r\n_Mein Kampf_ in which Hitler declared:\r\n\r\n    “* * * As the directing idea for the inner training of the\r\n    _Sturmabteilung_, the intention was always dominant, aside from\r\n    all physical education, to teach it to be the unshakeable\r\n    convinced defender of the National Socialist idea.” (_2760-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler’s pronouncement as to the function of SA in this respect became\r\nthe guiding principle of SA members, for _Mein Kampf_ was taken to\r\nexpress the basic philosophy of the SA. The Organization Book of the\r\nNazi Party declares that the training of SA members should consist of—\r\n\r\n    “The training and rearing upon the basis of the teachings and\r\n    aims of the Fuehrer as they are put down in ‘Mein Kampf’ and in\r\n    the Party program, for all spheres of our life and our National\r\n    Socialist ideology.” (_2354-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Party Organization Book also declares that the SA is the\r\n\r\n    “training and rearing instrument of the Party.” (_2354-PS_)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in an article which appeared in “_Der SA-Mann_”, at page 1 of\r\nthe issue of January 1934, the functions of the SA were set forth as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “First, to be the guaranty of the power of the National\r\n    Socialist State against all attacks from without as well as from\r\n    within.\r\n\r\n    “Second, to be the high institute of education of the people for\r\n    the living National Socialism.”\r\n\r\nThe function of the SA as propagandist of the Party was more than a\r\nresponsibility which SA took unto itself. It was a responsibility\r\nrecognized by the law of Germany. The law for “Securing the Unity of\r\nParty and State,” promulgated by the Reich Cabinet in 1933, provided:\r\n\r\n    “The members of the National Socialistic German Labor Party and\r\n    the SA (including their subordinate organizations) as the\r\n    leading and driving force of the National Socialist State will\r\n    bear greater responsibility toward Fuehrer, people and State.”\r\n    (_1395-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs the principal ideology bearers of the Nazi Party SA members were “the\r\nsoldiers of an idea,” to use the expression employed by Nazi writers.\r\nExamples of the use of the SA as Nazi propagandist will be seen in the\r\ndescription of the other functions performed by the SA. For in each case\r\nthe SA combined its propagandist responsibility instrument with the\r\nother functions which it performed in furtherance of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\n(2) _Strong-Arm Terrorization of Political Opponents._ In the early\r\nstages of the Nazi Movement the SA combined propaganda with violence\r\nalong the lines expressed by Hitler in _Mein Kampf_:\r\n\r\n    “The Young Movement from the first day, espoused the standpoint\r\n    that its idea must be put forward spiritually but that the\r\n    defense of this spiritual platform must, if necessary, be\r\n    secured by strong-arm means.” (_2760-PS_)\r\n\r\nSo that the Nazis might better spread their philosophies, the SA was\r\nemployed to gain possession and control of the streets for the Nazis.\r\nIts function was to beat up and terrorize all political opponents. The\r\nimportance of this function is explained in a pamphlet written by SA\r\nSturmfuehrer Bayer, upon orders from SA Headquarters (_2168-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “Possession of the streets is the key to power in the State—for\r\n    this reason the SA marched and fought. The public would have\r\n    never received knowledge from the agitative speeches of the\r\n    little Reichstag faction and its propaganda or from the desires\r\n    and aims of the Party if the martial tread and battle song of\r\n    the SA Companies had not beat the measure for the truth of a\r\n    relentless criticism of the state of affairs in the governmental\r\n    system. They wanted the young Movement to keep silent. Nothing\r\n    was to be read in the press about the labor of the National\r\n    Socialists, not to mention the basic aims of its platform. They\r\n    simply did not want to awake any interest in it. However, the\r\n    martial tread of the SA took care that even the drowsiest\r\n    citizens had to see at least the existence of a fighting troop.”\r\n    (_2168-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnd in _Mein Kampf_ Hitler defined the task of the SA as follows:\r\n\r\n    “We have to teach the Marxists that the master of the streets in\r\n    the future is National Socialism, exactly as it will once be the\r\n    Master of the State.” (_2760-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe importance of the work of SA in the early days of the Movement was\r\nindicated by Goebbels in a speech which appeared in _Das Archiv_ in\r\nOctober 1935:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The inner-political opponents did not disappear due to\r\n    mysterious unknown reasons but because the Movement possessed a\r\n    strong-arm within its organization and the strongest strong-arm\r\n    of the Movement is the SA * * *.” (_3211-PS_)\r\n\r\nSpecific evidence of the activities of the SA during the early period of\r\nthe Nazi Movement (1922-31) is to be found in a series of articles\r\nappearing in “_Der SA-Mann_” entitled, “SA Battle Experiences Which We\r\nWill Never Forget.” Each of these articles is an account of a street or\r\nmeeting-hall battle waged by the SA against a group of political\r\nopponents in the early days of the Nazi struggle for power. These\r\narticles demonstrate that during this period it was the function of SA\r\nto employ physical violence in order to destroy all forms of thought and\r\nexpression which might be considered hostile to Nazi aims or philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe titles of these articles are sufficiently descriptive to constitute\r\nevidence of SA activities. Some of these titles, together with the page\r\nand reference of “_Der SA-Mann_” upon which they appear, follow:\r\n\r\n Article entitled:    “We subdue the Red Terror,” 24 February, 1934: p.\r\n                        4.\r\n Article entitled:    “Nightly Street Battles on the Czech Border,” 8\r\n                        September, 1934: p. 12.\r\n Article entitled:    “Street Battle in Chemnitz,” 6 October, 1934: p.\r\n                        5.\r\n Article entitled:    “Victorious SA,” 20 October, 1934: p. 7.\r\n Article entitled:    “SA Against Sub-Humanity,” 20 October, 1934: p. 7.\r\n Article entitled:    “For the Superiority of the Street,” 10 November,\r\n                        1934: p. 10.\r\n Article entitled:    “The SA Conquers Rastenburg,” 26 January,\r\n                        1936[_sic_]: p. 7.\r\n Article entitled:    “Company 88 Receives its Baptism of Fire,” 23\r\n                        February, 1935: p. 5.\r\n Article entitled:    “Street Battles at Pforghein,” 23 February, 1935:\r\n                        p. 5.\r\n Article entitled:    “The SA Breaks the Red Terror,” 1 June, 1935: p.\r\n                        7.\r\n Article entitled:    “The Blood Sunday of Berlin,” 10 August, 1935: p.\r\n                        10.\r\n Article entitled:    “West Prussian SA Breaks the Red Terror in\r\n                        Christburg,” 24 August, 1935: p. 15.\r\n Portrait symbolizing the SA Man as the “Master of the Streets,”\r\n   entitled, “Attention: Free the Streets,” 11 September, 1937: p. 1.\r\n Article entitled:    “9 November, 1923, in Nurnberg,” 30 October, 1937.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the nature of these articles, the article appearing in\r\nthe Franken Edition of “_Der SA-Mann_” for 30 October 1937, at page 3,\r\nis typical. It is entitled: “9 November 1923 in Nurnberg,” and reads in\r\npart as follows:\r\n\r\n    “We stayed overnight in the Coliseum. Then in the morning we\r\n    found out what had happened in Munich. ‘Now a revolution will\r\n    also be made in Nurnberg,’ we said. All of a sudden the Police\r\n    came from the Maxtor Guard and told us that we should go home,\r\n    that the Putsch in Munich failed. We did not believe that and we\r\n    did not go home. Then came the State Police with fixed bayonets\r\n    and drove us out of the hall. One of us then shouted ‘Let’s go\r\n    to the Cafe Habsburg!’ By the time we arrived, however, the\r\n    Police again had everything surrounded. Some shouted then: ‘The\r\n    Jewish place will be stormed * * * Out with the Jews!’ Then the\r\n    Police started to beat us up. Then we divided into small groups\r\n    and roamed through town and wherever we caught a Red or a Jew we\r\n    knew, a fist fight ensued.\r\n\r\n    “Then in the evening we marched, although the Police had\r\n    forbidden it, to a meeting in Furth. During the promenade again\r\n    the police attempted to stop us. It was all the same to us.\r\n    Already in the next moment we attacked the police in our anger\r\n    so that they were forced to flee. We marched on to the Geissmann\r\n    Hall. There again they tried to stop us. But the Landsturm,\r\n    which was also there, attacked the protection forces like\r\n    persons possessed, and drove them from the streets. After the\r\n    meeting we dissolved and went to the edge of town. From there we\r\n    marched in close column back to Nurnberg. In the Wall Street\r\n    near the Plaerrer the Police came again. We simply shoved them\r\n    aside. They did not trust themselves to attack, for what would a\r\n    blood bath have meant? We decided beforehand not to take\r\n    anything from anyone. Also in Furth they had already noticed\r\n    that we were up to no good. A large mass of people accompanied\r\n    us on the march. We marched with unrolled flags and sang so that\r\n    the streets resounded: Comrade reach me your hand; we want to\r\n    stand together, even though they have false impressions, the\r\n    spirit must not die, Swastika on the steel helmet,\r\n    black—white—red armband, we are known as Storm Troop (SA)\r\n    Hitler!”\r\n\r\nThrough such means the SA was chiefly responsible for destroying all\r\npolitical elements hostile to the Nazis, including liberalism and\r\ncapitalism. This is shown by an article which appeared on 6 January,\r\n1934, at page 1 of “_Der SA-Mann_,” entitled “The SA Man in the New\r\nState!”\r\n\r\n    “The New Germany would not have been without the SA man and the\r\n    new Germany would not exist if the SA man would now, with the\r\n    feeling of having fulfilled his duty, quietly and unselfishly\r\n    and modestly step aside or if the new State would send him home\r\n    much like the Moors who had done his obligations.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “What has been accomplished up until now, the taking over of the\r\n    power in the State and the ejection of those elements which are\r\n    responsible for the pernicious developments of the post war\r\n    years as bearers of Marxist liberalism, and capitalism are only\r\n    the preliminaries, the spring-board for the real aims of\r\n    National Socialism.\r\n\r\n    “Being conscious of the fact that the real National Socialist\r\n    construction work would be building in an empty space without\r\n    the usurpation of power by Adolf Hitler, the movement and the SA\r\n    man as the aggressive bearer of its will primarily have directed\r\n    all their efforts thereupon, to achieve the platform of\r\n    continued striving and to obtain the fundamental for the\r\n    realization of our desires in the State by force * * *\r\n\r\n    “* * * Out of this comes the further missions of the SA for the\r\n    completion of the German revolution. First: To be the guaranty\r\n    of the power of the National Socialist State against all attacks\r\n    from without as well as within. Second: To be the high institute\r\n    of education of the people for the living National Socialism.\r\n    Third: to build a bridge over which the present day German youth\r\n    can march free and unhampered as first generation into the\r\n    formed Third Reich.”\r\n\r\n(3) _Consolidation of Nazi Control of Germany._ The Third function of\r\nthe SA was to carry out various programs designed to consolidate Nazi\r\ncontrol of the German State, including particularly the dissolution of\r\nthe trade unions and the Jewish persecutions. In the words of an SA\r\nofficer, it was the function of the SA to be the “tool for strengthening\r\nthe structure of the new State,” and “to clean up” all that was “worth\r\ncleaning up.” It was generally employed, says the SA man, “where\r\ncommunism and elements hostile to the State still insolently dared to\r\nrebel.” (_2168-PS_)\r\n\r\nSA groups were employed to destroy political opposition by force and\r\nbrutality where necessary. As an example, an affidavit of William F.\r\nSollman reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * From 1919 until 1933 I was a Social Democrat and a member\r\n    of the German Reichstag. Prior to March 11, 1933, I was the\r\n    editor-in-chief of a chain of daily newspapers, with my office\r\n    in Cologne, Germany, which led the fight against the Nazi Party.\r\n\r\n    “On March 9, 1933, members of the SS and SA came to my home in\r\n    Cologne and destroyed the furniture and my personal records. At\r\n    that time I was taken to the Brown House in Cologne where I was\r\n    tortured, being beaten and kicked for several hours. I was then\r\n    taken to the regular government prison in Cologne where I was\r\n    treated by two medical doctors * * * and released the next day.\r\n    On March 11, 1933, I left Germany.” (_3221-PS_)\r\n\r\nPrior to the organization of the Gestapo on a national scale local SA\r\nmeeting places were designated as arrest points, and SA members took\r\ninto custody Communists and other persons who were actually or\r\nsupposedly hostile to the Nazi Party. This activity is described in an\r\naffidavit of Raymond H. Geist, former U. S. Consul in Berlin:\r\n\r\n    “* * * At the beginning of the Hitler regime, the only\r\n    organization which had meeting places throughout the country was\r\n    the SA (Storm Troopers). Until the Gestapo could be organized on\r\n    a national scale the thousands of local SA meeting places became\r\n    ‘arrest points.’ There were at least fifty of these in Berlin.\r\n    Communists, Jews, and other known enemies of the Nazis party\r\n    were taken to these points, and, if they were enemies of\r\n    sufficient importance, they were immediately transferred to the\r\n    Gestapo headquarters.” (_1759-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition, SA members served as guards at concentration camps during\r\nthis consolidation period and participated in mistreatment of the\r\npersons there imprisoned. A report to Hitler by the public prosecutor of\r\nDresden concerning the _Knollprosse_ of one Vogel, who was accused of\r\nmistreatment of the persons imprisoned in a concentration camp, reads as\r\nfollows (_787-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The prosecuting authority in Dresden has indicted\r\n    Oberregierungsrat Erich Vogel in Dresden (case designation 16\r\n    STA 4 107/34) on account of bodily injury while in office. The\r\n    following subject matter is the basis of the process:\r\n\r\n    “Vogel belongs to the Gestapo office of the province of Saxony\r\n    since its foundation and is chief of Main section II, which\r\n    formerly bore the title ZUB (_Zentralstelle fuer\r\n    Umsturzbekaempfung_) (Central office for combatting overthrow).\r\n    In the process of combatting efforts inimical to the State Vogel\r\n    carried out several so called borderland actions in the year\r\n    1933 in which a large number of politically unreliable persons\r\n    and persons who had become political prisoners in the border\r\n    territories were taken into protective custody (_Schutzhaft_)\r\n    and brought to the Hohnstein protective custody camp. In the\r\n    camp serious mistreatment of the prisoners has been going on at\r\n    least since summer of 1933. The prisoners were not only, as in\r\n    protective custody camp Bredow near Stettin, beaten into a state\r\n    of unconsciousness for no reason with whips and other tools but\r\n    were also tortured in other ways, as for instance with a\r\n    drip-apparatus especially constructed for the purpose, under\r\n    which the prisoners had to stand so long that they came away\r\n    with serious purulent wounds of the scalp. The guilty SA-leaders\r\n    and SA-men were sentenced to punishment of six years to nine\r\n    months of imprisonment by the main criminal court of the\r\n    provincial court in Dresden of 15 May 1935 (16 STA. 3431.34).\r\n    Vogel, whose duties frequently brought him to the camp, took\r\n    part in this mistreatment, insofar as it happened in the\r\n    reception room of the camp during completion of the reception\r\n    formalities, and in the supply room, during issuing of the\r\n    blankets. In this respect it should be pointed out that Vogel\r\n    was generally known to the personnel of the camp—exactly\r\n    because of his function as head of the ZUB—and his conduct\r\n    became at least partly a standard for the above-named conduct of\r\n    the SA-leaders and men.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In his presence, for instance, the SA-men Mutze dealt such\r\n    blows to one man, without provocation, that he turned around on\r\n    himself. As already stated, Vogel not only took no steps against\r\n    this treatment of the prisoners, but he even made jokes about it\r\n    and stated that it amused him the way things were popping here.\r\n\r\n    “In the supply room Vogel himself took a hand in the beating\r\n    amid the general severe mistreatment. The SA-men there employed\r\n    whips and other articles and beat the prisoners in such a manner\r\n    that serious injuries were produced; the prisoners partly became\r\n    unconscious and had to lie in the dispensary a long time. Vogel\r\n    was often present in the supply room during the mistreatment. At\r\n    least in the following cases he personally laid violent hands\r\n    upon prisoners.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * the prisoner was laid across the counter in the usual\r\n    manner, held fast by the head and arms, and then beaten for a\r\n    considerable time by the SA men with whips and other articles.\r\n    Along with this Vogel himself took part in the beating for a\r\n    time, and after this mistreatment slapped him again, so that the\r\n    prisoner appeared green and blue in the face. The prisoner is\r\n    the tinsmith Hans Kuehitz, who bore the nickname Johnny. Upon\r\n    his departure Vogel gave the head of the supply room,\r\n    Truppenfuehrer Meier from 6 to 8 reichsmarks with the stated\r\n    reason that the SA men ‘had sweated so.’ The money was then\r\n    distributed by Meier to those SA-comrades who had taken part in\r\n    the mistreatment.” (_787-PS_)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the SA participated in the seizure and dissolution of the\r\nGerman trade unions in 1933, a measure taken by the Nazis under the\r\ndirection of Robert Ley. An official Nazi Party circular containing an\r\norder promulgated by Robert Ley concerning the program for the seizure\r\nof the union properties read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “SA, as well as SS, are to be employed for the occupation of\r\n    trade union properties and for the taking into protective\r\n    custody all personalities who come into the question.”\r\n    (_392-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe SA also participated extensively in the Jewish persecutions\r\nconducted by the Nazis. The affidavit of Mr. Geist, former U. S. Consul\r\nin Berlin (_1759-PS_) sets forth numerous instances of attacks upon\r\nJewish-American citizens. Mr. Geist also declares that on the morning\r\nafter the Nazis’ acquisition of power, SA groups roamed the streets of\r\nBerlin seizing and beating Jewish persons and other political opponents\r\nof the Nazi Party. Thereafter SA men participated in many attacks of\r\nphysical violence upon Jews, including Jewish-American citizens. In\r\naddition, uniformed SA men were employed as a display of threatening\r\nforce in order to coerce Jewish persons to dispose of their property at\r\ngreatly reduced values. (_1759-PS_)\r\n\r\nSA participation in the Jewish program of 10 to 11 November, 1938, is\r\ndisclosed in a confidential report of an SA Brigade Fuehrer to his Group\r\nCommander, dated 29 November, 1938 (_1721-PS_):\r\n\r\n  “TO:     SA Group Electrical Palatinate (Kurpfalz)\r\n           _MANNHEIM_\r\n\r\n    “The following order reached me at 3 o’clock on 10 November\r\n    1938.\r\n\r\n    ‘On the order of the Gruppenfuehrer, all the Jewish synagogues\r\n    within the 50th Brigade are to be blown up or set fire\r\n    immediately.\r\n\r\n    ‘Neighboring houses occupied by Aryans are not to be damaged.\r\n    The action is to be carried out in civilian clothes.

It was the function of the SA to create and\r\nfoster among the people an anti-Jewish spirit. Evidence of this function\r\nis to be found in the issues of “_Der SA-Mann_”. Article after article\r\nin this publication was devoted to propaganda designed to engender\r\nhatred toward the Jewish race. The nature of these articles is apparent\r\nfrom some of the titles:\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Finish up with the Jew”, with\r\n        subtitle: “We want no women to buy from Jews, and no\r\n        Jewish girl friends,” 27 July, 1935, p. 4.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “The Jewish World Danger,” 2 February,\r\n        1935, p. 5.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Jewish Worries,” (defending the\r\n        practices of excluding Jews from certain resorts). 20\r\n        July, 1935, p. 4.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Jews aren’t wanted Here,” with\r\n        pictures posted on outskirts of villages showing signs\r\n        bearing the same message. (1 June, 1935, p. 1.) The last\r\n        portion of this article reads as follows:\r\n\r\n“Since the day when National Socialism unrolled its flag and the march\r\nbegan for the Germany for Germans, our battle also included the Jewry *\r\n* * Let the Jew continue with his methods against New Germany.

On the contrary, the plan was to educate the members\r\nof the SA with this philosophy, and for the SA in turn to disseminate it\r\ninto the minds of the German people. This fact is demonstrated in the\r\nintroduction to a series of anti-Jewish articles entitled “Gravediggers\r\nof World Culture,” which began in the issue of 5 December, 1936, at page\r\n6. This introduction stated in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “We suggest that the comrades especially take notice of this\r\n    series of articles and see that they are further circulated.”\r\n    (_3050-A-E-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition, intensive campaigns were conducted to persuade the public\r\nto purchase and read “_Der SA-Mann_,” and various issues were posted in\r\npublic places so that the general public might read them. “_Der\r\nSA-Mann_” itself contained several photographs showing particular issues\r\nposted upon street bulletin boards. There are also several photographs\r\nshowing advertising displays, one of which reads as follows “_Der\r\nSA-Mann_ belongs in every house, every hotel, every inn, every waiting\r\nroom, and every store” (page 3 of the issue of 31 October, 1936).\r\n(_3050-A-E-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn view of such widespread publicity for the objectives and methods of\r\nthe SA, it is inconceivable that volunteers for membership did not know\r\nof the criminal character of this organization.\r\n\r\n(4) _Fostering of Militarism._ In the final phase of the SA in the\r\nconspiracy—its participation in the preparation for aggressive\r\nwarfare—the SA was again employed to inculcate a particular Nazi\r\nideology into the minds of the German people. It was the function of the\r\nSA to prepare Germany mentally for the waging of an aggressive war.\r\n\r\nAt all times, and especially during the period from 1933-39, SA leaders\r\nemphasized to SA members the duty and responsibility of creating and\r\nfostering a militaristic spirit throughout Germany. In 1933, Hitler\r\nestablished the so-called SA sports program and at that time, according\r\nto Sturmfuehrer Bayer in his pamphlet “The SA,”\r\n\r\n    “the SA was “commissioned to obtain an increase of and\r\n    preservation of a warlike power and a warlike spirit as the\r\n    expression of an aggressive attitude”. (_2168-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1937, Hitler renewed the so-called sports program and then declared\r\nthe program to be a means “for the fostering of a military spirit” among\r\nthe German people. (_3050-A-E-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Organization Book of the Party is to the same effect. The function\r\nof the SA is characterized as follows:\r\n\r\n    “While the political organization of the NSDAP has carried out\r\n    the political leadership, the SA is the training and education\r\n    instrument of the Party for the realization of the\r\n    world-philosophical soldier-like attitude.\r\n\r\n    “Consequently, the young German in the SA is being inculcated in\r\n    the first instance from the standpoint of world philosophy and\r\n    character, and trained as the bearer of National Socialist armed\r\n    will.” (_3220-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe contents of a number of articles designed to serve as war propaganda\r\nmaterial may be gained from their titles, which are very graphic. A\r\nnumber of articles relate to the Nazi _Lebensraum_ philosophy:\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “The German Living Space,” 5 January,\r\n        1935, p. 13.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Folk and Space—A Geopolitical View,”\r\n        27 April, 1935, p. 13.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “The Enlargement of our Living Space,”\r\n        25 April, 1936, p. 10.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Our Right, Our Colonies,” 10 October,\r\n        1936, p. 15.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Our Right for Colonies,” 18 December,\r\n        1937, p. 7.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Space and Folk,” 14 October, 1938, p.\r\n        3.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Colonies for Germany,” 2 January,\r\n        1937, p. 4. This article reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The German Ambassador in London, Herr von Ribbentrop, recently,\r\n    on occasion of a reception in the Anglo-German Fellowship * * *\r\n    has renewed, in a speech which aroused great interest, the\r\n    unretractable claim of Germany for the restitution of its\r\n    colonies which had been snatched away.\r\n\r\n    “Shortly thereafter the Reichsbank president and Reich Minister\r\n    of Economics, Dr. Schacht, published in the English magazine,\r\n    ‘Foreign Affairs,’ a detailed article on the German colonial\r\n    problem. * * *\r\n\r\n    “For the rest Dr. Schacht laid out the categorical demand that\r\n    Germany must, in order to solve its raw materials problem, get\r\n    colonies, which must be administered by Germany, and in which\r\n    the German standard currency must be in circulation.”\r\n\r\nThe next group consists of articles condemning the Versailles Treaty:\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “What is the Situation regarding our\r\n        battle for Equal Rights?” 7 April 1934, p. 4.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “The Dictate of Versailles,” 30 June,\r\n        1934, p. 15.

This article reads in part as\r\n        follows:\r\n\r\n            “This terrible word ‘Versailles,’ since a blind\r\n            nation ratified it, has become a word of\r\n            profanity for all those who are infatuated in\r\n            the spirit of this enormous production of\r\n            hatred.

Therefore, every last German\r\n            must also grasp the contents of this dictate so\r\n            that one single desire of its absolute\r\n            destruction fills the whole German Volk.”\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “How about Germany’s fight for Equal\r\n        Rights?” 16 March, 1935, p. 1.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Through Adolf Hitler’s Acts: Free\r\n        from Versailles,” 30 January, 1937, pp. 12-13.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Versailles will be Liquidated,” 13\r\n        February, 1937. This article reads in part as follows,\r\n        p. 4:\r\n\r\n            “The National Socialist Movement has again\r\n            achieved a victory, for upon its flag since the\r\n            beginning of the fight stands: The liquidation\r\n            of the Versailles Treaty. For this fight the SA\r\n            marched year after year * * *.”\r\n\r\nA third group consists of articles describing preparations for war\r\nallegedly being carried on by other nations:\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Military Training of the English\r\n        Youth” (showing pictures of Eton students wearing\r\n        traditional Eton dress—tall hats and frock\r\n        coats—marching with rifles), 26 January, 1935, p. 14.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “The Army of the Soviet Union” (with\r\n        pictures of self-propelled artillery and tanks. One\r\n        picture bears the quotation “The Artillery of the Red\r\n        Army is already extensively motorized”), 16 March, 1935,\r\n        p. 14.\r\n\r\n        Photograph of Russian Artillery bearing the notation\r\n        “Soviet Russian Heavy artillery on maneuver,” 16 March,\r\n        1935, p. 1.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Armies of Tomorrow” (discussion of\r\n        anticipated developments in motorized and mechanized\r\n        warfare. One section of the article is devoted to “plans\r\n        of foreign countries with respect to motorized armies”),\r\n        30 March, 1935, p. 14.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “The Red Danger in the East,” 4 April,\r\n        1936, p. 13.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “The Red Army Today,” 4 April, 1936,\r\n        p. 13.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Russia prepares for World War,” 29\r\n        August, 1936, p. 10.\r\n\r\n        Article entitled: “Red Terrorism Nailed Down,” 19 June,\r\n        1937, p. 7.\r\n\r\n        Cartoon bearing title “Stalin Wants World Revolution,”\r\n        26 February, 1938, p. 13.\r\n\r\nThese lists of articles are not exhaustive. These articles are merely\r\ntypical of many in similar vein which appear throughout the issues of\r\n“_Der SA-Mann_.”\r\n\r\n(5) _The Training of German Youth for Aggressive Warfare._\r\n\r\nThe important responsibility of training the youth of Germany in the\r\ntechnique of war, and of preparing them physically and spiritually for\r\nthe waging of aggressive warfare, was delegated to the SA. Hitler\r\ncharacterized this task of the SA in these words:\r\n\r\n    “Give the German Nation six million perfectly trained bodies in\r\n    sport, all fanatically inspired with the love for the Fatherland\r\n    and trained to the highest offensive spirit and a National\r\n    Socialist State will, if necessary, have created an Army out of\r\n    them in less than two years.” (_3215-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe military character of the SA is demonstrated by its organizational\r\nstructure (_2168-PS)_. As appears from the SA organizational chart,\r\n(_Chart Number 8_) it was organized into units closely corresponding to\r\nthose of the German army. The organizational scheme consisted of\r\ndivisions, regiments, battalions, companies, platoons, and squads. In\r\naddition, there were special units and branches, including cavalry,\r\nsignal corps, engineer corps, and medical corps. There were also three\r\nofficer training schools (_2168-PS_). SA members wore distinctive\r\nuniforms adapted to military functions, bore arms, and engaged in\r\ntraining, forced marches, and other military exercises. These facts are\r\ndisclosed in photographs and articles in “_Der SA-Mann_”.\r\n\r\nSA members, moreover, were governed by general regulations which closely\r\nresemble service regulations of an armed force (_2820-PS_). According to\r\nthese regulations, “discipline and obedience are the foundations as\r\nstrong as steel for each military unit.” These regulations further\r\nprovide for punishment for disobedience. The punishments provided\r\ndemonstrate the militaristic character of the SA. They include the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n Reprimand in private;\r\n Reprimand in presence of superiors and announcement\r\n thereof at formations;\r\n Prohibition of right to wear the service uniform;\r\n House arrest;\r\n Arrest and confinement in jail;\r\n Demotion in rank;\r\n Prohibition of right to carry weapon. (_2820-PS_)\r\n\r\nPreparation for war through the SA training program was commenced in\r\nGermany as early as 1933, but the scope of this program was not made\r\npublic because it constituted a violation of the Treaty of Versailles.\r\nThe strict secrecy with which the program was surrounded is shown by an\r\norder from the Chief of Staff of the SA dated 25 July, 1933 (_D-44_):\r\n\r\n    “Further to my instruction Z II 1351/33 dated 11 July 33, I find\r\n    cause to ask all SA authorities to exercise the greatest caution\r\n    with regard to any publicity given to the SA service not only in\r\n    the press, but also in the information and news sheets of the\r\n    individual SA units.\r\n\r\n    “Only during the last few days, the Reich Ministry of the\r\n    Interior, at the request of the Foreign Office, has given strict\r\n    instructions to all Reich authorities according to which the\r\n    most severe control is to be exercised on all publications which\r\n    might give other countries an opening to construe German\r\n    infringements of the terms of the Versailles Treaty. “As is\r\n    known from the Geneva negotiations, our opponents have piled up\r\n    material collected in Germany and submitted to them, which they\r\n    use against us on every occasion during the conferences.\r\n\r\n    “From this point of view, the information sheets circulating\r\n    among the subordinate SA units cause the liveliest concern. I\r\n    hold all higher SA leaders responsible that any such internal\r\n    information sheets appearing in the district of their command\r\n    are submitted to the most stringent control _before they go into\r\n    print_, and I feel compelled to draw attention to the threat of\r\n    a prosecution for treason, pronounced by official instructions\r\n    issued in the last few days, in cases where such reports,\r\n    printed no doubt in good faith, are publicized and therefore\r\n    exposed to the danger of falling into the wrong hands.\r\n\r\n    “On principle, pictures of the technical specialized units of\r\n    the SA and SS, in particular of the signals, motorized and\r\n    possibly also of the air wings which now exist outside these\r\n    formations, are forbidden, such pictures enabling other\r\n    countries to prove the alleged formation of technical troop\r\n    units.” (_D-44_)\r\n\r\nSecrecy was also required in the order assigning a _Wehrmacht_ officer\r\nto the SA in January, 1934, to assist in the SA Training Program\r\n(_2823-PS_). A memorandum from SA Headquarters dated 20 January, 1934\r\ndesignates an officer of the _Wehrmacht_ to assist in the military\r\ntraining of SA members and goes on to provide:\r\n\r\n    “For the purpose of disguise, Lt. Col. Auleb will wear SA\r\n    uniform with insignia of rank according to more detailed\r\n    regulations of the Supreme SA leaders”. (_2823-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe military training program of the SA was for many years conducted\r\nunder the guise of a sports program. This plan was created by Hitler as\r\nearly as 1920 in founding what he called the National Socialist Sport\r\nTroop (SA). Hitler’s declaration at the time of the creation of this\r\nsports organization was as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Sport Troop * * * is but the bearer of the military thought\r\n    of a free people.” (_3215-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe fact that the so-called Sports Program was in reality closely\r\nassociated with and in fact a means of providing military training for\r\nGerman youth, is shown by the following characterization of the program\r\nby Lutze, the Chief of Staff of the SA, in an article written in 1939\r\n(_3215-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * This goal setting also served for the decrees of the\r\n    Fuehrer to the SA of 1935 regarding the renewing of, in 1936\r\n    regarding the evaluation of, in 1937 regarding the yearly\r\n    repetitive exercises of the SA sport badge. Parallel to this\r\n    decree of the Fuehrer for the physical betterment and military\r\n    training the organizational and development missions within the\r\n    SA were met. Out of the conception that the preservation and\r\n    intensification of the military power of our people must\r\n    especially be requested by military and physical exercises, the\r\n    training was especially carried out systematically in these\r\n    fields. In 25 schools of the troop and in 3 Reichsfuehrer\r\n    schools of the SA yearly 22,000 to 25,000 officers and non-coms\r\n    were trained since 1934 in special educational courses until\r\n    they possessed the education and examination certificates. In\r\n    clearly outlined training directives the training goals which\r\n    had to be achieved yearly were given and at the same time the\r\n    yearly Reich competitive contests were established. Hand in hand\r\n    the training of the Fuehrer Corps and corresponding\r\n    organizational measures and the training at the front proceeded\r\n    on the broadest basis.” (_3215-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe military nature of the Sports Program is likewise demonstrated by\r\nthe tests and standards required to obtain the sports award. The\r\nOrganization Book of the Party lists these tests as follows (_2354-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The performance test includes three groups of exercises:\r\n\r\n        Body exercises,\r\n        Military sports,\r\n        Topographical (naval) services.\r\n\r\n    “Group I: Body exercises;\r\n\r\n        100-meter race,\r\n        Broad jump,\r\n        Shot-put,\r\n        Throwing of hand grenades,\r\n        3000-meter race.\r\n\r\n    “Group II: Military sports;\r\n\r\n        25-Kilometer march with pack,\r\n        Firing of small-caliber arms,\r\n        Aimed throwing of hand grenades,\r\n        200-meter cross-country race with gas masks over 4 obstacles,\r\n        Swimming or bicycle riding,\r\n        Basic knowledge of first aid in case of accidents.\r\n\r\n    “Group III: Terrain service;\r\n\r\n        Orientation,\r\n        Terrain observation,\r\n        Estimate of terrain,\r\n        Estimate of distance,\r\n        Camouflage,\r\n        Observing and reporting,\r\n        Utilization of terrain and general behavior in terrain\r\n        service.” (_2354-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1939, the SA Sports Program was formally recognized, in a decree\r\nissued by Hitler, as a military training program. At the same time the\r\nSA was openly declared to be an agency for pre- and post-military\r\ntraining, that is, military training prior to and following military\r\nservice in the _Wehrmacht_ (_2383-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe decree provided in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Der Fuehrer. In amplification of my decree of the 15th\r\n    February, 1935, and 18th March, 1937, regarding the acquisition\r\n    of the SA sport insignia and the yearly repetitive exercises, I\r\n    lift the SA sport insignia to the SA military insignia and make\r\n    it as a basis for pre-imposed military training.\r\n\r\n    “I designate the SA as standard bearer of this training.\r\n\r\n    “These soldiers who honourably were discharged out of the active\r\n    military service and who were serviceable soldiers are to be\r\n    placed into the Army ranks for the retaining of their spiritual\r\n    and physical energy and to be attached to the SA insofar as no\r\n    other organization of the Party (the SS, NSKK, and SFK) have\r\n    received them for special training.” (_2383-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe SA military training program was not confined to its members, but\r\nextended to the entire youth of Germany. Thus the Chief of Staff of the\r\nSA, in re-establishing the sports program in 1935, declared (_2354-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “In order to give conscious expression to the fostering of a\r\n    valiant spirit in all parts of the German people, I further\r\n    decide that this SA Sport Insignia can also be earned and worn\r\n    by persons who are not members of the movement, inasfar as they\r\n    comply racially and ideologically with the National Socialist\r\n    requirements”. (_2354-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet entitled “The SA”, shows that responsibility for conducting\r\nthis nation-wide program was lodged in the operational main office of\r\nthe SA (_2168-PS_). According to the pamphlet it was the duty of this\r\noffice to—\r\n\r\n    “Prepare the fighting training of the bodies of all Germans\r\n    capable of bearing arms (_Wehrfahig_) and as preparation\r\n    therefore must organize the execution of corporal exercises\r\n    (basic physical training) and sports achievements, so that the\r\n    widest stratum of the population is laid hold upon and will be\r\n    kept in condition to bear arms (_Wehrtuchtig_) both physically\r\n    and spiritually, as well as ideologically in character up to\r\n    greatest old age.” (_2168-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the SA carried the military training program into\r\nthe lives of the German people may be seen from the following excerpt\r\nfrom “Das Archiv” (_3215-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “Next to the companies of the SA were the sport badge\r\n    associations (SAG) in which all the militaristic nationals\r\n    entered who were prepared to voluntarily answer the call of the\r\n    SA for the preservation of military proficiency. Up until now\r\n    around 800,000 nationals outside of the SA could successfully\r\n    undergo the physical betterment as well as the political\r\n    military training of the SA on the basis of the SA sport badge.\r\n\r\n    “As pronounced proof heretofore it may be shown that alone\r\n    13,400 officers and around 30,000 non-coms in the Reserve Corps\r\n    of the Wehrmacht from its (SA) own ranks stand at the disposal\r\n    of the SA and can be employed at any time for the direction of\r\n    SA military forces * * *”. (_3215-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1939, the extension of the SA military program to non-SA members was\r\nofficially recognized by Hitler. This occurred in the ordinance for the\r\nexecution of the Hitler decree of 16 January, 1942:\r\n\r\n    “Every German man who has completed his seventeenth year and who\r\n    shows preliminary requirements for honorary service with the\r\n    weapon, has the _customary_ duty to win the SA military insignia\r\n    in preparation for military service.\r\n\r\n    “During the years in the Hitler Youth following his sixteenth\r\n    year, he is to prepare himself for the winning of the SA\r\n    military insignia.” (_2383-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe SA, in its military training program, was no mere marching and\r\ndrilling society. It embraced every phase of the technique of modern\r\nwarfare. This appears clearly from the articles on military training\r\nwhich appear throughout the issues of “_Der SA-Mann”. The titles of\r\nthese articles indicate their substance.

As early as\r\n1934, an SA memorandum provided that the SA chief of training and his\r\nsubordinates should remain—\r\n\r\n    “* * * in direct touch with the respective offices and sections\r\n    of the Reich Defense Ministry.” (_2823-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe same memorandum recites that a Lieutenant-Colonel of the _Wehrmacht_\r\nwas assigned to the SA with the duty of participating—\r\n\r\n    “* * * in all questions regarding training and organization * *\r\n    *.” (_2823-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother SA memorandum declared that:\r\n\r\n    “* * * permanent liaison between the Reich Defense Ministry and\r\n    the Supreme Commander of the SA * * * has been assured.”\r\n    (_2821-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler’s words regarding cooperation between _Wehrmacht_ and SA were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “The requirements of the _Wehrmacht_ are to be taken into\r\n    consideration in organization and training.\r\n\r\n    “The Chief of Staff of the SA releases the required executionary\r\n    directives in agreement with the Commander in Chief of the\r\n    _Wehrmacht_ units. He alone is responsible for the fulfillment.”\r\n    (_2383-PS_)\r\n\r\nA speech by the Chief of Staff of the SA relating to the technical and\r\nspecialized branches of the SA revealed that this opportunity for\r\ncollaboration with the _Wehrmacht_ in specialized military training was\r\nutilized to the utmost:\r\n\r\n    “In the course of this development also special missions for\r\n    military betterment (program) were placed on the SA. The Fuehrer\r\n    gave the SA the cavalry and motor training and called SA\r\n    Obergruppenfuehrer Littmann as Reich Inspector with the mission\r\n    to secure the * * * recruits and requirements for the German\r\n    Wehrmacht through the SA. In close cooperation with parts of the\r\n    Wehrmacht special certificates were created for the\r\n    communication, engineer and medical units which, like the\r\n    cavalry certificate of the SA, are valued as statement of\r\n    preference for employment in said units.” (_3215-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe specialized training given SA members, in accordance with the\r\nrequirements of technical branches of the _Wehrmacht_, is described by\r\nSA Sturmfuehrer Bayer as follows (_2168-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * On one side the young SA man who enters the armed forces\r\n    (_Wehrmacht_) from his branch, comes prepared with a multitude\r\n    of prerequisites which facilitate and speed up training in\r\n    technical respects; while on the other side those very soldiers,\r\n    having served, who return out of the armed forces into the SA\r\n    keep themselves, by constant practice, in a trained condition\r\n    physically and mentally and impart their knowledge to their\r\n    fellows.\r\n\r\n    “Thus they contribute a considerable portion to the enhancement\r\n    of armed strength (_Wehrkraft_) and armed spirit (_Wehrgeist_)\r\n    of the German people.” (_2168-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnd, with respect to the mounted or cavalry SA—\r\n\r\n    “* * * the SA each year is able to furnish many thousands of\r\n    young trained cavalrymen to our _Wehrmacht_. * * * At present\r\n    the SA cavalry has at its disposal 101 cavalry units in whose\r\n    schools, year in and year out, young Germans who are obligated\r\n    for military service receive the training which fits him for\r\n    entrance into a section of troops which is of their own\r\n    choosing.” (_2168-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe close relationship between the SA and the _Wehrmacht_ is shown\r\nthroughout the issues of “_Der SA-Mann_”, which contain a number of\r\narticles on military training written by _Wehrmacht_ officers. The same\r\nrelationship is shown in many photographs. For example, in the issue of\r\n1 May, 1937, at page 4, there is a picture of a _Wehrmacht_ formation\r\ndrawn up in front of an SA building with SA officers and men in the\r\nbackground. The picture is entitled—\r\n\r\n    “Day after day the closed formations of the _Wehrmacht_ march in\r\n    Wurzburg to the subscription places of the SA for thanksgiving\r\n    to the nation in order to announce its close relation with the\r\n    SA, and to express thanks to the Fuehrer for making the Reich\r\n    capable of defense.”\r\n\r\nPage 2 of the issue of 27 January, 1939, contains a photograph of the SA\r\nChief of Staff, Lutze, addressing a group of SA men. The photograph\r\nbears the caption, “We will be the bridge between the Party and the\r\n_Wehrmacht_.” Page 3 of the issue of 3 February, 1939, reproduces a\r\nphotograph of General von Brauchitsch and Chief of Staff Lutze reviewing\r\nan SA unit.\r\n\r\nThe close cooperation between the _Wehrmacht_ and the SA, and the\r\nsignificance of the SA military training program is shown by the fact\r\nthat service in the SA was considered as military service under the\r\nConscription Law of 1935. The Organization Book of the Party declared\r\nthat—\r\n\r\n    “Equally significant is a suitable education and training which\r\n    the SA has accomplished within the yearly classes, and which\r\n    have satisfied their arms obligation.” (_3220-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnd an article in “Das Archiv” declared—\r\n\r\n    “It was announced that conscripted SA men and Hitler Youths can\r\n    fulfill their military conscription in the SA Regiment\r\n    _Feldherrnhalle_ whose Commander is General Field Marshall SA\r\n    Obergruppenfuehrer Goering. The Regiment for the first time was\r\n    employed as Regiment of the Luftwaffe in the occupation of the\r\n    Sudetenland under its Fuehrer and Regimental Commander SA\r\n    Gruppenfuehrer Reimann.” (_3214-PS_)\r\n\r\nThere was never any misunderstanding among SA men as to the reasons\r\nwhich lay behind their military training program. They were preparing\r\nfor war and knew it. The purpose of the so-called “Sports Program” was\r\nannounced time after time in articles in “_Der SA-Mann_.” For example,\r\nthe introduction to an article entitled, “The War of Tomorrow,” which\r\nappeared in the issue of 6 July, 1937, at page 12, declared:\r\n\r\n    “By decree of the Fuehrer of 18th March, 1937, the SA Sport\r\n    Badge was declared as a means for the aggressive training of the\r\n    body, for the fostering of a military spirit, for the retaining\r\n    of military efficiency and thereby as a basis for German\r\n    military power. * * *\r\n\r\n    “* * * In the following article an attempt is made to occupy\r\n    every SA Fuehrer, who does not have the opportunity due to their\r\n    profession or many-sided SA services, with questions concerning\r\n    military policy and modern war direction, to give him an overall\r\n    view of facts, teachings, opinions and beliefs which today are\r\n    not without decisive influence upon the military policy, upon\r\n    the character of the coming war and upon the modern national\r\n    defense.”\r\n\r\n                D. _Participation of the SA in Warfare._\r\n\r\nIt would be natural in view of the above quotation, to expect the SA to\r\nhave been used as a striking force in the first steps of the aggressive\r\nwarfare launched by Germany, and as a basis for so-called Commando\r\nGroups. Such was the case. SA units were among the first of the Nazi\r\nmilitary machine to invade Austria in the spring of 1938. This fact was\r\nproudly announced in an article appearing in “_Der SA-Mann_” for 19\r\nMarch, 1938, at p. 10, entitled, “We were the First!” Similarly, the SA\r\nparticipated in the occupation of the Sudetenland (_3214-PS_). It was\r\nannounced that conscripted SA men and Hitler Youths could fulfill their\r\nmilitary conscription duty in the SA Regiment _Feldherrnhalle_,\r\ncommanded by General Field Marshall SA Obergruppenfuehrer Goering. The\r\nregiment was employed for the first time as Regiment of the Luftwaffe in\r\nthe occupation of the Sudetenland, under its Fuehrer and Regimental\r\ncommander SA Gruppenfuehrer Reimann.\r\n\r\nSA participation in the occupation of the Sudetenland is also shown by\r\nan affidavit of Gottlob Berger, a former officer in the SS who was\r\nassigned to the Sudeten-German Free Corps (_3036-PS_). Berger declares—\r\n\r\n    “* * * 1. In the fall of 1938 I held the rank and title of\r\n    Oberfuehrer in the SS. In mid-September I was assigned as SS\r\n    Liaison Officer with Konrad Henlein’s Sudeten German Free Corps\r\n    at their headquarters in the castle at Dondorf outside Bayreuth.\r\n    In this position I was responsible for all liaison between the\r\n    Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler and Henlein and, in particular, I was\r\n    delegated to select from the Sudeten Germans those who appeared\r\n    to be eligible for membership in the SS or VT (_Verfuegungs\r\n    Truppe_). In addition to myself, Liaison Officers stationed with\r\n    Henlein included an Obergruppenfuehrer from the NSKK, whose name\r\n    I have forgotten, and Obergruppenfuehrer Max Juettner, from the\r\n    SA. In addition, Admiral Canaris, who was head of the OKW\r\n    Abwehr, appeared at Dondorf nearly every two days and conferred\r\n    with Henlein.\r\n\r\n    “2. In the course of my official duties at Henlein’s\r\n    Headquarters I became familiar with the composition and\r\n    activities of the Free Corps. Three groups were being formed\r\n    under Henlein’s direction: One in the Eisenstein area, Bavaria,\r\n    one in the Bayreuth area; one in the Dresden area, and possibly\r\n    a fourth group in Silesia. These groups were supposedly composed\r\n    of refugees from the Sudetenland who had crossed the border into\r\n    Germany, but they actually contained Germans with previous\r\n    service in the SA and NSKK [Nazi Motor Corps] as well. These\r\n    Germans formed the skeleton of the Free Corps. On paper the Free\r\n    Corps had a strength of 40,000 men. Part of the equipment\r\n    furnished to Henlein, mostly haversacks, cooking utensils and\r\n    blankets, were supplied by the SA.” (_3036-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe adaptability of the SA to whatever purpose was required of it is\r\ndemonstrated by its activities subsequent to the outbreak of the war.\r\nDuring the war the SA continued to carry out its military training\r\nprogram, but it also engaged in various other functions:\r\n\r\n    “The General of the SA, Wilhelm Schepmann, gave further orders\r\n    to increase the employment of the SA in the homeland war\r\n    territories because of the requirements of total war employment.\r\n    This was done in numerous business conferences with Fuehrers of\r\n    the SA-Divisions.\r\n\r\n    “As a result of these conferences, as well as of measures\r\n    already carried out earlier for the totalization of the war\r\n    employment, the SA now has placed 86 per cent of its main\r\n    professional Fuehrer Corps at disposal at the Front even though\r\n    the war missions of the SA have increased in the fields of\r\n    pre-military training, the SA penetration into new territorial\r\n    parts of the Reich, the air war employment, the State and\r\n    national guard etc., during war time.\r\n\r\n    “The SA as a whole has given at present an even 70% of its\r\n    nearly million members to the Wehrmacht.” (_3219-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe SA even extended its activities into Poland:\r\n\r\n    “By command of the General of the SA, the ‘SA-Unit General\r\n    Government’ was established, the command of which was taken over\r\n    by Governor-General SA Obergruppenfuehrer Dr. Frank.”\r\n    (_3216-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn affidavit of Walter Schellenberg, bureau chief in the RSHA, reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * From the beginning of 1944 on the SA also participated in\r\n    many of the functions which had previously been entrusted only\r\n    to the SS, SIPO and Army, for instance the guarding of\r\n    concentration camps, the guarding of prisoner of war camps, the\r\n    supervision over forced laborers in Germany and occupied areas.\r\n    This cooperation of the SA was planned and arranged for by high\r\n    officials in Berlin as early as the middle of 1943 * * *.”\r\n    (_3232-PS_)\r\n\r\n       E. _Special Responsibility of Goering for the SA Program._\r\n\r\nHermann Goering participated in the conspiracy in his capacity as an SA\r\nmember and leader. In 1923, Goering became Commander of the entire SA. A\r\nfew months later Goering participated in the so-called Munich Putsch. SA\r\ntroops participated with him in this action.\r\n\r\nGoering’s intention to employ the SA as a terroristic force to destroy\r\npolitical opponents is shown by a speech made by him on 3 March, 1933,\r\nat a Nazi demonstration in Frankfurt Am Main (_1856-PS_). Goering spoke\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “Certainly, I shall use the power of the State and the police to\r\n    the utmost, my dear Communists! So you won’t draw any false\r\n    conclusions by the struggle to the death in which my fist will\r\n    grasp your necks, I shall lead with those down there. Those are\r\n    the Brown Shirts.” (_1856-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe importance of the SA under Goering in the early stages of the Nazi\r\nmovement is shown by a letter written to Goering by Hitler (_3259-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “My dear Goering:\r\n\r\n        “When in November 1923 the Party tried for the first time to\r\n    conquer the power of the State, you as Commander of the SA\r\n    created within an extraordinarily short time that instrument\r\n    with which I could bear that struggle. Highest necessity had\r\n    forced us to act, but a wise providence at that time denied the\r\n    success. After receiving a grave wound you again entered the\r\n    ranks as soon as circumstances permitted as my most loyal\r\n    comrade in the battle for power. You contributed essentially to\r\n    creating the basis for the 30th of January. Therefore, at the\r\n    end of a year of the National Socialist Revolution, I desire to\r\n    thank you wholeheartedly, my dear Party Comrade Goering, for the\r\n    great values which you have for the National Socialist\r\n    Revolution and consequently for the German people.\r\n\r\n        “In cordial friendship and grateful appreciation.\r\n\r\n                                                         “Yours,\r\n                                 “(s)  Adolf Hitler!” (_3259-PS_)\r\n\r\nAlthough Goering did not retain command of the SA, he at all times\r\nmaintained a close affiliation with the organization. This is shown by\r\nthe photographs of Goering participating in SA activities which have\r\nbeen mentioned previously. In 1937, Goering became Commander of the\r\n_Feldherrnhalle_ Regiment of the SA. This was the Regiment which was\r\nemployed in the occupation of the Sudetenland.

THE SCHUTZSTAFFELN (SS)\r\n\r\nIn the early weeks of the trial, there appeared in a newspaper\r\ncirculated in Nurnberg an account of a correspondent’s visit to a camp\r\nin which SS prisoners of war were confined. The thing which particularly\r\nstruck the correspondent was the one question asked by the SS prisoners:\r\nWhy are we charged as war criminals? What have we done except our normal\r\nduty?\r\n\r\nThe evidence which follows will answer that question. It will show that\r\njust as the Nazi Party was the core of the conspiracy, so the SS was the\r\nvery essence of Nazism. For the SS was the elite group of the Party,\r\ncomposed of the most thorough-going adherents of the Nazi cause, pledged\r\nto blind devotion to Nazi principles, and prepared to carry them out\r\nwithout any question and at any cost. It was a group in which every\r\nordinary value was so subverted that today its members can ask, what is\r\nthere unlawful about the things we have done?\r\n\r\nIn the evidence of the conspirators’ program for aggressive war, for\r\nconcentration camps, for the extermination of the Jews, for enslavement\r\nof foreign labor and illegal use of prisoners of war and for the\r\ndeportation and Germanization of inhabitants of conquered territories,\r\nin all this evidence the name of the SS runs like a thread. Again and\r\nagain that organization and its components are referred to. It performed\r\na responsible role in each of these criminal activities, because it was\r\nand indeed had to be a criminal organization.\r\n\r\nThe creation and development of such an organization was essential for\r\nthe execution of the conspirators’ plans. Their sweeping program and the\r\nmeasures they were prepared to use and did use, could be fully\r\naccomplished neither through the machinery of the government nor of the\r\nParty. Things had to be done for which no agency of government and no\r\npolitical party even the Nazi Party, would openly take full\r\nresponsibility. A specialized type of apparatus was needed—an apparatus\r\nwhich was to some extent connected with the government and given\r\nofficial support, but which, at the same time, could maintain a\r\nquasi-independent status so that all its acts could be attributed\r\nneither to the government nor to the Party as a whole. The SS was that\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nLike the SA, it was one of the seven components or formations of the\r\nNazi Party referred to in the Decree on Enforcement of the Law for\r\nSecuring the Unity of Party and State of 29 March 1935 (_1725-PS_). But\r\nits status was above that of the other formations. As the plans of the\r\nconspirators progressed, it acquired new functions, new\r\nresponsibilities, and an increasingly more important place in the\r\nregime. It developed during the course of the conspiracy into a highly\r\ncomplex machine, the most powerful in the Nazi State, spreading its\r\ntentacles into every field of Nazi activity.\r\n\r\nThe evidence which follows will be directed toward showing first, the\r\norigin and early development of the SS; second, how it was\r\norganized—that is, its structure and its component parts; third, the\r\nbasic principles governing the selection of its members and the\r\nobligations they undertook; and finally, its aims and the means used to\r\naccomplish them.\r\n\r\nThe history, organization, and publicly announced functions of the SS\r\nare not controversial matters. They are not matters to be learned only\r\nfrom secret files and captured documents. They were recounted in many\r\npublications, circulated widely throughout Germany and the world—in\r\nofficial books of the Nazi Party itself, and in books, pamphlets, and\r\nspeeches by SS and State officials published with SS and Party approval.\r\nThroughout this section there will be frequent reference to and\r\nquotation from a few such publications.\r\n\r\n              A. _Origin and General Functions of the SS._\r\n\r\n(1) _Origin._ The first aim of the conspirators was to gain a foothold\r\nin politically hostile territory, to acquire mastery of the street, and\r\nto combat any and all opponents with force. For that purpose they needed\r\ntheir own private, personal police organization. The SA was created to\r\nfill such a role. But the SA was outlawed in 1923. When Nazi Party\r\nactivity was again resumed in 1925, the SA remained outlawed. To fill\r\nits place and to play the part of Hitler’s own personal police, small\r\nmobile groups known as protective squadrons—_Schutzstaffel_—were\r\ncreated. This was the origin of the SS in 1925. With the reinstatement\r\nof the SA in 1926, the SS for the next few years ceased to play a major\r\nrole. But it continued to exist as an organization within the SA—under\r\nits own leader, however—the Reichsfuehrer SS.\r\n\r\nThis early history of the SS is related in two authoritative\r\npublications. The first is a book by SS Standartenfuehrer Gunter\r\nd’Alquen entitled “The SS” (_2284-PS_). This pamphlet of some 30 pages,\r\npublished in 1939, is an authoritative account of the history, mission,\r\nand organization of the SS. As indicated on its fly leaf, it was written\r\nat the direction of the Reichsfuehrer SS, Heinrich Himmler. Its author\r\nwas the editor of the official SS publication “_Das Schwarze Korps_”.\r\nThe second publication is an article by Himmler, entitled “Organization\r\nand Obligations of the SS and the Police.” It was published in 1937 in a\r\nbooklet containing a series of speeches or essays by important officials\r\nof the Party and the State, and known as “National Political Course for\r\nthe Armed Forces from 15 to 23 January 1937”. (_1992-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs early as 1929, the conspirators recognized that their plans required\r\nan organization in which the main principles of the Nazi system,\r\nspecifically the racial principles, would not only be jealously guarded\r\nbut would be carried to such extremes as to inspire or intimidate the\r\nrest of the population. Such an organization would also have to be\r\nassured complete freedom on the part of the leaders and blind obedience\r\non the part of the members. The SS was built up to meet this need. The\r\nfollowing statement appears on page 7 of d’Alquen’s book, “_Die SS_”\r\n(_2284-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “On the 16th of January, 1929, Adolf Hitler appointed his tested\r\n    comrade of long standing, Heinrich Himmler, as Reichsfuehrer SS.\r\n    Heinrich Himmler assumed charge therewith of the entire\r\n    _Schutzstaffel_ totaling at the time 280 men, with the express\r\n    and particular commission of the Fuehrer to form of this\r\n    organization an elite troop of the Party, a troop dependable in\r\n    every circumstance. With this day the real history of the SS\r\n    begins as it stands before us today in all its deeper essential\r\n    features, firmly anchored into the national Socialist movement.\r\n    For the SS and its Reichsfuehrer, Heinrich Himmler, its first SS\r\n    man, have become inseparable in the course of these\r\n    battle-filled years.” (_2284-PS_)\r\n\r\nCarrying out Hitler’s directive, Himmler proceeded to build up out of\r\nthis small force of men an elite organization which, to use d’Alquen’s\r\nwords, was “composed of the best physically, the most dependable, and\r\nthe most faithful men in the Nazi movement.” As d’Alquen further states,\r\nat page 12 of his book:\r\n\r\n    “When the day of seizure of power had finally come, there were\r\n    52,000 SS men, who in this spirit bore the revolution in the\r\n    van, marched into the new State which they began to help form\r\n    everywhere, in their stations and positions, in profession and\r\n    in science, and in all their essential tasks.” (_2284-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _General Functions._ The conspirators now had the machinery of\r\ngovernment in their hands. The initial function of the SS—that of\r\nacting as their private army and personal police force—was thus\r\ncompleted. But its mission had in fact really just begun. That mission\r\nis described in the Organizations book of the NSDAP for 1943 as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_Missions_\r\n\r\n    “The most original and most eminent duty of the SS is to serve\r\n    as the protector of the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n    “By order of the Fuehrer its sphere of duties has been amplified\r\n    to include the internal security of the Reich.” (_2640-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis new mission—protecting the internal security of the regime—was\r\nsomewhat more colorfully described by Himmler in his pamphlet, “The SS\r\nas an Anti-bolshevist Fighting Organization,” published in 1936\r\n(_1851-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “We shall unremittingly fulfill our task, the guaranty of the\r\n    security of Germany from the interior, just as the _Wehrmacht_\r\n    guarantees the safety, the honor, the greatness, and the peace\r\n    of the Reich from the exterior. We shall take care that never\r\n    again in Germany, the heart of Europe, will the\r\n    Jewish-Bolshevistic revolution of subhumans be able to be\r\n    kindled either from within or through emissaries from without.\r\n    Without pity we shall be a merciless sword of justice for all\r\n    those forces whose existence and activity we know, on the day of\r\n    the slightest attempt, may it be today, may it be in decades or\r\n    may it be in centuries.” (_1851-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis conception necessarily required an extension of the duties of the\r\nSS into many fields. It involved, of course, the performance of police\r\nfunctions. But it involved more. It required participation in the\r\nsuppression and extermination of all internal opponents of the regime.\r\nIt meant participation in extending the regime beyond the borders of\r\nGermany, and eventually, participation in every type of activity\r\ndesigned to secure a hold over those territories and populations which,\r\nthrough military conquest, had come under German domination.\r\n\r\n               B. _Organization and Branches of the SS._\r\n\r\nThe expansion of SS duties and activities resulted in the creation of\r\nseveral branches and numerous departments and the development of a\r\nhighly complex machinery. Although those various branches and\r\ndepartments cannot be adequately described out of the context of their\r\nhistory, a few words about the structure of the SS may be useful.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose reference is made to the chart depicting the\r\norganization of the SS as it appeared in 1945. This chart was examined\r\nby Gottlob Berger, formerly Chief of the SS Main Office, who stated in\r\nan attached affidavit that it correctly represents the organization of\r\nthe SS (_Chart Number 3_).\r\n\r\n(1) _Supreme Command of the SS._ At the very top of the chart is\r\nHimmler, the Reichsfuehrer SS, who commanded the entire organization.\r\nImmediately below, running across the chart and down the right hand\r\nside, embraced within the heavy line, are the twelve main departments\r\nconstituting the Supreme Command of the SS. Some of these departments\r\nhave been broken down into the several offices of which they were\r\ncomposed, as indicated by the boxes beneath them. Other departments have\r\nnot been so broken down. It is not intended to indicate that there were\r\nnot subdivisions of these latter departments as well. The breakdown is\r\nshown only in those cases where the constituent offices of some\r\ndepartment may have a particular significance in this case.\r\n\r\nThese departments and their functions are described in two official Nazi\r\npublications: The first is the Organizations Book of the NSDAP for 1943,\r\nat pages 419-422 (_2640-PS_). The second is an SS manual, which bears\r\nthe title: “The Soldier Friend—Pocket Diary for the German Armed\r\nForces—Edition D: Waffen SS” (_2825-PS_). It was prepared at the\r\ndirection of the Reichsfuehrer SS and issued by the SS Main Office for\r\nthe year ending 1942. In addition, the departments are listed in a\r\ndirectory of the SS published by one of the Main Departments of the SS\r\n(_2769-PS_). This document was found in the files of the Personal Staff\r\nof the Reichsfuehrer SS. It is entitled “Directory for the\r\n_Schutzstaffel_ of the NSDAP, 1 November 1944”, marked “Restricted”, and\r\nbears the notation “Published by SS Fuerhungshauptamt, Kommandant of the\r\nGeneral SS. Berlin—Wilmersdorf.”\r\n\r\nReturning to the chart, following down the central spine from the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS to the regional level, the Higher SS and Police\r\nLeaders, the supreme SS commanders in each region are reached.\r\nImmediately below these officials is the breakdown of the organization\r\nof the Allgemeine or General SS. To the left are indicated two other\r\nbranches of the SS—the Death Head Units (_Totenkopf Verbaende_) and the\r\nWaffen SS. To the right under the HSS Pf is the SD. All of which,\r\ntogether with the SS Police Regiments, are specifically named in the\r\nIndictment (Appendix B) as being included in the SS.\r\n\r\n(2) _Principal Branches of the SS._ Up to 1933 there were no such\r\nspecially designated branches. The SS was a single group, made up of\r\n“volunteer political soldiers.” It was out of this original nucleus that\r\nnew units developed.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Allgemeine SS._ The Allgemeine (General) SS was the main stem\r\nfrom which the various branches grew. It was composed of all members of\r\nthe SS who did not belong to any of the special branches. It was the\r\nbackbone of the entire organization. The personnel and officers of the\r\nMain Departments of the SS Supreme Command were members of this branch.\r\nExcept for high ranking officers and those remaining in staff\r\ncapacities, as in the Main Offices of the SS Supreme Command, its\r\nmembers were part-time volunteers. Its members were utilized in about\r\nevery phase of SS activity. They were called upon in anti-Jewish pogroms\r\nof 1938; they took over the task of guarding concentration camps during\r\nthe war; they participated in the colonization and resettlement program.\r\nIn short, the term “SS” normally meant the General SS.\r\n\r\nIt was organized on military lines as will be seen from the chart\r\n(_Chart Number 3_), ranging from district and subdistrict down through\r\nthe regiment, battalion, and company, to the platoon. Until after the\r\nbeginning of the war it constituted numerically the largest branch of\r\nthe SS. In 1939 d’Alquen, the official SS spokesmen, said, in his book,\r\n“The SS” (_2284-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The strength of the General SS, 240,000 men, is subdivided\r\n    today into 14 corps, 38 divisions, 140 infantry regiments, 19\r\n    mounted regiments, 14 communication battalions and 19 engineer\r\n    battalions as well as motorized and medical units. This General\r\n    SS stands fully and wholly on call as in the fighting years,\r\n    except for one small part of the chief leaders and men. The\r\n    corps, which are presently led by a Lt. General or Major\r\n    General, are subdivided into divisions, regiments, battalions\r\n    and companies.” (_2284-PS_)\r\n\r\nSimilar reference to the military organization of the General SS will be\r\nfound in Himmler’s speech, “Organization and Obligations of the SS and\r\nthe Police” (_1992-A-PS_), and in the Organizations Book of the NSDAP\r\nfor 1943 (_2640-PS_). Members of this branch, however,—with the\r\nexception of certain staff personnel—were subject to compulsory\r\nmilitary service. As a result of the draft of members of the General SS\r\nof military age into the Army, the numerical strength of presently\r\nactive members considerably declined during the war. Older SS men and\r\nthose working in or holding high positions in the Main Departments of\r\nthe Supreme Command of the SS remained. Its entire strength during the\r\nwar was probably not in excess of 40,000 men.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The SD._ The second component to be mentioned is the Security\r\nService of the Reichsfuehrer SS, almost always referred to as the SD.\r\nHimmler described the SD in these words (_1992-A-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “I now come to the Security Service (SD); it is the great\r\n    ideological intelligence service of the Party and, in the long\r\n    run, also that of the State. During the time of struggle for\r\n    power it was only the intelligence service of the SS. At that\r\n    time we had, for quite natural reasons, an intelligence service\r\n    with the regiments, battalions and companies. We had to know\r\n    what was going on on the opponents side, whether the Communists\r\n    intended to hold a meeting today or not, whether our people were\r\n    to be suddenly attacked or not, and similar things. I separated\r\n    this service already in 1931 from the troops, from the units of\r\n    the General SS, because I considered it to be wrong. For one\r\n    thing, the secrecy is endangered, then the individual men, or\r\n    even the companies, are too likely to discuss everyday\r\n    problems.” (_1992-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nAlthough, as Himmler put it, the SD was only the intelligence service of\r\nthe SS during the years preceding the accession of the Nazis to power,\r\nit became a much more important organization promptly thereafter. It had\r\nbeen developed into such a powerful and scientific espionage system\r\nunder its chief, Reinhard Heydrich, that on 9 June 1934, just a few\r\nweeks before the bloody purge of the SA, it was made, by decree of Hess,\r\nthe sole intelligence and counter-intelligence agency of the entire Nazi\r\nParty (_2284-PS_). Its organization and numbers, as they stood in 1937,\r\nwere thus described by Himmler (_1992-A-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The Security Service was already separated from the troop in\r\n    1931 and separately organized. Its higher headquarters, coincide\r\n    today with the _Oberabschnitte_ and _Abschnitte_—[that is, the\r\n    districts and subdistricts of the General SS]—and it has also\r\n    field offices, its own organization of officials with a great\r\n    many Command Posts, approximately three to four thousand men\r\n    strong, at least when it is built up.” (_1992-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nUp to 1939 its headquarters was the SS Main Security Office\r\n(_Sicherheitshauptamt_), which became amalgamated in 1939 into the Reich\r\nMain Security Office (or RSHA), one of the SS main departments shown on\r\nthe chart (_Chart Number 3_).\r\n\r\nThe closer and closer collaboration of the SD with the Gestapo and\r\nCriminal Police (Kripo), which eventually resulted in the creation of\r\nthe RSHA, as well as the activities in which the SD engaged in\r\npartnership with the Gestapo are discussed in Section 6 on the Gestapo.\r\nThe SD was, of course, at all times an integral and important component\r\nof the SS. But it is more practicable to deal with it in connection with\r\nthe activities of the whole repressive police system with which it\r\nfunctioned.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Waffen SS._ The third component is the Waffen SS, the combat\r\narm of the SS, which was created, trained, and finally utilized for the\r\npurposes of aggressive war. The reason underlying the creation of this\r\ncombat branch was described in the Organizations Book of the Nazi Party\r\nfor 1943:\r\n\r\n    “The Waffen SS originated out of the thought: to create for the\r\n    Fuehrer a selected long service troop for the fulfillment of\r\n    special missions. It was to render it possible for members of\r\n    the General SS, as well as for volunteers who fulfill the\r\n    special requirements of the SS, to fight in the battle for the\r\n    evolution of the National Socialist idea, with weapon in hand,\r\n    in unified groups, partly within the framework of the Army.”\r\n    (_2640-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe term “Waffen SS” did not come into use until after the beginning of\r\nthe war. Up to that time there were two branches of the SS composed of\r\nfulltime, professional, well-trained soldiers: the so-called _SS\r\nVerfuegungstruppe_, translatable perhaps as “SS Emergency Troops”; and\r\nthe _SS Totenkopf Verbaende_, the “Death Head Units.” After the\r\nbeginning of the war, the units of the _SS Verfuegungstruppe_ were\r\nbrought up to division strength, and new divisions were added to them.\r\nMoreover, parts of the SS Death Head Units were formed into a division,\r\nthe _SS Totenkopf Division_. All these divisions then came to be known\r\ncollectively as the “Waffen SS”.\r\n\r\nThis development is traced in the Organization Book of the Nazi Party\r\nfor 1943:\r\n\r\n    “The origin of the Waffen SS goes back to the decree of 17 March\r\n    1933, establishing the “Stabswache” with an original strength of\r\n    120 men. Out of this small group developed the later-called SS\r\n    Verfuegungstruppe (SS Emergency Force).” (_2640-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe function and status of the _SS Verfuegungstruppe_ are described in a\r\nTop Secret Hitler order, 17 August 1938 (_647-PS_). That order provides,\r\nin part:\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “II. The Armed Units of the SS.\r\n\r\n    “A. (The _SS Verfuegungstruppe_)\r\n\r\n    “1. The _SS Verfuegungstruppe_ is neither a part of the\r\n    Wehrmacht nor a part of the police. It is a standing armed unit\r\n    exclusively at my disposal. As such and as a unit of the NSDAP\r\n    its members are to be selected by the Reichsfuehrer SS according\r\n    to the philosophical and political standards which I have\r\n    ordered for the NSDAP and for the _Schutzstaffel_. Its members\r\n    are to be trained and its ranks filled with volunteers from\r\n    those who are subject to serve in the army who have finished\r\n    their duties in the obligatory labor service. The service period\r\n    for volunteers is for 4 years. It may be prolonged for _SS\r\n    Unterfuehrer_. Such regulations are in force for SS leaders. The\r\n    regular compulsory military service (par. 8 of the law relating\r\n    to military service) is fulfilled by service of the same amount\r\n    of time in the _SS Verfuegungstruppe_.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “III. Orders for the Case of Mobilization.\r\n\r\n    “A. The employment of the _SS Verfuegungstruppe_ in case of\r\n    mobilization is a double one.\r\n\r\n    “1. By the Supreme Commander of the Army within the wartime\r\n    army. In that case it comes completely under military laws and\r\n    regulations, but remains a unit of the NSDAP politically.\r\n\r\n    “2. In case of necessity in the interior according to my orders,\r\n    in that case it is under the Reichsfuehrer SS and chief of the\r\n    German Police.\r\n\r\n    “In case of mobilization I myself will make the decision about\r\n    the time, strength and manner of the incorporation of the _SS\r\n    Verfuegungstruppe_ into the wartime army, these things will\r\n    depend on the inner-political situation at that time.”\r\n    (_647-PS_)\r\n\r\nImmediately after the issuance of this decree, this militarized force\r\nwas employed with the Army for aggressive purposes—the taking over of\r\nthe Sudetenland. Following this action, feverish preparations to\r\nmotorize the force and to organize new units, such as antitank, machine\r\ngun, and reconnaissance battalions, were undertaken pursuant to further\r\ndirectives of the Fuehrer. By September 1939, the force was fully\r\nmotorized, its units had been increased to division strength, and it was\r\nprepared for combat. These steps are described in the National Socialist\r\nYearbook for the years 1940 (_2164-PS_) and 1941 (_2163-PS_). The\r\nYearbook was an official publication of the Nazi Party, edited by\r\nReichsleiter Robert Ley and published by the Nazi Party publishing\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nAfter the launching of the Polish invasion, and as the war progressed,\r\nstill further divisions were added. The Organizations Book of the Nazi\r\nParty for 1943 (_2640-PS_) lists some eight divisions and two infantry\r\nbrigades as existing at the end of 1942. This was no longer a mere\r\nemergency force. It was an SS army and hence came to be designated as\r\nthe “Waffen SS” that is, “Armed” or “Combat” SS. Himmler referred to the\r\nspectacular development of this SS combat branch in his speech at Posen\r\non 4 October 1943 to SS Gruppenfuehrers, in these terms:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Now I come to our own development, to that of the SS in\r\n    the past months. Looking back on the whole war, this development\r\n    was fantastic. It took place at an absolutely terrific speed.\r\n    Let us look back a little to 1939. At that time we were a few\r\n    regiments, guard units (_Wachverbande_) 8 to 9,000 strong,—that\r\n    is, not even a division, all in all 25 to 28,000 men at the\r\n    outside. True, we were armed, but really only got our artillery\r\n    regiment as our heavy arm two months before the war began.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In the hard battles of this year, the Waffen-SS has been welded\r\n    together in the bitterest hours from the most varied divisions\r\n    and sections, and from these it formed: bodyguard units\r\n    (_Leibstandarte_), military SS (_Verfuegungstruppe_), Death’s\r\n    Head Units, and then the Germanic SS. Now when our ‘Reich’,\r\n    Death’s Head Cavalry Divisions and ‘Viking’ Divisions were\r\n    there, everyone knew in these last weeks: ‘Viking’ is at my\r\n    side, ‘Reich’ is at my side, ‘Death’s Head’ is at my\r\n    side,—‘Thank God’ now nothing can happen to us.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe transformation of a small emergency force into a vast combat Army\r\ndid not result in any separation of this branch from the SS. Although\r\ntactically under the command of the _Wehrmacht_ while in the field, it\r\nremained as much a part of the SS as any other branch of that\r\norganization. Throughout the war it was recruited, trained, administered\r\nand supplied by the main offices of the SS Supreme Command.\r\nIdeologically and racially its members were selected in conformity with\r\nSS standards, as shown by the recruiting standards of the Waffen SS\r\npublished in the SS manual, “The Soldier Friend” (_2825-PS_). A section\r\nof that manual entitled “The Way to the Waffen SS,” reads:\r\n\r\n    “Today at last is the longed-for day of the entrance examination\r\n    where the examiners and physicians decide whether or not the\r\n    candidate is ideologically and physically qualified to do\r\n    service in the Armed Forces SS.\r\n\r\n    “Everyone has acquainted himself with the comprehensive Manual\r\n    for the Waffen SS; the principal points are as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. Service in the Armed Forces SS counts as military service.\r\n    Only volunteers are accepted.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “3. Every pure-blooded German in good health between the ages of\r\n    17 and 45 can become a member of the armed forces SS. He must\r\n    meet all the requirements of the SS, must be of excellent\r\n    character, have no criminal record, and be an ardent adherent to\r\n    all Nazi socialist doctrines. Members of the _Streifendienst_\r\n    and of the _Landdienst_ of the Hitler Youth will be given\r\n    preference because their aptitudes, qualities and schooling are\r\n    indicative that they have become acquainted very early with the\r\n    ideology of the SS.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In all cases of doubt or difficulty the recruiting offices of\r\n    the Waffen SS will advise and aid volunteers. They have branches\r\n    over the entire Reich, always at the seat of the Service Command\r\n    Headquarters, and work closely with the recruiting of the Waffen\r\n    SS in the Main Office (SS Hauptamt) of the Reichsfuehrer SS.”\r\n    (_2825-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe recruiting activities of the SS Main Office are illustrated by its\r\nrecruiting pamphlet, “The SS Calls You,” an elaborate illustrated\r\nbooklet containing full information covering the Waffen SS:\r\n\r\n    “If you answer the call of the Waffen SS and volunteer to join\r\n    the ranks of the great Front of SS Divisions, you will belong to\r\n    a corps which has from the very beginning been directed toward\r\n    outstanding achievements, and, because of this fact, has\r\n    developed an especially deep feeling of comradeship. You will be\r\n    bearing arms with a corps that embraces the most valuable\r\n    elements of the young German generation. Over and above that you\r\n    will be especially bound to the National Socialist ideology.”\r\n    (_3429-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe SS Main Office, through which these recruiting activities were\r\nconducted, was one of the principal departments of the SS Supreme\r\nCommand. It is shown on the chart (the second box from the left) (_Chart\r\nNumber 3_). In the breakdown of that department, shown by the boxes\r\nunderneath, will be found the central recruiting office.\r\n\r\nOther departments of the Supreme Command performed other functions in\r\nconnection with the Waffen SS. The SS Operational Headquarters (_SS\r\nFuehrungshauptamt_)—the fifth box from the left—contains the Command\r\nHeadquarters of the Waffen SS (_Chart Number 3_). The functions of this\r\ndepartment are thus defined in the SS Manual, “The Soldier Friend”:\r\n\r\n    “In the _Fuehrungshauptamt_ the command office of the Waffen SS\r\n    handles tasks of military leadership: Training and organization\r\n    of the units of the Waffen SS, supply of the troops with arms,\r\n    equipment and ammunition, procurement of motor vehicles for the\r\n    Waffen SS and General SS, personnel and disciplinary affairs.”\r\n    (_2825-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe SS Legal Main Office (_Hauptamt SS Gericht_) (indicated on the chart\r\nby the second box from the top on the right hand side within the heavy\r\nembracing line—(_Chart Number 3_)) controlled the administration of\r\ncourts-martial and discipline within the Waffen SS. The secret Hitler\r\norder of 17 August 1938 (_647-PS_) had, it is true, provided that in the\r\nevent of mobilization the SS militarized forces should come completely\r\nunder military laws and regulations. That provision was modified by\r\nsubsequent enactments: The decree of 17 October 1939 relating to special\r\njurisdiction in penal matters for members of the SS and for members of\r\npolice groups on special tasks (_2946-PS_); and the decree of 17 April\r\n1940, entitled “Second Decree for the Implementation of the Decree\r\nRelating to a Special Jurisdiction in Penal Matters for Members of the\r\nSS” (_2947-PS_). These two decrees established a special jurisdiction in\r\npenal matters for various classes of SS members, including members of\r\nthe SS militarized units, in cases which would ordinarily fall under the\r\njurisdiction of the _Wehrmacht_; and created special SS courts to handle\r\nsuch cases under the direction of the SS Legal Main Office. Thus, in the\r\nvital question of discipline, as well as in recruiting, administration,\r\nand supply, the Waffen SS was subject to the SS Supreme Command.\r\n\r\nThe place of the Waffen SS as an integral part of the entire SS\r\norganization was strongly emphasized by Himmler in his address to\r\nofficers of the _SS Leibstandarte_ “Adolf Hitler” on the “Day of Metz”:\r\n\r\n    “You must also consider the following: I cannot concentrate my\r\n    mind solely on—now, please don’t become conceited—the most\r\n    splendid part of the SS because it _is_ the most positive part\r\n    and because the trade you are following _is_ the most positive\r\n    and most manly. I cannot do that. I must always have the\r\n    _entire_ SS in my mind.\r\n\r\n    “If I did not see this part, I would deny life to this most\r\n    positive and most manly part of our activity; i.e., the Armed\r\n    SS. I would deny your life. Because this armed SS will live only\r\n    if the entire SS is alive. If the entire corps is actually an\r\n    order which lives according to these laws and realizes that one\r\n    part cannot exist without the other—you are unimaginable\r\n    without the General SS, and the latter is not imaginable without\r\n    you. The police is not imaginable without the SS, nor are we\r\n    imaginable without this executive branch of the state which is\r\n    in our hands.” (_1918-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The Totenkopf Verbaende._\r\n\r\nThe fourth component to be mentioned is the SS Death Head Units (_SS\r\nTotenkopf Verbaende_). Their origin and purpose are succinctly described\r\nby d’Alquen on page 20 of his book, “_Die SS_”:\r\n\r\n    “The SS Death Head Units form one part of the garrisoned SS.\r\n    They arose from volunteers of the General SS who were recruited\r\n    for the guarding of concentration camps in 1933.\r\n\r\n    “Their mission, aside from the indoctrination of the armed\r\n    political soldier, is guarding enemies of the State who are held\r\n    in concentration camps.\r\n\r\n    “The SS Death Head Units obligate their members to 12 years\r\n    service. It is composed mainly of men who have already fulfilled\r\n    their duty to serve in the _Wehrmacht_. This time of service is\r\n    counted completely.” (_2284-PS_)\r\n\r\nSince the Death Head Units, like the _SS Verfuegungstruppe_, were\r\ncomposed of well trained professional soldiers, they were also a\r\nvaluable nucleus for the Waffen SS. The secret Hitler order of 17 August\r\n1938 (_647-PS_) provided for this task in the event of mobilization. The\r\n_Totenkopf Verbaende_ were to be relieved from the duty of guarding\r\nconcentration camps and transferred as a skeleton corps to the _SS\r\nVerfuegungstruppe_. Section II C, subparagraph 5, of that order\r\nprovides: “5. _Regulations for the case of the Mobilization_.\r\n\r\n    “The _SS-Totenkopf Verbaende_ form the skeleton corps for the\r\n    reinforcement of the _SS-Totenkopf Verbaende_ (police\r\n    reinforcement), and will be replaced in the guarding of the\r\n    concentration camps by members of the General SS who are over 45\r\n    years of age and had military training.\r\n\r\n    “The skeleton corps—which up to now were units of the two\r\n    replacement units for the short time training of the\r\n    reinforcement of the _SS-Totenkopf Verbaende_—will be\r\n    transferred to the _SS-Verfuegungstruppe_ as skeleton crews of\r\n    the replacement units for that unit.” (_647-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_e_) _The SS Polizei Regimente._\r\n\r\nThe final component specifically referred to in the Indictment is the SS\r\nPolice Regiments. The SS eventually succeeded in assuming controls over\r\nthe entire Reich Police. Out of the police, special militarized forces\r\nwere formed, originally SS Police Battalions, and later expanded to SS\r\nPolice Regiments. Himmler, in his Posen speech, declared:\r\n\r\n    “Now to deal briefly with the tasks of the regular uniformed\r\n    police and the Sipo [the Security Police] they still cover the\r\n    same field. I can see that great things have been achieved. We\r\n    have formed roughly 30 police regiments from police reservists\r\n    and former members of the police—police officials, as they used\r\n    to be called. The average age in our police battalions is not\r\n    lower than that of the security battalions of the Armed Forces.\r\n    Their achievements are beyond all praise. In addition, we have\r\n    formed Police Rifle Regiments by merging the police battalions\r\n    of the ‘savage peoples.’ Thus we did not leave these police\r\n    battalions untouched but blended them in the ratio of about 1 to\r\n    3.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe results of this blend of militarized SS police and “savage peoples”\r\nwill be seen in the evidence, subsequently referred to, of the\r\nextermination actions conducted by them in the Eastern territories.\r\nThese exterminations which were so successful and so ruthless that even\r\nHimmler could find no words adequate for their eulogy.\r\n\r\n(3) _Unity of the Organization._\r\n\r\nEach of the various components described above played its part in\r\ncarrying out one or more functions of the SS. The personnel composing\r\neach differed. Some were part-time volunteers; others were professionals\r\nenlisted for different periods of time. But every branch, every\r\ndepartment, every member was an integral part of the whole organization.\r\nEach performed his assigned role in the manifold tasks for which the\r\norganization had been created. No better witness to this fact could be\r\ncalled upon than the Reichsfuehrer SS, whose every endeavor was to\r\ninsure the complete unity of the organization. The following words are\r\ntaken from his Posen speech:\r\n\r\n    “It would be an evil day if the SS and police fell out. It would\r\n    be an evil day if the Main Offices, performing their tasks well\r\n    meaningly but mistakenly made themselves independent by each\r\n    having a downward chain of command. I really think that the day\r\n    of my overthrow would be the end of the SS. It must be, and so\r\n    come about, that this SS organization with all its branches—the\r\n    General SS which is the common basis of all of them, the\r\n    Waffen-SS, the regular uniformed police (_Ordnungspolizei_), the\r\n    SIPO (with the whole economic administration, schooling,\r\n    ideological training, the whole question of kindred), is, even\r\n    under the tenth Reichsfuehrer-SS _one_ bloc, _one_ body, _one_\r\n    organization.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The regular uniformed police and SIPO, General-SS and Waffen-SS\r\n    must now gradually amalgamate too, just as this is and must be\r\n    the case within the Waffen-SS. This applies to matters\r\n    concerning filling of posts, recruiting, schooling, economic\r\n    organization, and medical services. I am always doing something\r\n    towards this end, a bond is constantly being cast around these\r\n    sections of the whole to cause them to grow together. Alas, if\r\n    these bonds should ever be loosened—then everything—you may be\r\n    sure of this—would sink back into its old insignificance in one\r\n    generation, and in a short space of time.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\n         C. _Selection, Training, and Obligations of Members._\r\n\r\nTo understand this organization, the theories upon which it was based\r\nmust be kept clearly in mind. The underlying philosophy of the SS, the\r\nprinciples by which its members were selected, and the obligations\r\nimposed upon them furnish the key to all its activities. It is\r\nnecessary, therefore, to consider them in some detail.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Racial Basis of the SS._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The SS as a racial and biological elite._\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle of selection was what Himmler called that of\r\nBlood and Elite. The SS was to be the living embodiment of the Nazi\r\ndoctrine of the superiority of Nordic blood, and of the Nazi conception\r\nof a master race. In Himmler’s own words, the SS was to be a “National\r\nSocialist Soldierly Order of Nordic Men” (_1992-A-PS_). In describing to\r\nthe _Wehrmacht_ the reasons behind his emphasis on racial standards of\r\nselection and the manner in which they were carried out, he said:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Accordingly, only good blood, blood which history has\r\n    proved to be leading and creative and the foundation of every\r\n    state and of all military activities, only Nordic blood, can be\r\n    considered. I said to myself that should I succeed in selecting\r\n    from the German people for this organization as many people as\r\n    possible a majority of whom possess this desired blood, in\r\n    teaching them military discipline and, in time, the\r\n    understanding of the value of blood and the entire ideology\r\n    which results from it, then it will be possible actually to\r\n    create such an elite organization which would successfully hold\r\n    its own in all cases of emergency.” (_1992-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nFurther on in the same speech, Himmler described the selection of\r\ncandidates for his organization:\r\n\r\n    “* * * They are extremely thoroughly examined and checked. Of\r\n    100 men we can use on the average of 10 or 15, no more. We ask\r\n    for the political reputation record of his parents, brothers and\r\n    sisters, the record of his ancestry as far back as 1750 and\r\n    naturally the physical examination and his records from the\r\n    Hitler Youth. Further, we ask for a record of hereditary health\r\n    showing that no hereditary disease exists in his parents and in\r\n    his family. Last, but perhaps most important, is a certification\r\n    of the race commission. This examining commission is composed of\r\n    SS leaders, anthropologists and physicians.” (_1992-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis same strict selection process for the SS was somewhat similarly\r\ndescribed in the Organizations Book of the Nazi Party for 1943:\r\n\r\n    “_Selection of Members_\r\n\r\n    “For the fulfillment of these missions a homogeneous firmly\r\n    welded fighting force has been created bound by ideological\r\n    oaths, whose fighters are selected out of the best Aryan\r\n    humanity.\r\n\r\n    “The conception of the value of the blood and soil serves as\r\n    directive for the selection into the SS. Every SS man must be\r\n    deeply imbued with the sense and essence of the National\r\n    Socialist Movement. He will be ideologically and physically\r\n    trained so that he can be employed individually or in groups in\r\n    the decisive battle for the National Socialist ideology.\r\n\r\n    “Only the best and thoroughbred Germans are suited for\r\n    commitment, in this battle. Therefore it is necessary that an\r\n    uninterrupted selection is retained within the ranks of the SS,\r\n    first superficially, then constantly more thoroughly.”\r\n    (_2640-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe creation of a racial and biological elite had some very practical\r\nreasons behind it. The conspirators’ plans for conquest and exploitation\r\nof the conquered territories required the development of a Nazi\r\naristocracy which would dominate Germany and Europe for centuries to\r\ncome. That purpose was explicitly stated by Himmler in his Posen speech:\r\n\r\n    “One thing must be clear, one thing I would like to say to you\r\n    today: the moment the war is over, we will really begin to weld\r\n    together our organization, this organization which we have built\r\n    up for 10 years, which we imbued and indoctrinated with the\r\n    first most important principles during the 10 years before the\r\n    war. We must continue to do this—we,—if I may say so, we older\r\n    men—for twenty years full of toil and work, so that a tradition\r\n    30, 35, 40 years, a generation, may be created. Then this\r\n    organization will march forward into the future young and\r\n    strong, revolutionary and efficient to fulfill the task of\r\n    giving the German people, the Germanic people, the superstratum\r\n    of society which will combine and hold together this Germanic\r\n    people and this Europe, and from which the brains which the\r\n    people need for industry, farming, politics, and as soldiers,\r\n    statesmen and technicians, will emerge. In addition this\r\n    superstratum must be so strong and vital that every generation\r\n    can unreservedly sacrifice two or three sons from every family\r\n    on the battle-field, and that never-the-less the continued\r\n    flowing of the bloodstream is assured.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\nHe forcibly made the same point in his address to officers of the _SS\r\nLeibstandarte_ “Adolph Hitler” on the “Day of Metz”:\r\n\r\n    “The ultimate aim for these 11 years during which I have been\r\n    the Reichsfuehrer SS has been invariably the same: To create an\r\n    order of good blood which is able to serve Germany. Which\r\n    unfailingly and without sparing itself can be made use of\r\n    because the greatest losses can do no harm to the vitality of\r\n    this order, the vitality of these men, because they will always\r\n    be replaced. To create an order which will spread the idea of\r\n    nordic blood so far that we will attract all nordic blood in the\r\n    world, take away the blood from our adversaries, absorb it so\r\n    that never again, looking at it from the viewpoint of grand\r\n    policy, nordic blood in great quantities and to an extent worth\r\n    mentioning will fight against us. We must get it and the others\r\n    cannot have it. We never gave up the ideas and the aim conceived\r\n    so many years ago. Everything we did has taken us some distance\r\n    further on the way. Everything we are going to do will lead us\r\n    further on the way.” (_1918-PS_)\r\n\r\nSince the SS was to be made a Nazi aristocracy which would dominate not\r\nonly Germany but the world for centuries to come, it was essential that\r\nthe SS stock be perpetuated. To insure the continuance of this good\r\nblood, the first step was to limit marriages of SS men to women meeting\r\nthe same requirements as to health, descent, and ideological background\r\nas the SS man himself. This was accomplished by an order of the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS issued on 31 December 1931. This SS marriage law is set\r\nout in full in d’Alquen’s Book, “The SS,” (_2284-PS_). But proper\r\nmarriages were not enough without children. A series of orders took care\r\nof that. On 13 September 1936, Himmler issued an order entitled\r\n“Foundation of the Organization ‘_Lebensborn e.V._’”, published in the\r\nSS manual, “The Soldier Friend”:\r\n\r\n    “As early as December 13, 1934, I wrote to all SS leaders and\r\n    declared that we have fought in vain if political victory was\r\n    not to be followed by victory of birth of good blood. The\r\n    question of multiplicity of children is not a private affair of\r\n    the individual but his duty towards his ancestors and our\r\n    people.\r\n\r\n    “The SS has taken the first step in this direction long ago with\r\n    the engagement and marriage decree of December 1931. However,\r\n    the existence of sound marriage is futile if it does not result\r\n    in the creation of numerous descendants.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The minimum amount of children for a good sound marriage is\r\n    four. Should unfortunate circumstances deny a married couple\r\n    their own children, then every SS leader should adopt racially\r\n    and hereditarily valuable children, educate them in the spirit\r\n    of National Socialism, let them have an education corresponding\r\n    to their ability.” (_2825-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe drive for perpetuation of SS stock was continued. A further order of\r\nHimmler, issued on 28 October 1939, directed to the entire SS and the\r\nPolice, is also published in the SS manual, “The Soldier Friend”:\r\n\r\n    “The old saying that only those who have children can die in\r\n    peace must again become acknowledged truth in this war,\r\n    especially for the SS.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Though in other times it may perhaps be considered an\r\n    infraction of necessary social standards and conventions, German\r\n    women and girls of good blood can fulfill a high obligation by\r\n    bearing children out of wedlock to soldiers going to the front,\r\n    whose eventual return or death for Germany lies entirely in the\r\n    hands of fate—not out of promiscuity but out of a deep sense of\r\n    ethics.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Let us never forget that the victory of the sword and of the\r\n    spilled blood of our soldiers remains fruitless, if it is not\r\n    succeeded by the victory of the child and the colonizing of\r\n    conquered soil.” (_2825-PS_)\r\n\r\nA final order designed to assure continuance of good SS blood was issued\r\non 15 August 1942, entitled “SS Orders to the Last Sons”, also published\r\nin “The Soldier Friend”:\r\n\r\n    “You SS men have been withdrawn from the front lines by order of\r\n    the Fuehrer because you are the last sons. This measure has been\r\n    taken because the people and the State have an interest in\r\n    seeing that your families do not die out.\r\n\r\n    “It has never been the nature of SS men to submit to a fate\r\n    without attempting to effect a change. It is your duty to see to\r\n    it that you are no longer the last sons by producing as many\r\n    children of good blood as possible.” (_2825-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese orders were not the product of some benevolent theorist in\r\neugenics who was interested in large and happy SS families for their own\r\nsake. They stemmed from a basic idea of the conspiracy, the plan to\r\ninsure Germany’s continued capacity to wage war for generations. Himmler\r\nput this theory very bluntly in his speech to officers of the _SS\r\nLeibstandarte_ “Adolf Hitler” on the “Day of Metz”:\r\n\r\n    “* * * If we once had not enough sons, those who will come after\r\n    us will have to become cowards. A nation which has an average of\r\n    four sons per family can venture a war; if two of them die, two\r\n    transmit the name. The leadership of a nation having one son or\r\n    two sons per family will have to be faint-hearted at any\r\n    decision on account of their own experience, because they will\r\n    have to tell themselves: We cannot afford it. Look at France,\r\n    which is the best example. France had to accept from us a\r\n    dictate.” (_1918-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The SS as an exterminator of “inferior” races._\r\n\r\nDomination of Europe through a Nazi Elite required more, however, than\r\nthe positive side of racism—that is, the building up of a numerous\r\n“biologically superior” group. It necessarily meant also the destruction\r\nof other races. The SS had to be, and was, taught not merely to breed,\r\nbut to exterminate. In a speech delivered at Kharkov in April 1943,\r\nHimmler declared:\r\n\r\n    “We have—I would say, as very consistent National\r\n    Socialists—taken the question of blood as our starting point.\r\n    We were the first really to solve the problem of blood by\r\n    action, and in this connection by problem of blood, we of course\r\n    do not mean anti-semitism. Antisemitism is exactly the same as\r\n    delousing. Getting rid of lice is not a question of ideology. It\r\n    is a matter of cleanliness. In just the same way, anti-semitism\r\n    for us, will soon have been dealt with. We shall soon be\r\n    deloused. We have only 20,000 lice left, and then the matter is\r\n    finished within the whole of Germany.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\nBut it was not merely against Jews that SS efforts were directed. All\r\nnon-Nordic races were similarly condemned. In his Posen speech, Himmler\r\nstated this basic principle of the SS:\r\n\r\n    “One basic principle must be the absolute rule for the SS men:\r\n    We must be honest, decent, loyal and comradely to members of our\r\n    own blood and to nobody else. What happens to a Russian, to a\r\n    Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What other nations\r\n    can offer in the way of good blood of our type, we will take, if\r\n    necessary, by kidnapping their children and raising them here\r\n    with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death\r\n    interests me only so far as we need them as slaves for our\r\n    culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000\r\n    Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an\r\n    antitank ditch interests me only insofar as the antitank ditch\r\n    for Germany is finished.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “That is what I want to instill into this SS and what I believe\r\n    I have instilled in them as one of the most sacred laws of the\r\n    future.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Indoctrination of members in SS racial theories._ These were the\r\nprinciples which were publicly reiterated, over and over again, so that\r\nthe newest recruit was thoroughly steeped in them. In his Kharkov speech\r\nto the commanding officers of three Waffen SS divisions, Himmler\r\nstrongly insisted on indoctrinating all SS members in his theories of\r\nthe racial struggle.\r\n\r\n    “This is what is important for us as SS men, for our province of\r\n    duty and our mission (it is a task additional to those of the\r\n    whole German armed forces and the whole German people): That is\r\n    what I would like to impress upon you. This is what I beg you as\r\n    commanding officers, as chiefs and as leaders, to teach the\r\n    young men again and again in their ideological instruction. That\r\n    is what I demand and exact of you—that you really concern\r\n    yourself with the man, the young fellow of 17 or 18 who comes to\r\n    us, and with many who are in our ranks not as volunteers but as\r\n    conscripts. I ask you to look after them, and guide them, and\r\n    not let them go before they are really saturated with our spirit\r\n    and are fighting as the old guard fought before us—that is what\r\n    I request and demand of you.\r\n\r\n    “We have only one task—to stand firm and carry on the racial\r\n    struggle without mercy.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis function of the SS men in the racial struggle was publicly\r\nproclaimed in the Organizations Book of the NSDAP for 1943:\r\n\r\n    “He openly and relentlessly fights against the most dangerous\r\n    enemies of the State: Jews, Freemasons, Jesuits and political\r\n    clergymen.” (_2640-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _The Obligation of Obedience._ Indoctrination of the organization in\r\nprinciples of racial hatred was not enough. The members had to be ready\r\nand willing tools, prepared to carry out tasks of any nature, however\r\ndistasteful, illegal or inhuman. Absolute obedience was the necessary\r\nsecond foundation stone of the SS. The Organizations Book of the NSDAP\r\nfor 1943 thus describes this fundamental requirement:\r\n\r\n    “Obedience must be unconditional. It corresponds to the\r\n    conviction that the National Socialist ideology must reign\r\n    supreme. He who is possessed by it and fights for it\r\n    passionately subjects himself voluntarily to the obligation to\r\n    obey. Every SS man is prepared, therefore, to carry out blindly\r\n    every order which is issued by the Fuehrer or which is given by\r\n    his superior, irrespective of the heaviest sacrifices involved.”\r\n    (_2640-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe same point was emphasized by Himmler in the Posen speech:\r\n\r\n    “I would like here to state something clearly and unequivocally.\r\n    It is a matter of course that the little man must obey. It is\r\n    even more a matter of course that all the senior leaders of the\r\n    SS, that is the whole corps of Gruppenfuehrers, are a model of\r\n    blind obedience.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _The SS as a Terroristic Agency._ A necessary corollary of these two\r\nfundamental principles of race and of blind obedience was ruthlessness.\r\nSubsequent evidence of SS activities will prove how successfully the SS\r\nlearned the lesson it was taught. The SS had to and did develop a\r\nreputation for terror which was carefully cultivated. Himmler himself\r\nattested to it as early as 1936 in a speech publicly delivered at the\r\nPeasant’s Day Rally and subsequently published and circulated in\r\npamphlet form under the title “The SS as an Anti-bolshevist Fighting\r\nOrganization”:\r\n\r\n    “I know that there are some people in Germany who become sick\r\n    when they see their black coats. We understand the reason for\r\n    this and do not expect that we shall be loved by too many.”\r\n    (_1851-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Continuance of the Elite and Voluntary Character of the SS._ The\r\nrole which the SS was to play required that it remain constantly the\r\nessence of Naziism, and that its elite Nazi quality never be diluted.\r\nFor this reason the SS was for a time temporarily closed to new members,\r\nand those who had proved unfit were weeded out. Himmler described this\r\nprocess in his article “Organization and Obligations of the SS and the\r\nPolice” (_1992-A-PS_). Referring to the influx of new adherents to the\r\nParty and its organizations in 1933, he said:\r\n\r\n    “A very difficult question confronted us at that time. It was a\r\n    question of deciding whether to close the Party and its\r\n    organizations to further membership and thus remain pure in\r\n    quality but small in volume, or of opening them to further\r\n    membership to increase their volume.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The SS too was endangered by this menace. Therefore I closed it\r\n    while some of the other organizations accepted as great a number\r\n    of people as possible. This way I had the SS again under my\r\n    control in April and said: We shall accept no more people. From\r\n    the end of 1933 to the end of 1935 we expelled all those of the\r\n    newly accepted members who proved unsuitable.” (_1992-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese standards were not abandoned later. Indeed, in 1943 the\r\nOrganizations Book of the Nazi Party stated that:\r\n\r\n    “The demands with respect to racial purity of the SS are being\r\n    increased every year.”\r\n\r\nAnd in the same year, 1943, Himmler emphasized this point in a letter\r\nwritten to Kaltenbrunner (_2768-PS_).\r\n\r\nThis letter from the Reichsfuehrer SS, which bears the date 24 April\r\n1943, states in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Referring again to the matter which I discussed some time ago,\r\n    i.e., the admission of SIPO officials into the SS. I wish to\r\n    clarify again: I want an admission only if the following\r\n    conditions are fulfilled:\r\n\r\n        “1. If the man applies freely and voluntarily;\r\n\r\n        “2. If, by applying strict and peacetime standards, the\r\n        applicant fits racially and ideologically into the SS,\r\n        guarantees according to the number of his children a\r\n        really healthy SS stock, and is neither ill, degenerate\r\n        nor worthless.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I beg you not only to act accordingly in the future, but\r\n    especially also that numerous admissions into ranks of the SS in\r\n    the past be reexamined and revised according to these\r\n    instructions.” (_2768-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _Method of Acquiring Membership in the SS._ The normal method by\r\nwhich membership in the SS was attained was discussed by Himmler in his\r\narticle, “Organization and Obligations of the SS and Police”:\r\n\r\n    “The age groups in the SS are as follows: With 18 years the\r\n    young man enters the SS. He is first an applicant, after three\r\n    months he takes the oath on the Fuehrer and thus becomes a\r\n    candidate (_Anwaerter_). As a candidate during the first year he\r\n    takes examinations for his SA sport insignia and his bronze\r\n    sport insignia. At the age of 19 or 19½, according to the time\r\n    of his acceptance, he is conscripted for the labor service and\r\n    subsequently for the _Wehrmacht_. After two more years he comes\r\n    back from the _Wehrmacht_ unless he remains there as a\r\n    prospective noncommissioned officer or reenlists. If he returns\r\n    to us, he is still candidate. In these weeks he is especially\r\n    thoroughly instructed in ideology. The first year is for him a\r\n    period of elementary ideological indoctrination. In these weeks\r\n    following his return from the _Wehrmacht_ he receives special\r\n    instruction about the marriage law and all other laws pertaining\r\n    to the family, and the honor laws. On the 9th of November,\r\n    following his return from the _Wehrmacht_, he becomes an SS man\r\n    in the true sense. The Reichsfuehrer of the SS is just as much\r\n    an SS man in the sense of the SS organization as the common man\r\n    at the front. On this 9th of November he is awarded the dagger,\r\n    and at this occasion he promises to abide by the marriage law\r\n    and the disciplinary laws of the SS, since the family is also\r\n    subject to these laws. From this day on he has the right and the\r\n    duty to defend his honor with a weapon as laid down by the honor\r\n    laws of the SS. The applicants and candidates do not yet have\r\n    this right. The SS man remains in the so-called active General\r\n    SS until his 35th year. From his 35th to his 45th year he is in\r\n    the SS reserve, and after his 45th year in the _Stammabteilung_\r\n    of the SS, identified by the grey color patch.” (_1992-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe oath to the Fuehrer, referred to by Himmler in the passage just\r\nquoted, appears in the SS recruiting pamphlet, “The SS Calls You”:\r\n\r\n    “The Oath of the SS Man:\r\n\r\n    “I swear to you, Adolf Hitler, as Fuehrer and Reichschancellor,\r\n    loyalty and bravery. I vow to you, and to those you have named\r\n    to command me, obedience unto death, so help me God.”\r\n    (_3429-PS_)\r\n\r\n              D. _Criminal Aims and Activities of the SS._\r\n\r\n(1) _The Purge of 20[_sic_] June 1934._ Proof of the elite Nazi quality\r\nand thorough reliability of the SS, the test by which it won its spurs,\r\noccurred on 30 June 1934, when it participated in the purge of the SA\r\nand other opponents or potential opponents of the Nazi regime. That was\r\nthe first real occasion for use of this specialized organization which\r\ncould operate with the blessing of the Nazi State but outside the law.\r\nIn an affidavit signed and sworn to in Nurnberg on 19 November 1945,\r\nWilhelm Frick says, referring to the victims of that purge:\r\n\r\n    “They were just killed on the spot. Many people were killed—I\r\n    don’t know how many—who actually did not have anything to do\r\n    with the putsch. People who just weren’t liked very well, as for\r\n    instance, Schleicher, the former Reich Chancellor, were killed *\r\n    * * The SS was used by Himmler for the execution of these orders\r\n    to suppress the putsch.” (_2950-PS_)\r\n\r\nHimmler referred to this same event in his Posen speech:\r\n\r\n    “Just as we did not hesitate on June 20,[_sic_] 1934, to do the\r\n    duty we were bidden, and stand comrades who had lapsed, up\r\n    against the wall and shoot them, so we have never spoken about\r\n    it and will never speak about it.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was in recognition of its services in this respect that the SS was\r\nelevated to the status of a component of the Party equal in rank to the\r\nSA and other similar branches. The following announcement appeared on\r\npage 1 of the _Voelkischer Beobachter_ of 26 July 1934:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich press office announces the following order of the\r\n    Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n    “In consideration of the greatly meritorious service of the SS,\r\n    especially in connection with the events of 30 June 1934, I\r\n    elevate it to the standing of an independent organization within\r\n    the NSDAP.\r\n\r\n    “Munch 20 July 1934.” (_1857-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Functions as a Repressive Police Organization._\r\n\r\nOne of the first steps essential to the security of any regime is\r\ncontrol of the police. The SS was the type of organization which the\r\nconspirators needed for this purpose. Their aim was to fuse the SS and\r\npolice, and to merge them into a single, unified repressive force.\r\n\r\nShortly after the seizure of power the conspirators began to develop as\r\npart of the state machinery, secret political police forces. These\r\noriginated in Prussia with the Gestapo, established by decree of Goering\r\nin April 1933, and were duplicated in the other German States. (This\r\ndevelopment is discussed in Section 6 on the Gestapo.) By 1934 Himmler,\r\nthe Reichsfuehrer SS, had become the chief of these secret political\r\npolice forces in each of the German states except Prussia, and deputy\r\nchief of the Prussian Gestapo. In that capacity he infiltrated these\r\nforces with members of the SS until a virtual identity of membership was\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nOn 17 June 1936, by Decree on the Establishment of a Chief of the German\r\nPolice (_2073-PS_), the new post of Chief of the German Police was\r\ncreated in the Ministry of the Interior. Under the terms of the decree,\r\nHimmler was appointed to this post with the title of “Reichsfuehrer SS\r\nand Chief of the German Police in the Ministry of the Interior.” The\r\ncombination of these two positions, that of leadership of the SS and\r\nhead of all the police forces in the Reich, was no accident but was\r\nintended to establish a permanent relation between the two bodies and\r\nnot a mere “transitory fusion of personnel.” The significance of the\r\ncombination of these two positions was referred to by Hitler in the\r\npreamble to his secret order of 17 August 1938:\r\n\r\n    “By means of the nomination of the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of\r\n    the German Police in the Ministry of the Interior on June 17th,\r\n    1936 (_Reichsgesetzblatt_ I, page 487), I have created the basis\r\n    for the unification and reorganization of the German Police.\r\n\r\n    “With this step, the _Schutzstaffeln_ of the NSDAP, which were\r\n    under the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police even\r\n    up to now, have entered into close connection with the duties of\r\n    the German Police.” (_647-PS_)\r\n\r\nUpon his appointment, Himmler immediately proceeded to reorganize the\r\nentire Reich Police Force, designating two separate branches: (1) the\r\nregular uniformed police force (_Ordnungspolizei_, or Orpo), and (2) the\r\nSecurity Police (_Sicherheitspolizei_, or Sipo). The Sipo was composed\r\nof all criminal police organizations in the Reich and all the secret\r\npolitical police forces, or Gestapo. This reorganization was achieved by\r\nthe Decree Assigning Functions in the Office of the Chief of the German\r\nPolice (_1551-PS_). To be head of the Sipo, that is the criminal police\r\nand Gestapo, Himmler appointed Reinhard Heydrich, who was at that time\r\nthe Chief of the SD. Thus, through Himmler’s dual capacity as leader of\r\nthe SS and as Chief of the Police, and through Heydrich’s dual capacity\r\nas head of the Sipo and as chief of the SD, a unified personal command\r\nof the SS and Security Police Forces was achieved. But further steps\r\ntoward unification were later taken. In 1939, the Security Police and\r\nthe SD were combined in a single department, the Reich Security Main\r\nOffice, commonly referred to as the RSHA. (The details of the\r\norganization of the RSHA are discussed in Section 6 on the Gestapo.) The\r\nimportant point to be observed is this: The newly created Reich Security\r\nMain Office was not a mere department of the Government. It was a dual\r\nbody: an agency of the government, organizationally placed in the\r\nDepartment of the Interior, and at the same time one of the principal\r\ndepartments of the SS, organizationally placed in the Supreme Command of\r\nthe SS. (cf. the chart of the SS organization (_Chart Number 3_)). The\r\nfollowing description of the RSHA appears in the Organizations Book of\r\nthe NSDAP for 1943:\r\n\r\n    “The RSHA handles all the organizational, personnel, management\r\n    and technical affairs of the Security Police and the SD. In\r\n    addition, it is the central office of the State Police and\r\n    criminal police executive, as well as the central directorate of\r\n    the intelligence net of the SD.” (_2640-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe position of the RSHA in the Supreme Command of the SS is also\r\nsimilarly described in the SS manual, “The Soldier Friend”. (_2825-PS_)\r\n\r\nBut it was not merely the Gestapo and the Criminal Police which came\r\nunder the sway of the SS. The regular uniformed police as well were\r\naffected. For, like the RSHA, the Department of the Regular Police\r\n(_Ordnungspolizei_, or Orpo), was not merely a department in the\r\nMinistry of the Interior, but also simultaneously in the Supreme Command\r\nof the SS. Its position in the SS is indicated by the seventh box on the\r\nchart of the SS organization (_Chart Number 3_). The following\r\ndescription of the Department of the Regular Police appears in the\r\nOrganizations Book of the NSDAP for 1943:\r\n\r\n    “The sphere of duties of the Main Office of the\r\n    _Ordnungspolizei_ includes police administration as well as the\r\n    management and direction of the protective police\r\n    (_Schutzpolizei_) of the Reich, the Gendarmes, the protective\r\n    police of the community, the water protection police, the air\r\n    protection police, the fire protection police, the protective\r\n    groups in the occupied territories, the colonial police, the\r\n    volunteer fire department, the compulsatory and youth fire\r\n    departments, the technical aid and the technical SS and police\r\n    academy.” (_2640-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe position of this Department in the SS Supreme Command is also\r\nsimilarly described in the SS Manual, “The Soldier Friend”. (_2825-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis unity of the Command was not a mere matter of the highest\r\nheadquarters. It extended down to the operating level. As the chart\r\nshows, the Higher SS and Police Leader in each region, who was directly\r\nsubordinate to Himmler, had under his command both the Security Police\r\nand the regular, uniformed police (_Chart Number 3_). These forces were\r\nsubject to his orders as well as to those of the RSHA and the Department\r\nof the Regular Police respectively. This position of the Higher SS and\r\nPolice Leader is described in the Organizations Book of the NSDAP for\r\n1943. (_2640-PS_)\r\n\r\nSS control of the police was, however, not only a matter of organization\r\nand of unified command. Unity of personnel was also in large measure\r\nachieved. Vacancies occurring in the police forces were filled by SS\r\nmembers; police officials retained in the force were urged to join the\r\nSS; and schools operated by the SS were the required training centers\r\nfor police as well as SS officials. These measures are described in\r\nHimmler’s article, “Organization and Obligations of the SS and the\r\nPolice” (_1992-A-PS_). They are also described in an authoritative book\r\non the police and on the SS, entitled “The German Police,” written by\r\nDr. Werner Best, a Ministerial Director in the Ministry of the Interior\r\nand a department head in the Security Police and published in 1940. It\r\nbears on its flyleaf the imprimatur of the Nazi Party and is listed in\r\nthe official list of National Socialist Party bibliography. Chapter 7\r\nfrom that book is reproduced in document (_1852-PS_). Reference is also\r\nmade to the order of the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police\r\nof 23 June 1938, entitled “Acceptance of Members of the Security Police\r\ninto the SS” (_1637-PS_). In that order provision was made for admitting\r\nmembers of the Security Police into the SS upon certain conditions. The\r\npreamble of the order states that it was issued “with the aim of fusing\r\nmembers of the German Police with the ‘_Schutzstaffel_’ of the National\r\nSocialist German Workers Party into one uniformly turned out State\r\nProtective Corps of the National Socialist Reich” (_1637-PS_).\r\nParenthetically, it should be observed that even this aim was not\r\nsufficient to cause a relaxation of SS admission standards since the\r\norder provided that, to be admitted as an SS member, personnel of the\r\nSecurity Police were obliged to fulfill the general requirements of the\r\nSS (its racial and ideological standards).\r\n\r\nThrough this unity of organization and personnel, the SS and the police\r\nbecame identified in structure and in activity. The resulting situation\r\nwas described by Best as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Thus the SS and the Police form a unit, both in their structure\r\n    and in their activity, although their individual organizations\r\n    have not lost their true individuality and their position in the\r\n    larger units of the Party and State administration * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In the relationship between the Police and the SS, the\r\n    principle of the ‘orderly’ penetration of an organization of the\r\n    National order has been realized for the first time to the final\r\n    outcome through the supporters of the National Socialist\r\n    movement”. (_1852-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs Himmler stated in his address to the officers of _SS-Leibstandarte_\r\n“Adolph Hitler” on the “Day of Metz”:\r\n\r\n    “I want to tell you: In the entire Waffen-SS we must begin to\r\n    view the other great activity of the entire SS (_Gesamt-SS_) and\r\n    entire Police. We must see to it that you consider the activity\r\n    of the man in the green uniform as just as valuable as the\r\n    activity you yourself are engaged in. You have to consider the\r\n    work of the SD man or the man of the Security Police as a vital\r\n    part of our whole work just like the fact that you can carry\r\n    arms”. (_1918-PS_)\r\n\r\nThrough the police the SS was in a position to carry out a large part of\r\nthe functions assigned to it. The working partnership between Gestapo,\r\nthe criminal police, and the SD, under the direction of the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS, resulted in the ultimate in repressive and\r\nunrestrained police activity. (cf. the discussion in Section 6 on the\r\nGestapo.) It must be remembered that the Gestapo activities were but one\r\naspect of SS functions—one part of the whole criminal SS scheme.\r\n\r\n(3) _Functions and Activities with Respect to Concentration Camps._\r\nControl over the police, however, was not enough. Potential sources of\r\nopposition could be tracked down by the SD. Suspects could be seized by\r\nthe criminal police and Gestapo. But those means alone would not assure\r\nthe complete suppression of all opponents and potential opponents of the\r\nregime. For this purpose concentration camps were invented, and the SS\r\nwas given large responsibility in that system.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Criminal activities of SS guards and camp personnel._ The first\r\nrequirement of the camps was for guard and administrative personnel.\r\nPart-time volunteer members of the _Allgemeine SS_ were originally\r\nutilized as guards. But part-time volunteers could not adequately serve\r\nthe need of the extensive and long-range program that was planned.\r\nHence, beginning in 1933 full-time professional guard units (the _SS\r\nTotenkopf Verbaende_) were organized. Their very name (“Death Head\r\nUnits”) and their distinguishing insignia, the skull and cross bones,\r\nappropriately marked the type of activity in which they engaged.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, members of the _Allgemeine SS_ resumed the function of\r\nguarding the camps which they had undertaken when the camps were\r\ncreated. This was provided for in the Hitler order of 17 August 1938\r\n(_647-PS_) directing the substitution of _Allgemeine SS_ members for the\r\nDeath Head Units in the event of mobilization. That substitution took\r\nplace. In reviewing the events of the period between 1938 and 1940,\r\nsignificant for the SS, the National Socialist Yearbook of 1940\r\ncongratulated the _Allgemeine SS_ on the performance of its new mission:\r\n\r\n    “However, not only the garrisoned parts of the SS were employed.\r\n    Also the General SS were brought forth for special missions.\r\n    Thousands of younger and older SS comrades were employed for the\r\n    strengthening of the police and for the guarding of\r\n    concentration camps and have faithfully fulfilled their duty\r\n    throughout the weeks.” (_2164-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to repeat the evidence of wholesale brutalities,\r\ntortures, and murders committed by SS guards. These were not sporadic\r\ncrimes committed by irresponsible individuals. They were a part of a\r\ndefinite and calculated policy, which necessarily resulted from SS\r\nphilosophy, and which was carried out from the initial creation of the\r\ncamps.\r\n\r\nHimmler bluntly explained to the _Wehrmacht_ in 1937 the prevailing view\r\nof the SS as to the inmates of concentration camps:\r\n\r\n    “It would be extremely instructive for everyone, some members of\r\n    the _Wehrmacht_ were already able to do so, to inspect such a\r\n    concentration camp. Once they have seen it, they are convinced\r\n    of the fact that no one had been sent there unjustly; that it is\r\n    the offal of criminals and freaks. No better demonstration of\r\n    the laws of inheritance and race, as set forth by Doctor Guett,\r\n    exists than such a concentration camp. There you can find people\r\n    with hydrocephalus, people who are cross-eyed, deformed,\r\n    half-Jewish, and a number of racially inferior products. All\r\n    that is assembled there. Of course, we distinguish between those\r\n    inmates who are only there for a few months for the purpose of\r\n    education, and those who are to stay for a very long time. On\r\n    the whole, education consists of discipline, never of any kind\r\n    of instruction on an ideological basis, for the prisoners have,\r\n    for the most part, slave-like souls; and only very few people of\r\n    real character can be found there.” (_1992-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nEven these “slave-like souls,” however, might be redeemed by SS hygienic\r\nmeasures. For, as Himmler continued:\r\n\r\n    “The discipline thus means order. The order begins with these\r\n    people living in clean barracks. Such a thing can really only be\r\n    accomplished by us Germans, hardly another nation would be as\r\n    humane as we are. The laundry is frequently changed. The people\r\n    are taught to wash themselves twice daily, and the use of a\r\n    toothbrush with which most of them have been unfamiliar.”\r\n    (_1992-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nDespite this callous jest to the _Wehrmacht_, all pretense was swept\r\naway in Himmler’s speech to his own Gruppenfuehrers at Posen:\r\n\r\n    “I don’t believe the Communists could attempt any action, for\r\n    their leading elements, like most criminals, are in our\r\n    concentration camps. And here I must say this—that we shall be\r\n    able to see after the war what a blessing it was for Germany\r\n    that, in spite of all the silly talk about humanitarianism, we\r\n    imprisoned all this criminal substratum of the German people in\r\n    concentration camps: I’ll answer for that.” (_1919-PS_).\r\n\r\nCertainly there was no “silly humanitarianism” in the manner in which SS\r\nmen performed their task. An illustration of their conduct, not in 1944\r\nor 1945 but in 1933, is shown in four reports relating to the deaths of\r\nfour different inmates of the Concentration Camp Dachau between May 16\r\nand 27, 1933. Each report is signed by Winterberger, the Public\r\nProsecutor of the District Court in Munich, and addressed to the Public\r\nProsecutor of the Supreme Court of Munich. The first (_641-PS_) 1 June\r\n1933, relates to the death of Dr. Alfred Strauss, a prisoner in\r\nprotective custody in Dachau. That report states:\r\n\r\n    “On May 24, 1933 the 30 year old, single, attorney at law, Dr.\r\n    Alfred Strauss from Munich who was in the concentration camp\r\n    Dachau as a prisoner under protective custody was killed by 2\r\n    pistol shots from SS man Johann Kantschuster who escorted him on\r\n    a walk outside of the fenced part of the camp prescribed to him\r\n    by the camp doctor.\r\n\r\n    “Kantschuster gives the following report: He himself had to\r\n    urinate; Strauss proceeded on his way. Suddenly Strauss broke\r\n    away towards the shrub located at a distance of about 6 m from\r\n    the line. When he noticed it, he fired 2 shots at the fugitive\r\n    from a distance of about 8 m, whereupon Strauss collapsed dead.\r\n\r\n    “On the same day, May 24, 1933, a judicial inspection of the\r\n    locality took place. The corpse of Strauss was lying at the edge\r\n    of the wood. Leather slippers were on his feet. He wore a sock\r\n    on one foot, while the other foot was bare, obviously because of\r\n    an injury to this foot. Subsequently an autopsy was performed.\r\n    Two bullets had entered the back of his head. Besides, the body\r\n    showed several black and blue spots (_Blutunterlaufung_) and\r\n    also open wounds.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I have charged Kantschuster today with murder and have made\r\n    application for opening and execution of the judicial\r\n    preliminary investigation as well as for a warrant of arrest\r\n    against him.” (_641-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe second (_642-PS_) also 1 June 1933, relates to the death of Leonhard\r\nHausmann, another prisoner in Dachau. That letter states:\r\n\r\n    “On 17 May 1933, Leonhard Hausmann from Augsburg, 31 years old,\r\n    married, relief worker, who was kept in protective custody in\r\n    the Dachau concentration camp, was shot by SS Staff Sergeant\r\n    Karl Ehmann. According to the account of the latter, Hausmann\r\n    was to dig out young fir trees in the woods in the vicinity of\r\n    the camp and pile them up on a certain spot. He was supervised\r\n    by Ehmann. Suddenly the latter did not see him anymore.\r\n    Therefore Ehmann looked after the prisoners and saw him running\r\n    away in a stooped position, Ehmann ran after him, called ‘Halt’\r\n    several times, once also ‘Stop,’ but in vain. Whereupon Ehmann\r\n    raised his pistol at the prisoner and fired without aiming;\r\n    Hausmann dropped dead. Ehmann asserts that he fired from a\r\n    distance of 10 to 12 meters.\r\n\r\n    “The corpse was inspected already on 17 May 1933 with the\r\n    assistance of the State court physician. It was found that death\r\n    was due to a shot through the left side of the chest. According\r\n    to the autopsy protocol, the shot was fired from a distance less\r\n    than 1 meter. Meanwhile the legal-medical institute ascertained\r\n    that the distance was less than 30 cm.” (_642-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe third (_644-PS_) 22 May 1933, relates to the death of Louis Schloss,\r\nan inmate of Dachau. Attached to the letter is a copy of a report of the\r\nautopsy conducted in the Schloss case, signed by the examining\r\nphysicians. The letter of 22 May 1933, begins:\r\n\r\n    “In the afternoon of 16 May 1933 the police station Dachau\r\n    informed the State Prosecution that an inmate of the\r\n    concentration camp Dachau, the merchant Louis Schloss, from\r\n    Nurnberg, widowed, born on 21 June 1889, has hanged himself in\r\n    solitary confinement. At the request of the state prosecution,\r\n    on the same day the legal inspection was performed with the\r\n    assistance of the state court physician with the State Court\r\n    Munich II. As it was proven that the corpse exhibited numerous\r\n    whip marks and as the cause of death appeared doubtful, an\r\n    autopsy was carried out on 17 May 1933. According to a\r\n    preliminary certificate of the participating physicians, the\r\n    autopsy did not prove death by hanging”. (_644-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe preliminary opinion of the examining physician states:\r\n\r\n    “Preliminary opinion:\r\n\r\n    “I. The death through hanging could not be proven by autopsy.\r\n\r\n    “II. Extensive blood suffusions and whipmarks were found,\r\n    particularly on the back, on the buttocks and on both arms, as\r\n    well as on both legs, abdomen and thorax to a minor extent. In\r\n    the region of the buttocks and shoulders extensive destruction\r\n    of adipose tissue was found together with the blood suffusions.\r\n    This is adequate to explain death through autointoxication and\r\n    fat embolism.” (_644-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe fourth (_645-PS_) 1 June 1933, relates to the death of Sebastian\r\nNefzger, another Dachau prisoner. The letter reads:\r\n\r\n    “On May 27, 1933, the following report was received by the Lower\r\n    Court Dachau:\r\n\r\n    “Concentration Camp Dachau, Political Division, May 27, 1933, to\r\n    the Lower Court Dachau. An inquest on the dead body of the\r\n    prisoner Nefzger Sebastian merchant in Munich, Schommerstrasse\r\n    17/0, born: 1/10/1900 in Munich, religion: Catholic, marital\r\n    status: married—showed that death through the action of third\r\n    persons must be excluded. Death was indubitably caused by\r\n    excessive bleeding resulting from an opened artery of the left\r\n    hand. Signed Dr. Nuernbergk, Camp Physician.\r\n\r\n    “Neither the Lower Court Dachau nor the State Attorney Munich II\r\n    had up to that time been informed of Nefzger’s death reported in\r\n    the letter in spite of the fact that Nefzger had already died in\r\n    the night of the 25 to the 26th of May 1933. The Lower Court\r\n    Dachau informed the State Attorney, Munich II of this letter. A\r\n    coroner’s inquest was ordered, which took place as late as May\r\n    27, 1933. Since the physician appointed by the Superior Court,\r\n    doubted that death had occurred to excessive bleeding and in\r\n    identified marks of strings on the victim’s neck, a judicial\r\n    autopsy was arranged by the State Attorney on May 29, 1933. The\r\n    resulting opinion of the expert is so far: I) The autopsy\r\n    discloses that excessive bleeding due to a cut on the left arm\r\n    must be excluded as a cause of death: II) The cut on the left\r\n    wrist reveals three incisions of the bone. Trial cuts are\r\n    lacking. These findings are contrary to the assumption that the\r\n    wound has been self-inflicted: III) It must be assumed that the\r\n    cause of death was suffocation. As a cause for suffocation,\r\n    strangulation and throttling must be considered. The\r\n    characteristics of the marks left by the strings do not agree\r\n    with those otherwise observed in cases of death caused by\r\n    hanging.” (_645-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese four murders, committed within the short space of two weeks in the\r\nSpring of 1933, each by different SS guards, are but a few examples of\r\nSS activities in the camps even as early as 1933. Many similar examples\r\nfrom that period and later periods could be produced.\r\n\r\nIndeed, that sort of thing was officially encouraged. Disciplinary\r\nRegulations for the Dachau Concentration Camp were issued on 1 October\r\n1933 by SS Fuehrer Eicke, who later became commander of all the Death\r\nHead Units (_778-PS_). The fourth paragraph of the introduction of those\r\nrules provides:\r\n\r\n    “Tolerance means weakness. In the light of this conception,\r\n    punishment will be mercilessly handed out whenever the interests\r\n    of the Fatherland warrant it. The fellow countryman who is\r\n    decent but misled will never be affected by these regulations.\r\n    But let it be a warning to the agitating politicians and\r\n    intellectual provocators—regardless of which kind—; be on\r\n    guard not to be caught, for otherwise it will be your neck and\r\n    you will be shut up according to your own methods.” (_778-PS_)\r\n\r\nSo many inmates were killed “while trying to escape,” to use the pat\r\nofficial phrase, that by 1936 the Minister of Justice was moved to\r\nappeal to Himmler to regulate the use of firearms by the Death Head\r\nUnits. A memorandum 9 March 1936, prepared by Minister of Justice\r\nGuertner, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “On the 2d of this month, using the Hoppe case as an\r\n    illustration, I discussed the question of use of arms by the\r\n    guard-personnel of the concentration camp with the Reichsfuehrer\r\n    SS. I suggested to Himmler that he issue an order on the use of\r\n    arms for the officials subordinated to him. I referred in this\r\n    respect to the example of the decree on the use of arms by the\r\n    armed forces of 17 January of this year. Himmler has promised me\r\n    that such a decree will be issued and will grant us\r\n    participation in the preliminary work.” (_781-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe memorandum bears the pencil notation, “Initiative with Himmler”.\r\nSubsequent events showed how Himmler carried out this initiative.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Administration of concentration camps through SS agencies._\r\nFurnishing guard personnel was not the only function of the SS with\r\nrelation to the camps. The entire internal management of the camps,\r\nincluding the use of prisoners, their housing, clothing, sanitary\r\nconditions, the determination of their right to live and the disposal of\r\ntheir remains, was controlled by the SS. Such management was first\r\nvested in the leader of the SS Death Head Units, who also had the title\r\nof Inspector of the Concentration Camps. This official was originally a\r\npart of the SS Main Office (_SS Hauptamt_), represented on the chart by\r\nthe second box from the left (_Chart Number 3_).\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the war, in March 1942, control of concentration\r\ncamps was transferred to another of the departments of the SS Supreme\r\nCommand, the SS Economic and Administration Main Office (commonly known\r\nas WVHA). That department is indicated on the chart by the third box\r\nfrom the left (_Chart Number 3_).\r\n\r\nThat change was announced in a letter to Himmler 30 April 1942 from SS\r\nObergruppenfuehrer and General of the Waffen SS Pohl, the Chief of WVHA\r\n(_R-129_). In that letter Pohl reported on the measures he had taken to\r\ncarry out Himmler’s order of 3 March 1942 to transform the camps into\r\nlarge scale economic enterprises, and inclosed an order to all\r\nconcentration camp commanders which provided that no longer was there to\r\nbe any limit on working hours in the camps. (_R-129_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _SS control of concentration camps and the slave labor program._\r\nThis shift of control to WVHA coincided with the change in the basic\r\npurposes of the concentration camps. Political and security reasons,\r\nwhich previously had been the grounds for confinement, were abandoned\r\nand the camps were made to serve the Nazi slave labor program.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy the increased demands for manpower it was not enough to work\r\nthe inmates of the camp harder. More inmates had to be obtained. Through\r\nits police arm, the SS was prepared to satisfy this demand. On 17\r\nDecember 1942 an order was issued to all commanders of the Security\r\nPolice and SD directing that at least 35,000 prisoners qualified for\r\nwork be sent immediately to the concentration camps (_1063-D-PS_).\r\nThirty-five thousand prisoners was, of course, merely the beginning. The\r\nSS dragnet was capable of catching many more slaves. A directive to all\r\nthe departments of the SS Supreme Command signed by Himmler at his field\r\nheadquarters on 5 August 1943, ordered the collection of men, women, and\r\nchildren for work in coal mines (_744-PS_). This directive implements an\r\norder signed by Keitel directing the use of all males captured in\r\nguerilla fighting in the East for forced labor (_744-PS_). The Himmler\r\ndirective, it will be noted, is addressed to every main office in the SS\r\nSupreme Command:\r\n\r\n    “_Subject_: Manpower for coal mining industry. _Reference_:\r\n    Letter of the command staff of the Reichsfuehrer SS—journal No.\r\n    Ia/1909/43 secret.\r\n\r\n                                                              Secret\r\n\r\n    1.

(_R-124_)\r\n\r\nThe last source of manpower had not been tapped. To Jews, deportees,\r\nwomen and children, there was added the productive power of prisoners of\r\nwar. Naturally enough it was through the SS that the conspirators\r\nsqueezed the last drop of labor from such prisoners. Speer’s minutes of\r\nhis conference with the Fuehrer on 5 March 1944, state:\r\n\r\n    “Told the Fuehrer of the Reichs Marshal’s wish for further\r\n    utilization of the production power of prisoners of war by\r\n    giving the direction of the Stalag to the SS with the exception\r\n    of the English and Americans. The Fuehrer considers the proposal\r\n    good and has asked Colonel von Below to arrange matters\r\n    accordingly.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nThat matters were soon arranged is shown by Speer’s statement made at\r\nthe 58th discussion of the Central Planning Board on 25 May 1944\r\n(_R-124_):\r\n\r\n    “Speer: We have come to an arrangement with the Reichsfuehrer SS\r\n    as soon as possible so that PW’s he picks up are made available\r\n    for our purposes. The Reichsfuehrer SS gets from 30 to 40\r\n    thousand men per month.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nFinally, in order to insure SS control over the labor of prisoners of\r\nwar, the Reichsfuehrer SS was appointed by Hitler as head of all\r\nprisoner of war camps on 25 September 1944. A circular letter from the\r\nDirector of the Party Chancellery, 30 September 1944 and signed by M.\r\nBormann, states:\r\n\r\n    “1. The Fuehrer has ordered under the date 25 Sept 1944: The\r\n    custody of all prisoners of war and interned persons, as well as\r\n    prisoner of war camps, and institutions with guards are\r\n    transferred to the commander of the Reserve Army from October 1,\r\n    1944.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “2. The Reichsfuehrer SS has commanded:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ In my capacity as Commander of the Reserve Army, I\r\n    transfer the affairs of prisoners of war to Gottleb Berger,\r\n    SS-Lieut. General (_SS-Obergruppenfuehrer und General der\r\n    Waffen-SS_) Chief of Staff of the _Volkstums_.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_c._ The mobilization of labor of the prisoners of war will be\r\n    organized with the present labor mobilization office in joint\r\n    action between SS-Lieut. General Berger (SS-Obergruppenfuehrer)\r\n    and SS-Lieut. General Pohl.\r\n\r\n    “The strengthening of security in the field of prisoner of war\r\n    affairs is to be accomplished between SS-Lieut. General Berger\r\n    and the Chief of the Security Police, SS-Lieut. Gen. Dr.\r\n    Kaltenbrunner.” (_058-PS_)\r\n\r\nSo impressive were the results obtained from SS concentration camp labor\r\nthat Goering on 14 February 1944 called on Himmler for more inmates for\r\nuse in the aircraft industry (_1584-I-PS_). Himmler’s reply to that\r\nrequest reads, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Most Honored Reichsmarshal:\r\n\r\n    “Following my teletype letter of the 18 Feb. 44 I herewith\r\n    transmit a survey on the employment of prisoners in the aviation\r\n    industry.\r\n\r\n    “This survey indicates that at the present time about _36,000\r\n    prisoners_ are employed for the purposes of the air force. An\r\n    increase to a total of _90,000 prisoners is_ contemplated.\r\n\r\n    “The production is being discussed, established, and executed\r\n    between the Reich Ministry of aviation and the chief of my\r\n    economic-administrative main office, SS-Obergruppenfuehrer and\r\n    General of the Waffen-SS, Pohl respectively.\r\n\r\n    “We assist with all forces at our disposal.\r\n\r\n    “The task of my economic-administrative main office, however, is\r\n    not solely fulfilled with the delivery of the prisoners to the\r\n    aviation industry as SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Pohl and his\r\n    assistants take care of the required working speed thru constant\r\n    and supervision of the work-groups [Kommandos] and therefore\r\n    have some influence on the results of production. In this\r\n    respect I may suggest consideration of the fact that in\r\n    enlarging our responsibility thru a speeding up of the total\r\n    work, better results can definitely be expected.\r\n\r\n    “We also have for some time adjusted our own stone-quarries to\r\n    production for the airforce. For instance in Flossenbuerg near\r\n    Weiden the prisoners employed previously in the quarry are\r\n    working now in the fighter plane program for the Messerschmitt\r\n    corporation Regensburg, which saw in the availability of our\r\n    stone-mason shops and labor forces after the attack on\r\n    Regensburg at that time a favorable opportunity for the\r\n    immediate partial transfer of their production. Altogether 4,000\r\n    prisoners will work there after the expansion. We produce now\r\n    with 2,000 men 900 sets of engine cowlings and radiator covers\r\n    as well as 120,000 single parts of various kinds for the fighter\r\n    ME 109.\r\n\r\n    “In Oranienburg we are employing 6,000 prisoners at the Heinkel\r\n    works now for construction of the HE 177. With that we have\r\n    supplied 60% of the total crew of the plant.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The movement of manufacturing plants of the aviation industry\r\n    to subterranean locations requires _further_ employment of about\r\n    100,000 prisoners. The plans for this employment on the basis of\r\n    your letter of 14 Feb. 1944 are already under way.\r\n\r\n    “I shall keep you, most honored Reichsmarshal, currently\r\n    informed on this subject.\r\n\r\n                                     “Heil Hitler\r\n                                     “[initialled]  HH”  (_1584-III-PS_)\r\n\r\nInclosed with that letter was a report in tabular form of the number of\r\nprisoners being used in each of the concentration camps, the total\r\nman-hours for the month of January 1944, and the type of production in\r\nwhich such prisoners were engaged. That report is signed by Pohl, the\r\nChief of WVHA (_1584-III-PS_). The total appearing under the column\r\n“Number of prisoners planned” is 90,785; under the column “Number of\r\nprisoners used,” 35,839; and under the column “Man-hours—January,”\r\n8,733,495. (_1584-III-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the number of prisoners was increased through SS\r\nefforts is illustrated by a report from Office Group D of WVHA, 15\r\nAugust 1944:\r\n\r\n“_Subject_:   Report of the number of prisoners and Survey of prisoners\r\n                clothing type G and Z and the supply of G available.\r\n“Reference:   Telephone call by SS-Sturmbannfuehrer Waschkau on 15.8.44.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “With reference to the above-mentioned telephone call, I am\r\n    sending herewith a report on the actual number of prisoners for\r\n    1.8.1944 and of the new arrivals already announced, as well as\r\n    the clothing report for 15.8.44.\r\n\r\n“(1).  The actual number on 1.8.44, consisted of:\r\n       _a._ Male prisoners                                         379,167\r\n       _b._ Female prisoners                                       145,119\r\n\r\n        “In addition, there are the following new arrivals:\r\n\r\n 1. From the Hungary program (anti-Jewish action)                   90,000\r\n 2. From Litzmannstadt (Police prison and Ghetto)                   60,000\r\n 3.

Continued arrivals from France approx.                   15,000-20,000\r\n\r\n    “Most of the prisoners are already on the way and will be\r\n    received into the Concentration Camps within the next few days.”\r\n    (_1166-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) _SS control of concentration camps and the ill treatment and\r\nmurder of inmates._ The intensive drive for manpower to some extent\r\ninterfered with the program already undertaken by WVHA to exterminate\r\ncertain classes of individuals in the camps. This is shown by a letter\r\nfrom WVHA, Department D Concentration Camps, 28 March 1942, addressed to\r\na number of concentration camp commandants and signed Liebehenschel, SS\r\nObersturmbannfuehrer:\r\n\r\n    “It became known through a report of a Camp Commandant that 42\r\n    prisoners out of 51 which were mustered out for the special\r\n    treatment 14 f 13 again became capable of work after a period of\r\n    time and therefore do not have to be directed to the special\r\n    treatment. From this it appears that the selection of the\r\n    prisoners is not being handled according to given directives.\r\n    Only those prisoners are allowed to be directed to the\r\n    examination commission who fulfill the given stipulations and\r\n    who above all are no longer capable of work.\r\n\r\n    “In order to be able to fulfill the designated missions of the\r\n    concentration camps, the working capabilities of every prisoner\r\n    must be retained for the camp. The camp commandants of the\r\n    concentration camps are requested to especially make this their\r\n    aim.” (_1151-P-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother letter from WVHA, Department D Concentration Camps, 27 April\r\n1943, addressed to a number of concentration camp commanders, signed by\r\nGluecks, SS Brigade Fuehrer and Major General of the Waffen SS, deals\r\nwith the same point:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Fuehrer-SS and Chief of German Police has decided,\r\n    after consultation, that in the future only mentally sick\r\n    (_geisteskranke_) prisoners may be selected for action 14 F 13\r\n    by the medical commissions appointed for this purpose.\r\n\r\n    “All other prisoners incapable of working (tubercular cases,\r\n    bedridden cripples, etc.) are to be basically excepted from this\r\n    action. Bedridden prisoners are to be drafted for suitable work\r\n    which they can perform in bed.\r\n\r\n    “The order of the Reich Fuehrer SS is to be obeyed strictly in\r\n    the future.\r\n\r\n    “Requests for fuel for this purpose, therefore, do not take\r\n    place.” (_1933-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe SS, however, was to some degree enabled to achieve both goals—that\r\nof increased production and of elimination of undesirable individuals,\r\nas shown by the agreement between Minister of Justice Thierack and\r\nHimmler on 18 September 1942 (_654-PS_). That agreement provided for the\r\ndelivery of antisocial elements after the execution of their sentences\r\nto the Reichsfuehrer SS “to be worked to death.”\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which such persons worked in the camps were well\r\ncalculated to lead to their deaths. Those conditions were regulated by\r\nthe WVHA. An illustration of WVHA management is to be found in an order\r\ndirected to commandants of concentration camps, 11 August 1942, and\r\nissued by SS Brigade Fuehrer and General of the Waffen SS Gluecks, Chief\r\nof Office Group D of WVHA (_2189-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police has\r\n    ordered, that punishment by beating will be executed in\r\n    concentration camps for women by _prisoners_—under the ordered\r\n    supervision.\r\n\r\n    “In order to coordinate this order the main office chief of the\r\n    main SS economic administration office, SS-Obergruppenfuehrer\r\n    and General of the Waffen-SS Pohl, has ordered, effective\r\n    immediately, that punishment by beating will also be executed by\r\n    prisoners in concentration camps for men.” (_2189-PS_)\r\n\r\nEven after their deaths, the prisoners did not escape the management of\r\nWVHA. A directive to the commanders of concentration camps, 12 September\r\n1942, signed by the Chief of the Central Office of Office Group D of\r\nWVHA, SS Obersturmbannfuehrer Liebehenschel, provided:\r\n\r\n    “According to a communication of the Chief of the Security\r\n    Police and the SD and conforming to a report of the Chief of\r\n    Security Police and SD in Prague, urns of deceased Czechs and\r\n    Jews were sent for burial to the home-cemeteries within the\r\n    Protectorate.\r\n\r\n    “Based on different events (Demonstrations, erecting of posters\r\n    inimical to the Reich on urns of deceased inmates in halls of\r\n    cemeteries in the home-communities, pilgrimages to the graves of\r\n    deceased inmates, etc.) within the Protectorate, the delivery of\r\n    urns with the ash remnants of deceased Nationals of the\r\n    Protectorate and of Jews is henceforth prohibited. The urns\r\n    shall be preserved within the Concentration Camps. In case of\r\n    doubt about the preservation of the urns oral instructions shall\r\n    be available at this agency.” (_2199-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_e_) _SS use of concentration camp labor for pecuniary profit._ The SS\r\nregarded the inmates of concentration camps as its own personal property\r\nto be used for its own economic advantage. The suggestion in Himmler’s\r\nletter to Goering, will be recalled, that the SS be given a larger\r\nresponsibility in the armament program conducted in the camps\r\n(_1584-III-PS_). As early as 1942 Speer recognized that the SS was\r\nmotivated by the desire for further profits when he suggested to Hitler\r\nin a conference on 20, 21, and 22 September that the SS receive a share\r\nof the war equipment produced by concentration camp labor in ratio to\r\nthe working hours of the prisoners (_R-124_). The Fuehrer agreed that a\r\n3 to 5 percent share would satisfy SS commanders (_R-124_). Himmler\r\nhimself frankly admitted his intention to derive profits for SS purposes\r\nfrom the camps in his speech to the officers of the SS Leibstandarte\r\n“Adolf Hitler” (_1918-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * The apartment-building program which is the prerequisite\r\n    for a healthy and social basis of the entire SS as well as of\r\n    the entire Fuehrerkorps can be carried out only when I get the\r\n    money for it from somewhere; nobody is going to give me the\r\n    money, it must be earned, and it will be earned by forcing the\r\n    scum of mankind, the prisoners, the professional criminals to do\r\n    positive work. The man, guarding these prisoners, serves just as\r\n    hard as the one on close-order drill. The one who does this and\r\n    stands near these utterly negative people will learn within 3 to\r\n    4 months * * * and we shall see: In peacetime I shall form\r\n    guard-battalions and put them on duty for 3 months only—to\r\n    fight the inferior being (_Untermenschentum_), and this will not\r\n    be a boring guard duty, but if the officers handle it right, it\r\n    will be the best indoctrination on inferior beings and the\r\n    inferior races. This activity is necessary, as I said; 1. to\r\n    eliminate those negative people from the German people; 2. to\r\n    exploit them once more for the great folk community by having\r\n    them break stones and bake bricks so that the Fuehrer can again\r\n    erect his grand buildings; and 3. to in turn invest the money,\r\n    earned soberly this way, in houses, in ground, in settlements so\r\n    that our men can have houses in which to raise large families\r\n    and lots of children. This in turn is necessary because we stand\r\n    or die with this leading blood of Germany and if the good blood\r\n    is not reproduced we will not be able to rule the world.”\r\n    (_1918-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Functions and activities with respect to human experiments._ One\r\naspect of SS control over concentration camps remains to be\r\nmentioned—its direction of the program of biological experiments on\r\nhuman beings which was carried on in the camps. An American military\r\ntribunal has passed judgment on some of the SS members who participated\r\nin these experiments at Dachau. The purpose of this discussion is to\r\nshow only that those experiments were the result of SS direction and\r\nthat the SS played a vital part in their successful execution.\r\n\r\nThe program seems to have originated in a request by Dr. Sigmund Rascher\r\nto Himmler for permission to utilize persons in concentration camps as\r\nmaterial for experiments with human beings, in connection with research\r\nhe was conducting on behalf of the Luftwaffe. A letter dated 15 May\r\n1941, addressed to the Reichsfuehrer SS and signed by S. Rascher reads\r\nin part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “For the time being I have been assigned to the\r\n    _Luftgaukommando_ VLL, Munich for a medical course. During this\r\n    course, where researches on high-altitude flights play a\r\n    prominent part (determined by the somewhat higher ceiling of the\r\n    English fighter planes) considerable regret was expressed at the\r\n    fact that no tests with human material had yet been possible for\r\n    us, as such experiments are very dangerous and nobody volunteers\r\n    for them. I put, therefore, the serious question: can you make\r\n    available two or three professional criminals for these\r\n    experiments? The experiments are made at _Bodenstaendige\r\n    Bruefstells fuer Hoehenforschung der Luftwaffe_, Munich. The\r\n    experiments, by which the subjects can, of course, die, would\r\n    take place with my cooperation. They are essential for\r\n    researches on high-altitude flight and cannot be carried out, as\r\n    has been tried, with monkeys, who offer entirely different\r\n    test-conditions. I have had a very confidential talk with a\r\n    representative of the air forces surgeon who makes these\r\n    experiments. He is also of the opinion that the problem in\r\n    question could only be solved by experiments on human persons.\r\n    (Feeble-minded could also be used as that material.)”\r\n    (_1602-PS_)\r\n\r\nDr. Rascher promptly received assurance that he would be allowed to\r\nutilize concentration camp inmates for his experiments.\r\n\r\nA letter dated 22 May 1941, addressed to Dr. Rascher and bearing the\r\nsignature of SS Sturmbannfuehrer Karl Brandt, reads in part:\r\n\r\n    “Shortly before flying to Oslo, the Reichsfuehrer SS gave me\r\n    your letter of 15 May 1941, for partial reply.\r\n\r\n    “I can inform you that prisoners will of course be gladly made\r\n    available for the high-flight researches. I have informed the\r\n    Chief of the Security Police of this agreement of the\r\n    Reichsfuehrer SS, and requested that the competent official be\r\n    instructed to get in touch with you.” (_1582-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe altitude experiments were conducted by Rascher. In May 1942 General\r\nField Marshal Milch on behalf of the Luftwaffe expressed his thanks to\r\nthe SS for the assistance it furnished in connection with the\r\nexperiments. This letter, dated 20 May 1942, addressed to SS\r\nObergruppenfuehrer Wolff reads in part:\r\n\r\n    “In reference to your telegram of 12 May our sanitary inspector\r\n    reports to me that the altitude experiments carried out by the\r\n    SS and Air Force at Dachau have been finished. Any continuation\r\n    of these experiments seems essentially unreasonable. However the\r\n    carrying out of experiments of some other kind, in regard to\r\n    perils at high seas, would be important. These have been\r\n    prepared in immediate agreement with the proper offices; Major\r\n    (M.C.) Weltz will be charged with the execution and Capt. (M.C.)\r\n    Rascher will be made available until further orders in addition\r\n    to his duties within the Medical Corps of the Air Corps. A\r\n    change of these measures does not appear necessary, and an\r\n    enlargement of the task is not considered pressing at this time.\r\n\r\n    “The low-pressure chamber would not be needed for these\r\n    low-temperature experiments. It is urgently needed at another\r\n    place and therefore can no longer remain in Dachau.\r\n\r\n    “I convey the special thanks from the supreme commander of the\r\n    Air Corps to the SS for their extensive cooperation.\r\n\r\n    “I remain with best wishes for you in good comradeship and with\r\n\r\n                                             “Heil Hitler!\r\n                                             “Always yours\r\n                                             “s/s  E. Milch”  (_343-PS_)\r\n\r\nHaving finished his high-altitude experiments, Dr. Rascher proceeded to\r\nexperiment with methods of rewarming persons who had been subjected to\r\nextreme cold. On 10 September 1942 he rendered an intermediate report on\r\nintense chilling experiments which had been started in Dachau on 15\r\nAugust (_1618-PS_). That report states:\r\n\r\n    “The experimental subjects (VP) were placed in the water,\r\n    dressed in complete flying uniform, winter or summer\r\n    combination, and with an aviator’s helmet. A life jacket made of\r\n    rubber or kapok was to prevent submerging. The experiments were\r\n    carried out at water temperatures varying from 2.5° to 12°.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Electrical measurements gave low temperature readings of 26.4°\r\n    in the stomach and 26.5° in the rectum. Fatalities occurred only\r\n    when the brain stem and the back of the head were also chilled.\r\n    Autopsies of such fatal cases always revealed large amounts of\r\n    free blood, up to ½ liter, in the cranial cavity. The heart\r\n    invariably showed extreme dilation of the right chamber. As soon\r\n    as the temperature in these experiments reached 28°, the\r\n    experimental subjects (VP) died invariably, despite all attempts\r\n    at resuscitation.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “During attempts to save severely chilled persons\r\n    (_Unterkuehlte_), it was shown that rapid rewarming was in all\r\n    cases preferable to slow rewarming, because after removal from\r\n    the cold water, the body temperature continued to sink rapidly.\r\n    I think that for this reason we can dispense with the attempt to\r\n    save intensely chilled subjects by means of animal heat.\r\n\r\n    “Rewarming by animal warmth—animal bodies or women’s\r\n    bodies—would be too slow.” (_1618-PS_)\r\n\r\nAlthough Rascher was of the preliminary opinion that rewarming by\r\nwomen’s bodies would be too slow, means for conducting such experiments\r\nwere nevertheless placed at his disposal. A letter from the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS, signed Himmler, 16 November 1942, and addressed to Lt.\r\nGeneral Pohl, the head of WVHA, read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The following struck me during my visit to Dachau on the 13 Nov\r\n    1942 regarding the experiments conducted there for the saving of\r\n    people whose lives are endangered through exposure\r\n    (_Unterkuehlung_) in ice, snow, or water and who are to be saved\r\n    by the employment of every method or means:\r\n\r\n    “I had ordered that suitable women are to be set aside from the\r\n    Concentration Camp for these experiments for the warming of\r\n    these who were exposed. Four girls were set aside who were in\r\n    the Concentration Camp due to loose living, and being\r\n    prostitutes, they formulate a danger of contagion. * * *”\r\n    (_1583-PS_)\r\n\r\nTo insure the continuance of Rascher’s experiments, Himmler arranged for\r\nhis transfer to the Waffen SS. A letter dated November 1942 from the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS addressed to “Dear Comrade Milch,” stated:\r\n\r\n    “You will recall that through General Wolff I particularly\r\n    recommended to you for your consideration the work of a certain\r\n    SS Fuehrer, Dr. Rascher, who is a physician of the air force on\r\n    leave (_Arzt des Beurlaubtenstandes der Luftwaffe_).\r\n\r\n    “These researches which deal with the behavior of the human\r\n    organism at great heights, as well as with manifestations caused\r\n    by prolonged cooling of the human body in cold water, and\r\n    similar problems which are of vital importance to the air force\r\n    in particular, can be performed by us with particular efficiency\r\n    because I personally assumed the responsibility for supplying\r\n    asocial individuals and criminals who deserve only to die\r\n    (_todeswuerdig_) from concentration camps for these\r\n    experiments.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I beg you to release Dr. Rascher, Stabsarzt in reserve, from\r\n    the air force and to transfer him to me to the Waffen-SS. I\r\n    would then assume the sole responsibility for having these\r\n    experiments made in this field, and would put the results, of\r\n    which we in the SS need only a part for the frost injuries in\r\n    the East, entirely at the disposal of the air force. However, in\r\n    this connection I suggest that with the liaison between you and\r\n    Wolff a “non-Christian” physician should be charged, who should\r\n    be at the same time honorable as a scientist and not prone to\r\n    intellectual theft and who could be informed of the results.\r\n    This physician should also have good contacts with the\r\n    adminstrative[administrative?] authorities, so that the results\r\n    would really obtain a hearing.\r\n\r\n    “I believe that this solution—to transfer Dr. Rascher to the\r\n    SS, so that he could carry out the experiments under my\r\n    responsibility and under my orders—is the best way. The\r\n    experiments should not be stopped; we owe that to our men. If\r\n    Dr. Rascher remained with the air force, there would certainly\r\n    be much annoyance; because then I would have to bring a series\r\n    of unpleasant details to you, because of the arrogance and\r\n    assumption which Professor Dr. Holzloehner has displayed in the\r\n    post of Dachau—who is under my command—about me in utterances\r\n    delivered to SS Colonel Sievers. In order to save both of us\r\n    this trouble, I suggest again that Dr. Rascher should be\r\n    transferred to the Waffen SS as quickly as possible.”\r\n    (_1617-PS_)\r\n\r\nRascher’s experiments were by no means the only experiments in which the\r\nSS was interested. Without attempting even to outline the whole extent\r\nof the experimental program, one further illustration of this type of SS\r\nactivity may be mentioned. That is a report prepared by the Chief\r\nHygienist in the office of the Reich Surgeon of the SS and Police, SS\r\nOberfuehrer Dr. Mrugowsky, 12 September 1944, relating to experiments\r\nwith poisoned bullets.\r\n\r\n    “On 11 September 1944, in the presence of SS-Sturmbannfuehrer\r\n    Dr. Ding, Dr. Widman and the undersigned, experiments with\r\n    Akonotinnitrate bullets were carried out on five persons who had\r\n    been sentenced to death. The caliber of the bullets used was\r\n    7.65 cm and they were filled with the poison in crystal form.\r\n    Each subject of the experiments received one shot in the upper\r\n    part of the left thigh, while in a horizontal position. In the\r\n    case of 2 persons, the bullets passed clean through the upper\r\n    part of the thigh. Even later no effect from the poison could be\r\n    seen. These two subjects were therefore rejected * * *.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The symptoms shown by the three condemned persons were\r\n    surprisingly the same. At first, nothing special was noticeable.\r\n    After 20 to 25 minutes, a disturbance of the motor nerves and a\r\n    light flow of saliva began, but both stopped again. After 40 to\r\n    44 minutes a strong flow of saliva appeared. The poisoned\r\n    persons swallowed frequently, later the flow of saliva is so\r\n    strong that it can no longer be controlled by swallowing. Foamy\r\n    saliva flows from the mouth. Then, a sensation of choking, and\r\n    vomiting start.” (_L-103_)\r\n\r\nThe next three paragraphs describe in coldly scientific fashion the\r\nreactions of the dying persons. That description then concludes:\r\n\r\n    “At the same time there was pronounced nausea. One of the\r\n    poisoned persons tried in vain to vomit. In order to succeed he\r\n    put 4 fingers of his hand, up to the main joint, right into his\r\n    mouth. In spite of this, no vomiting occurred. His face became\r\n    quite red.\r\n\r\n    “The faces of the other two subjects were already pale at an\r\n    early stage. Other symptoms were the same. Later on the\r\n    disturbance of the motor nerves increased so much that the\r\n    persons threw themselves up and down rolled their eyes and made\r\n    aimless movements with their hands and arms. At last, the\r\n    disturbance subsided, the pupils were enlarged to the maximum,\r\n    the condemned lay still. Massetercramp and loss of urine was\r\n    observed in one of them. Death occurred 121, and 129 minutes\r\n    after they were shot.” (_L-103_)\r\n\r\nThe fact that SS doctors engaged in such experiments was no accident. It\r\nwas consistent with an ideology and racial philosophy which, to use\r\nHimmler’s own words, regarded human beings as lice and offal. But the\r\nmost important factor was the fact that only the SS was in a position to\r\nsupply necessary human material. And it did supply such material through\r\nWVHA. A letter from the Department Chief of Office Group D of WVHA, 12\r\nMay 1944, addressed to the commandants of all concentration camps dealt\r\nwith the assignment of prisoners for the experimental purposes:\r\n\r\n    “There is cause to call attention to the fact that in every case\r\n    permission for assignment has to be requested here _before_\r\n    assignment of prisoners is made for experimental purposes.\r\n\r\n    “To be included in this request are number, kind of custody, and\r\n    in case of aryan prisoners, exact personal data, file number in\r\n    the Main Reich’s Security Office and reason for detainment into\r\n    the concentration camp.\r\n\r\n    “Herewith, I explicitly forbid assignment of prisoners for\r\n    experimental purposes without permission.” (_1751-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was on the basis of its ability to supply such material that the\r\nMinistry of Finance was prepared to subsidize the SS experimental\r\nprogram. This matter was discussed in a series of letters between the\r\nMinistry of Finance, the Reichs Research Department, and the Reich\r\nSurgeon of the SS and police (_002-PS_). The first is from the office of\r\nthe Executive Council of the Reichs Research Department, addressed to\r\nthe Reichs Surgeon SS and Police, 19 February 1943, and signed by\r\nMentzel, Chief of Bureau, SS Brigade Leader:\r\n\r\n    “The Reichs Minister of Finance told me that you requested 53\r\n    leading positions (BES. GR C3-C8) for your office, partly for a\r\n    new research institute.\r\n\r\n    “After the Reichsmarschall of the Great German Reich had, as\r\n    President of the Reichs Research Dept., entrusted himself with\r\n    all German research, issued directives among other things, that\r\n    in the execution of military important scientific tasks, the\r\n    available institutions including equipment and personnel should\r\n    be utilized to the utmost for reasons of necessary economization\r\n    (of effort).\r\n\r\n    “The foundation of new institutes comes therefore only in\r\n    question in as far as there are no outstanding institutes\r\n    available for the furtherance of important war research tasks.”\r\n    (_002-PS_)\r\n\r\nTo this letter the Reich Surgeon of SS and Police replied on 26 February\r\n1943:\r\n\r\n    “In acknowledgment of your correspondence of the 19th Feb. 1943,\r\n    I am able to reply the following to it today:\r\n\r\n    “The appropriation for the 53 key positions for my office which\r\n    you made the basis of your memorandum was a veritable peace\r\n    plan.\r\n\r\n    “The special institutes of the SS which are to be partly staffed\r\n    through this appropriation are to serve the purpose to establish\r\n    and make accessible for the entire realm of scientific research,\r\n    the particular possibilities of research only possessed by the\r\n    SS.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I will gladly be at your disposal at any time to discuss the\r\n    particular research aims in connection with the SS, which I\r\n    would like to bring up upon the direction of the Reichs Director\r\n    SS.” (_002-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn interview between the Reich Surgeon and Mentzel took place, and on 25\r\nMarch 1943 Mentzel wrote the following letter to the Reich Minister of\r\nFinance:\r\n\r\n    “In regard to your correspondence of the 19th Dec (J 4761—174 I\r\n    g III. Ang) to which I gave you a preliminary communication on\r\n    the 19th Feb, I finally take the following position:\r\n\r\n    “The Surgeon General-SS and Police, in a personal discussion,\r\n    told me that the budget claim which he looks after is used\r\n    primarily in the pure military sector of the Waffen SS. Since it\r\n    is established on a smaller scale for the enlarging of\r\n    scientific research possibilities, they pertain therefore\r\n    exclusively to such affairs that are carried out with the\r\n    material (Prisoners—‘_Haflinge_’) which is only accessible to\r\n    the Waffen SS and are therefore not to be undertaken for any\r\n    other experimental purposes.\r\n\r\n    “I cannot object therefore on the part of the Reichs\r\n    Experimental Counsel against the budget claims of the Surgeon\r\n    General, SS and Police.” (_002-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _Functions and Activities with respect to Jewish Persecution._\r\nThrough its activities with respect to concentration camps the SS\r\nperformed part of its mission to safeguard the security of the Nazi\r\nregime. But another specialized aspect of that mission must not be\r\nforgotten. Himmler had defined that task as the prevention of a\r\n“_Jewish_ Bolshevist revolution of subhumans.” In plain words this meant\r\nparticipation in the Nazi program of Jewish persecution and\r\nextermination. That program involved every branch and component of the\r\nSS.\r\n\r\nThe racial philosophy of the SS made that organization a natural agency\r\nfor the execution of all types of anti-semitic measures. The SS position\r\non the Jewish question was publicly stated in the SS newspaper “_Das\r\nSchwarze Korps_,” in the issue of 8 August 1940, by its editor, Gunter\r\nd’Alquen (_2668-PS_). “_Das Schwarze Korps_” was the official propaganda\r\nagency of the SS which every SS man was required to read and to induce\r\nothers to read. This was the SS position on the Jews:\r\n\r\n    “Just as the Jewish question will be solved for Germany only\r\n    when the last Jew has been deported, so the rest of Europe\r\n    should realize that the German peace which awaits it must be a\r\n    peace without Jews.” (_2668-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe attempted “solution” of the Jewish question through pogroms and\r\n“spontaneous” demonstrations occurred following the murder of von Rath\r\nin November 1938. In these demonstrations all branches of the SS were\r\ncalled on to play a part. The teletype message from SS Gruppenfuehrer\r\nHeydrich, Chief of the Security Police and SD, issued on 10 November\r\n1938 concerning “Measures against Jews tonight,” provided:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The direction of the measures of the Security Police\r\n    concerning the demonstrations against Jews is vested with the\r\n    organs of the State Police—inasmuch as the inspectors of the\r\n    Security Police are not issuing their own orders. In order to\r\n    carry out the measures of the Security Police, officials of the\r\n    Criminal Police, as well as members of the SD, of the\r\n    _Verfuegungstruppe_ and the _Allgemeine SS_ may be used.”\r\n    (_3051-PS_)\r\n\r\nWith the outbreak of the war and the march of Nazi armies over the\r\nContinent, the SS participated in “solving” the Jewish question in all\r\nthe countries of Europe. The solution was nothing short of\r\nextermination. To a large degree these wholesale murders were disguised\r\nunder the name of “anti-partisan” or “anti-guerilla” actions, and as\r\nsuch included as victims not merely Jews but Soviets, Poles, and other\r\nEastern peoples. One example of an action confined essentially to Jews\r\nwas the mass annihilation of Jews in gas vans (_501-PS_). Those vans\r\nwere operated by the Security Police and SD under the direction of RSHA.\r\nAnother example is found in the report entitled “Solution of the Jewish\r\nQuestion in Galicia,” prepared by SS Gruppenfuehrer and Lt. General of\r\nthe Police Katzman and rendered to SS Obergruppenfuehrer and General of\r\nthe Police Krueger (_L-18_). The “solution,” which consisted in\r\nevacuation and extermination of all the Jews in Galicia and confiscation\r\nof their property, was carried out under the energetic direction of the\r\nSS and Police Leaders, with the assistance of SS police units, as the\r\nreport proudly boasts. Three additional items in that report dealing\r\nspecifically with the SS should be noted. The first is the text under a\r\nphotograph in the original report:\r\n\r\n    “Great was the joy of the SS men when the Reichsfuehrer SS in\r\n    person in 1942 visited some camps along the Rollbahn.” (_L-18_)\r\n\r\nThe second is a balance sheet, showing the income from forced Jewish\r\nlabor and expenditures therefrom. Item 3 on the balance sheet reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“3. Amount paid over to the SS cashier:\r\n    _a._ Camps                                            6,876,251,00 Zl\r\n    _b._ W&R Factories                                    6,556,513,69 Zl\r\n                                                                 ————————\r\n                                                         13,432,764,69 Zl\r\n\r\n    Further payments to the SS-cashier are effected every month.”\r\n    (_L-18_)\r\n\r\nThe third is the last two paragraphs of the report:\r\n\r\n    “Despite the extraordinary burden heaped upon every single SS\r\n    Police Officer during these actions, mood and spirit of the men\r\n    were extraordinarily good and praiseworthy to the last day.\r\n\r\n    “Only thanks to the sense of duty of every single leader and man\r\n    have we succeeded to get rid of this PLAGUE in so short a time.”\r\n    (_L-18_)\r\n\r\nOne final example of SS participation in Jewish extermination is the\r\nreport by SS Brigadefuehrer and Major General of the Police, Stroop, of\r\nthe destruction of the Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw during April and May 1943\r\n(_1061-PS_). Two sections of that report dealing with the constitution\r\nof the participating forces should be noted. A table of the units used\r\nindicates the average number of officers and men from each unit employed\r\nper day. It will be observed that among the units involved were the\r\nstaff of the SS and Police Leader, two battalions of the Waffen SS, two\r\nbattalions of the 22d SS Police Regiment and members of the Security\r\nPolice. The part played by the Waffen SS particularly came in for high\r\npraise from the writer of the report. Tribute is paid to the toughness\r\nof the men of the Waffen SS, Police, and _Wehrmacht_. In the next\r\nparagraph the writer says:\r\n\r\n    “Considering that the greater part of the men of the Waffen SS\r\n    had been trained for only three or four weeks before being\r\n    assigned to this action, high credit should be given for the\r\n    pluck, courage and devotion to duty which they showed.”\r\n    (_1061-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe selection methods and ideological education of Waffen SS men\r\nfurnished such good grounding that a few weeks of practice was all that\r\nwas required to turn them into excellent exterminators. Himmler’s proud\r\nboast of the part that the SS played in the extermination of the Jews\r\noccurs in his Posen Speech:\r\n\r\n    “Most of _you_ must know what it means when 100 corpses are\r\n    lying side by side, or 500 or 1,000. To have stuck it out and at\r\n    the same time—apart from the exceptions caused by human\r\n    weakness—to have remained decent fellows, that is what has made\r\n    us hard. This is a page of glory in our history which has never\r\n    been written and is never to be written * * *.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\n(6) _Functions and activities with respect to preparing for and waging\r\naggressive war._ From the very beginning the SS made prime contributions\r\nto the conspirators’ aggressive aims. First, it served as one of the\r\npara-military organizations under which the conspirators disguised their\r\nbuilding up of an Army in violation of the Versailles Treaty. Second,\r\nthrough affiliated SS organizations in other countries and through some\r\nof the departments in its own Supreme Command, it fostered Fifth Column\r\nmovements outside Germany and prepared the way for aggression. Third,\r\nthrough its militarized units, it participated in the aggressive actions\r\nwhich were eventually carried out.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The SS as a para-military organization._ The para-military\r\ncharacter of the General SS is apparent from the military character of\r\nits structure, the military discipline required of its members, and the\r\nsteps it took to enlist in its ranks young men of military age. In\r\naddition to this volunteer Army the SS created, as early as 1933, fully\r\narmed professional soldiers who complied with the requirement for\r\ncompulsory military service by performing duties in the SS. These were\r\nthe _SS Vorfuegungstruppe_ and the Death Head Units.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The SS as a fifth column agency._ While building up the SS as a\r\nmilitary force within Germany, the conspirators also utilized it in\r\nother countries to lay the groundwork for aggression. During the seizure\r\nof Austria, the _SS Standarte 89_ was directly involved in the murder of\r\nChancellor Dolfuss, and a memorial placque was erected in Vienna as a\r\ntribute to the SS men who participated in that murder (_L-273_;\r\n_2968-PS_). Subsequently, on the night of 11 March 1938, the SS with the\r\nSA marched into Vienna and occupied all government buildings and\r\nimportant posts in the city. (See the report of Gauleiter Rainer to\r\nReich Commissioner Buerckel (_812-PS_); and the record of the telephone\r\nconversations between Goering and Dambrowski (_2949-PS_)).\r\n\r\nThe same pattern was repeated in Czechoslovakia. Henlein’s Free Corps\r\nplayed in that country the part of fifth column which the SS had played\r\nin Austria and was rewarded, in September 1938, by being placed under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Reichsfuehrer SS (_388-PS, Items 37, 38_).\r\nMoreover, a Most Secret OKW order of 28 September 1938, reveals that the\r\nSS had its own armed units, four battalions of _Totenkopf Verbaende_,\r\nactually operating in Czechoslovakian territory before the Munich Pact\r\nwas signed (_388-PS, Item 36_).\r\n\r\nBut SS preparations for aggression were not confined to military forces.\r\nOne of the departments of the SS Supreme Command, the _Volksdeutsche\r\nMittelstelle_, was a center for fifth column activity. At the secret\r\nmeeting between Ribbentrop and Henlein in March 1938, at which the line\r\nto be followed by the Sudeten German Party was determined, the\r\n_Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle_ was represented by Professor Haushofer and\r\nSS Obergruppenfuehrer Lorenz (_2788-PS_). And when the Foreign Office in\r\nAugust 1938 awarded further subsidies to Henlein’s Sudeten Party, the\r\nmemorandum of that recommendation (_3059-PS_) contained the significant\r\nfootnote:\r\n\r\n    “Volksdeutsche Mittlestelle will be informed.” (_3059-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _SS participation in aggressive war._ When at last the time came\r\nto strike, the SS was ready. In the words of the National Socialist\r\nYearbook for 1940 (_2164-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “When the march into the liberated provinces of the Sudetenland\r\n    began on that memorable October 1, 1938, _Verfuegungstruppe_ as\r\n    well as the Death Head Units were along with those in the lead.\r\n    * * *”\r\n\r\n    “The 15th of March 1939 brought a similar utilization of the SS\r\n    when it served to establish order in collapsing Czechoslovakia.\r\n    This action ended with the founding of the protectorate\r\n    Bohemia-Moravia.\r\n\r\n    “Only a week later, on the 29th of March 1939, Memel also\r\n    returned to the Reich upon basis of an agreement with Lithuania.\r\n    Again it was the SS, here above all the Eastern Prussian SS,\r\n    which played a prominent part in the liberation of this\r\n    province.” (_2164-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the final act which set off the war, the attack on Poland in\r\nSeptember 1939, the SS acted as stage manager. In his affidavit\r\n(_Affidavit A_), Maj. Gen. Erwin Lahousen describes the simulated attack\r\non the radio station Gleiwitz by Germans dressed in Polish uniforms, as\r\none of the most mysterious actions which took place in the _Abwehr_\r\noffice:\r\n\r\n    “This was an incident which had been deliberately engineered and\r\n    directed by the SD and it was executed by prisoners from\r\n    Concentration Camps dressed up in Polish uniforms, and using\r\n    Polish weapons and equipment. Those prisoners were later\r\n    murdered by the SD in order to eliminate any possibility of\r\n    their giving testimony of the incident.” (_Affidavit A_)\r\n\r\nThe war erupted and the Waffen SS again took its place in the van of the\r\nattacking forces.\r\n\r\n(7) _Functions and activities with respect to commission of war crimes._\r\nDuring the war great use was made of the peculiar qualities possessed by\r\nthe SS—qualities not only of its combat force, but of its other\r\ncomponents as well—in executing tasks embracing the commission of war\r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _“Antipartisan” operations._ A directive issued by Keitel on 13\r\nMarch 1941, making preparations 3 months in advance for the attack on\r\nRussia, provided that in the area of operations the Reichsfuehrer SS was\r\nentrusted with special tasks for the preparation of the political\r\nadministration—tasks which would result from the struggle about to\r\ncommence between two opposing political systems. (_447-PS_)\r\n\r\nOne of the steps taken by the Reichsfuehrer SS to carry out those\r\n“special tasks” was the formation and use of so-called “anti-partisan”\r\nunits. They were discussed by Himmler in his Posen speech:\r\n\r\n    “In the meantime I have also set up the Chief of the\r\n    anti-partisan units. Our comrade SS Obergruppenfuehrer von dem\r\n    Bach is Chief of the anti-partisan units. I considered it\r\n    necessary for the Reichsfuehrer SS to be in authoritative\r\n    command in all these battles, for I am convinced that we are\r\n    best in position to take action against this enemy struggle,\r\n    which is decidedly a political one. Except where units which had\r\n    been supplied and which we had formed for this purpose were\r\n    taken from us to fill in gaps at the front, we have been very\r\n    successful.\r\n\r\n    “It is notable that by setting up this department, we have\r\n    gained for the SS in turn, a division, a corps, an army, and the\r\n    next step—which is the High Command of an army or area of a\r\n    group—if you wish to call it that.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhat the SS did with its division, corps, and army, out of which the\r\nanti-partisan units were formed, is illustrated in the “Activity and\r\nSituation Report No. 6 of the Task Forces of the Security Police and SD\r\nin the U.S.S.R.,” covering the period from 1 to 31 October 1941\r\n(_R-102_). The report shows that so-called “anti-partisan” activity was\r\nactually nothing but a name for extermination of Jews and persons\r\nbelieved politically undesirable. The report is a carefully organized\r\nand detailed description of such extermination. Section I describes the\r\nstations of the various Task Forces involved, and section II their\r\nactivities. The latter section is divided into parts, each dealing with\r\na different geographical region—the Baltic area, White Ruthenia, and\r\nthe Ukraine. Under each area the report of activities is classified\r\nunder three headings: (_a_) Partisan activity and counteraction; (_b_)\r\narrests and executions of communists and officials; and (_c_) Jews. The\r\nfollowing units were involved (_R-102_):\r\n\r\n    “The present stations are:\r\n\r\n        “Task Force A: since 7 October 1941 Krasnowardeisk.\r\n        “Task Force B: continues in Smolensk.\r\n        “Task Force C: since 27 September 1941 in Kiew.\r\n        “Task Force D: since 27 September 1941 in Nikolajew.\r\n\r\n    “The Action and Special Commandos (_Einsatz und Sonder\r\n    Commandos_) which are attached to the Task Force continue on the\r\n    march with the advancing troops into the sectors which have been\r\n    assigned to them.” (_R-102_)\r\n\r\nThe section headed “Baltic area” and subsection labeled “Jews” read as\r\nfollows (_R-102_):\r\n\r\n    “Spontaneous demonstrations against Jewry followed by pogroms on\r\n    the part of the population against the remaining Jews have not\r\n    been recorded on account of the lack of adequate indoctrination.\r\n\r\n    “However, the Estonian Protective Corps (_Selbstschutz_), formed\r\n    at the time of the entry of the Wehrmacht, immediately started a\r\n    comprehensive arrest action of all Jews. This action was under\r\n    the direction of the task force of the Security Police and the\r\n    SD.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The male Jews over 16 were executed with the exception of\r\n    doctors and the elders. At the present time this action is still\r\n    in progress. After completion of this action there will remain\r\n    only 500 Jewesses and children in the Eastern Territory.”\r\n    (_R-102_)\r\n\r\nIn the section headed “White Ruthenia,” the subsection labeled “Partisan\r\nactivity and counteraction,” the following appear:\r\n\r\n    “In Wultschina 8 juveniles were arrested as partisans and shot.\r\n    They were inmates of a children’s home. They had collected\r\n    weapons which they hid in the woods. Upon search the following\r\n    were found: 3 heavy machine guns, 15 rifles, several thousand\r\n    rounds of ammunition, several hand grenades, and several\r\n    packages of poison gas Ebrit.\r\n\r\n    “_b. Arrests and executions of communists, officials, and\r\n    criminals._\r\n\r\n    “A further large part of the activity of the Security Police was\r\n    devoted to the combatting of Communists and criminals. A special\r\n    Commando in the period covered by this report executed 63\r\n    officials, NKVD agents and agitators.” (_R-102_)\r\n\r\nThe preceding subsection ends with the following statement:\r\n\r\n    “The liquidations for the period covered by this report have\r\n    reached a total of 37,180 persons.” (_R-102_)\r\n\r\nAnd under the section headed “Ukraine,” the subsection “Jews,” this\r\nstatement occurs:\r\n\r\n    “_Shitomir_\r\n\r\n    In Shitomir 3,145 Jews had to be shot, because from experience\r\n    they have to be regarded as bearers of Bolshevik propaganda and\r\n    saboteurs.” (_R-102_)\r\n\r\nThe foregoing report deals with the activities of four Task Forces—A,\r\nB, C, and D. The more detailed report of Task Force A up to 15 October\r\n1941 shows great variety of SS components in such a task force:\r\n\r\n    “This description of the over-all situation showed and shows\r\n    that the members of the Stapo [The Secret State Police], Kripo\r\n    and SD [Security Service] who are attached to the Action-Group,\r\n    are active mainly in Lithouania, Latvia, Esthonia,\r\n    White-Ruthenia and to a smaller part in front of Leningrad. It\r\n    shows further that the forces of the uniformed police and the\r\n    Armed SS are active mainly in front of Leningrad, in order to\r\n    take measures against the returning population and under their\r\n    own officers. This is so much easier because the Action\r\n    detachments in Lithouania, Latvia and Esthonia have at their\r\n    disposal native police units, as described in encl. 1, and\r\n    because so far 150 Latvian reinforcements have been sent to\r\n    White-Ruthenia.\r\n\r\n    “The distribution of the leaders of Security Police and SD\r\n    during the individual phases can be gathered from encl. 2, the\r\n    advance and the activities of the Action-Group and the\r\n    Action-detachments from encl. 3. It should be mentioned that the\r\n    leaders of the Armed-SS and of the uniformed police who are\r\n    reserves have declared their wish to stay on with the Security\r\n    Police and the SD.” (_L-180_)\r\n\r\nInclosure 1_a_ to this report shows the constitution of the Force:\r\n\r\n“_Total Strength of Action Group A_:\r\n                                                   _Percent_\r\n“Total:                                       990\r\n Waffen-SS                                    340       34.4\r\n Motor Bicycle-Riders                         172       17.4\r\n Administration                                18        1.8\r\n Security Service [SD]                         35        3.5\r\n Criminal Police [Kripo]                       41        4.1\r\n State Police [Gestapo]                        89        9.0\r\n Auxiliary Police                              87        8.8\r\n Order Police                                 133       13.4\r\n Female Employees                              13        1.3\r\n Interpreters                                  51        5.1\r\n Teleprinter-Operators                          3        0.3\r\n Wireless-Operators                             8        0.8 ” (_L-180_)\r\n\r\nAnother report on the anti-partisan activity, from the General Commissar\r\nfor White Ruthenia to the Reich Minister for Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories, 5 June 1943, deals with the results of the police operation\r\n“Cottbus”:\r\n\r\n    “* * * SS Brigadefuehrer, Major General of Police von Gottberg,\r\n    reports that the operation ‘Cottbus’ had the following result\r\n    during the period mentioned:\r\n\r\nEnemy dead                                                           4,500\r\nDead suspected of belonging to bands                                 5,000\r\nGerman dead                                                             59\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The figures mentioned above indicate that again a heavy\r\n    destruction of the population must be expected. If only 492\r\n    rifles are taken from 4,500 enemy dead, this discrepancy shows\r\n    that among these enemy dead were numerous peasants from the\r\n    country. The battalion Dirlewanger especially has a reputation\r\n    for destroying many human lives. Among the 5,000 people\r\n    suspected of belonging to bands, there were numerous women and\r\n    children.\r\n\r\n    “By order of the Chief of Band-Combatting, SS Obergruppenfuehrer\r\n    von dem Bach, units of the armed forces have also participated\r\n    in the operation * * *” (_R-135_)\r\n\r\nSS Obergruppenfuehrer vom dem Bach was referred to by Himmler as “our\r\ncomrade” when he placed him in charge of anti-partisan activity.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Execution of civilians._ The activities so far dealt with were\r\njoint activities in which the Gestapo, Order Police, the SD, Waffen SS,\r\nand SS Police Regiments were all involved. But these units were, of\r\ncourse, also used individually to carry out tasks of such a\r\nnature—tasks for which any component of the SS was well trained. A\r\nletter from the Chief of the Command Office of the Waffen SS to the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS, 14 October 1941, contains an intermediate report on\r\ncivilian state of emergency:\r\n\r\n    “* * * I deliver the following report regarding the commitment\r\n    of the Waffen SS in the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia during\r\n    the civilian state of emergency:\r\n\r\n    “In the mutual changes, all Battalions of the Waffen SS in the\r\n    Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia will be brought forth for\r\n    shootings, and relatively for the supervision at hangings.\r\n\r\n    “Up until now there occurred:\r\n\r\n“in Prague:                             99 shootings\r\n                                        21 hangings\r\n“in Bruenn:                             54 shootings\r\n                                        17 hangings\r\n“Total:                                191 executions (including 16 Jews)\r\n\r\n    “A complete report regarding other measures and on the conduct\r\n    of the officers, noncoms and men will be made following the\r\n    termination of the civilian state of emergency.” (_1972-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Murder of prisoners of war._ It is not surprising that units of\r\nthe Waffen SS, a branch which had thus been employed for extermination\r\nactions and the execution of civilians, also violated the laws of\r\nwarfare when carrying on ordinary combat activities. Proof of these\r\nviolations is contained in a supplementary report of the Supreme\r\nHeadquarters Allied Expeditionary Force Court of Inquiry concerning the\r\nshooting of allied prisoners of war by the 12th SS Panzer Division\r\n(Hitler Jugend) in Normandy, France, on 7-21 June 1944 (_2997-PS_). The\r\nCourt of Inquiry concluded that there occurred in Normandy, between 7\r\nand 17 June 1944, seven cases of violations of the law of war, involving\r\nthe shooting of 64 unarmed allied prisoners of war in uniform, many of\r\nwhom had been previously wounded, and none of whom had resisted or\r\nendeavored to escape; that the perpetrators were members of the 12th SS\r\nPanzer Division, the so-called Hitler Jugend Division; that enlisted men\r\nof the 15th Company of the 25th Panzer Grenadier Regiment of that\r\nDivision were given secret orders to the effect that SS troops should\r\ntake no prisoners and that prisoners were to be executed after having\r\nbeen interrogated; that similar orders were given to men of the 3d\r\nBattalion of the 26th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment and to the 12th SS\r\nEngineering and Reconnaissance Battalions; and that the conclusion was\r\nirresistible that it was understood throughout the Division that a\r\npolicy of denying quarter or executing prisoners after interrogation was\r\nopenly approved. (_2997-PS_)\r\n\r\nOther combatants met a similar fate at the hands of other components of\r\nthe SS. (The execution of allied fliers, of commandos, and paratroopers,\r\nand of escaped prisoners of war who were turned over to the SD to be\r\ndestroyed, is discussed in Section 6 on the Gestapo.)\r\n\r\nCombatants who were taken prisoner of war encountered the SS in another\r\nform. (Section 6 on the Gestapo discusses the selection, by SS groups\r\nstationed in prisoner of war camps, of prisoners for what the Nazis\r\neuphemistically called “special treatment.”) Finally, the entire control\r\nof prisoners of war was turned over to the Reichsfuehrer SS, pursuant to\r\nthe circular letter from the Nazi Party Chancellery placing Himmler in\r\ncharge of all prisoner of war camps. (_058-PS_)\r\n\r\n(8) _Functions and activities with respect to Germanization of conquered\r\nlands._ The final phase of the conspiracy in which the SS played a\r\nleading role comprehended the colonization of conquered territories, the\r\ndestruction of their national existence, and the permanent extension of\r\nthe German frontier. These objectives were carried out through the\r\nforcible evacuation and resettlement of inhabitants of conquered\r\nregions, confiscation of their properties, “denationalization” and\r\n“reeducation” of persons of German blood, and the colonization of\r\nconquered territories by Germans. (See Chapter X on the Slave Labor\r\nProgram and Chapter XIII on Germanization and Spoliation.)\r\n\r\nThe SS was the logical agency to formulate and carry out the execution\r\nof this program. The numerous statements made by Himmler as to SS\r\ntraining for its role as the aristocracy in the “new Europe” leave that\r\nbeyond doubt. Himmler immediately proceeded to put these theories into\r\npractice upon his appointment on 7 October 1939 as Reich Commissioner\r\nfor the Consolidation of German Folkdom. (_686-PS_)\r\n\r\nTo make and carry out plans for the program of evacuation and\r\nresettlement, a new department of the SS Supreme Command, the Staff\r\nHeadquarters of the Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German\r\nFolkdom, was created. The functions of this office are thus described in\r\nthe Organizations Book of the NSDAP for 1943:\r\n\r\n    “The Main Office of the Staff of the Reichs Commissar for the\r\n    Consolidation of German Nationality is entrusted with the whole\r\n    settlement and constructive planning and with its execution in\r\n    the Reich and all those territories within the authority of the\r\n    Reich, including all administrative and economic questions in\r\n    connection with settlement, especially the deployment of\r\n    manpower for this purpose.” (_2640-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe colonization program had two principal objectives: the first phase\r\nwas the destruction of the conquered peoples, by exterminating them,\r\ndeporting them, and confiscating their property; the second phase was\r\nthe bringing back of racial Germans to settle in the newly acquired land\r\nand to live from the wealth of those who had been eliminated.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Elimination and deportation of conquered people._ The\r\nextermination actions contributed in part to clearing the conquered\r\nterritories of persons deemed dangerous to the Nazi plan. But not every\r\nundesirable could be liquidated. Moreover, manpower was needed for the\r\nNazi war effort. Mass deportation thus accomplished the twin purpose of\r\nproviding labor and of freeing the land for German colonists. The\r\nparticipation of SS agencies in deporting persons from the conquered\r\nterritories to meet the increased demands of the Nazi war machine for\r\nmanpower has already been shown. The evacuation and resettlement\r\nprogram, however, required the use of additional SS agencies to deport\r\npersons occupying the desired living space. For this purpose immigration\r\ncenters were set up under the direction of RSHA, as is stated in the\r\nNational Socialist Yearbook for 1941:\r\n\r\n    “For some time now the Reichsfuehrer-SS has had at his disposal\r\n    an office under the management of SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Lorenz,\r\n    the _Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle_. This office has the task of\r\n    dealing with National German questions and the raising of\r\n    required support.\r\n\r\n    “In addition to the VM the Immigration Center Offices with the\r\n    Chief of the Security Police and the Security Service of the SS\r\n    (under the management of SS-Obersturmbannfuehrer Dr. Sandberger)\r\n    and the Settlement Staff of the Reich-Commissioner were created,\r\n    which, in cooperation with the NSV [National Socialist Welfare\r\n    Organization] and the Reich Railroad Agency, took charge of the\r\n    Migration of National Germans.” (_2163-PS_)\r\n\r\nFurther evidence is contained in the affidavit of Otto Hoffman, SS\r\nObergruppenfuehrer and General of the Waffen SS and Police, who was\r\nchief in the Main Office for Race and Settlement in the SS Supreme\r\nCommand until 1943. This affidavit, taken at Freising, Germany, on 4\r\nAugust 1945 reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * 2. The executive power, in other words the carrying out\r\n    of all so-called resettlement actions, that is to say, sending\r\n    away of Polish and Jewish settlers and those of non-German blood\r\n    from a territory in Poland destined for Germanization, was in\r\n    the hands of the Chief of the RSHA (Heydrich and later\r\n    Kaltenbrunner, since the end of 1942). The Chief of the RSHA\r\n    also supervised and issued orders to the so-called immigration\r\n    center (EWZ) which classified the Germans, living abroad who\r\n    returned to Germany and directed them to the individual farms,\r\n    already freed. The latter was done in agreement with the chief\r\n    office of the Reichsfuehrer SS.” (_L-49_)\r\n\r\nOther SS agencies also were included. The report, dated 22 May 1940,\r\nrelating to confiscation of Polish agricultural enterprises and\r\ndeportation of the Polish owners to Germany, shows that the following SS\r\nagencies were involved in this action:\r\n\r\n    “Means of transportation to the railroad can be provided (1)—by\r\n    the enterprise of the East German Corporation of Agricultural\r\n    Development, (2)—by the SS NCO School in Lublinitz and the\r\n    concentration camp of Auschwitz.\r\n\r\n    “These two latter places will also detail the necessary SS men\r\n    for the day of the confiscation, etc.” (_1352-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe extent to which departments of the Supreme Command of the SS were\r\nconcerned with the evacuation program is shown by the minutes of a\r\nmeeting on 4 August 1942 dealing with the treatment of deported\r\nAlsatians (_R-114_). The minutes list those present at the meeting as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“Present:\r\n“SS.- ‘Hauptsturmfuehrer’ Dr. Stier  }\r\n SS.- ‘Hauptsturmfuehrer’ Petri      }\r\n‘RR’  Hoffmann                       }  Staff Headquarters\r\n Dr.  Scherler                       }\r\n SS.- ‘Untersturmfuehrer’ Foerster   }\r\n SS.- ‘Obersturmfuehrer’ Dr. Hinrichs, Chief of Estate Office and\r\n        Settlement Staff, Strasbourg [_Leiter des Bodenamtes und\r\n        Ansiedlungsstabes Strasburg_]\r\n SS.- ‘Sturmbannfuehrer’ Bruckner, Intermediate Office for Racial Germans\r\n        (_Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle_)\r\n SS.- ‘Hauptsturmfuehrer’ Hummisch, Main Office Reich Security\r\n        [_Reichssicherheitshauptamt_]\r\n SS.- ‘Untersturmfuehrer’ Dr. Sieder, Main office for race and settling\r\n        [_Rus-Hauptamt_]\r\n Dr. Labes, D. U. T.” (_R-114_)\r\n\r\nThe minutes read in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. _State of deportation in Alsace._\r\n\r\n    “The starting point of the conference was a report on the\r\n    deportation effected so far and further plans for resettlement\r\n    in Alsace.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n                                 “_B._\r\n\r\n    “The representatives of the SS Main Offices present were united\r\n    in this opinion:\r\n\r\n    “II. 1. The Gauleiter’s plans for evacuation can be approved in\r\n    principle, since they confine themselves in fact to a class of\r\n    persons, whose presence in the Reich would be insupportable for\r\n    racial and political reasons.” (_R-114_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Resettlement of conquered territories by Germans._ The SS not\r\nonly destroyed or deported conquered peoples and confiscated their\r\nproperty, but it also repopulated the conquered regions with so-called\r\nracial Germans. Thousands upon thousands of these Germans were\r\ntransported from all parts of Europe to join the greater Reich. Not all\r\nGermans were deemed reliable colonists, however. Those who were not,\r\nwere returned to Germany proper for “re-Germanization” and “reeducation”\r\nalong Nazi lines. A typical instance of the fate of such Germans is\r\nfound in the decree of the Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of\r\nGerman Folkdom of 16 February 1942, dealing with the treatment to be\r\naccorded so-called “Polonized” Germans (_R-112_). By the terms of that\r\ndecree two other SS functionaries were charged with the responsibility\r\nfor the re-Germanization program, the Higher SS and Police Leaders and\r\nthe Gestapo. Paragraph III of the decree provides:\r\n\r\n    “III. The Higher SS and Police Fuehrer will further the\r\n    re-Germanization actions with every means at their disposal and\r\n    continuously take stock of their success. In case they find that\r\n    obstacles are put in the way of a re-Germanization action, they\r\n    will report on their findings to the competent State Police\r\n    (Superior) Office for appropriate measures. Where it proves to\r\n    be impossible to attain re-Germanization even by forcible\r\n    measures taken by the State Police, they will apply for a\r\n    revocation of the naturalization through the Reich Fuehrer SS,\r\n    Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood\r\n    and give notice to the competent State Police (Superior)\r\n    Office.” (_R-112_)\r\n\r\nParagraph IV of the decree provides:\r\n\r\n    “IV. In the course of fulfilling their duties imposed on them by\r\n    this Decree the competent State Police (Superior) Offices will\r\n    take in particular the following measures:”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “4. They will assist the Higher SS and Police Fuehrer in their\r\n    task of re-Germanization, particularly in removing obstacles by\r\n    forcible measures whenever there is opposition to\r\n    re-Germanization. Before ordering forcible measures by the State\r\n    Police they will give the Counsellor of the person in question\r\n    an opportunity to state his opinion.\r\n\r\n    “5. They will take into protective custody all persons, with\r\n    regard to whom the Higher SS and Police Fuehrer has applied for\r\n    revocation of their naturalization and will order their\r\n    imprisonment in a Concentration Camp.” (_R-112_)\r\n\r\nIn the final stage of the process, the resettlement of the conquered\r\nlands by racially and politically desirable Germans, still other SS\r\nagencies participated. The National Socialist Yearbook for 1941 states\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n    “Numerous SS-leaders and SS-men helped with untiring effort in\r\n    bringing about this systematic migration of peoples, which has\r\n    no parallel in history.\r\n\r\n    “There were many authoritative and administrative difficulties\r\n    which, however, were immediately overcome due to the\r\n    unbureaucratic working procedure. This was especially guaranteed\r\n    above all by the employment of SS leaders.\r\n\r\n    “The procedure called ‘_Durchschleusung_’ (literally, ‘passing\r\n    through the lock’) takes 3 to 4 hours as a rule. The resettler\r\n    is passed through 8 to 9 offices, following each other in\r\n    organic order: registration office, card-index office,\r\n    certificate and photo-office, property office, and biological\r\n    hereditary and sanitary test office. The latter was entrusted to\r\n    doctors and medical personnel of the SS and of the Armed Forces.\r\n    The SS-Corps Areas [_Oberabschnitte_] Alpenland, North-West,\r\n    Baltic Sea, Fulda-Werra, South and South East, the SS-Main\r\n    Office [_SS-Hauptamt_], the NPEA (National Political Education\r\n    Institution) Vienna, and the SS-Cavalry-School in Hamburg\r\n    provided most of the SS-Officer and SS-Non-Coms who worked at\r\n    this job of resettlement.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The settlement, establishment and care of the newly won\r\n    peasantry in the liberated Eastern territory will be one of the\r\n    most cherished tasks of the SS in the whole future.” (_2163-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 E. _Defendant’s Membership in the SS._\r\n\r\nIn the course of its development from a group of strong armed\r\nbodyguards, some 200 in number, to a complex organization participating\r\nin every field of Nazi endeavor, the SS found room for its members in\r\nhigh places. Persons in high places moreover, found for themselves a\r\nposition in the SS. Of the defendants charged in the indictment at least\r\n7 were high ranking officers in the SS. They are the defendants\r\nRibbentrop, Hess, Kaltenbrunner, Bormann, Sauckel, Neurath, and\r\nSeyss-Inquart. The vital part that Kaltenbrunner played in the SS, the\r\nSD, and the entire Security Police system is discussed in Section 6 on\r\nthe Gestapo.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the other six defendants, the facts as to their\r\nmembership in the SS are to be found in two official publications. The\r\nfirst is the membership list of the SS as of 1 December 1936. On line 2,\r\npage 8, of that publication, there appears the name “Hess, Rudolf,”\r\nfollowed by the notation, “By authority of the Fuehrer the right to wear\r\nthe uniform of an SS Obergruppenfuehrer.” In the 1937 edition of the\r\nsame membership list, line 50, page 10, there appears the name “Bormann,\r\nMartin,” and in line with his name on the opposite page, under the\r\nheading “Gruppenfuehrer,” appears the following date “20.4.37.” In the\r\nsame edition, line 56, page 12, is the name “von Neurath, Konstantin”\r\nand on the opposite page, under the column headed “Gruppenfuehrer,” the\r\ndate “18.9.37.”\r\n\r\nThe second publication is “_Der Grossdeutsche Reichstag_” for the Fourth\r\nVoting Period, edited by E. Kienast, Ministerial Director of the German\r\nReichstag, an official handbook containing biographical data as to\r\nmembers of the Reichstag. On page 349 the following appears: “von\r\nRibbentrop, Joachim, _Reichsminister des Auswaertigen_, SS\r\nObergruppenfuehrer”; and on page 360 the following: “Sauckel, Fritz,\r\n_Gauleiter_ and _Reichsstatthalter_ in Thuringen, SS\r\nObergruppenfuehrer”; and on page 389 the following: “Seyss-Inquart,\r\nArthur, Dr. Jur., Reichsminister, SS Obergruppenfuehrer.”\r\n\r\n                            F. _Conclusion._\r\n\r\nIt is the prosecution’s contention that the SS, as defined in Appendix B\r\nof the Indictment, was unlawful. Its participation in every phase of the\r\nconspiracy alleged in Count One is clear. As an organization founded on\r\nthe principle that persons of “German blood” were a “master race,” it\r\nexemplified a basic Nazi doctrine. It served as one of the means through\r\nwhich the conspirators acquired control of the German government. The\r\noperations of the SD, and of the _SS Totenkopf Verbaende_ in\r\nconcentration camps, were means used by the conspirators to secure their\r\nregime and terrorize their opponents as alleged in Count One. All\r\ncomponents of the SS were involved from the very beginning in the Nazi\r\nprogram of Jewish extermination. Through the _Allgemeine SS_ as a\r\npara-military organization, the _SS Verfuegungstruppe_ and _SS Totenkopf\r\nVerbaende_ as professional combat forces, and the _Volksdeutsche\r\nMittelstelle_ as a fifth column agency, it participated in preparations\r\nfor aggressive war, and, through its militarized units, in the seizure\r\nof Austria, the invasion of Czechoslovakia, the attack on Poland, and\r\nthe waging of aggressive war in the West and in the East, as set forth\r\nin Counts One and Two of the Indictment. In the course of such war, all\r\ncomponents of the SS had a part in the war crimes and crimes against\r\nhumanity, set forth in Counts Three and Four,—the murder and ill\r\ntreatment of civilian populations in occupied territory, the murder and\r\nill treatment of prisoners of war, and the Germanization of occupied\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nThe evidence has shown that the SS was a single enterprise—a unified\r\norganization. Some of its functions were, of course, performed by one\r\nbranch, or department or office, some by another. No single branch or\r\ndepartment participated in every phase of its activity. But every branch\r\nand department and office was necessary to the functioning of the whole.\r\nThe situation is much the same as in the case of the individual\r\ndefendants at the bar. Not all participated in every act of the\r\nconspiracy; but all performed a contributing part in the whole criminal\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nThe evidence has shown, not only that the SS was an organization of\r\nvolunteers but that applicants had to meet the strictest standards of\r\nselection. It was not easy to become an SS member. That was true of all\r\nbranches of the SS. During the course of the war, as the demands for\r\nmanpower increased and the losses of the Waffen SS grew heavier and\r\nheavier, there were occasions when men drafted for compulsory military\r\nservice were assigned to units of the _Waffen SS_ rather than to the\r\n_Wehrmacht_. Those instances were relatively few. Evidence of recruiting\r\nstandards of the Waffen SS in 1943 has shown that membership in that\r\nbranch was as essentially voluntary and highly selective as in other\r\nbranches. The fact that some individuals may have been arbitrarily\r\nassigned to some Waffen SS unit has no bearing on the issue before the\r\ntribunal, which is this, whether the SS was or was not an unlawful\r\norganization. Doubtless some of the members of the SS, or of other of\r\nthe organizations alleged to be unlawful, might desire to show that\r\ntheir participation in the organization was small or innocuous, that\r\ncompelling reasons drove them to apply for membership, that they were\r\nnot fully conscious of its aims, or that they were mentally\r\nirresponsible when they became members. Such facts might or might not be\r\nrelevant if they were on trial. But in any event this is not the forum\r\nto try out such matters.\r\n\r\nThe question before this Tribunal is simply this, whether the SS was or\r\nwas not an unlawful organization. The evidence has fully shown what the\r\naims and activities of the SS were. Some of these aims were stated in\r\npublications. The activities were so widespread and so notorious,\r\ncovering so many fields of unlawful endeavor, that the illegality of the\r\norganization could not have been concealed. It was a notorious fact, and\r\nHimmler himself admitted that in 1936, when he said:\r\n\r\n    “I know that there are people in Germany now who become sick\r\n    when they see these black coats. We know the reason and we don’t\r\n    expect to be loved by too many.”\r\n\r\nIt was at all times the exclusive function and purpose of the SS to\r\ncarry out the common objectives of the conspirators. Its activities in\r\ncarrying out those functions involved the commission of the crimes\r\ndefined in Article 6 of the Charter. By reason of its aims and the means\r\nused for the accomplishment thereof, the SS should be declared a\r\ncriminal organization in accordance with Article 9 of the Charter.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE SCHUTZSTAFFELN\r\n                                  (SS)\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 9.                │  I   │       6\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix B.                         │  I   │  29, 70\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

THE GEHEIME STAATSPOLIZEI (GESTAPO) AND SICHERHEITSDIENST (SD)\r\n\r\nThis section on the _Geheime Staatspolizei_ (GESTAPO) includes evidence\r\non the criminality of the _Sicherheitsdienst_ (SD) of the\r\n_Schutzstaffel_ (SS). In the Indictment the SD is included by special\r\nreferences as a part of the SS, since it originated as a part of the SS\r\nand always retained its character as a party organization, as\r\ndistinguished from the GESTAPO, which was a State organization. As will\r\nbe shown in this section, however, the GESTAPO and the SD were brought\r\ninto close working relationship, the SD serving primarily as the\r\ninformation-gathering agency and the GESTAPO as the executive agency of\r\nthe police system established by the Nazis for the purpose of combatting\r\nthe political and ideological enemies of the Nazi regime. This close\r\nworking relationship between the GESTAPO and the SD was accomplished by\r\nthe appointment of Himmler, the Reichsfuehrer of the SS, to the position\r\nof Chief of the German Police. What is proved in this section with\r\nrespect to the criminality of the SD applies directly to the case\r\nagainst the SS. The relationship between the SS and the GESTAPO is\r\nconsidered in section 5 on the SS.\r\n\r\n              A. _Development of the Gestapo and the SD._\r\n\r\n(1) _Development of the GESTAPO._ The _Geheime Staatspolizei_, or\r\nGESTAPO, was first established in Prussia on 26 April 1933 by Goering,\r\nwith the mission of carrying out the duties of political police with or\r\nin place of the ordinary police authorities. The GESTAPO chief was given\r\nthe rank of a higher police authority and was subordinated only to the\r\nMinister of the Interior, to whom was delegated the responsibility of\r\ndetermining its functional and territorial jurisdiction (_2104-PS_).\r\nPursuant to this law, and on the same date, the Minister of the Interior\r\nissued a decree on the reorganization of the police which established a\r\nState Police Bureau in each government district of Prussia subordinate\r\nto the Secret State Police Bureau in Berlin. (_2371-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 30 November 1933 Goering issued a decree for the Prussian State\r\nMinistry and for the Reichs Chancellor which acknowledged the valuable\r\nservices which the GESTAPO was able to render to the State and which\r\nplaced the GESTAPO under his direct supervision as Chief. The GESTAPO\r\nwas thereby established as an independent branch of the Administration\r\nof the Interior, responsible directly to Goering as Prussian Prime\r\nMinister. This decree gave the GESTAPO jurisdiction over the political\r\npolice matters of the general and interior administration and provided\r\nthat the district, county, and local police authorities were subject to\r\nthe directives of the GESTAPO (_2105-PS_). By a decree of 8 March 1934\r\nthe regional State Police offices were separated from their\r\norganizational connection with the district government and established\r\nas independent authorities of the GESTAPO. (_2113-PS_)\r\n\r\nParallel to the development of the GESTAPO in Prussia, the Reichsfuehrer\r\nSS, Heinrich Himmler, created in Bavaria the Bavarian Political Police\r\nand also directed the formation of political police forces in the other\r\nfederal states outside of Prussia. The unification of the political\r\npolice of the various states took place in the spring of 1934 when\r\nHermann Goering appointed Himmler the Deputy Chief of the Prussian\r\nGESTAPO in place of the former Deputy Chief, Diels. Himmler thereby\r\nobtained unified control over the political police forces throughout the\r\nReich. (_1680-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 10 February 1936 the basic law for the GESTAPO was promulgated by\r\nGoering as Prussian Prime Minister. This law provided that the Secret\r\nState Police had the duty to investigate and to combat in the entire\r\nterritory of the State all tendencies inimical to the State, and\r\ndeclared that orders in matters of the Secret State Police were not\r\nsubject to the review of the administrative courts (_2107-PS_). On the\r\nsame date, 10 February 1936, a decree for the execution of said law was\r\nissued by Goering as Prussian Prime Minister and by Frick as Minister of\r\nthe Interior. This decree provided that the GESTAPO had authority to\r\nenact measures valid in the entire area of the State and measures\r\naffecting that area, that it was the centralized agency for collecting\r\npolitical intelligence in the field of political police, and that it\r\nadministered the concentration camps. The GESTAPO was given authority to\r\nmake police investigations in cases of criminal attacks upon Party as\r\nwell as upon State. (_2108-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 28 August 1936 a circular of the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the\r\nGerman Police provided that as of 1 October 1936 the political police\r\nforces of the German provinces were to be called the “_Geheime\r\nStaatspolizei_” (Secret State Police). The regional offices were still\r\nto be described as State Police (_2372-PS_). On 20 September 1936 a\r\ncircular of the Minister of the Interior commissioned the GESTAPO Bureau\r\nin Berlin with the supervision of the duties of the political police\r\ncommanders in all the States of Germany. (_L-297_)\r\n\r\nThe law relating to financial measures in connection with the police of\r\n19 March 1937 provided that officials of the GESTAPO were to be\r\nconsidered direct officials of the Reich and their salaries, in addition\r\nto the operational expenses of the whole State Police, were to be borne\r\nfrom 1 April 1937 on by the Reich. (_2243-PS_)\r\n\r\nThrough the above laws and decrees the GESTAPO was established as a\r\nuniform political police system operating throughout the Reich and\r\nserving Party, State, and the Nazi leadership.\r\n\r\n(2) _Development of the SD._ In 1932 the Reichsfuehrer of the SS,\r\nHeinrich Himmler, created the _Sicherheitsdienst_, or SD, as an\r\nintelligence service of the SS under the then SS-Standartenfuehrer\r\nReinhard Heydrich. (_1680-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 9 June 1934, the NSDAP issued an ordinance which merged all\r\ninformation facilities then existing within the Party organization into\r\nthe SD, and the SD was established as the sole Party information\r\nservice. (_1680-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the course of its development, the SD came into increasingly closer\r\ncooperation with the GESTAPO and also with the _Reich Kriminalpolizei_,\r\nthe Criminal Police, or KRIPO. The GESTAPO and the KRIPO considered\r\ntogether were called the _Sicherheitspolizei_, the Security Police, or\r\nSIPO. The SD was also called upon to furnish information to various\r\nState authorities. On 11 November 1938 a decree of the Reich Minister of\r\nthe Interior declared that the SD was to be the intelligence\r\norganization for the State as well as for the Party, that it had the\r\nparticular duty of supporting the Secret State Police, and that it\r\nthereby became active on a national mission. These duties necessitated a\r\nclose cooperation between the SD and the authorities for the General and\r\nInterior Administration. (_1680-PS_; _1638-PS_)\r\n\r\nThrough the above laws and decrees the SD was established as a uniform\r\npolitical information service operating throughout the Reich and serving\r\nParty, State, and the Nazi leadership.\r\n\r\n(3) _Consolidation of the GESTAPO and the SD._ The first step in the\r\nconsolidation of the political police system of the State (the GESTAPO)\r\nand the information service of the Nazi Party (the SD) took place in the\r\nspring of 1934 when Goering appointed Himmler Deputy Chief of the\r\nGESTAPO. Heydrich was the head of the SD under Himmler, and when Himmler\r\ntook over the actual direction of the GESTAPO, these two agencies were\r\nin effect united under one command. (_1956-PS_; _2460-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 17 June 1936, “for the uniformity of police duties in the Reich,” the\r\nposition of Chief of the German Police was established in the Reich\r\nMinistry of the Interior, to which was assigned the direction and\r\nprotection of all police affairs within the jurisdiction of the Reich.\r\nBy this law Himmler was appointed Chief of the German Police under\r\nFrick, the Reich Minister of the Interior, and was given the right to\r\nparticipate in the sessions of the Reich Cabinet as Chief of the German\r\nPolice. (_2073-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 26 June 1936 Himmler issued a decree providing for the appointment of\r\na chief of the uniformed police and of a chief of the Security Police.\r\nThis decree divided the German police system into two principal\r\nbranches:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) _Ordnungspolizei_ (ORPO or Regular Police).\r\n\r\n    (_b_) _Sicherheitspolizei_ (SIPO or Security Police).\r\n\r\nThe _Ordnungspolizei_ was composed of the _Schutzpolizei_ (Safety\r\nPolice), the _Gendarmerie_ (Rural Police), and the _Gemeindepolizei_\r\n(Local Police). The _Sicherheitspolizei_ was composed of the _Reich\r\nKriminalpolizei_ (KRIPO) and the _Geheime Staatspolizei_ (GESTAPO).\r\nDaluege was named head of the _Ordnungspolizei_ and Heydrich was named\r\nhead of the _Sicherheitspolizei_. Since Heydrich was also head of the\r\nSD, he took the new title of Chief of the Security Police and SD.\r\n(_1551-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 27 September 1939 by order of Himmler, in his capacity as\r\nReichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police, the central offices of\r\nthe GESTAPO and the SD, together with the Criminal Police, were\r\ncentralized in the office of the Chief of the Security Police and SD\r\nunder the name of the _Reichssicherheitshauptamt_, Reich Security Main\r\nOffice, or RSHA. Under this order the personnel and administrative\r\nsections of each agency were coordinated in _Amt_ I and _Amt_ II of the\r\nRSHA; the operational sections of the SD became _Amt_ III (except for\r\nforeign intelligence which was placed in _Amt_ VI); the operational\r\nsections of the GESTAPO became _Amt_ IV and the operational sections of\r\nthe KRIPO became _Amt_ V. Ohlendorf was named the Chief of _Amt_ III,\r\nthe SD within Germany; Mueller was named the Chief of _Amt_ IV, the\r\nGESTAPO; and Nebe was named the Chief of _Amt_ V, the KRIPO. (_L-361_)\r\n\r\nOn 27 September 1939 Heydrich, as Chief of the Security Police and SD,\r\nissued a directive pursuant to the foregoing order of Himmler, in which\r\nhe ordered the designation and heading “_Reichssicherheitshauptamt_” to\r\nbe used exclusively in internal relations of the Reich Ministry of the\r\nInterior, and the heading “The Chief of the Security Police and SD” in\r\ntransactions with outside persons and offices. The directive provided\r\nthat the GESTAPO would continue to use the designation and heading\r\n“_Geheime Staatspolizeiamt_” according to particular instructions.\r\n(_L-361_)\r\n\r\nIn 1944 most of the sections of the _Abwehr_ (military intelligence)\r\nwere incorporated into the various sections of the RSHA and into a new\r\nsection connected with _Amt_ VI, called the _Militaerisches Amt_.\r\n(_2644-PS_)\r\n\r\nHeydrich was Chief of the Security Police and SD (RSHA) until his death\r\non 4 June 1942, after which Himmler directed the organization until the\r\nappointment of the defendant Ernst Kaltenbrunner as Chief of the\r\nSecurity Police and SD. Kaltenbrunner took office on 30 January 1943 and\r\nremained Chief of the Security Police and SD (RSHA) until the end of the\r\nwar. (_2644-PS_)\r\n\r\n              B. _Organization of the Gestapo and the SD._\r\n\r\n(1) _Organization of the Gestapo_ (_Amt_ IV of the RSHA). The\r\nheadquarters organization of the GESTAPO (_Amt_ IV of the RSHA) was set\r\nup on a functional basis. In 1943 it contained five sub-sections.\r\n\r\nSection A dealt with opponents, sabotage, and protective service and was\r\nsubdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n A 1   Communism, Marxism and associated organizations, war crimes,\r\n       illegal and enemy propaganda.\r\n A 2   Defense against sabotage, combatting of sabotage, political\r\n       falsification.\r\n A 3   Reaction, opposition, legitimism, liberalism, matters of malicious\r\n       opposition.\r\n A 4   Protective service, reports of attempted assassinations, guarding,\r\n       special jobs, pursuit troops.\r\n\r\nSection B dealt with political churches, sects and Jews, and was\r\nsubdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n B 1   Political Catholicism.\r\n B 2   Political Protestantism Sects.\r\n B 3   Other churches, Freemasonry.\r\n B 4   Jewish affairs, matters of evacuation, means of suppressing\r\n       enemies of the people and State, dispossession of rights of German\r\n       citizenship. (Eichmann was head of this office).\r\n\r\nSection C dealt with card files, protective custody, and matters of\r\npress and Party, and was subdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n C 1   Evaluation, main card index, administration of individual files,\r\n       information office, supervision of foreigners.\r\n C 2   Matters of protective custody.\r\n C 3   Matters of the press and literature.\r\n C 4   Matters of the Party and its formations, special cases.\r\n\r\nSection D dealt with regions under greater German influence, and was\r\nsubdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n D (_aus. arb._)  Foreign Workers.\r\n D 1   Matters of the Protectorate, Czechs in the Reich, Slovakia,\r\n       Serbia, Croatia, and the remaining regions of the former\r\n       Jugoslavia, Greece.\r\n D 2   Matters of the General Government, Poles in the Reich.\r\n D 3   Confidential office, foreigners hostile to the State, emigrants.\r\n D 4   Occupied territories, France, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Denmark.\r\n D 5   Occupied Eastern territories.\r\n\r\nSection E dealt with security and was subdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n E 1   General security matters, supply of legal opinions in matters of\r\n       high and State treason, and other security matters.\r\n E 2   General economic matters, defense against economic espionage,\r\n       protection of works and those engaged in guarding.\r\n E 3   Security West.\r\n E 4   Security North.\r\n E 5   Security East.\r\n E 6   Security South.\r\n\r\nSection F dealt with passport matters and alien police and was\r\nsubdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n   F 1 Frontier police.\r\n   F 2 Passport matters.\r\n   F 3 Identification and identity cards.\r\n   F 4 Alien police and basic questions concerning frontiers.\r\n   F 5 Central visa office. (_L-219_)\r\n\r\nSubordinate offices of the GESTAPO were established throughout the Reich\r\nand designated as _Staats Polizeileitstellen_ or _Staats\r\nPolizeistellen_, depending upon the size of the office. These offices\r\nreported directly to the RSHA in Berlin but were subject to the\r\nsupervision of _Inspekteurs_ of the Security Police in the various\r\nprovinces. The inspectors were expected to foster cooperation between\r\nthe Security Police and the central offices of the general and interior\r\nadministration. (_2245-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the occupied territories the regional offices of the GESTAPO were\r\ncoordinated with the Criminal Police and the SD under _Kommandeurs_ of\r\nthe Security Police and SD, who were subject to _Befehlshabers_ of the\r\nSecurity Police and SD who reported to the Chief of the Security Police\r\nand SD (RSHA) in Berlin. (_1285-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Organization of the SD (Amt III of the RSHA)._ The headquarters\r\norganization of the SD (including only _Amt_ III of the RSHA and not\r\n_Amt_ VI, the Foreign Intelligence Branch) was set up on a functional\r\nbasis. In 1943 it contained four sections.\r\n\r\nSection A dealt with questions of legal order and structure of the Reich\r\nand was subdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n A 1   General questions of work on spheres of German life.\r\n A 2   Law.\r\n A 3   Constitution and administration.\r\n A 4   National life in general.\r\n A 5   General questions of police law, and technical questions of\r\n       legislation.\r\n\r\nSection B dealt with nationality, and was subdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n B 1   Nationality questions.\r\n B 2   Minorities.\r\n B 3   Race and health of the people.\r\n B 4   Citizenship and naturalization.\r\n B 5   Occupied territories.\r\n\r\nSection C dealt with culture, and was subdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n C 1   Science.\r\n C 2   Educational religious life.\r\n C 3   Folk culture and art.\r\n C 4   Press, literature, radio, office for evaluation of material.\r\n\r\nSection D dealt with economics, and was subdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n D a   Reading office, economics, press, magazines, literature.\r\n D b   Colonial economics.\r\n D S   Special questions and review of material.\r\n D West  Western occupied regions.\r\n D Ost    Eastern occupied regions.\r\n D 1   Food economy.\r\n D 2   Commerce, handcraft, and transport.\r\n D 3   Finance, currency, banks and exchanges, insurance.\r\n D 4   Industry and Power.\r\n D 5   Labor and Social Questions.   (_L-219_)\r\n\r\nWithin Germany the original regional offices of the SD were called\r\n_SD-Oberabschnitte_ and _SD-Unterabschnitte_. In 1939 these designations\r\nwere changed to _SD-Abschnitte_ and _SD-Leitabschnitte_. Offices of the\r\n_SD-Abschnitte_ were located in the same place as the\r\n_Staatspolizeistellen_. _SD-Abschnitte_ located where there were _Staats\r\nPolizeileitstellen_ were called “_SD Leitabschnitte_.” Direct orders\r\ncame from the Chief of the Security Police and SD in Berlin (RSHA) to\r\nthese regional offices, but they were also subject to the supervision of\r\nthe _Inspekteurs_ of the SIPO and SD. In the occupied territories the\r\nregional offices of the SD were coordinated with the GESTAPO and\r\nCriminal Police under _Kommandeurs_ of the SIPO and SD who were subject\r\nto _Befehlshabers_ of the Security Police and SD who reported to the\r\nChief of the Security Police and SD (RSHA) in Berlin. (_1680-PS_,\r\n_L-361_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Combined Organization of the GESTAPO and SD._ The central offices\r\nof the GESTAPO and SD were coordinated in 1936 with the appointment of\r\nHeydrich, the head of the SD, as chief of the Security Police. The\r\noffice of Heydrich was called “Chief of the Security Police and SD.”\r\n(_1551-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhen the central offices of the GESTAPO and SD, together with the\r\nCriminal Police, were centralized in one main office (RSHA) in 1939, the\r\nfunctions were somewhat redistributed.\r\n\r\n_Amt_ I of the RSHA handled personnel for the three agencies. Subsection\r\nA 2 handled personnel matters of the GESTAPO, A 3 handled personnel\r\nmatters of the KRIPO, and A 4 handled personnel matters of the SD.\r\n\r\n_Amt_ II handled organization, administration, and law for the three\r\nagencies. Subsection C handled domestic arrangements and pay accounts,\r\nand was divided into two sections, one to take care of pay accounts of\r\nthe Security Police and the other to take care of pay accounts of the\r\nSD, since personnel of the former were paid by the State and personnel\r\nof the latter were paid by the Party. Subsection D, under\r\nSS-Obersturmbannfuehrer Rauff handled technical matters, including the\r\nmotor vehicles of the SIPO and SD.\r\n\r\n_Amt_ III was the SD and was charged with investigation into spheres of\r\nGerman life. Its subdivisions have heretofore been considered.\r\n\r\n_Amt_ IV was the GESTAPO and was charged with combatting political\r\nopposition. Its subdivisions have heretofore been considered.\r\n\r\n_Amt_ V was the KRIPO and was charged with combatting criminals.\r\nSubsection V D was the criminalogical institute for the SIPO handling\r\nmatters of identification, chemical and biological investigations, and\r\ntechnical research.\r\n\r\n_Amt_ VI was concerned with foreign political intelligence and contained\r\nsubsections dealing with western Europe, Russia and Japan,\r\nAnglo-American sphere, and central Europe. It contained a special\r\nsection dealing with sabotage.\r\n\r\n_Amt_ VII handled ideological research against enemies, such as\r\nFreemasonry, Judaism, political churches, Marxism, and liberalism.\r\n(_L-185_; _L-219_)\r\n\r\nThe centralization of the main offices of the GESTAPO and SD was not\r\nfully carried out in the regional organization. Within Germany the\r\nregional offices of the GESTAPO and SD maintained their separate\r\nidentity and reported directly to the section of the RSHA which had the\r\njurisdiction of the subject matter. They were, however, coordinated by\r\nthe _Inspekteurs_ of the Security Police and SD. The _Inspekteurs_ were\r\nalso under the supervision of the Higher SS and Police leaders appointed\r\nfor each _Wehrkreis_.\r\n\r\nThe Higher SS and Police leaders reported to the Reichsfuehrer SS and\r\nChief of the German Police in each _Wehrkreis_ and supervised not only\r\nthe _Inspekteurs_ of the Security Police and SD but also the\r\n_Inspekteurs_ of the Order Police and various subdivisions of the SS.\r\n(_1285-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the occupied territories the organization developed as the German\r\narmies advanced. Combined operational units of the Security Police and\r\nSD, known as _Einsatz_ Groups, operated with and in the rear of the\r\nArmy. These groups were officered by personnel of the GESTAPO, the\r\nKRIPO, and the SD, and the enlisted men were composed of Order Police\r\nand Waffen SS. They functioned with various army groups. The _Einsatz_\r\nGroups were subdivided into _Einsatzkommandos_, _Sonderkommandos_, and\r\n_Teilkommandos_, all of which performed the functions of the Security\r\nPolice and SD with or closely behind the army. After the occupied\r\nterritories had been consolidated, the _Einsatz_ Groups and their\r\nsubordinate parts were formed into permanent combined offices of the\r\nSecurity Police and SD within prescribed geographical locations. These\r\ncombined forces were placed under the _Kommandeurs_ of the Security\r\nPolice and SD, and the offices were organized in sections similar to the\r\nRSHA headquarters. The _Kommandeurs_ of the Security Police and SD\r\nreported directly to _Befehlshabers_ of the Security Police and SD, who\r\nin turn reported directly to the Chief of the Security Police and SD. In\r\nthe occupied territories, the Higher SS and Police leaders exercised\r\nmore direct control over the _Befehlshabers_ and the _Kommandeurs_ of\r\nthe Security Police and SD than within the Reich. They had authority to\r\nissue direct orders so long as they did not conflict with the Chief of\r\nthe Security Police and SD who exercised controlling authority.\r\n(_1285-PS, Chart Number 19._)\r\n\r\n          C. _Place of the GESTAPO and SD in the Conspiracy._\r\n\r\n(1) _Tasks and Methods of the GESTAPO._ In the basic law of 10 February\r\n1936, the GESTAPO was declared to have “the duty to investigate and to\r\ncombat in the entire territory of the State, all tendencies dangerous to\r\nthe State.” The decree issued for the execution of said law gave the\r\nGESTAPO the authority to make police investigations in treason,\r\nespionage, and sabotage cases, “and in other cases of criminal attacks\r\non Party and State.” (_2107-PS_; _2108-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn referring to the above law, the Nazi jurist, Dr. Werner Best,\r\ncommented as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Not the State in its outward organic appearance but the tasks\r\n    of the leadership in the sense of the National-Socialist idea is\r\n    the object of protection.” (_2232-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe duties of the GESTAPO were described in 1938 as follows, in an order\r\npublished by the Party Chancery:\r\n\r\n    “To the GESTAPO has been entrusted the mission by the Fuehrer to\r\n    watch over and to eliminate all enemies of the Party and the\r\n    National Socialist State as well as all disintegrating forces of\r\n    all kinds directed against both.” (_1723-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn _Das Archiv_, January 1936, the duties of the GESTAPO were described\r\nin part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Since the National Socialist revolution, all open struggle and\r\n    all open opposition to the State and to the leadership of the\r\n    State is forbidden, and a Secret State Police as a preventive\r\n    instrument in the struggle against all dangers threatening the\r\n    State is indissolubly bound up with the National Socialist\r\n    Fuehrer-State.” (_1956-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe successful accomplishment of this mission to strike down the\r\npolitical and ideological opponents of the Nazi conspiracy was stated in\r\nthe official magazine of the SIPO and SD on 1 February 1943 in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n    “The Secret State Police by carrying out these tasks,\r\n    contributed decisively to the fact that the National Socialist\r\n    constructive work could be executed in the past ten years\r\n    without any serious attempts of interference by the political\r\n    enemies of the nation.” (_1680-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe methods used by the GESTAPO were limited only by the results to be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n    “The duties of the political police and the necessary means for\r\n    their performance are not chosen freely but are prescribed by\r\n    the foe. Just like the operations of an army against the outward\r\n    enemy and the means to fight this enemy cannot be prescribed, so\r\n    the political police also must have a free hand in the choice of\r\n    the means necessary at times to fight the attempts dangerous to\r\n    the State.” (_2232-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO was not restricted to the limitations of written law. The\r\nNazi jurist, Dr. Werner Best, states:\r\n\r\n    “As long as the ‘police’ carries out the will of the leadership,\r\n    it is acting legally.” (_1852-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO was given the express power to take action outside the law\r\nin the occupied territories. The laws pertaining to the administration\r\nof Austria and the Sudetenland provided that the Reichsfuehrer SS and\r\nChief of the German Police will take measures for the maintenance of\r\nsecurity and order “even beyond the legal limitation otherwise laid down\r\nfor this purpose.” (_1437-PS_; _1438-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe actions and orders of the GESTAPO were not subject to judicial\r\nreview. The decision of the Prussian High Court of Administration on 2\r\nMay 1935 held that the status of the GESTAPO as a special police\r\nauthority removed its orders from the jurisdiction of the Administrative\r\nTribunals. The court said that under the law of 30 November 1933 the\r\nonly redress available was by appeal to the next higher authority within\r\nthe GESTAPO itself. (_2347-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe basic law of 10 February 1936 on the powers of the GESTAPO provided\r\nspecifically in Section VII:\r\n\r\n    “Orders in matters of the Secret State Police are not subject to\r\n    the review of the administrative courts.” (_2107-PS_)\r\n\r\nConcerning the power of the GESTAPO to act outside the law, the Nazi\r\njurist, Dr. Werner Best, states:\r\n\r\n    “It is no longer a question of law but a question of fate\r\n    whether the will of the leadership lays down the ‘right’ rules,\r\n    i.e., rules feasible and necessary for police action—the\r\n    ‘police’ law suitable for and beneficial to the people. Actual\r\n    misuse of the legislative power by a people’s leadership—be it\r\n    a harmful severity or weakness—will, because of the violations\r\n    of the ‘laws of life,’ be punished in history more surely by\r\n    fate itself through misfortune, overthrow and ruin, than by a\r\n    State Court of Justice.” (_1852-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe great power of the GESTAPO was “_Schutzhaft_”—the power to imprison\r\npeople without judicial proceedings on the theory of “protective\r\ncustody.” This power was based upon the law of 28 February 1933 which\r\nsuspended the clauses of the Weimar Constitution guaranteeing civil\r\nliberties to the German people, including Article 114 thereof, which\r\nprovided that an abridgement of personal liberty was permissible only by\r\nauthority of law. (_2499-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn April 1934 the Reich Minister of the Interior issued a decree (which\r\nwas not made public) stating that in view of the stabilizing of the\r\nnational situation it had become feasible to place restrictions upon the\r\nexercise of protective custody and providing for limitations upon its\r\nexercise. (_L-301_; _779-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO did not observe such limitations, and the practice of taking\r\npeople into protective custody increased greatly in 1934. The GESTAPO\r\ndid not permit lawyers to represent persons taken into protective\r\ncustody and, in one instance, counsel were themselves placed in\r\nprotective custody for trying to represent clients. Civil employees were\r\ninvestigated and taken into protective custody by the GESTAPO without\r\nknowledge of their superiors. (_775-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs of 1 February 1938, the Reich Minister of the Interior rescinded\r\nprevious decrees relating to protective custody, including the decree of\r\n12 April 1934, and issued new regulations. These regulations provided\r\nthat protective custody could be ordered:\r\n\r\n    “* * * as a coercive measure of the Secret State Police against\r\n    persons who endangered the security of the people and the State\r\n    through their attitude, in order to counter all aspirations of\r\n    enemies of the people and State”;\r\n\r\nthat the GESTAPO had the exclusive right to order protective custody;\r\nthat protective custody was to be executed in the State concentration\r\ncamps; and that the GESTAPO, which authorized release from protective\r\ncustody, would review individual cases once every three months. The\r\nChief of the Secret Police was given authority to issue the necessary\r\nregulations. (_1723-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe importance of this power of protective custody was set forth in _Das\r\nArchiv_, 1936, in the following language:\r\n\r\n    “The most effective preventive measure is without doubt the\r\n    withdrawal of freedom, which is covered in the form of\r\n    protective custody, if it is to be feared that the free activity\r\n    of the persons in question might endanger the security of the\r\n    State in any way. While protective arrest of short duration is\r\n    carried out in police and court prisons, the concentration camps\r\n    under the Secret State Police admit those taken into protective\r\n    custody who have to be withdrawn from public life for a longer\r\n    time.” (_1956-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe authority of the GESTAPO to administer the concentration camps was\r\nset forth in the decree to the basic law of 10 February 1936.\r\n(_2108-PS_)\r\n\r\nOther methods used by the GESTAPO consisted of the dissolution of\r\nassociations, prohibition and dissolution of assemblies and\r\ncongregations, prohibition of publications of various kinds and so\r\nforth. (_1956-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Tasks and Methods of the SD._ The task of the SD, after it became\r\nthe intelligence service for State and Party, was to obtain secret\r\ninformation concerning the actual and potential enemies of the Nazi\r\nleadership so that appropriate action could be taken to destroy or\r\nneutralize opposition. (_1956-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe duties of the SD were stated by the Nazi jurist, Dr. Werner Best, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “As the intelligence service of the German National Socialist\r\n    Labor Party, the Security Service has first of all the task of\r\n    investigating and keeping a watch over all forces, events and\r\n    facts which are of importance for the domination of the National\r\n    Socialist idea and movement in German territory. With this task\r\n    follows that duty laid down by the Reich Minister of the\r\n    Interior—the duty of supporting the Security Police—which is\r\n    fulfilled, so far as it goes, under State orders. In support of\r\n    the tasks of the Security Police in securing the ranks of the\r\n    German people against interference and destruction of any kind,\r\n    the Security Service has to watch over every sphere of life of\r\n    the German people with regard to the activities of inimical\r\n    forces and the result of state and political measures, and to\r\n    inform continually the competent State authorities and offices\r\n    about the facts which have come to light. Finally, it has to\r\n    investigate politically and explore fundamentally the activities\r\n    and connections of the great, ideological, arch-enemy of\r\n    National Socialism and the German people, in order thereby to\r\n    render possible a purposeful and effective fight against it.”\r\n    (_1852-PS_)\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this task, the SD created an organization of agents and\r\ninformants operating out of various SD regional offices established\r\nthroughout the Reich, and later in conjunction with the GESTAPO and\r\nCriminal Police throughout the occupied territories. The organization\r\nconsisted of several hundred full-time agents whose work was\r\nsupplemented by several thousand part-time informants. Informants were\r\nlocated in schools, shops, churches, and all other spheres of German\r\nlife, operating under cover, and reporting any utterances or actions\r\nagainst the Nazi Party, State or leadership. (_2614-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe SD had direct and powerful influence in the selection of Nazi\r\nleaders. It investigated the loyalty and reliability of State officials,\r\nevaluating them by their complete devotion to Nazi ideology and the\r\nHitler leadership. It secretly marked ballots and thereby discovered the\r\nidentity of persons who cast “No” votes and “invalid” votes in the\r\nreferenda. (_2614-PS_; _R-142_)\r\n\r\nThe SD worked closely with the GESTAPO. An article in the “_Voelkischer\r\nBeobachter_” published in _Das Archiv_, January 1936, stated:\r\n\r\n    “As the Secret State Police can not carry out, in addition to\r\n    its primary executive tasks, this observation of the enemies of\r\n    the state, to the extent necessary, there steps alongside to\r\n    supplement it the Security Service of the Reichsleader of the\r\n    SS, set up by the Deputy Fuehrer as the political intelligence\r\n    service of the movement, which puts a large part of the forces\r\n    of the movement mobilized by it into the service of the security\r\n    of the state.” (_1956-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _The Place of the GESTAPO and the SD in the Conspiracy._ The GESTAPO\r\nwas founded in April 1933 by Goering to serve as a political police\r\nforce in Prussia. Goering instructed Diels, the first Deputy Chief of\r\nthe GESTAPO, that his main task would be the elimination of political\r\nopponents of National Socialism and the fight against Communism.\r\n(_2460-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn “_Aufbau Einer Nation_,” published in 1934, Goering said:\r\n\r\n    “For weeks I had been working personally on the reorganization\r\n    and at last I alone and upon my own decision and my own\r\n    reflection created the office of the Secret State Police. This\r\n    instrument which is so feared by the enemies of the State, has\r\n    contributed most to the fact that today there can no longer be\r\n    talk of a Communist and Marxist danger in Germany and Prussia.”\r\n    (_2344-PS_)\r\n\r\nSo effective had the GESTAPO proven itself in combatting the political\r\nopposition to National Socialism by the fall of 1933 that Goering took\r\nover direct control of the GESTAPO (_2105-PS_). Goering’s position as\r\nChief of the GESTAPO in Prussia was recognized by Himmler even after he\r\nbecame Chief of the German Police in 1936 (_2372-PS_). Even as late as\r\nDecember 1938 Goering continued to exercise his direct control over the\r\nPrussian GESTAPO. (_D-183_)\r\n\r\nHimmler was named Deputy Chief of the GESTAPO in Prussia in 1934. He\r\nused the GESTAPO, infused with new personnel recruited in large part\r\nfrom the SS, to carry out the Roehm purge of 30 June 1934. (_2460-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO, through its great power of arrest and confinement to\r\nconcentration camps without recourse to law, was the principal means for\r\neliminating enemies of the Nazi regime. Diels, the former Deputy Chief\r\nof the GESTAPO under Goering, declared:\r\n\r\n    “* * * From (1934) on the GESTAPO is responsible for all\r\n    deprivations of freedom and breaches of law and killings in the\r\n    political field which took place without court verdict. Of\r\n    primary importance among these was the shooting of numerous\r\n    persons who had been committed to jails by the courts and then\r\n    shot supposedly because of resistance. Many such cases were at\r\n    that time published in the papers. For people guilty of\r\n    immorality such illegal shootings became the rule. As for\r\n    deprivation of freedom, there was no legal reason any more for\r\n    protective custody orders after 1934, which had still been the\r\n    case before that date, since from 1934 on the power of the\r\n    totalitarian state was so stabilized that the arrest of a person\r\n    for his own protection was only an excuse for arbitrary\r\n    arrest—without court verdict and without legal measures for\r\n    him. The terroristic measures, which led to the development of\r\n    the pure force system and punished to an increasing degree each\r\n    critical remark and each impulse of freedom with the\r\n    concentration camp, took on more and more arbitrary and cruel\r\n    forms. The GESTAPO became the symbol of the regime of force.”\r\n    (_2460-PS_)\r\n\r\n          D. _Criminal Responsibility of the Gestapo and SD._\r\n\r\nIn the remainder of this section the criminal responsibility of the\r\nGESTAPO and the SD will be considered with respect to certain crimes\r\nagainst the peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity which were in\r\nprincipal part committed by the centralized political police system the\r\ndevelopment and organization of which has previously been considered. In\r\nsome instances the crimes were committed in cooperation or conjunction\r\nwith other groups and organizations.\r\n\r\nFrequent reference will be made to the phrase, “SIPO and SD.” The SIPO\r\nand SD was composed of the following organizations,—the GESTAPO, the\r\nKRIPO and the SD.\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO was the largest of these, having a membership of about\r\n40,000 or 50,000 in 1943-45. It was the political police force of the\r\nReich. Much of its personnel consisted of transferees from former\r\npolitical police forces of the States. Membership in the GESTAPO was\r\nvoluntary.\r\n\r\nThe KRIPO was second largest, having a membership of about 15,000 in\r\n1943-45. It was the criminal police force of the Reich.\r\n\r\nThe SD was the smallest, having a membership of about 3,000 in 1943-45.\r\nIt was the intelligence service of the SS. Membership in the SD was\r\nvoluntary. (_3033-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn common usage, and even in orders and decrees, the term “SD” was used\r\nas an abbreviation in the term “SIPO and SD.” Since the GESTAPO was the\r\nprimary executive agency of the SIPO and SD, and by far the largest, in\r\nmost such cases the actual executive action was carried out by personnel\r\nof the GESTAPO rather than of the SD or of the KRIPO. In occupied\r\nterritories members of the GESTAPO frequently wore SS uniforms.\r\n(_3033-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe term “Chief of the Security Police and SD” describes the person who\r\nis the head of the GESTAPO, KRIPO and the SD, and of their headquarters\r\noffice called the RSHA. The “Chief of the Security Police and SD” and\r\nthe “head of the RSHA” are always one and the same person. The RSHA was\r\na department in the Reich Ministry of the Interior and in the SS.\r\nSometimes organizational responsibility can be established by the fact\r\nthat the orders in question were issued by or submitted to _Amt_ III of\r\nthe RSHA (in which case the action concerned the SD), to _Amt_ IV of the\r\nRSHA (in which case the action concerned the GESTAPO), or to _Amt_ V of\r\nthe RSHA (in which case the action concerned the KRIPO).\r\n\r\nAlthough the GESTAPO was the chief executive agency in the political\r\npolice system, all three organizations contributed to the accomplishment\r\nof most of the criminal activities discussed hereinafter.\r\n\r\n          E. _Crimes of the GESTAPO and SD against the Peace._\r\n\r\nPrior to the invasion of Poland by Germany, “border incidents” were\r\nfabricated by the GESTAPO and SD for the purpose of furnishing Hitler\r\nwith an excuse to wage war. (_2751-PS_)\r\n\r\nEarly in August, 1939, the plan was conceived by the Chief of the\r\nSecurity Police and SD, Heydrich, to stage simulated border raids by\r\npersonnel of the GESTAPO and SD dressed as Poles. To add authenticity,\r\nit was planned to take certain prisoners from concentration camps, kill\r\nthem by use of hypodermic injections, and leave their bodies, clad in\r\nPolish uniforms, at the various places where the incidents were planned\r\nto occur. The Chief of the GESTAPO, Mueller, took a directing hand in\r\nthese actions, which were staged on 31 August 1939 in Beuthen,\r\nHindenburg, Gleiwitz, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the SD agents who made the pretended attack on the\r\nGleiwitz radio station on 31 August, said:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In my presence, Mueller discussed with a man named\r\n    Mehlhorn plans for another border incident, in which it should\r\n    be made to appear that Polish soldiers were attacking German\r\n    troops. Germans in the approximate strength of a company were to\r\n    be used. Mueller stated that he had 12 or 13 condemned criminals\r\n    who were to be dressed in Polish uniforms and left dead on the\r\n    ground of the scene of the incident, to show that they had been\r\n    killed while attacking. For this purpose they were to be given\r\n    fatal injections by a doctor employed by Heydrich. Then they\r\n    were also to be given gunshot wounds. After the incident members\r\n    of the press and other persons were to be taken to the spot of\r\n    the incident. A police report was subsequently to be prepared.\r\n\r\n    “4. Mueller told me that he had an order from Heydrich to make\r\n    one of those criminals available to me for the action at\r\n    Gleiwitz. The code name by which he referred to these criminals\r\n    was ‘Canned Goods.’\r\n\r\n    “5. The incident at Gleiwitz in which I participated was carried\r\n    out on the evening preceding the German attack on Poland. As I\r\n    recall, war broke out on the 1st of September 1939. At noon of\r\n    the 31st August I received by telephone from Heydrich the code\r\n    word for the attack which was to take place at 8 o’clock that\r\n    evening. Heydrich said, ‘In order to carry out this attack\r\n    report to Mueller for Canned Goods.’ I did this and gave Mueller\r\n    instructions to deliver the man near the radio station. I\r\n    received this man and had him laid down at the entrance to the\r\n    station. He was alive but he was completely unconscious. I tried\r\n    to open his eyes. I could not recognize by his eyes that he was\r\n    alive, only by his breathing. I did not see the shot wounds but\r\n    a lot of blood was smeared across his face. He was in civilian\r\n    clothes.\r\n\r\n    “6. We seized the radio station as ordered, broadcast a speech\r\n    of three to four minutes over an emergency transmitter, fired\r\n    some pistol shots and left.” (_2751-PS_; _2479-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese were the “frontier incidents” to which Hitler referred in his\r\nspeech to the Reichstag on 1 September 1939. (Adolf Hitler, “My New\r\nOrder,” Reynal and Hitchcock, Inc., 1941, p. 687.)\r\n\r\n                 F. _War Crimes of the GESTAPO and SD._\r\n\r\n(1) _The GESTAPO and SD carried out mass murders of hundreds of\r\nthousands of civilians of occupied countries as a part of the Nazi\r\nprogram to exterminate political and racial undesirables (“Einsatz\r\nGroups”)._ About four weeks before the attack on Russia, special task\r\nforces of the SIPO and SD, called _Einsatzgruppen_ or Special Task\r\nGroups, were formed on order of Himmler for the purpose of following the\r\nGerman armies into Russia, combatting partisans and members of\r\nresistance groups and exterminating the Jews and Communist leaders. In\r\nthe beginning four _Einsatz_ Groups were formed. _Einsatz_ Group A,\r\noperating in the Baltic States, was placed under the command of\r\nStahlecker, former Inspector of the SIPO and SD. _Einsatz_ Group B,\r\noperating toward Moscow, was placed under the command of Nebe, the Chief\r\nof _Amt_ V (KRIPO) of the RSHA. _Einsatz_ Group C, operating toward\r\nKiev, was placed under the command of Rasch and later of Thomas, former\r\nChief of the SIPO and SD in Paris. _Einsatz_ Group D, operating in the\r\nsouth of Russia, was placed under the command of Ohlendorf, the Chief of\r\n_Amt_ III (SD) of the RSHA.\r\n\r\nThe _Einsatz_ Groups were officered by personnel of the GESTAPO, the SD\r\nand the KRIPO. The men were drawn from the Order Police and the Waffen\r\nSS. The groups had complements of 400 to 500 men, and had their own\r\nvehicles and equipment. By agreement with the OKW and OKH, the\r\n_Einsatzkommandos_ were attached to certain Army corps or divisions. The\r\nArmy assigned the area in which the _Einsatzkommandos_ were to operate,\r\nbut all operational directives and orders for the carrying out of\r\nexecutions were given through the RSHA in Berlin. Regular courier\r\nservice and radio communications existed between the _Einsatz_ Groups\r\nand the RSHA.\r\n\r\nThe affidavit of Ohlendorf, Chief of the SD, who led _Einsatz_ Group D,\r\nreads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “When the German Army invaded Russia, I was leader of\r\n    _Einsatzgruppe_ D in the southern sector, and in the course of\r\n    the year during which I was leader of the _Einsatzgruppe_ D, it\r\n    liquidated approximately 90,000 men, women and children. The\r\n    majority of those liquidated were Jews, but there were also\r\n    among them some Communist functionaries.\r\n\r\n    “In the execution of this extermination program the\r\n    _Einsatzgruppen_ were subdivided into _Einsatzkommandos_, and\r\n    the _Einsatzkommandos_ into still smaller units, the so-called\r\n    _Sonderkommando_ and _Teilkommandos_. Usually the smaller units\r\n    were led by a member of the SD, the GESTAPO or the KRIPO. The\r\n    unit selected for this task would enter a village or city and\r\n    order the prominent Jewish citizens to call together all Jews\r\n    for the purpose of resettlement. They were asked to hand over\r\n    their personal belongings to the leaders of the unit, and\r\n    shortly before the execution, to surrender their outer clothing.\r\n    The men, women and children were led to a place of execution\r\n    which usually was located beside a deepened antitank ditch. Then\r\n    they were shot, kneeling or standing, and the corpses were\r\n    thrown into the ditch. I never permitted the shooting by\r\n    individuals in Group D, but ordered that several of the men\r\n    should shoot at the same time in order to avoid direct personal\r\n    responsibility. The leaders of the unit, or especially\r\n    designated persons, however, had to fire the last shot against\r\n    those victims who were not dead immediately. I learned from\r\n    conversations with other group leaders that some of them asked\r\n    the victims to lie down flat on the ground to be shot through\r\n    the neck. I did not approve of these methods.” (_2620-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe contention that these murders were carried out by subterfuge and\r\nwithout force and terror is belied by the eyewitness account of two such\r\nmass murders witnessed by Hermann Graebe, who was manager and engineer\r\nin charge of the branch office of the Solingen firm of Josef Jung in\r\nSdolbunow, Ukraine, from September 1941 until January 1944. Graebe’s\r\ninterest in the mass executions derived from the fact that in addition\r\nto Poles, Germans, and Ukrainians, he employed Jews on the various\r\nconstruction projects under his supervision. He was personally\r\nacquainted with the leader of the SIPO and SD who carried out the\r\nactions hereinafter described with the aid of SS-men (most of whom wore\r\nthe SD arm-band) and Ukrainian militia. Graebe negotiated with SS-major\r\nPutz, the leader of the SIPO and SD, for the release of about 100 Jewish\r\nworkers from the action which took place in Rowno on 13 July 1942. The\r\noriginal letter which exempted these Jewish workers from the action is\r\nattached to Graebe’s affidavit, which states in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In the evening of this day I drove to Rowno and posted myself\r\n    with Fritz Einsporn in front of the house in the Bahnhofstrasse\r\n    in which the Jewish workers of my firm slept. Shortly after\r\n    22.00 the ghetto was encircled by a large SS detachment and\r\n    again about three times as many members of the Ukrainian\r\n    militia. Then the electric floodlights which had been erected\r\n    all around the ghetto were switched on. SS and militia details\r\n    of 4 to 6 members entered or at least tried to enter the houses.\r\n    Where the doors and windows were closed and the inhabitants did\r\n    not open upon the knocking, the SS men and militia broke the\r\n    windows, forced the doors and beams with crowbars and entered\r\n    the dwellings. The owners were driven onto the street just as\r\n    they were, regardless of whether they were dressed or whether\r\n    they had been in bed. Since the Jews in most cases refused to\r\n    leave their dwellings and resisted, the SS and militia both\r\n    applied force. With the help of whippings, kicks and hits with\r\n    the rifle butts they finally succeeded in having the dwellings\r\n    evacuated. The people were chased out of their houses in such\r\n    haste that the small children who had been in bed had been left\r\n    behind in several instances. In the street women cried out for\r\n    their children and children for their parents. That did not\r\n    prevent the SS from chasing the people along the road, at double\r\n    time, and hitting them until they reached a waiting freight\r\n    train. Car after car was filled, over it hung the screaming of\r\n    women and children, the cracking of whips and rifle shots. Since\r\n    several families and groups had barricaded themselves in\r\n    especially strong buildings, and the doors could not be forced\r\n    with crowbars or beams, these houses were now blown open with\r\n    hand grenades. Since the ghetto was near the railroad tracks in\r\n    Rowno, the younger people tried to get across the tracks and to\r\n    a small river to be outside of the ghetto. This sector being\r\n    outside of the floodlights was lighted by signal ammunition. All\r\n    through the night these beaten, chased and wounded people\r\n    dragged themselves across the lighted streets. Women carried\r\n    their dead children in their arms, children hugged and dragged\r\n    by their arms and feet their dead parents down the road toward\r\n    the train. Again and again the calls ‘Open the door,’ ‘Open the\r\n    door’ echoed through the ghetto.” (_2992-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe leader of _Einsatz_ Group D, Ohlendorf, stated in his affidavit that\r\nother _Einsatz_ Group leaders required the victims to lie down flat on\r\nthe ground to be shot through the neck. Graebe describes a mass\r\nexecution of this kind which he observed carried out under the direction\r\nof a man in SD uniform on 5 October 1943 at Dubno, Ukraine, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Thereupon in the company of Moennikes I drove to the\r\n    construction area and saw in its vicinity a heap of earth, about\r\n    30 meters long and 2 meters high. Several trucks stood in front\r\n    of the heap. Armed Ukrainian militia chased the people off the\r\n    trucks under the supervision of an SS man. The militia men were\r\n    guards on the trucks and drove them to and from the excavation.\r\n    All these people had the prescribed yellow badges on the front\r\n    and back of their clothes, and thus were recognized as Jews.\r\n\r\n    “Moennikes and I went directly to the excavation. Nobody\r\n    bothered us. Now we heard shots in quick succession from behind\r\n    one of the earth mounds. The people who had gotten off the\r\n    trucks—men, women, and children of all ages—had to undress\r\n    upon the orders of an SS man who carried a riding or dog whip.\r\n    They had to put down their clothes in fixed places, sorted\r\n    according to shoes, over and underclothing, I saw a pile of\r\n    shoes of about 800 to 1,000 pairs, great piles of laundry and\r\n    clothing. Without screaming or crying these people undressed,\r\n    stood around by families, kissed each other, said farewells and\r\n    waited for the nod of another SS man, who stood near the\r\n    excavation, also with a whip in his hand. During the 15 minutes\r\n    that I stood near the excavation I have heard no complaint and\r\n    no request for mercy. I watched a family of about 8 persons, a\r\n    man and a woman, both about 50 with their children of about 1, 8\r\n    and 10, and two grown-up daughters of about 20 to 24. An old\r\n    woman with snow-white hair held the one-year-old child in her\r\n    arms and sang for it, and tickled it. The child was squeaking\r\n    from joy. The couple looked on with tears in their eyes. The\r\n    father held the hand of a boy about 10 years old and spoke to\r\n    him softly; the boy was fighting his tears. The father pointed\r\n    toward the sky, fondled his hand, and seemed to explain\r\n    something to him. At that moment the SS-man at the excavation\r\n    called something to his comrades. The latter counted off about\r\n    20 persons and instructed them to walk behind the earth mound.\r\n    Among them was the family which I had mentioned. I remember very\r\n    well a girl, blackhaired and slender, passing near me; she\r\n    pointed at herself and said, ‘23 years.’ I walked around the\r\n    mound, and stood in front of a tremendous grave. Closely pressed\r\n    together the people were lying on top of each other so that only\r\n    their heads were visible. Several of the people shot still\r\n    moved. Some lifted their arms and turned their heads to show\r\n    that they were still alive. The excavation was already\r\n    two-thirds full. I estimated that it contained about 1,000\r\n    people. I looked for the man who did the shooting. I saw an\r\n    SS-man who sat at the rim of the narrow end of the excavation,\r\n    his feet dangling into the excavation. On his knees he had a\r\n    machine pistol and he was smoking a cigarette. The completely\r\n    naked people descended a stairway which was dug into the clay of\r\n    the excavation and slipped over the heads of the people lying\r\n    there already to the place to which the SS-man directed them.\r\n    They laid themselves in front of the dead or injured people,\r\n    some touched tenderly those who were still alive and spoke to\r\n    them in a low voice. Then I heard a number of shots. I looked\r\n    into the excavation and saw how the bodies jerked or the heads\r\n    rested already motionless on top of the bodies that lay before\r\n    them. Blood was running from their necks. I was surprised that I\r\n    was not chased away, but I saw there were two or three postal\r\n    officers in uniform nearby. Now already the next group\r\n    approached, descended into the excavation, lined themselves up\r\n    against the previous victims and was shot. When I walked back,\r\n    around the mound, I noticed again a transport which had just\r\n    arrived. This time it included sick and frail persons. An old,\r\n    very thin woman with terribly thin legs was undressed by others\r\n    who were already naked, while two persons held her up.\r\n    Apparently the woman was paralyzed. The naked people carried the\r\n    woman around the mound. I left with Moennikes and drove with my\r\n    car back to Dubno.” (_2992-PS_)\r\n\r\nThere are two reports by Stahlecker, the Chief of _Einsatz_ Group B,\r\navailable. The first report, found in Himmler’s personal files, states\r\nthat during the first four months of the Russian campaign _Einsatz_\r\nGroup A murdered 135,000 Communists and Jews, and carried out widespread\r\ndestruction of homes and villages and other vast crimes. Enclosure 8 to\r\nthis Stahlecker report is a careful survey of the number of persons\r\nmurdered, classified as to country, and whether Jew or Communist, with\r\ntotals given in each instance. This report discloses that the _Einsatz_\r\nGroups frequently enlisted the aid of the local populations in the\r\nextermination program. It states:\r\n\r\n    “In view of the extension of the area of operations and the\r\n    great number of duties which had to be performed by the Security\r\n    Police, it was intended from the very beginning to obtain the\r\n    cooperation of the reliable population for the fight against\r\n    vermin—that is, mainly the Jews and Communists.” (_L-180_)\r\n\r\nWith respect to extermination of Jews the report stated:\r\n\r\n    “From the beginning it was to be expected that the Jewish\r\n    problem could not be solved by pogroms alone. In accordance with\r\n    the basic orders received, however, the cleansing activities of\r\n    the Security Police had to aim at a complete annihilation of the\r\n    Jews. Special detachments reinforced by selected units—in\r\n    Lithuania partisan detachments, in Latvia units of the Latvian\r\n    auxiliary police—therefore performed extensive executions both\r\n    in towns and in rural areas. The actions of the execution\r\n    detachments were performed smoothly. * * *”\r\n\r\nEnclosure 8, “Survey of the number of executed persons” is quoted\r\ndirectly from the report:\r\n\r\n        “_Enclosure 8—Survey of the number of executed persons_\r\n\r\n                  Area                  │   Jews   │Communists│  Total\r\n“Lithuania:                             │          │          │\r\nKowono town and surroundings            │          │          │\r\n    (land)                              │    31,914│        80│    31,994\r\n    Schaulen                            │    41,382│       763│    42,145\r\n    Wilna                               │     7,015│        17│     7,032\r\n                                        │     —————│     —————│     —————\r\n                                        │    80,311│       860│    81,171\r\n                                        │==========│==========│==========\r\n“Latvia:                                │          │          │\r\n    Riga town and surroundings          │          │          │\r\n    (land)                              │          │          │     6,378\r\n    Mitau                               │          │          │     3,576\r\n    Libau                               │          │          │    11,860\r\n    Wolmar                              │          │          │       209\r\n    Dueanaburg                          │     9,256│       589│     9,845\r\n                                        │     —————│     —————│     —————\r\n                                        │    30,025│     1,843│    31,868\r\n                                        │==========│==========│==========\r\n“Esthonia                               │       474│       684│     1,158\r\n                                        │==========│==========│==========\r\n“White Ruthenia                         │     7,620│          │     7,620\r\n                                        │==========│==========│==========\r\n“Total:                                 │          │          │\r\n    Lithuania                           │    80,311│       860│    81,171\r\n    Latvia                              │    30,025│     1,843│    31,868\r\n    Esthonia                            │       474│       684│     1,158\r\n    White Ruthenia                      │     7,620│          │     7,620\r\n                                        │     —————│     —————│     —————\r\n                                        │   118,430│     3,387│   121,817\r\n\r\n“to be added to these figures:\r\nIn Lithuania and Latvia Jews annihilated by pogroms                  5,500\r\nJews, Communists and partisans executed in old-Russian area          2,000\r\nLunatics executed                                                      748\r\n                                                                      ————\r\n                                                                   122,455\r\nCommunists and Jews liquidated by State Police and Security\r\n  Service Tilsit during search actions                               5,502\r\n                                                                      ————\r\n                                                                  135,567”\r\n(_L-180_)\r\n\r\nThe second report from _Einsatz_ Group A (_L-180_) reports the\r\nextermination of nearly 230,000 persons. With respect to Esthonia, it\r\nstates in part:\r\n\r\n    “Only by the SIPO and SD were the Jews gradually executed as\r\n    they became no longer required for work. Today there are no\r\n    longer any Jews in Esthonia.”\r\n\r\nWith respect to Latvia, the report states in part:\r\n\r\n    “Up to October 1941 approximately 30,000 Jews had been executed\r\n    by these _Sonderkommandos_. The remaining Jews who were still\r\n    indispensable from the economic point of view were collected in\r\n    Ghettos, which were established in Riga, Duenaburg and Libau.”\r\n\r\nWith respect to Lithuania, the report states in part:\r\n\r\n    “Therefore by means of selected units—mostly in the proportion\r\n    of 1:8—first of all the prisons, and then systematically,\r\n    district by district, the Lithuanian sector was cleansed of Jews\r\n    of both sexes. Altogether 136,421 people were liquidated in a\r\n    great number of single actions. As the complete liquidation of\r\n    the Jews was not feasible, as they were needed for labor,\r\n    Ghettos were formed which at the moment are occupied as follows:\r\n    Kauen approximately 15,000 Jews; Wilna approximately 15,000\r\n    Jews; Schaulen approximately 4,500 Jews. These Jews are used\r\n    primarily for work of military importance. For example, up to\r\n    5,000 Jews are employed in 3 shifts on the aerodrome near Kauen\r\n    on earthworks and work of that sort.”\r\n\r\nWith respect to White Russia, the report states in part:\r\n\r\n    “In view of the enormous distances, the bad condition of the\r\n    roads, the shortage of vehicles and petrol, and the small forces\r\n    of Security Police and SD, it needs the utmost effort to be able\r\n    to carry out shootings in the country. Nevertheless 41,000 Jews\r\n    have been shot up to now.”\r\n\r\nWith respect to Jews from the Reich, the report states in part\r\n\r\n    “Since December 1940 transports containing Jews have arrived at\r\n    short intervals from the Reich. Of these, 20,000 Jews were\r\n    directed to Riga and 7,000 Jews to Minsk. Only a small section\r\n    of the Jews from the Reich is capable of working. About 70-80\r\n    percent are women and children or old people unfit for work. The\r\n    death rate is rising continually also as a result of the\r\n    extraordinarily bad winter. In isolated instances sick Jews with\r\n    contagious disease were selected under the pretext of putting\r\n    them into a home for the aged or a hospital, and executed.”\r\n\r\nAttached as an enclosure to this report is a map entitled “Jewish\r\nExecutions Carried out by _Einsatzgruppe_ A,” on which, by the use of\r\ncoffins as symbols, the number of Jews murdered in each area covered by\r\n_Einsatz_ Group A is shown (_Chart Number 4_). The map shows thousands\r\nof Jews in ghettos, and an estimated 128,000 Jews “still on hand” in the\r\nMinsk area. Number of murdered, according to figures beside the coffins,\r\nduring the period covered by this report, was 228,050.\r\n\r\nOn 30 October 1941 the Commissioner of the territory of Sluzk wrote a\r\nreport to the Commissioner General, Minsk, in which he severely\r\ncriticized the actions of the _Einsatzkommandos_ operating in his area\r\nfor the murder of all the Jews of Sluzk:\r\n\r\n    “On 27 October in the morning at about 8 o’clock a first\r\n    lieutenant of the police battalion No. 11 from Kauen (Lithuania)\r\n    appeared and introduced himself as the adjutant of the battalion\r\n    commander of the security police. The first lieutenant explained\r\n    that the police battalion had received the assignment to effect\r\n    the liquidation of all Jews here in the town of Sluzk, within\r\n    two days. The battalion commander with his battalion in strength\r\n    of four companies, two of which were made up of Lithuanian\r\n    partisans, was on the march here and the action would have to\r\n    begin instantly. I replied to the first lieutenant that I had to\r\n    discuss the action in any case first with the commander. About\r\n    half an hour later the police battalion arrived in Sluzk.\r\n    Immediately after the arrival the conference with the battalion\r\n    commander took place according to my request. I first explained\r\n    to the commander that it would not very well be possible to\r\n    effect the action without previous preparation, because\r\n    everybody had been sent to work and that it would lead to\r\n    terrible confusion. At least it would have been his duty to\r\n    inform me a day ahead of time. Then I requested him to postpone\r\n    the action one day. However, he rejected this with the remark\r\n    that he had to carry out this action everywhere and in all towns\r\n    and that only two days were allotted for Sluzk. Within these two\r\n    days, the town of Sluzk had to be cleared of Jews by all means.\r\n    For the rest, as regards the execution of the action, I must\r\n    point out to my deepest regret that the latter bordered already\r\n    on sadism. The town itself offered a picture of horror during\r\n    the action. With indescribable brutality on the part of both the\r\n    German police officers and particularly the Lithuanian\r\n    partisans, the Jewish people, but also among them White\r\n    Ruthenians, were taken out of their dwellings and herded\r\n    together. Everywhere in the town shots were to be heard and in\r\n    different streets the corpses of shot Jews accumulated. The\r\n    White Ruthenians were in greatest distress to free themselves\r\n    from the encirclement. Regardless of the fact that the Jewish\r\n    people, among whom were also tradesmen, were mistreated in a\r\n    terribly barbarous way in the face of the White Ruthenian\r\n    people, the White Ruthenians themselves were also worked over\r\n    with rubber clubs and rifle butts. There was no question of an\r\n    action against the Jews any more. It rather looked like a\r\n    revolution. In conclusion I find myself obliged to point out\r\n    that the police battalion has looted in an unheard of manner\r\n    during the action, and that not only in Jewish houses but just\r\n    the same in those of the White Ruthenians. Anything of use such\r\n    as boots, leather, cloth, gold and other valuables, has been\r\n    taken away. On the basis of statements of members of the armed\r\n    forces, watches were torn off the arms of Jews in public, on the\r\n    streets, and rings were pulled off the fingers in the most\r\n    brutal manner. A major of the finance department reported that a\r\n    Jewish girl was asked by the police to obtain immediately 5,000\r\n    rubles to have her father released. This girl is said to have\r\n    actually gone everywhere in order to obtain the money.”\r\n    (_1104-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis report was submitted by the Commissioner General of White Ruthenia\r\nto the Reich Commissioner for the Eastern Territories on 1 November 1941\r\nwith the following comment:\r\n\r\n    “I am submitting this report in duplicate so that one copy may\r\n    be forwarded to the Reich Minister. Peace and order cannot be\r\n    maintained in White Ruthenia with methods of that sort. To bury\r\n    seriously wounded people alive who worked their way out of their\r\n    graves again is such a base and filthy act that the incidents as\r\n    such should be reported to the Fuehrer and Reichs Marshal.”\r\n    (_1104-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn the same date by separate letter the Commissioner General of White\r\nRuthenia reported to the Reich Commissioner for the Eastern Territories\r\nthat he had received money, valuables, and other objects taken by the\r\npolice in the action at Sluzk and other regions, all of which had been\r\ndeposited with the Reich Credit institute for the disposal of the Reich\r\nCommissioner. (_1104-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 21 November 1941 a report on the Sluzk incident was sent to the\r\npersonal reviewer of the permanent deputy of the Minister of the Reich\r\nwith a copy to Heydrich, the Chief of the Security Police and SD.\r\n(_1104-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 6 November 1942 a secret report submitted to the Reich Commissar for\r\nthe East concerning the struggle against partisans in the East discloses\r\nthat destruction of villages continued, and reports the execution of\r\n1,274 partisan suspects and 8,350 Jews, and the deportation of 1,217\r\npeople. This report was forwarded on 10 December 1942 to the Reich\r\nMinister for the occupied Eastern territories. (_1113-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe report from the prison administrator at Minsk as of 31 May 1943 to\r\nthe General Commissioner for White Ruthenia states:\r\n\r\n    “The German, former dentist Ernst Israel Tichauer and his wife\r\n    Elisa Sara Tichauer, born Rosenthal, were delivered to the\r\n    Court-Prison by the SD (_Hauptscharfuehrer_ Rube) on 13 April\r\n    1943. Since that date, the golden bridgework, crowns and\r\n    fillings of the received German and Russian Jews were pulled\r\n    out, respectively broken out by force. This always happened 1-2\r\n    hours before the actions in question.\r\n\r\n    “Since 13 April 1943, 516 German and Russian Jews were\r\n    liquidated. After careful investigation it was ascertained that\r\n    gold objects were only taken away during 2 actions, namely on 14\r\n    April 43 from 172 and on 27 April 43 from 164 Jews. About 50\r\n    percent of the Jews had gold teeth, bridges or fillings.\r\n    _Hauptscharfuehrer_ Rube of the SD was always present in person,\r\n    and also took the gold objects with him.\r\n\r\n    “This has not been done before 13 April 1943.”\r\n\r\nThis report was forwarded to the Reich Minister for the occupied Eastern\r\nterritories on 1 June 1943. (_R-135_)\r\n\r\nDeath vans were used by the _Einsatz_ Groups to murder victims by gas.\r\nThese vans were built by the Saurer Works in Berlin and other firms. The\r\nvans were built for the technical section of _Amt_ II of the RSHA, which\r\nsent them to the _Einsatz_ Groups in the field. They were first used in\r\nthe spring of 1942 and continued to be used throughout the war\r\n(_2348-PS_). The method of using the vans is described by Ohlendorf in\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n    “We received orders to use the car for the killing of women and\r\n    children. Whenever a unit had collected a sufficient number of\r\n    victims, a car was sent for their liquidation. We also stationed\r\n    these cars in the neighborhood of the transit camps to which the\r\n    victims had been brought. They were told that they would be\r\n    resettled and had to climb into the cars for that purpose. Then\r\n    the doors were closed and as soon as the cars started moving the\r\n    gas would enter. The victims died within ten to fifteen minutes.\r\n    The cars were driven to the burial place where the corpses were\r\n    taken out and buried.” (_2620-PS_)\r\n\r\nA letter from Becker, the operator of several death vans, written to\r\nRauff, the head of the technical section of _Amt_ II of the RSHA, on 16\r\nMay 1942, states:\r\n\r\n    “The overhauling of vans by groups D and C is finished. While\r\n    the vans of the first series can also be put into action if the\r\n    weather is not too bad the vans of the second series (Saurer)\r\n    stop completely in rainy weather. If it has rained for instance\r\n    for only one-half hour, the van cannot be used because it simply\r\n    skids away. It can only be used in absolutely dry weather. It is\r\n    only a question now whether the van can only be used standing at\r\n    the place of execution. First the van has to be brought to that\r\n    place, which is possible only in good weather. The place of\r\n    execution is usually 10-15 km away from the highways and is\r\n    difficult of access because of its location; in damp or wet\r\n    weather it is not accessible at all. If the persons to be\r\n    executed are driven or led to that place, then they realize\r\n    immediately what is going on and get restless, which is to be\r\n    avoided as far as possible. There is only one way left; to load\r\n    them at the collecting point and to drive them to the spot.\r\n\r\n    “I ordered the vans of group D to be camouflaged as\r\n    house-trailers by putting one set of window shutters on each\r\n    side of the small van and two on each side of the larger vans,\r\n    such as one often sees on farm-houses in the country. The vans\r\n    became so well-known, that not only the authorities but also the\r\n    civilian population called the van “death van”, as soon as one\r\n    of these vehicles appeared. It is my opinion that the van cannot\r\n    be kept secret for any length of time, not even camouflaged.\r\n\r\n    “* * * I should like to take this opportunity to bring the\r\n    following to your attention: several commands have had the\r\n    unloading after the application of gas done by their own men. I\r\n    brought to the attention of the commanders of those SK concerned\r\n    the immense psychological injuries and damages to their health\r\n    which that work can have for those men, even if not immediately,\r\n    at least later on. The men complained to me about headaches\r\n    which appeared after each unloading.\r\n\r\n    “* * * The application of gas usually is not undertaken\r\n    correctly. In order to come to an end as fast as possible, the\r\n    driver presses the accelerator to the fullest extent. By doing\r\n    that the persons to be executed suffer death from suffocation\r\n    and not death by dozing off as was planned. My directions now\r\n    have proved that by correct adjustment of the levers death comes\r\n    faster and the prisoners fall asleep peacefully. Distorted faces\r\n    and excretions, such as could be seen before, are no longer\r\n    noticed.” (_501-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe death vans were not always satisfactory. A telegram from the\r\ncommandant of the SIPO and SD “Ostland” to the RSHA, _Amt_ II D, on 15\r\nJune 1942, states:\r\n\r\n    “A transport of Jews, which has to be treated in a special way,\r\n    arrives weekly at the office of the commandant of the Security\r\n    Police and the Security Service of White Ruthenia.\r\n\r\n    “The three S-vans, which are there, are not sufficient for that\r\n    purpose. I request assignment of another S-van (5-tons). At the\r\n    same time I request the shipment of 20 gas-hoses for the three\r\n    S-vans on hand (2 Diamond, 1 Saurer), since the ones on hand are\r\n    leaky already.” (_501-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe reports of the various _Einsatz_ Groups were summarized at RSHA, and\r\nthe summaries were then distributed to the various sections interested,\r\nparticularly _Amt_ III (the SD), _Amt_ IV (the GESTAPO), and _Amt_ V\r\n(the KRIPO) (_2752-PS_). One such report covering the period 1-31\r\nOctober 1941 is entitled “Activity and Situation Report No. 6 of the\r\n_Einsatz_ Groups of the Security Police and the SD in the USSR”\r\n(_R-102_). This report describes in summary form the activities of the\r\nvarious _Einsatz_ Groups during the month of October 1941. The report\r\nfirst discusses the stations and in that regard states:\r\n\r\n    “During the period covered by this report the stations of the\r\n    Task Forces of the Security Police and the SD have changed only\r\n    in the Northern Sector.\r\n\r\n    “The present stations are:\r\n\r\n    “Task Force A: since 7 October 1941 Krasnowardeisk.\r\n\r\n    “Task Force B: continues in Smolensk.\r\n\r\n    “Task Force C: since 27 September 1941 in Kiew.\r\n\r\n    “Task Force D: since 27 September 1941 in Nikolajew.\r\n\r\n    “The Action and Special Commandos (_Einsatz und Sonder_\r\n    Commandos) which are attached to the Task Force continue on the\r\n    march with the advancing troops into the sectors which have been\r\n    assigned to them.” (_R-102_)\r\n\r\nThe report next discusses the activities of each _Einsatz_ Group. There\r\nis included first a discussion of the Baltic area, next of White\r\nRuthenia, and last of the Ukraine. Under each section the work of the\r\n_Einsatz_ Groups in connection with the action taken against partisans,\r\nJews, and communist officials is considered. With respect to the\r\ntreatment of Jews in the Baltic area the report states in part:\r\n\r\n    “* * * However, the Estonian Protective Corps (_Selbstschutz_),\r\n    formed at the time of the entry of the _Wehrmacht_, immediately\r\n    started a comprehensive arrest action of all Jews. This action\r\n    was under the direction of the task force of the Security Police\r\n    and the SD.\r\n\r\n    “The measures taken were:\r\n\r\n        1. Arrest of all male Jews over 16.\r\n\r\n        2. Arrest of all Jewesses from 16-20 years, who lived in\r\n        Reval and environs and were fit for work; these were\r\n        employed in peat cutting.\r\n\r\n        3. Comprehensive detention in the synagogue of all\r\n        Jewesses living in Dorport and its environs.\r\n\r\n        4. Arrest of the Jews and Jewesses fit for work in\r\n        Pernau and environs.\r\n\r\n        5. Registration of all Jews according to age, sex, and\r\n        capacity for work for the purpose of their detention in\r\n        a camp that is being prepared.\r\n\r\n    “The male Jews over 16 were executed with the exception of\r\n    doctors and the elders. At the present time this action is still\r\n    in progress. After completion of this action there will remain\r\n    only 500 Jewesses and children in the Eastern territory. * * *”\r\n    (_R-102_)\r\n\r\nWith respect to partisan activity in White Ruthenia, the report states\r\nin part:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In the village Michalowo, after careful reconnaissance\r\n    through civilian agents, 8 partisans were surprised in a house\r\n    by the same Commando of the Security Police and the SD, they\r\n    were arrested and hanged the next day in this particularly\r\n    partisan infested village.\r\n\r\n    “The president of the District Region Soviets in Tarenitsch and\r\n    his secretary were shot because of their connections with\r\n    partisans.\r\n\r\n    “During an action approximately 70 kilometers south of Mogilow,\r\n    25 Armenians, Kirghize and Mongols were apprehended with false\r\n    identification papers with which they tried to conceal the fact\r\n    that they belong to a partisan group.

A special\r\n    Commando in the period covered by this report executed 63\r\n    officials, NKVD agents and agitators. * * *” (_R-102_)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the action taken against the Jews in White Ruthenia the\r\nreport states in part:\r\n\r\n    “* * * All the more vigorous are the actions of the task forces\r\n    of the Security Police and the SD against the Jews who make it\r\n    necessary that steps be taken against them in different spheres.\r\n\r\n    “In Gorodnia 165 Jewish terrorists and in Tschernigow 19 Jewish\r\n    Communists were liquidated. 8 more Jewish communists were shot\r\n    at Beresna.\r\n\r\n    “It was experienced repeatedly that the Jewish women showed an\r\n    especially obstinate behaviour. For this reason 28 Jewesses had\r\n    to be shot in Krugoje and 337 at Mogilev.\r\n\r\n    “In Borissov 321 Jewish saboteurs and 118 Jewish looters were\r\n    executed.\r\n\r\n    “In Bobruisk 380 Jews were shot who had engaged to the last in\r\n    incitement and horror propaganda [_Hetz-und Greuelpropaganda_]\r\n    against the German army of occupation.\r\n\r\n    “In Tatarsk the Jews had left the Ghetto of their own accord and\r\n    returned to their old home quarters, attempting to expel the\r\n    Russians who had been quartered there in the meantime.

This\r\n    involved approximately 3000 Jews. * * *” (_R-102_)\r\n\r\nWith respect to partisan activity in the Ukraine the report states in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n    “Although partisan activity in the south sector is very strong\r\n    too, there is nevertheless the impression that spreading and\r\n    effective partisan activity are strongly affected by the flight\r\n    of higher partisan leaders and by the lack of initiative of the\r\n    subordinate leaders who have remained behind. Only in one case a\r\n    commando of the Security Police and the SD succeeded in a fight\r\n    with partisans in shooting the Secretary of the Communist Party\r\n    for the administration district of Nikolajew-Cherson, who was at\r\n    the time Commissar of a partisan group for the district\r\n    Nikolajew-Cherson-Krim. * * *” (_R-102_)\r\n\r\nWith respect to treatment of Jews in the Ukraine the report states in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n    “The embitterment of the Ukrainian population against the Jews\r\n    is extremely great because they are thought responsible for the\r\n    explosions in Kiew. They are also regarded as informers and\r\n    agents of the NKVD who started the terror against the Ukrainian\r\n    people. As a measure of retaliation for the arson at Kiew, all\r\n    Jews were arrested and altogether 33,771 Jews were executed on\r\n    the 29th and 30th September. Money, valuables and clothing were\r\n    secured and put at the disposal of the National-Socialist League\r\n    for Public Welfare (NSV) for the equipment of the National\r\n    Germans [_Volksdeutschen_] and partly put at the disposal of the\r\n    provisional city administration for distribution to the needy\r\n    population.\r\n\r\n    “_Shitomir_\r\n\r\n    “In Shitomir 3,145 Jews had to be shot, because from experience\r\n    they have to be regarded as bearers of Bolshevik propaganda and\r\n    saboteurs.\r\n\r\n    “_Cherson_\r\n\r\n    “In Cherson 410 Jews were executed as a measure of retaliation\r\n    for acts of sabotage. Especially in the area east of the Dnjepr\r\n    the solution of the Jewish question has been taken up\r\n    energetically by the task forces of the Security Police and the\r\n    SD. The areas newly occupied by the Commandos were purged of\r\n    Jews. In the course of this action 4,891 Jews were liquidated.\r\n    At other places the Jews were marked and registered. This\r\n    rendered it possible to put at the disposal of the _Wehrmacht_\r\n    for urgent labor, Jewish worker groups up to 1,000 persons.”\r\n    (_R-102_)\r\n\r\nThese reports, circulated among the various offices of the RSHA, brought\r\ngeneral knowledge to the entire organization of the program of mass\r\nmurder conducted by these special task forces of the SIPO and SD.\r\n(_R-102_)\r\n\r\nThe activities of the _Einsatz_ Groups continued throughout 1943 and\r\n1944 under Kaltenbrunner as Chief of the SIPO and SD. New groups were\r\nformed and sent into action in the West (_2890-PS_). Under adverse war\r\nconditions, however, the program of extermination was to a large extent\r\nchanged to one of rounding up slave labor for Germany. A letter written\r\non 19 March 1943 from the headquarters of a _Sonderkommando_ (section of\r\n_Einsatz_ Group C) states as follows:\r\n\r\n    “It is the task of the Security Police and of the Security\r\n    Service (SD) to discover all enemies of the Reich and fight\r\n    against them in the interest of security, and in the zone of\r\n    operations especially to guarantee the security of the army.\r\n    Besides the annihilation of active opponents all other elements\r\n    who, by virtue of their opinions or their past, may appear\r\n    active as enemies under favorable conditions, are to be\r\n    eliminated [_sind * * * auszumerzen_] through preventive\r\n    measures. The Security Police carries out this task according to\r\n    the general directives of the Fuehrer with all the required\r\n    toughness. Energetic measures are especially necessary in\r\n    territories endangered by the activity of hostile gangs. The\r\n    competence of the Security Police within the zone of operations\r\n    is based on the Barbarossa decrees. I deem the measures of the\r\n    Security Police, carried out on a considerable scale during\r\n    recent times, necessary for the two following reasons:\r\n\r\n    “1. The situation at the front in my sector had become so\r\n    serious that the population, partly influenced by Hungarians and\r\n    Italians, who streamed back in chaotic condition, took openly\r\n    position against us.\r\n\r\n    “2. The strong expeditions of hostile gangs, who came especially\r\n    from the forest of Bryansk, were another reason. Besides that,\r\n    other revolutionary groups, formed by the population, appeared\r\n    suddenly in all districts. The providing of arms evidently\r\n    provided no difficulties at all. It would have been\r\n    irresponsible, if we had observed this whole activity without\r\n    acting against it. It is obvious that all such measures bring\r\n    about some harshness. I want to take up the significant points\r\n    of harsh measures:\r\n\r\n        “1. The shooting of Hungarian Jews.\r\n\r\n        “2. The shooting of directors of collective farms.\r\n\r\n        “3. The shooting of children.\r\n\r\n        “4. The total burning down of villages.\r\n\r\n        “5. The “shooting, while trying to escape” of Security\r\n        Service (SD) prisoners.\r\n\r\n    “Chief of _Einsatz_ Group C confirmed once more the correctness\r\n    of the measures taken, and expressed his recognition for the\r\n    energetic actions.\r\n\r\n    “With regard to the current political situation, especially in\r\n    the armament industry in the fatherland, the measures of the\r\n    Security Police have to be subordinated to the greatest extent\r\n    to the recruiting of labor for Germany. In the shortest possible\r\n    time, the Ukraine has to put at the disposal of the armament\r\n    industry 1 million workers, 500 of whom have to be sent from our\r\n    territory daily.\r\n\r\n    “The work of the field groups has therefore to be changed as of\r\n    now. The following orders are given:\r\n\r\n    “1. Special treatment is to be limited to a minimum.\r\n\r\n    “2. The listing of communist functionaries, activists and so on,\r\n    is to take place by roster only for the time being, without\r\n    arresting anybody. It is, for instance, no longer feasible to\r\n    arrest all the close relatives of a member of the communist\r\n    party. Although, members of the Komsomolz are to be arrested\r\n    only if they were active in a leading position.\r\n\r\n    “3. The activity of the labor offices, respective of recruiting\r\n    commissions, is to be supported to the greatest extent possible.\r\n    It will not be possible always to refrain from using force.\r\n    During a conference with the Chief of the Labor Commitment\r\n    Staffs, an agreement was reached stating that wherever prisoners\r\n    can be released, they should be put at the disposal of the\r\n    Commissioner of the Labor Office. When searching [_Uberholung_]\r\n    villages, resp., when it has become necessary to burn down a\r\n    village, the whole population will be put at the disposal of the\r\n    Commissioner by force.\r\n\r\n    “4. As a rule, no more children will be shot.\r\n\r\n    “5. The reporting of hostile gangs as well as drives against\r\n    them is not affected hereby. All drives against these hostile\r\n    gangs can only take place after my approval has been obtained.\r\n\r\n    “6. The prisons have to be kept empty, as a rule. We have to be\r\n    aware of the fact that the Slavs will interpret all soft\r\n    treatment on our part as weakness and that they will act\r\n    accordingly right away. If we limit our harsh measures of\r\n    security police through above orders for the time being, that is\r\n    only done for the following reason. The most important thing is\r\n    the recruiting of workers. No check of persons to be sent into\r\n    the Reich will be made. No written certificates of political\r\n    reliability check or similar things will be issued.\r\n\r\n                                           “(signed) Christiansen.”\r\n                                                        (_3012-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe head of the Jewish section in the GESTAPO, and the man directly\r\nresponsible for carrying out the mass extermination program against the\r\nJews by the GESTAPO, _Obersturmbannfuehrer_ Eichmann, estimated in his\r\nreport to Himmler on the matter, that 2,000,000 Jews had been killed by\r\nshootings, mainly by the _Einsatz_ Groups of the SIPO and SD during the\r\ncampaign in the East.

He further said that the\r\n    political functionaries and commissars were not to be considered\r\n    as prisoners of war but were to be segregated from other\r\n    prisoners immediately after their capture and were to be turned\r\n    over to special detachments of the SD which were to accompany\r\n    the German troops to Russia. He further said that when it was\r\n    not possible to turn over the political functionaries and\r\n    commissars to the SD, they were to be eliminated by the German\r\n    troops.” (_2884-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the SD, Otto Ohlendorf, describes this action in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n    “In 1941, shortly after the start of the campaign against\r\n    Russia, an agreement was entered into between the Chief of the\r\n    Security Police and SD and the OKW and OKH to the effect that\r\n    the prisoner of war camps on the Eastern front should be opened\r\n    to _Einsatzkommandos_ of the SIPO and SD so that the prisoners\r\n    could be screened. All Jews and Communist functionaries were to\r\n    be taken from the prisoner of war camps by the\r\n    _Einsatzkommandos_ and executed outside the camps. To my\r\n    knowledge, this action was carried on throughout the entire\r\n    Russian campaign. In the other occupied territories and within\r\n    the Reich—to my knowledge—the GESTAPO had been made\r\n    responsible for this program in the Russian prisoner of war\r\n    camps. It was, to my knowledge, carried on throughout the\r\n    greater part of the war.” (_2622-PS_)\r\n\r\nLahousen, chief of a division in the office of foreign intelligence in\r\nthe _Wehrmacht_, states:\r\n\r\n    “* * * From the start of the campaign against the U.S.S.R. the\r\n    higher German political and military leadership followed the\r\n    policy of eliminating Russian commissars and various other types\r\n    of Russian prisoners of war captured by the _Wehrmacht_. In June\r\n    and July 1941 I participated in a conference which concerned\r\n    itself with the treatment of Russian commissars. * * *\r\n    Obergruppenfuehrer Mueller was present as representative of the\r\n    RSHA, and he participated in this matter because, as Chief of\r\n    Section IV, he was responsible for the carrying out of these\r\n    measures. Jointly with the SD and the GESTAPO he had the task of\r\n    instituting the necessary measures for the execution of\r\n    commissars. * * * In the discussion that followed, Mueller\r\n    promised in a peculiarly cynical manner that these executions\r\n    would take place in the future outside the camp, so that the\r\n    troops would not be obliged to watch them. He promised further a\r\n    certain limitation in the concept of ‘Bolshevistically\r\n    infected.’ This concept and its interpretation had been hitherto\r\n    left to the discretion of the SD _Sonderkommandos_. * * * An\r\n    agreement was concluded between the OKW, the GESTAPO and the SD.\r\n    Pursuant to this agreement Russian prisoners of war under the\r\n    control of the OKW were delivered to the GESTAPO and SD for\r\n    execution. The term ‘_Sonderbehandlung_’ in the official\r\n    documents and way of speaking of the SD was equivalent to\r\n    ‘condemned to death’.” (_2846-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 17 July 1941 instructions were issued by the GESTAPO to Commandos of\r\nthe SIPO and SD stationed in Stalags, providing in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The activation of commandos will take place in accordance with\r\n    the agreement of the Chief of the Security Police and Security\r\n    Service and the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces as of 16\r\n    July 1941 (see enclosure 1). The commandos will work\r\n    independently according to special authorization and in\r\n    consequence of the general regulations given to them, in the\r\n    limit of the camp organizations. Naturally, the commandos will\r\n    keep close contact with the camp-commander and the\r\n    defense-officers assigned to him.\r\n\r\n    “The mission of the commandos is the political investigating of\r\n    all camp-inmates, the elimination and further ‘treatment’\r\n\r\n    “_a._ of all political, criminal or in some other way unbearable\r\n    elements among them.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ of those persons who could be used for the reconstruction\r\n    of the occupied territories.\r\n\r\n    “The commandos must use for their work as far as possible, at\r\n    present and even later, the experiences of the camp-commanders\r\n    which the latter have collected meanwhile from observation of\r\n    the prisoners and examinations of camp inmates.\r\n\r\n    “Further, the commandos must make efforts from the beginning to\r\n    seek out among the prisoners elements which appear reliable,\r\n    regardless if there are communists concerned or not, in order to\r\n    use them for intelligence purposes inside of the camp and, if\r\n    advisable, later in the occupied territories also.\r\n\r\n    “By use of such informers and by use of all other existing\r\n    possibilities, the discovery of all elements to be eliminated\r\n    among the prisoners, must proceed step by step at once. * * *\r\n\r\n    “Above all, the following must be discovered: All important\r\n    functionaries of state and party, especially\r\n\r\n        Professional revolutionaries\r\n\r\n        Functionaries of the Komintern\r\n\r\n        All policy forming party functionaries of the KPdSU and\r\n        its fellow organizations in the central committees, in\r\n        the regional and district committees.\r\n\r\n        All peoples-commissars and their deputies\r\n\r\n        All former political commissars in the Red-Army\r\n\r\n        Leading personalities of the state-authorities of\r\n        central and middle regions.\r\n\r\n        The leading personalities of the business world.\r\n\r\n        Members of the Soviet-Russian intelligence\r\n\r\n        All Jews\r\n\r\n        All persons who are found to be agitators or fanatical\r\n        communists. * * *\r\n\r\n    “Executions are not to be held in the camp or in the immediate\r\n    vicinity of the camp.

(_1165-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 9 November 1941 Mueller issued a directive to all GESTAPO offices in\r\nwhich he ordered that diseased PWs should be excluded from the transport\r\ninto the concentration camps for execution. The letter began:\r\n\r\n    “The commandant of the concentration camps are complaining that\r\n    5 to 10 percent of the Soviet Russians destined for execution\r\n    are arriving in the camps dead or half dead. Therefore the\r\n    impression has arisen that the Stalags are getting rid of such\r\n    prisoners in this way. * * *” (_1165-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe affidavit of Kurt Lindow, former GESTAPO official, states:\r\n\r\n    “* * * 2. From 1941 until the middle of 1943 there was attached\r\n    to subsection IVA1 a special department that was headed by the\r\n    _Regierungsoberinspektor_, later _Regierungsamtmann_, and\r\n    _SS-Hauptsturmbannfuehrer_ Franz Koenigshaus. In this department\r\n    were handled matters concerning prisoners of war. I learned from\r\n    this department that instructions and orders by Reichsfuehrer\r\n    Himmler, dating from 1941 and 1942, existed according to which\r\n    captured Soviet Russian political Commissars and Jewish soldiers\r\n    were to be executed. As far as I know proposals for execution of\r\n    such PWs were received from the various PW camps. Koenigshaus\r\n    had to prepare the orders for execution and submitted them to\r\n    the chief of section IV, Mueller, for signature. These orders\r\n    were made out so that one order was to be sent to the agency\r\n    making the request and a second one to the concentration camp\r\n    designated to carry out the execution. The PWs in question were\r\n    at first formally released from PW status, then transferred to a\r\n    concentration camp for execution. * * *\r\n\r\n    “* * * 4.

Whether\r\nescaped British and American officers and nonworking NCOs, upon\r\nrecapture, should be handed over to the SIPO and SD was to be decided by\r\nthe High Command of the Army. In connection with this order, the Chief\r\nof the Security Police and SD (RSHA) issued instructions that the\r\nGESTAPO _Leitstellen_ should take over the escaped officers from the\r\ncamp commandants and transport them in accordance with a procedure\r\ntheretofore in force to the Mauthausen concentration camp. The camp\r\ncommandant was to be informed that the prisoners were being handed over\r\nunder the operation “_Kugel_”. On the journey the prisoners of war were\r\nto be placed in irons. The GESTAPO _Leitstellen_ were to make\r\nhalf-yearly reports, giving numbers only, of the handing over of\r\nprisoners of war. Escaped officer and nonworking NCO prisoners of war,\r\nwith the exception of British and Americans, recaptured by police\r\nstations were not to be handed back to the Stalag command. The Stalag\r\nwas to be informed of the recapture and asked to surrender them with the\r\nwords “_Stufe III_”. (_1650-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 27 July 1944 an order from the 6th Corps Area Command was issued on\r\nthe treatment of prisoners of war, which provided that prisoners of war\r\nwere to be discharged from prisoner-of-war status and transferred to the\r\nGESTAPO if they were guilty of crimes, had escaped and been recaptured,\r\nor refused to work or encouraged other prisoners not to work, or were\r\nscreened out by _Einsatzkommandos_ of the SIPO and SD, or were guilty of\r\nsabotage. No reports on transfers were required (_1514-PS_). This decree\r\nwas known as the “_Kugel Erlass_” (“Bullet Decree”). Prisoners of war\r\nsent to Mauthausen concentration camp under it were regarded as dead to\r\nthe outside world and were executed. (_2478-PS_; _2285-PS_.)\r\n\r\n(4) _The GESTAPO and SD were responsible for establishing and\r\nclassifying concentration camps, and for committing racial and political\r\nundesirables to concentration and annihilation camps for slave labor and\r\nmass murder._ The first concentration camps were established in 1933 at\r\nDachau in Bavaria and at Oranienburg in Prussia. The GESTAPO was given\r\nby law the responsibility of administering the concentration camps.\r\n(_2108-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO had the sole authority to take persons into protective\r\ncustody, and orders for protective custody were carried out in the State\r\nconcentration camps. (_1723-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO issued the orders establishing concentration camps,\r\ntransforming prisoner of war camps into concentration camps, designating\r\nconcentration camps as internment camps, changing labor camps into\r\nconcentration camps, setting up special sections for female prisoners,\r\nand so forth. (_D-50_; _D-46_.)\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Security Police and SD ordered the classification of\r\nconcentration camps according to the seriousness of the accusation and\r\nthe chances for reforming the prisoners from the Nazi viewpoint. The\r\nconcentration camps were classified as Classes I, II, or III. Class I\r\nwas for the least serious prisoners, and Class III for the most serious\r\nprisoners. (_1063-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nRegional offices of the GESTAPO had the authority to commit persons to\r\nconcentration camps for short periods, at first 21 days and later 56\r\ndays, but all other orders for protective custody had to be approved by\r\nthe GESTAPO headquarters in Berlin. Orders for protective custody issued\r\nby GESTAPO headquarters had to be signed by or on behalf of the Chief of\r\nthe Security Police and SD, at first Heydrich, later Kaltenbrunner.\r\n(_2477-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Security Police and SD had authority to fix the length\r\nof the period of custody. During the war it was the policy not to permit\r\nthe prisoners to know the period of custody and merely to announce the\r\nterm as “until further notice”. (_1531-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe local GESTAPO offices which made the arrests maintained a register\r\ncalled the “_Haftbuch_.” In this register the names of all persons\r\narrested were listed, together with personal data, grounds for the\r\narrest, and disposition. When orders were received from the GESTAPO\r\nheadquarters in Berlin to commit persons who had been arrested to\r\nconcentration camps, an entry was made in the _Haftbuch_ to that effect.\r\nThe reason assigned for the arrest and commitment of persons to\r\nconcentration camps usually was that, according to the GESTAPO, the\r\nperson endangered by his attitude the existence and security of the\r\npeople and the State. Further specifications of grounds included such\r\noffenses as that of “working against the Greater German Reich with an\r\nillegal resistance organization,” “being a Jew,” “suspected of working\r\nfor the detriment of the Reich,” “being strongly suspected of aiding\r\ndesertion,” “because as a relative of a deserter he is expected to take\r\nadvantage of every occasion to harm the German Reich,” “refusal to\r\nwork,” “sexual intercourse with a Pole,” “religious propaganda,”\r\n“working against the Reich,” “loafing on the job,” or “defeatist\r\nstatements.” Sometimes specification of the grounds simply referred to\r\nan “action,” under which a large number of persons would be arrested and\r\nsent to concentration camps. (_L-358_; _L-215_.)\r\n\r\nOn 16 December 1942, Mueller, Chief of the GESTAPO, reported that, in\r\nconnection with an increase in slave labor required by concentration\r\ncamps by 30 January 1943 the GESTAPO could round up 45,000 Jews,\r\nincluding invalids, aged, and children. The telegram stated:\r\n\r\n    “In accordance with the increased recruitment of manpower into\r\n    the concentration camps, which was ordered by 30 January 1943,\r\n    the following may be applied in the Jewish sector:\r\n\r\n    “1. Total amount: 45,000 Jews.\r\n\r\n    “2. Start of transportation 11 January 1943.\r\n\r\n    “3. Completion of transportation 31 January 1943.” (_1472-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 17 December 1942, Mueller issued an order to the _Kommandeurs_ and\r\n_Inspekteurs_ of the SIPO and SD and to the directors of the GESTAPO\r\nregional offices, in which he stated that Himmler, Reichsfuehrer SS and\r\nChief of the German Police, had given orders on 14 December 1942 that at\r\nleast 35,000 persons who were fit for work had to be put into\r\nconcentration camps not later than at the end of January. The order\r\nfurther provided that Eastern or foreign workers who had escaped or\r\nbroken the labor contracts were to be sent to the nearest concentration\r\ncamps as quickly as possible, and that inmates of detention rooms and\r\neducational work camps who were fit for work should be delivered to the\r\nnearest concentration camps. (_1063-D-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 23 March 1943, Mueller issued another directive referring to said\r\ndirective of 17 December 1942, in which he stated that measures are to\r\nbe carried out until 30 April ‘43. More explicit instructions were given\r\nas to which concentration camps the slave laborers were to be sent. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    “Care has to be taken that only prisoners who are fit for work\r\n    are sent to concentration camps, and adolescents only in\r\n    accordance with the provisions issued; otherwise, contrary to\r\n    the purpose, the concentration camps become overburdened.”\r\n    (_L-41_)\r\n\r\nOn 25 June 1943, Mueller issued an order stating that the decrees of 17\r\nDecember 1942 and of 23 March 1943 had achieved the intended goal.\r\n(_1063-E-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 21 April 1943, the Minister of Justice declared in a letter that the\r\nRSHA had ordered on 11 March 1943 that all Jews who were released from\r\nprison were to be handed over to the GESTAPO for lifelong detainment in\r\nthe concentration camps at Auschwitz and Lublin. Poles released after an\r\nimprisonment of over six months were to be transferred to the GESTAPO\r\nfor internment in a concentration camp for the duration of the war.\r\n(_701-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Jews and their shipment to annihilation camps was carried\r\nout under the direction of Eichmann, head of the section handling Jews\r\nin the Gestapo. Eichmann’s staff was composed of members of the SIPO,\r\nespecially the GESTAPO. The Jews were shipped on order of the SIPO and\r\nSD to annihilation camps in the East. Eichmann estimated, and so\r\nreported to Himmler, that 4,000,000 Jews were killed in the annihilation\r\ncamps in the East, in addition to the 2,000,000 Jews shot by the\r\n_Einsatz_ Groups. The extermination of Jews in the annihilation camps\r\nwas accomplished mainly after the beginning of 1943, during the time\r\nKaltenbrunner was the Chief of the Security Police and SD. (_2615-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _The GESTAPO and the SD participated in the deportation of citizens\r\nof occupied countries for forced labor and handled the disciplining of\r\nforced labor._ On 26 November 1942, Fritz Sauckel transmitted a letter\r\nto the president of provincial employment offices in which he stated\r\nthat he had been advised by the Chief of the Security Police and SD\r\n(RSHA) under date of 26 October 1942 that during the month of November\r\nthe evacuation of Poles in the Lublin district would begin in order to\r\nmake room for the settlement of persons of the German race. The Poles\r\nwho were evacuated as a result of this measure were to be put into\r\nconcentration camps for labor so far as they were criminal or asocial.\r\nThe remaining Poles who were suitable for labor were to be transported\r\nwithout their families into the Reich, there to be put at the disposal\r\nof the Labor Allocation Offices to serve as replacements for Jews\r\neliminated from the armament factories. (_L-61_)\r\n\r\nDuring 1943 the program of mass murder carried out by the _Einsatz_\r\nGroups in the East was modified, and orders were issued to round up\r\nhundreds of thousands of persons for the armament industry.\r\n\r\n    “In the shortest possible time the Ukraine has to put at the\r\n    disposal of the armament industry one million workers, 500 of\r\n    whom have to be sent from our territory daily. * * * The\r\n    activity of the labor offices * * * is to be supported to the\r\n    greatest extent possible. * * * When searching villages, esp.\r\n    when it has become necessary to burn down a village, the whole\r\n    population will be put at the disposal of the Commissions by\r\n    force. * * * The most important thing is the recruiting of\r\n    workers.” (_3012-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 18 June 1941 secret orders were issued from the Chief of the Security\r\nPolice and SD, signed by Mueller, to prevent the return of Eastern\r\nemigrants and civilian workers from the Reich to the East, and to keep\r\nthem in German war production. Any attempts at refusal to work were to\r\nbe countered by the GESTAPO with the severest measures, arrest and\r\nconfinement in concentration camps (_1573-PS_).

(_654-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 5 September 1942 an order was issued by the RSHA to the offices of\r\nthe GESTAPO and SD covering this understanding. This order provided that\r\nordinary criminal procedure would not be applied against Poles, Jews,\r\ngypsies, and other Eastern people, but that instead they would be turned\r\nover to the police. Such persons of foreign extraction were to be\r\ntreated on a basis entirely different from that applied to Germans.\r\n\r\n    “* * * Such considerations which may be right for adjudicating a\r\n    punishable offense committed by a German are, however, wrong for\r\n    adjudicating a punishable offense committed by a person of alien\r\n    race.

The only standard may be that German\r\n    civil order is endangered by his action, and that consequently\r\n    preventive measures must be taken to prevent the recurrence of\r\n    such risks. In other words, the action of a person of alien race\r\n    is not to be viewed from the angle of judicial expiation, but\r\n    from the angle of the police guard against danger.\r\n\r\n    “As a result of this, the administration of penal law for\r\n    persons of alien race must be transferred from the hands of the\r\n    administrators of justice into the hands of the police. * * *”\r\n    (_L-316_)\r\n\r\n(9) _The GESTAPO and SD executed or confined persons in concentration\r\ncamps for crimes allegedly committed by their relatives._ On 19 July\r\n1944, the Commander of the SIPO and SD for the District Radom published\r\nan order transmitted through the Higher SS and Police Leaders to the\r\neffect that in all cases of assassination or attempted assassination of\r\nGermans, or where saboteurs had destroyed vital installations, not only\r\nthe guilty person but also all his (or her) male relatives should be\r\nshot and the female relatives over 16 years of age put into a\r\nconcentration camp. (_L-37_)\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1944, the _Einsatzkommando_ of the SIPO and SD at\r\nLuxembourg caused persons to be confined at Sachsenhausen concentration\r\ncamp because they were relatives of deserters and were, therefore,\r\n“expected to endanger the interest of the German Reich if allowed to go\r\nfree.” (_L-215_)\r\n\r\n(10) _The GESTAPO and SD were instructed to murder prisoners in the SIPO\r\nand SD prisons to prevent their release by the Allied armies._ On 21\r\nJuly 1944, the _Kommandeur_ of the SIPO and SD for the District Radom\r\nforwarded an order of the _Befehlshaber_ of the SIPO and SD to the\r\neffect that it was essential that the number of inmates of the SIPO and\r\nSD prisons be kept as low as possible. Inmates were to be subjected only\r\nto short formal interrogations and then to be sent by the quickest route\r\nto concentration camps.

In similar\r\ncircumstances, the Jews who were still employed in the armament\r\nindustries or in other work were to be dealt with in the same way.

The responsibility of\r\nthe GESTAPO and the SD for the mass extermination program carried out by\r\nthe Einsatz Groups of the SIPO and SD and in the annihilation camps to\r\nwhich Jews were sent by the SIPO and SD has already been considered. In\r\nthis subdivision, the place of the GESTAPO and SD in the development of\r\nthis persecution will be treated.\r\n\r\nSection B of the SD dealt with problems of nationality, including\r\nminorities, race and national health, immigration, and resettlement.\r\nSection B4 of the GESTAPO, headed by Eichmann, dealt with Jewish\r\naffairs, including matters of evacuation, means of suppressing enemies\r\nof the people and State, and dispossession of rights of German\r\ncitizenship. One of the functions of the SD was to furnish information\r\nconcerning the Jews to the GESTAPO. One of the functions of the GESTAPO\r\nwas to carry out the Nazi program of persecution of the Jews. (_L-185_;\r\n_L-219_.)\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO was charged with the enforcement of discriminatory laws,\r\nsuch as those preventing Jews from engaging in business, restricting\r\ntheir right to travel, and prohibiting them from associating with\r\ngentiles. Violations of such restrictions resulted in protective custody\r\nand confinement in concentration camps by the GESTAPO. (_L-217_;\r\n_L-152_; _L-167_.)\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Security Police and SD ordered the GESTAPO and the SD\r\nto supervise the anti-Jewish pogrom staged in November 1938 following\r\nthe von Rath incident in Paris. As many Jews were to be arrested in all\r\ndistricts as the available jail space would hold. Well-to-do Jews were\r\nto be singled out for arrest, and primarily only healthy male adults of\r\nnot too advanced age. Immediately after completion of the arrests, the\r\ncompetent concentration camp was to be notified in order to provide for\r\nspeediest transfer of Jews to the camps. (_3051-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 11 November 1938 Heydrich reported to Goering by secret express\r\nletter on the results of the action as reported by the GESTAPO. The\r\nreport stated in part:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The extent of the destruction of Jewish shops and houses\r\n    cannot yet be verified by figures. The figures given in the\r\n    reports: 815 shops destroyed, 171 dwelling houses set on fire or\r\n    destroyed, only indicate a fraction of the actual damage caused,\r\n    as far as arson is concerned. Due to the urgency of the\r\n    reporting, the reports received to date are entirely limited to\r\n    general statements such as ‘numerous’ or ‘most shops destroyed.’\r\n    Therefore the figures given must have been exceeded\r\n    considerably.\r\n\r\n    “191 synagogues were set on fire, and another 76 completely\r\n    destroyed. In addition 11 parish halls, [_Gemeindehauser_]\r\n    cemetery chapels and similar buildings were set on fire and 3\r\n    more completely destroyed.\r\n\r\n    “20,000 Jews were arrested, also 7 Aryans and 3 foreigners. The\r\n    latter were arrested for their own safety.\r\n\r\n    “36 deaths were reported and those seriously injured were also\r\n    numbered at 36. Those killed and injured are Jews. One Jew is\r\n    still missing. The Jews killed include one Polish national, and\r\n    those injured include 2 Poles.” (_3058-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 31 July 1941 Goering sent the following order to the Chief of the\r\nSecurity Police and SD, Heydrich:\r\n\r\n    “Complementing the task that was assigned to you on 24 January\r\n    1939, which dealt with arriving at a solution of the Jewish\r\n    problem through furtherance of emigration and evacuation as\r\n    advantageous as possible, I hereby charge you with making all\r\n    necessary preparations in regard to organizational and financial\r\n    matters for bringing about a complete solution of the Jewish\r\n    question in the German sphere of influence in Europe.”\r\n    (_710-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn February or March 1943, according to Gottfried Boley,\r\n_Ministerialrat_ in the Reich Chancery, a conference on the solution of\r\nthe Jewish problem, attended by representatives of the ministries, was\r\ncalled by Kaltenbrunner as Chief of the Security Police and SD. Boley\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “The meeting was presided over by Eichmann who had charge of\r\n    Jewish problems in the GESTAPO. In his opening remarks Eichmann\r\n    referred to former conferences that had taken place in the\r\n    office of the Chief of the Security Police and SD, and that on\r\n    this occasion he wished to discuss the matter in a more basic\r\n    manner. He stated that the Jewish question had to be solved in a\r\n    quick and proper way. Representatives of the Chief of the\r\n    Security Police and SD who attended the conference made it clear\r\n    to those present that the remaining Jews had to be sent forcibly\r\n    to concentration camps or be sterilized. Those present at the\r\n    conference must have carried away the impression that the\r\n    objectives were the extermination of the Jewish people.”\r\n    (_2645-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe deportation of Jews into concentration camps was part of the program\r\nfor slave labor. Jews not fit for work were screened out at\r\nextermination centers, such as Auschwitz, and the remainder were taken\r\ninto concentration and work camps. The orders were issued by Himmler and\r\npassed through the Chief of the Security Police and SD, Kaltenbrunner\r\n(formerly Heydrich) to Mueller, Chief of the GESTAPO, and then to\r\nEichmann for execution. (_2376-PS_; _1472-PS_.)\r\n\r\nIn Galicia, the deportation of Jews was carried out during the period\r\nfrom April 1942 to June 1943. At the end of that time Galicia had been\r\nentirely cleared of Jews. In all, 434,392 Jews were deported from\r\nGalicia alone. In connection with the deportations, Jewish property was\r\nconfiscated, including furniture, clothing, money, dental fillings, gold\r\nteeth, wedding rings, and other personal property of all kinds. The\r\nSecurity Police participated in this action along with other police and\r\nSS detachments. (_L-18_)\r\n\r\nIn Warsaw the Security Police played a responsible role in the\r\nsegregation of the Jews and placing them in the Ghetto, in the\r\nsubsequent removal of the Jews to concentration camps, and in the final\r\nclearance of the Ghetto. The Ghetto was established in November of 1940.\r\nOver 300,000 Jews were deported from it between July and October 1942,\r\nand 6,500 more were deported in January 1943. In April and May 1943 the\r\nfinal clearance of the Ghetto was accomplished under the direction of\r\nthe SS and Police Leader of the Warsaw area, and with units of the SIPO,\r\nWaffen SS, Order Police, and some military and Polish police units.\r\nThousands of Jews were killed in the action. About 7,000 were\r\ntransported to “T. II” where they were exterminated. The remaining\r\n40,000 to 45,000 were placed in concentration camps. (_1061-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn Denmark the _Kommandeur_ of the SIPO and SD was ordered in September\r\nof 1943 to arrest all Danish citizens of Jewish belief and send them to\r\nStettin by ship and from there to the concentration camp at\r\nTheresienstadt. In spite of the protests of the _Kommandeur_ of the SIPO\r\nand SD, Kaltenbrunner as Chief of the Security Police and SD gave direct\r\norders to carry out the anti-Jewish action. Eichmann, head of the Jewish\r\nsection in the GESTAPO, had direct charge of the clearance program.\r\n(_2375-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn Hungary the deportation of Jews was again carried out by Eichmann.\r\nThis action took place under direction of the GESTAPO after the German\r\noccupation of Hungary in March 1944. About 450,000 Jews were deported\r\nfrom Hungary due to the pressure and direction of the GESTAPO.\r\n(_2605-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _The GESTAPO and the SD were primary agencies for the persecution of\r\nthe churches._ The fight against the churches was never brought out into\r\nthe open by the GESTAPO and the SD as in the case of the persecution of\r\nthe Jews. The struggle was designed to weaken the churches and to lay a\r\nfoundation for the ultimate destruction of the confessional churches\r\nafter the end of the war. (_1815-PS_)\r\n\r\nSection C2 of the SD dealt with education and religious life. Section B1\r\nof the GESTAPO dealt with political Catholicism. Section B2 with\r\npolitical Protestantism sects, and Section B3 with other churches and\r\nFreemasonry. (_L-185_)\r\n\r\nAs early as 1934 the GESTAPO enforced restrictions against the churches.\r\nAn order by the State Police of Dusseldorf prohibited the churches from\r\nengaging in public activities, especially public appearances in groups,\r\nsports, hikes, and the establishment of holiday or outdoor camps.\r\n(_R-145_)\r\n\r\nIn 1934 the Bavarian Political Police placed three ministers in\r\nprotective custody for refusing to carry out the order of the Government\r\nto ring church bells on the occasion of the death of Hindenburg.\r\n(_1521-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO dissolved those church organizations which it considered to\r\nhave political objectives. In 1938 the GESTAPO at Munich dissolved by\r\norder the Guild of the Virgin Mary of the Bavarian dioceses. (_1481-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn insight into the hidden objectives and secret methods of the GESTAPO\r\nand the SD in the fight against the churches is disclosed in the file of\r\nthe GESTAPO regional office at Aachen (_1815-PS_). On 12 May 1941 the\r\nChief of the GESTAPO issued a directive in which he reported that the\r\nChief of the Security Police and SD had issued an order under which the\r\ntreatment of church politics which had theretofore been divided between\r\nthe SD and the GESTAPO was to be taken over entirely by the GESTAPO. The\r\nSD “church specialists” were to be temporarily transferred to the same\r\nposts in the GESTAPO and operate an intelligence service in the church\r\npolitical sphere there. SD files concerning church political opposition\r\nwere to be handed over to the GESTAPO, but the SD was to retain material\r\nconcerning the confessional influence on the lives of the people.\r\n\r\nOn 22 and 23 September 1941 a conference of church specialists attached\r\nto GESTAPO regional offices was held in the lecture hall of the RSHA in\r\nBerlin. The notes on the speeches delivered at this conference indicate\r\nthat the GESTAPO considered the church as an enemy to be attacked with\r\ndetermination and “true fanaticism.” The immediate objective of the\r\nGESTAPO was stated to be to insure that the Church did not win back any\r\nlost ground. The ultimate objective was stated to be the destruction of\r\nthe confessional churches. This was to be brought about by the\r\ncollection of material through the GESTAPO church intelligence system to\r\nbe produced at a proper time as evidence for the charge of treasonable\r\nactivities during the German fight for existence.\r\n\r\nThe executive measures to be applied by the GESTAPO were discussed. It\r\nwas stated to be impractical to deal with political offenses under\r\nnormal legal procedure owing to lack of political perception which\r\nprevailed among the legal authorities. The so-called “agitator-Priests,”\r\ntherefore, had to be handled by GESTAPO measures, and when necessary\r\nremoved to a concentration camp. The following punishments were to be\r\napplied to priests according to individual circumstances: warning, fine,\r\nforbidden to preach, forbidden to remain in parish, forbidden all\r\nactivity as a priest, short-term arrest, protective custody. Retreats,\r\nyouth and recreational camps, evening services, processions and\r\npilgrimages were all to be forbidden on grounds of interfering with the\r\nwar effort, blackouts, overburdened transportation, etc.\r\n\r\nIn executing this program close cooperation was required between the\r\nGESTAPO and the SD. The study and treatment of the Church in its\r\nopposition to the Nazi state was the responsibility of the GESTAPO. The\r\nresult of this treatment of the Church in the sphere of “religious life”\r\nremained the province of the SD. By these means the GESTAPO and the SD\r\ncarried on the struggle of the Nazi conspirators against the Church.\r\n\r\n                            H. _Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThe evidence shows that the GESTAPO was created by Goering in Prussia in\r\nApril 1933 for the specific purpose of serving as a police agency to\r\nstrike down the actual and ideological enemies of the Nazi regime, and\r\nthat henceforward the GESTAPO in Prussia and in the other States of the\r\nReich carried out a program of terror against all who were thought to be\r\ndangerous to the domination of the conspirators over the people of\r\nGermany. Its methods were utterly ruthless. It operated outside the law\r\nand sent its victims to the concentration camps. The term “GESTAPO”\r\nbecame the symbol of the Nazi regime of force and terror.\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, operating secretly, the SD, through its vast network\r\nof informants, spied upon the German people in their daily lives, on the\r\nstreets, in the shops, and even within the sanctity of the churches.\r\n\r\nThe most casual remark of a German citizen might bring him before the\r\nGESTAPO, where his fate and freedom were decided without recourse to\r\nlaw. In this government, in which the rule of law was replaced by a\r\ntyrannical rule of men, the GESTAPO was the primary instrumentality of\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO and the SD played an important part in almost every criminal\r\nact of the conspiracy. The categories of these crimes, apart from the\r\nthousands of specific instances of torture and cruelty in policing\r\nGermany for the benefit of the conspirators, indicate the extent of\r\nGESTAPO and SD complicity.\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO and SD fabricated the border incidents which Hitler used as\r\nan excuse for attacking Poland.\r\n\r\nThrough the _Einsatz_ Groups they murdered approximately 2,000,000\r\ndefenseless men, women, and children.\r\n\r\nThey removed Jews, political leaders, and scientists from prisoner of\r\nwar camps and murdered them.\r\n\r\nThey took recaptured prisoners of war to concentration camps and\r\nmurdered some of them.\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO established and classified concentration camps and sent\r\nmillions of people into them for extermination and slave labor.\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO cleared Europe of the Jews and was responsible for sending\r\n4,000,000 Jews to their deaths in annihilation camps.\r\n\r\nThe GESTAPO and SD rounded up hundreds of thousands of citizens of\r\noccupied countries and shipped them to Germany for forced labor, and\r\nsent slave laborers to labor reformatory camps and concentration camps\r\nfor disciplining.\r\n\r\nThey executed captured commandos and paratroopers and protected\r\ncivilians who lynched Allied flyers.\r\n\r\nThey took civilians of occupied countries to Germany for secret trial\r\nand punishment.\r\n\r\nThey arrested, tried, and punished citizens of occupied territories\r\nunder special criminal procedures which did not accord them fair trials,\r\nand by summary methods.\r\n\r\nThey murdered or sent to concentration camps the relatives of persons\r\nwho had allegedly committed crimes.\r\n\r\nThey ordered the murder of prisoners in SIPO and SD prisons to prevent\r\ntheir release by the Allied armies.\r\n\r\nThey participated in the seizure and spoliation of public and private\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThey were primary agencies for the persecution of the Jews and of the\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out these crimes the GESTAPO operated as an organization,\r\nclosely centralized and controlled from Berlin headquarters. Reports\r\nwere submitted to Berlin, and all important decisions emanated from\r\nBerlin. The regional offices had only limited power to commit persons to\r\nconcentration camps. All cases, other than those of short duration, had\r\nto be submitted to Berlin for approval. From 1943 to the end of the war\r\nthe defendant Kaltenbrunner was the Chief of the Security Police and SD\r\nin Berlin. The GESTAPO was organized on a functional basis. Its\r\nprincipal divisions dealt with the groups and institutions against which\r\nit committed the worst crimes—Jews, churches, communists, and political\r\nliberals. Thus, in perpetrating these crimes, the GESTAPO acted as an\r\nentity, each section performing its part in the general criminal\r\nenterprises ordered by Berlin. It must be held responsible as an entity.\r\n\r\nThe SD was at all times a department of the SS. Its criminality directly\r\nconcerns and contributes to the criminality of the SS.\r\n\r\nAs to the GESTAPO, it is submitted that:\r\n\r\n        1. The GESTAPO is an organization, in the sense in which\r\n        that term is used in Article 9 of the Charter.\r\n\r\n        2. The defendants Goering and Kaltenbrunner committed\r\n        the crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter in their\r\n        capacity as members and leaders of the GESTAPO.\r\n\r\n        3. The GESTAPO, as an organization, participated in and\r\n        aided the conspiracy which contemplated and involved the\r\n        commission of the crimes defined in Article 6 of the\r\n        Charter.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, on German Police Day, Heydrich, the former Chief of the\r\nSecurity Police and the SD, said:\r\n\r\n    “Secret State Police, Criminal Police, and SD are still adorned\r\n    with the furtive and whispered secrecy of a political detective\r\n    story. In a mixture of fear and shuddering—and yet at home with\r\n    a certain feeling of security because of their\r\n    presence,—brutality, inhumanity bordering on the sadistic, and\r\n    ruthlessness are attributed abroad to the men of this\r\n    profession.” (Extract from a brochure on Reinhard Heydrich,\r\n    published in December 1943.)\r\n\r\nThe evidence as it is submitted, shows that brutality, inhumanity,\r\nsadism, and ruthlessness were characteristic of the GESTAPO and that it\r\nwas and should be declared, a criminal organization, in accordance with\r\narticle 9 of the Charter.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n     LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE GEHEIME\r\n           STAATSPOLIZEI (GESTAPO) AND SICHERHEITSDIENST (SD)\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 9.                │  I   │       6\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │ 29, 70,\r\n                  │  Appendix B.                         │  I   │      71\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

THE GENERAL STAFF AND HIGH COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES\r\n\r\nIn one respect the General Staff and High Command of the German Armed\r\nForces is to be distinguished from the other groups and organizations\r\nagainst which the prosecution seeks declaration of criminality. The\r\nLeadership Corps of the NSDAP, for example, was the instrument by which\r\nHitlerism rose to full power in Germany. The SA and the SS were\r\nbranches—large branches to be sure—of the Nazi Party. The German\r\npolice had certain roots and antecedents which antedated Hitlerism, but\r\nwas almost entirely a creature of the party and the SS. The Reichs\r\nCabinet was, in essence, merely a committee or set of committees of\r\nReichs Ministers, and when the Nazis came to power these ministerial\r\npositions were filled for the most part by Nazis. All those groups and\r\norganizations, accordingly, either owe their origin and development to\r\nNaziism, or automatically became nazified when Hitler came to full\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThat is not true of this group, the General Staff and High Command of\r\nthe German Armed Forces. It is common knowledge that German armed might\r\nand the German military tradition antedate Hitlerism by many decades.\r\nThe war of 1914-18, the Kaiser, and the “scrap of paper” are modern\r\nwitnesses to this fact.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the German defeat in 1918 and the Treaty of Versailles,\r\nthe size and activities of the German armed forces were severely\r\nrestricted. The last few years have made it abundantly apparent that\r\nthese restrictions did not destroy or even seriously undermine German\r\nmilitarism. The full flowering of German military strength came about\r\nthrough collaboration between the Nazis and the career leaders of the\r\nGerman Armed Forces—the professional soldiers, sailors, and airmen.\r\nWhen Hitler came to power in 1933, he did not find a vacuum in the field\r\nof military affairs; he found a small _Reichswehr_ and a body of\r\nprofessional officers with a morale and outlook nourished by German\r\nmilitary history.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of these professional officers constitute the group named in\r\nthe Indictment—the General Staff and High Command of the German Armed\r\nForces. This part of the case concerns that group of men. Needless to\r\nsay, it is not the prosecution’s position that it is a crime to be a\r\nsoldier or sailor, or to serve one’s country as a soldier or sailor in\r\ntime of war. The profession of arms is an honorable one, and can be\r\nhonorably practiced. But it is too clear for argument that a man who\r\ncommits crimes cannot plead as a defense that he committed them in\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nIt is not in the nature of things, and it is not the prosecution’s\r\nposition, that all members of this group were wicked men, or that they\r\nwere all equally culpable. But this group not only collaborated with\r\nHitler and supported many Nazi objectives. They furnished one thing\r\nwhich was essential and basic to the success of the Nazi program for\r\nGermany—skill and experience in the development and use of armed might.\r\n\r\nWhy did this group support Hitler and the Nazis? The answer is simple.\r\nThe answer is that they agreed with the basic objectives of Naziism, and\r\nthat Hitler gave the generals the opportunity to play a major part in\r\nachieving those objectives. The generals, like Hitler, wanted Germany to\r\naggrandize at the expense of neighboring countries, and to do so if\r\nnecessary by force or threat of force. Force—armed might—was the\r\nkeystone of the arch, the thing without which nothing else would have\r\nbeen possible.\r\n\r\nAs they came to power and when they had attained power, the Nazis had\r\ntwo alternatives: to collaborate with and expand the _Reichswehr_, or to\r\nignore the Reichswehr and build up a separate army of their own. The\r\ngenerals feared that the Nazis might do the latter. So they were the\r\nmore ready to play along with the Nazis. Moreover, the Nazis offered the\r\ngenerals the chance of achieving much that the generals wished to\r\nachieve in the expansion of German armies and frontiers. And so the\r\ngenerals climbed onto the Nazi bandwagon. They saw it was going in their\r\ndirection for the present. No doubt they hoped later to take over the\r\ndirection themselves. In fact, it was ultimately they who were taken\r\nover by the Nazis. Hitler attracted the generals to him with the glitter\r\nof conquest and then succeeded in submerging them politically. As the\r\nwar proceeded they became his tools.\r\n\r\nBut if the leaders of the Armed Forces became the tools of Naziism, it\r\nis not to be supposed that they were unwitting, or that they did not\r\nparticipate fully in many of the actions which are charged as criminal.\r\nThe willingness, indeed eagerness, of German officers to become partners\r\nof the Nazis will be fully developed.\r\n\r\n  A. _Composition and Functions of The General Staff and High Command\r\n                                Group._\r\n\r\nDuring the first World War there was an organization in the German Armed\r\nForces known as the Great General Staff. This name persists in the\r\npublic mind, but the _Grosse Generalstab_ no longer exists in fact.\r\nThere has been no such single organization, no single German General\r\nStaff, since 1918. But there has of course been a group of men\r\nresponsible for the policy and acts of the Armed Forces. The fact that\r\nthese men have no collective name does not prevent us from collecting\r\nthem together. Men cannot escape the consequences of their collective\r\nacts by combining informally instead of formally. The essence of a\r\ngeneral staff or a high command lies not in name but in function. And\r\nthe men comprised within this group do constitute a functional group,\r\nwelded together by common responsibility, of those officers who had the\r\nprincipal authority and responsibility under Hitler, for the plans and\r\noperations of the German armed forces.\r\n\r\n(1) _Structure and Organization of the German Armed Forces._ When the\r\nNazis came to power in 1933 the German Armed Forces were controlled by a\r\nReich Defense Minister, at that time Field Marshall von Blomberg.\r\nSubordinate to von Blomberg were the chiefs of the army staff (at that\r\ntime von Fritsch), and of the naval staff, the defendant Raeder. Owing\r\nto the limitations imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles, the\r\nGerman Air Force at that time had no official existence whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIn May 1935, at the time that military conscription was introduced in\r\nGermany, there was a change in the titles of these offices but the\r\nstructure remained basically the same. Field Marshall von Blomberg\r\nremained in supreme command of the armed forces, with the title of Reich\r\nMinister for War and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. Von Fritsch\r\nbecame Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and Raeder Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Navy. The army and naval staffs were renamed “High\r\nCommands”—_Oberkommando des Heeres and Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine_,\r\nfrom which are derived the initials by which they are usually known (OKH\r\nand OKM).\r\n\r\nThe German Air Force came into official and open existence at about this\r\nsame time, but it was not put under von Blomberg. It was an independent\r\ninstitution under the personal command of Goering, who had the double\r\ntitle of Air Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force.\r\n\r\nIn February 1938 a rather fundamental reorganization took place, both in\r\nterms of personnel and organizational structure. Although Raeder\r\nsurvived the reshuffle, von Blomberg and von Fritsch were both retired\r\nfrom their positions, and Blomberg’s ministry, the War Ministry, was\r\nwound up. This ministry had contained a division or department called\r\nthe _Wehrmachtamt_ or “Armed Forces Department,” the function of which\r\nwas to coordinate the plans and operations of the Army and Navy. From\r\nthis Armed Forces Department was formed a new over-all Armed Forces\r\nauthority, known as the High Command of the Armed Forces—_Oberkommando\r\nder Wehrmacht_—usually known by the initials OKW. As the Air Force as\r\nwell as the Army and the Navy was subordinated to OKW, coordination of\r\nall Armed Forces matters was vested in the OKW, which was in effect\r\nHitler’s personal staff for these matters. It combined staff and\r\nministerial functions. Keitel was appointed chief of the OKW. The most\r\nimportant department of OKW was the operations staff, of which Jodl\r\nbecame the chief. Jodl’s immediate subordinate was Warlimont, with the\r\ntitle of Deputy Chief of The Armed Forces Operations Staff from 1941.\r\n(The genesis of this department is explained in _L-79_.)\r\n\r\nThis reorganization and establishment of OKW were embodied in a decree\r\nissued by Hitler on 4 February 1938 (1938 RGBl., Part I, page 111):\r\n\r\n               “DECREE ON THE COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES\r\n\r\n    “Command authority over the entire Armed Forces is from now on\r\n    exercised directly by me personally.\r\n\r\n    “The Armed Forces Department in the Reich War Ministry with its\r\n    functions becomes ‘The High Command of the Armed Forces’ and\r\n    comes directly under my command as my military staff.\r\n\r\n    “The head of the Staff of the High Command of the Armed Forces\r\n    is the Chief of the former Armed Forces Department, with the\r\n    title of Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces. His\r\n    status is equal to that of Reich Minister.\r\n\r\n    “The High Command of the Armed Forces also takes over the\r\n    affairs of the Reich War Ministry. The Chief of the High Command\r\n    of the Armed Forces as my representative exercises the functions\r\n    hitherto exercised by the Reich War Minister.\r\n\r\n    “The High Command of the Armed Forces is responsible in peace\r\n    time for the unified preparation of the defense of the Reich in\r\n    all areas according to my directives.\r\n\r\n    “Berlin, 4 February 1938.\r\n\r\n                                  “The Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor\r\n                                               “(S)  Adolf Hitler\r\n             “The Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery\r\n                                                “(S)  Dr. Lammers\r\n                     “Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces\r\n                                                    “(S)  Keitel”\r\n\r\nUnder OKW were the supreme commands of the three branches of the Armed\r\nForces: OKH, OKM, and the Air Force, which did not receive the official\r\ndesignation of _Oberkommando der Luftwaffe_ (OKL) until 1944. Raeder\r\nremained after 1938 as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and von Fritsch\r\nwas replaced by von Brauchitsch as Commander-in-Chief of the Army.\r\nGoering continued as Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force. In 1941 von\r\nBrauchitsch was replaced as Commander-in-Chief of the Army by Hitler\r\nhimself, and Raeder was replaced as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy by\r\nDoenitz early in 1943. Goering continued as Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nAir Force until the last month of the war, when he was replaced by von\r\nGreim.\r\n\r\nOKW, OKH, OKM and the Air Force each had its own staff. These four\r\nstaffs did not have uniform designations; in the case of OKH, the staff\r\nwas known as the _Generalstab_ (General Staff); in the case of OKW, it\r\nwas known as the _Fuehrungstab_ (Operations Staff); but in all cases the\r\nfunctions were those of a General Staff in military parlance. It will be\r\nseen, therefore, that there was in this war no single German General\r\nStaff, but rather four, one for each branch of the service plus one for\r\nthe OKW as the over-all interservice supreme command.\r\n\r\nUnder OKH, OKL, and OKM were the various fighting formations of the\r\nArmy, Air Force and Navy respectively. The largest army field formation\r\nwas known to the Germans, as it is among the nations generally, as an\r\n“army group”. An Army group was a headquarters controlling two or more\r\n“armies.” In some cases, e.g. in the campaigns in Norway and Greece\r\nwhere only one army was used, “armies” were directly subordinated to\r\nOKH, rather than to an “army group.” Under the armies come the lower\r\nfield formations such as corps, divisions, regiments, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the German Air Force (OKL), the largest formation was\r\nknown as an “air fleet” (_Luftflotte_) and the lower units under the air\r\nfleet were called “corps” (_Fliegerkorps_ or _Jagdkorps_) or “divisions”\r\n(_Fliegerdivisionen_ or _Jagddivisionen_).\r\n\r\nUnder OKM were the various “naval group commands,” which controlled all\r\nnaval operations in a given area, with the exception of the operation of\r\nthe high seas fleet and the submarines, which by their nature, were too\r\nmobile to be restricted to an area command. The Commanders of the fleet\r\nand submarines, and certain other specialized units, were directly\r\nsubordinate to the German Admiralty.\r\n\r\n(2) _Composition of the Group Charged as Criminal._ The group charged in\r\nthe Indictment (Appendix B) as criminal comprises, first, German\r\nofficers who held the top positions in the four supreme commands\r\ndescribed above; and second, the officers who held the top field\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nThe holders of nine of the principal positions in the supreme commands\r\nare included in the group. Four of these are positions of supreme\r\nauthority: the chief of the OKW, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Navy, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Air\r\nForce. Four other positions are those of the Chiefs of Staff to the four\r\nCommanders-in-Chief: the Chief of the Operations Staff of OKW, the Chief\r\nof the General Staff of the Army, the Chief of the General Staff of the\r\nAir Force, and the Chief of the Naval War Staff. The ninth position is\r\nthat of Deputy Chief of the Operations Staff of OKW. The particular\r\nresponsibility of the holder of this office was planning, and for this\r\nreason his office has been included in the group.\r\n\r\nThe group named in the Indictment comprises all individuals who held any\r\nof these nine staff positions between February 1938 and the end of the\r\nwar in May 1945. February 1938 was selected as the opening date because\r\nit was in that month that the top organization of the German Armed\r\nForces was reorganized and assumed substantially the form in which it\r\npersisted up to the end of the war. Twenty-two different individuals\r\noccupied these nine positions during that period, of whom eighteen are\r\nstill living.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the officers who held the principal field commands, the\r\nIndictment includes as members of the group all Commanders-in-Chief in\r\nthe field who had the status of _Oberbefehlshaber_ in the Army, Navy, or\r\nAir Force. The term _Oberbefehlshaber_ defies literal translation into\r\nEnglish: literally the components of the word mean\r\n“over-command-holder,” and it is perhaps best translated as\r\nCommander-in-Chief. In the case of the Army, commanders of army groups\r\nand armies always had the status and title of _Oberbefehlshaber_. In the\r\nAir Force, the Commander-in-Chief of air fleets always had the status of\r\n_Oberbefehlshaber_, although they were not formally so designated until\r\n1944. In the Navy, officers holding the senior regional commands, and\r\ntherefore in control of all naval operations (other than of the high\r\nseas fleet itself) in a given sector, had the status of\r\n_Oberbefehlshaber_. Roughly 110 individual officers had the status of\r\n_Oberbefehlshaber_ in the Army, Navy, or Air Force during the period in\r\nquestion, and all but approximately a dozen of them are still alive.\r\n\r\nThe entire General Staff and High Command group as defined in the\r\nIndictment comprises about 130 officers, of whom 114 are believed still\r\nto be living. These figures are the cumulative total of all officers who\r\nat any time belonged to the group during the seven years and three\r\nmonths from February 1938 to May 1945. The number of active members of\r\nthe group at any one time is, of course, much smaller; it rose from\r\nabout 20 at the outbreak of the war to 50 in 1944 and 1945.\r\n\r\nThe structure and functioning of the German General Staff and High\r\nCommand group have been described in a series of affidavits by some of\r\nthe principal German field marshalls and generals. A brief description\r\nof how these statements were obtained may be helpful. In the first place\r\ntwo American officers, selected for ability and experience in\r\ninterrogating high-ranking German prisoners of war, were briefed by an\r\nIntelligence officer and a trial counsel on the particular problems\r\npresented by this part of the case. These interrogators were already\r\nwell versed in military intelligence and were able to converse fluently\r\nin German. The officer who briefed these interrogators emphasized that\r\ntheir function was objectively to inquire into and to establish facts on\r\nwhich the prosecution wishes to be accurately and surely informed; the\r\ninterrogators were not to regard themselves as cross-examiners. The\r\nGerman officers to be interrogated were selected on the basis of the\r\nspecial knowledge which they could be presumed to possess by reason of\r\npositions held by them during the past generation. After each interview\r\nthe interrogator prepared a report. From this report such facts as\r\nappeared relevant to the issues now before the Tribunal were extracted\r\nand a statement embodying these facts was prepared. This statement was\r\nthen presented to the officer at a later interview. It was presented in\r\nthe form of a draft and the officer was asked whether it truly\r\nreproduced what he said at the previous interview. He was also invited\r\nto alter it in any way he thought fit. This careful and laborious, but\r\nnecessary, process had as its object the procuring of the best possible\r\ntestimony in the form of carefully considered statements.\r\n\r\nThese affidavits fully support the prosecution’s description of the\r\ngroup, and conclusively establish that this group of officers was in\r\nfact the group which had the major responsibility for planning and\r\ndirecting the operations of the German Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nThe first of these affidavits is that of Franz Halder (_3702-PS_), who\r\nheld the rank of _Generaloberst_ (Colonel General), the equivalent of a\r\nfour-star general in the American Army. Halder was chief of the General\r\nStaff of OKH from September 1938 to September 1942 and is, accordingly,\r\na member of the group. His statement reads:\r\n\r\n    “Ultimate authority and responsibility for military affairs in\r\n    Germany was vested in the Head of State who prior to 2 August\r\n    1934 was Field Marshall von Hindenburg and thereafter until 1945\r\n    was Adolf Hitler.\r\n\r\n    “Specialized military matters were the responsibility of the\r\n    three branches of the Armed Forces subordinate to the\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces (at the same time Head of\r\n    State), that is to say the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. In\r\n    practice, supervision within this field was exercised by a\r\n    relatively small group of high-ranking officers. These officers\r\n    exercised such supervision in their official capacity and by\r\n    virtue of their training, their positions and their mutual\r\n    contacts. Plans for military operations of the German Armed\r\n    Forces were prepared by members of this group according to the\r\n    instructions of the OKW in the name of their respective\r\n    Commanding Officers and were presented by them to the\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces (at the same time Head of\r\n    State).\r\n\r\n    “The members of this group were charged with the responsibility\r\n    of preparing for military operations within their competent\r\n    fields and they actually did prepare for any such operations as\r\n    were to be undertaken by troops in the field.\r\n\r\n    “Prior to any operation, members of this group were assembled\r\n    and given appropriate directions by the Head of State. Examples\r\n    of such meetings are the speech by Hitler to the\r\n    Commanders-in-Chief on 22 August 1939 prior to the Polish\r\n    campaign and the consultation at the Reich Chancellery on 14\r\n    June 1941 prior to the first Russian campaign. The composition\r\n    of this group and the relationship of its members to each other\r\n    were as shown in the attached chart. This was in effect the\r\n    General Staff and High Command of the German Armed Forces.”\r\n\r\n                                         “(S)  Halder”  (_3702-PS_)\r\n\r\nA substantially identical statement (_3703-PS_) was made by von\r\nBrauchitsch, who held the rank of Field Marshall, and who was\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army from 1938 to 1941. Von Brauchitsch was\r\nalso, therefore, a member of the group. The only difference between the\r\ntwo statements is worth noting occurs in the last sentence of each.\r\nHalder states that the group described in the Indictment “was in effect\r\nthe General Staff and High Command of the German Armed Forces,”\r\n(_3702-PS_), whereas von Brauchitsch puts it a little differently,\r\nsaying “in the hands of those who filled the positions shown in the\r\nchart lay the actual direction of the Armed Forces.” (_3703-PS_)\r\n\r\nBoth von Brauchitsch and Halder have stated under oath that the General\r\nStaff chart (_Chart Number 7_) accurately portrays the top organization\r\nof the German Armed Forces. The statements by von Brauchitsch and Halder\r\nalso fully support the prosecution’s statement that the holders of the\r\npositions shown on this chart constitute the group in whom lay the major\r\nresponsibility for the planning and execution of all Armed Forces\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nAnother affidavit by Halder (_3707-PS_) sets forth certain less\r\nimportant matters of detail:\r\n\r\n    “The most important department in the OKW was the Operations\r\n    Staff—in much the same way as the General Staff was in the Army\r\n    and Air Force and the Naval War Staff in the Navy. Under Keitel\r\n    there were a number of departmental chiefs who were equal in\r\n    status with Jodl, but in the planning and conduct of military\r\n    affairs they and their departments were less important and less\r\n    influential than Jodl and Jodl’s staff.\r\n\r\n    “The OKW Operations Staff was also divided into sections. Of\r\n    these the most important was the section of which Warlimont was\r\n    chief. It was called the ‘National Defense’ Section and was\r\n    primarily concerned with the development of strategic questions.\r\n    From 1941 onwards Warlimont, though charged with the same\r\n    duties, was known as Deputy Chief of the OKW Operations Staff.\r\n\r\n    “There was during World War II no unified General Staff such as\r\n    the Great General Staff which operated in World War I.\r\n\r\n    “Operational matters for the Army and Air Force were worked out\r\n    by the group of high-ranking officers described in my Statement\r\n    of 7 November (in the Army: ‘General Staff of the Army’; in the\r\n    Air Force ‘General Staff of the Air Force’).\r\n\r\n    “Operational matters in the Navy were even in World War I not\r\n    worked out by the ‘Great General Staff’ but by the Naval Staff.”\r\n\r\n                              “(Signed)  Franz Halder”  (_3707-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis affidavit is primarily concerned with the functions of the General\r\nStaffs of the four Commanders of OKW, OKL, OKM, and OKH and fully\r\nsupports the inclusion of the Chiefs of Staff of the four services in\r\nthe indicted group, as well as the inclusion of Warlimont as Deputy\r\nChief of the OKW Operations Staff, with his strategic planning\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nAn affidavit (_3708-PS_) by the son of Field Marshal von Brauchitsch,\r\nwho had the rank of _Oberst_ (Colonel) in the German Air Force, and who\r\nwas personal aide to Goering as Commander-in-Chief of the German Air\r\nForce, furnishes a few details on the _Luftwaffe_:\r\n\r\n    “_Luftflottenchefs_ have the same status as the\r\n    _Oberbefehlshaber_ of an army. During the war they had no\r\n    territorial authority and accordingly exercised no territorial\r\n    jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n    “They were the highest troop commanders of the air force units\r\n    subordinate to them and were directly under the command of the\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force.\r\n\r\n    “Until the summer of 1944 they bore the designation\r\n    ‘_Befehlshaber_’ and from then on that of ‘_Oberbefehlshaber_.’\r\n    This change of designation carried with it no change in the\r\n    functions and responsibilities which they previously had.”\r\n\r\n                               “(Signed)  Brauchitsch”  (_3708-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Functioning of the General Staff and High Command Group._ In many\r\nrespects, the German military leaders functioned in the same general\r\nmanner as obtains in the military establishments of other large nations.\r\nGeneral plans were made by the top staff officers and their assistants\r\nat OKW, OKH, OKL, and OKM, in collaboration with the field generals or\r\nadmirals who were entrusted with the execution of the plans. A decision\r\nto wage a particular campaign would be made, needless to say, at the\r\nhighest level, and the making of such a decision would involve political\r\nand diplomatic questions as well as purely military considerations. When\r\nthe decision was made, to attack Poland, for example, the top staff\r\nofficers in Berlin and their assistants would work out general military\r\nplans for the campaign. These general plans would be transmitted to the\r\nCommanders of the Army groups and Armies who were to be in charge of the\r\ncampaign. Consultation would follow between the top field commanders and\r\nthe top staff officers at OKW and OKH, and the plans would be revised,\r\nperfected, and refined in detail.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the group worked, involving as it did the\r\ninterchange of ideas and recommendations between the top staff officers\r\nat OKW and OKH and the principal field commanders, is graphically\r\ndescribed in two affidavits by Field Marshall von Brauchitsch\r\n(_3705-PS_):\r\n\r\n                     “STATEMENT OF 7 NOVEMBER 1945\r\n\r\n    “In April 1939 I was instructed by Hitler to start military\r\n    preparations for a possible campaign against Poland. Work was\r\n    immediately begun to prepare an operational and deployment plan.\r\n    This was then presented to Hitler and approved by him as amended\r\n    by a change which he desired.\r\n\r\n    “After the operational and deployment orders had been given to\r\n    the two Commanders of the army groups and the five Commanders of\r\n    the armies, conferences took place with them about details in\r\n    order to hear their desires and recommendations.\r\n\r\n    “After the outbreak of the war I continued this policy of\r\n    keeping in close and constant touch with the Commanders-in-Chief\r\n    of army groups and of armies by personal visits to their\r\n    headquarters as well as by telephone, teletype or wireless. In\r\n    this way I was able to obtain their advice and their\r\n    recommendations during the conduct of military operations. In\r\n    fact it was the accepted policy and common practice for the\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of the Army to consult his subordinate\r\n    Commanders-in-Chief and to maintain a constant exchange of ideas\r\n    with them. The Commander-in-Chief of the Army and his Chief of\r\n    Staff communicated with army groups and, thru them as well as\r\n    directly, with armies; thru army groups on strategical and\r\n    tactical matters; directly on questions affecting supply and the\r\n    administration of conquered territory occupied by these armies.\r\n    An army group had no territorial jurisdiction. It had a\r\n    relatively small staff which was concerned only with military\r\n    operations. In all territorial matters it was the\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of the army and not of the army group who\r\n    exercised jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n                           “(Signed)  von Brauchitsch”  (_3705-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n             “SUPPLEMENT TO MY STATEMENT OF 7 NOVEMBER 1945\r\n\r\n    “When Hitler had made a decision to support the realization of\r\n    his political objectives through military pressure or through\r\n    the application of military force, the Commander-in-Chief of the\r\n    Army, if he was at all involved, ordinarily first received an\r\n    appropriate oral briefing or an appropriate oral command.\r\n\r\n    “Operational and deployment plans were next worked out in the\r\n    OKM. After these plans had been presented to Hitler, generally\r\n    by word of mouth, and had been approved by him, there followed a\r\n    written order from the OKW to the three branches of the Armed\r\n    Forces. In the meanwhile the OKH began to transmit the\r\n    operational and deployment plans to the army groups and armies\r\n    involved. Details of the operational and deployment plans were\r\n    discussed by the OKH with the Commanders of the army groups and\r\n    armies and with the Chiefs of Staff of these Commanders.\r\n\r\n    “During the operations the OKH maintained a constant exchange of\r\n    ideas with the army groups by means of telephone, radio and\r\n    courier. The Commander-in-Chief of the Army used every\r\n    opportunity to maintain a personal exchange of ideas with the\r\n    Commanders of army groups, armies and lower echelons by means of\r\n    personal visits to them. In the war against Russia the\r\n    Commanders of army groups and of armies were individually and\r\n    repeatedly called in by Hitler for consultation.\r\n\r\n    “Orders for all operational matters went from the OKH to army\r\n    groups and for all matters concerning supply and territorial\r\n    jurisdiction from the OKH directly to the armies.”\r\n\r\n                           “(Signed)  von Brauchitsch”  (_3705-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe _Oberbefehlshaber_ in the field, therefore—and in the case of the\r\narmy that means the Commander-in-Chief of army groups and\r\narmies—participated in planning, and directed the execution of the\r\nplans. The _Oberbefehlshaber_ were also the repositories of general\r\nexecutive power in the areas in which their army groups and armies were\r\noperating. This fact appears from a directive of 13 March 1941 signed by\r\nKeitel and issued by the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces (_447-PS_).\r\nThis directive sets out various regulations for the impending operations\r\nagainst the Soviet Union (which were actually begun on 22 June 1941).\r\nUnder paragraph I, is entitled “Area of operations and executive power\r\n(_Vollziehende Gewalt_)”, subparagraph 1 and 2(a) provide:\r\n\r\n    “It is not contemplated to declare East Prussia and the\r\n    General-Gouvernement an area of operations. However, in\r\n    accordance with the unpublished Fuehrer orders from 19 and 21\r\n    October 1939, the Commander in Chief of the Army shall be\r\n    authorized to take all measures necessary for the execution of\r\n    his military aim and for the safeguarding of the troops. He may\r\n    transfer his authority onto the Commanders in Chief\r\n    [_Oberbefehlshaber_] of the Army Groups and Armies.

The\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of the Army has the right to exercise the\r\n    executive power [_Vollziehende Gewalt_] in this area, and may\r\n    transfer his authority onto the Commanders in Chief\r\n    [_Oberbefehlshaber_] of the Army Groups and Armies.” (_447-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe official command invitation to participate in consultations at the\r\nReich Chancellery on 14 June 1941, eight days prior to the German attack\r\non the Soviet Union, also shows the group at work (_C-78_). This meeting\r\nis referred to in the last paragraph of the affidavits by Halder\r\n(_3702-PS_) and von Brauchitsch (_3703-PS_) mentioned above. This\r\ndocument, signed by Colonel Schmundt, Chief _Wehrmacht_ Adjutant to\r\nHitler, and is dated at Berchtesgaden, 9 June 1941, begins:\r\n\r\n    “_Re: Conference ‘Barbarossa’_\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces has\r\n    ordered reports on Barbarossa [the code name for the invasion of\r\n    the U.S.S.R.] by the Commanders of Army Groups and Armies and\r\n    Naval and Air Commanders of equal rank.”\r\n\r\nThis document likewise includes a list of the participants in this\r\nconference which closely parallels the structure of the group as set\r\nforth in the Indictment. The list includes General Field Marshal von\r\nBrauchitsch, who was then Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and a member\r\nof the group; and General Halder, who was chief of the Army Staff, and a\r\nmember of the group. Then there are three subordinates who were not\r\nmembers of the group: Paulus, Heusinger, and Gyldenfeldt. Next is navy\r\nCaptain Wagner, who was chief of the Operations Staff, Operations\r\nDivision of the Naval War Staff, not a member of the group. On the air\r\nside there were General Milch, State Secretary and Inspector of the Air\r\nForce, again not a member of the group; General Joschonnek, chief of the\r\nGeneral Staff of the Air Force and a member of the group; and two of his\r\nassistants. Passing to the OKW, High Command of the Armed Forces, we\r\nfind that Keitel, Jodl, Warlimont, all members of the group, were\r\npresent, with an assistant from the General Staff. Then there were four\r\nofficers from the office of the adjutant, who were not members of the\r\ngroup. Present from the Field Commanders were General von Falkenhorst,\r\nArmy High Command, Norway, member of the group; General Stumpff, Air\r\nFleet 5, member of the group; Rundstedt, Reichenau, Stuelpnagel,\r\nSchobert, Kleist, all from the Army, all members of the group. Of the\r\nAir Force officers present, General Loehr, Air Fleet 4, was a member of\r\nthe group; General Fromm and General Udet were not members. One was\r\ndirector of the Home Forces, commander of the Home Forces, and the other\r\nthe Director General of Equipment and Supply. Turning to the Navy, those\r\npresent were Raeder, a member of the group; Fricke, chief of the Naval\r\nWar Staff, and a member of the group; and an assistant who was not a\r\nmember, Carls, Navy Group North, member of the group, and likewise\r\nSchmundt were present. Then from the Army, Leeb, Busch, Kuechler, all\r\nmembers of the group as _Oberbefehlshaber_, and Keller, a member of the\r\ngroup, were present. Also Bock, Kluge, Strauss, Guderian, Hoth,\r\nKesselring, all members of the group, were present. It will be seen\r\nthat, except for a few assisting officers of relatively junior rank, all\r\nthe participants in these consultations were members of the group, and\r\nthat in fact the participants in these consultations included the\r\nmembers of the group who were concerned in the impending operations\r\nagainst the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\n B. _Criminal Activities of the General Staff and High Command Group._\r\n\r\nThe General Staff and High Command group is well represented among the\r\nindividual defendants in this case. It must be kept in mind that this\r\ngroup may be declared criminal in connection with any act of which an\r\nindividual defendant who is a member of the group may be convicted\r\n(Charter, Article 9). Five of the individual defendants, or one-quarter\r\nof the total number accused, are members of this group.\r\n\r\nIn the order of listing in the indictments, the first is Goering.\r\nGoering is a defendant in this case in numerous capacities. He is a\r\nmember of the General Staff and High Command group by reason of having\r\nbeen the Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force from the time when the Air\r\nForce first came into the open, and was officially established, until\r\nabout a month prior to the end of the war. During the last month of the\r\nwar he was replaced in this capacity by von Greim, who committed suicide\r\nshortly after his capture at the end of the war. Goering is charged with\r\ncrimes under all counts of the Indictment.\r\n\r\nThe next listed defendant who is a member of the group is Keitel. He and\r\nthe remaining three defendants who are members of the group are all four\r\nin this case primarily or solely in their military capacities, and all\r\nfour of them were professional soldiers or sailors. Keitel was made the\r\nchief of the High Command of the German Armed Forces (OKW) when the OKW\r\nwas first set up in 1938, and remained in that capacity throughout the\r\nperiod in question. He held the rank of Field Marshall throughout most\r\nof this period, and in addition to being the Chief of OKW, he was a\r\nmember of the Secret Cabinet Council and of the Council of Ministers for\r\nthe Defense of the Reich. Keitel is charged with crimes under all four\r\ncounts of the Indictment.\r\n\r\nThe defendant Jodl was a career soldier; he was an _Oberstleutnant_\r\n(Lieutenant Colonel) when the Nazis came to power, and ultimately\r\nattained the rank of _Generaloberst_ (Colonel General). He became the\r\nChief of the Operations Staff of the _Wehrmacht_, and continued in that\r\ncapacity throughout the war. He also is charged with crimes under all\r\nfour counts of the Indictment.\r\n\r\nThe defendant Raeder is in a sense the senior member of the entire\r\ngroup, having been Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy as early as\r\n1928. He attained the highest rank in the German Navy, _Grossadmiral_,\r\nand in addition to being Commander-in-Chief of the Navy he was a member\r\nof the Secret Cabinet Council. He retired from Supreme Command of the\r\nNavy in January 1943, and was replaced by Doenitz. Raeder is charged\r\nwith crimes under counts 1, 2, and 3 of the Indictment.\r\n\r\nThe last of these five defendants, Doenitz, was a relatively junior\r\nofficer when the Nazis came to power. During the early years of the Nazi\r\nregime he specialized in submarine activities and was in command of the\r\nU-boat arm when the war broke out. He rose steadily in the Navy and was\r\nchosen to succeed Raeder when the latter retired in 1943. Doenitz then\r\nbecame Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and attained the rank of\r\n_Grossadmiral_. When the German Armed Forces collapsed near the end of\r\nthe war, Doenitz succeeded Hitler as head of the German government. He\r\nis charged with crimes under counts 1, 2, and 3 of the Indictment.\r\n\r\nFour of these five defendants are reasonably typical of the group as a\r\nwhole. Goering is an exception: he is primarily a Nazi party politician\r\nnourishing a hobby for aviation as a result of his career in 1914-18.\r\nBut the others made soldiering or sailoring their life work. They\r\ncollaborated with and joined in the most important adventures of the\r\nNazis, but they were not among the early party members. They differ in\r\nno essential respect from the other 125 odd members of the group. They\r\nare, no doubt, abler men in certain respects than some of the other\r\nmembers, as they rose to the highest positions in the German Armed\r\nForces, and all but Jodl attained the highest rank. But they are\r\ngenerally representative of the group, and their expressed ideas and\r\nactions are fairly characteristic of those of the other group members.\r\n\r\nIt is not, of course, the prosecution’s position, and it is not\r\nessential to its case, that all 130 members of this group, (or all the\r\nmembers of any other organization or group named in the Indictment),\r\nactually committed crimes, under Article 6 of the Charter. It is the\r\nprosecution’s position that the leadership of the group and the purposes\r\nto which the group was committed by the leaders were criminal under\r\nArticle 6. The individual defendants were among the leaders of the\r\nGeneral Staff and High Command group, and, acting in the official\r\ncapacities which made them members of the group, they performed and\r\nparticipated in acts which are criminal under Article 6 of the Charter.\r\nOther members of the group performed such acts. The German Armed Forces\r\nwere so completely under the group’s control as to make the group\r\nresponsible for their activities under the last sentence of Article 6 of\r\nthe Charter.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Planning and Launching of Wars of Aggression._ It is, of\r\ncourse, the normal function of a military staff to prepare military\r\nplans. In peacetime, military staffs customarily concern themselves with\r\nthe preparation of plans of attack or defense based on hypothetical\r\ncontingencies. There is nothing criminal about carrying on such\r\nexercises or preparing such plans. That is not what these defendants and\r\nthis group are charged with.\r\n\r\nThis group agreed with the Nazi objective of aggrandizing Germany by\r\nforce or threat of force. They joined knowingly and enthusiastically in\r\ndeveloping German armed might for this criminal purpose. They joined\r\nknowingly and willfully in initiating and waging aggressive wars. They\r\nwere advised in advance of the Nazi plans to launch aggressive wars.\r\nThey laid the military plans and directed the initiation and carrying on\r\nof the wars. These things are criminal under article 6 of the Charter.\r\n\r\nAggressive war cannot be prepared and waged without intense activity on\r\nthe part of all branches of the Armed Forces and particularly by the\r\nhigh-ranking officers who control such forces. To the extent, therefore,\r\nthat German preparations for and waging of aggressive war are historical\r\nfacts of common knowledge, or are proved, it necessarily follows that\r\nthe General Staff and High Command group, and the German Armed Forces,\r\nparticipated therein.\r\n\r\nThis is so notwithstanding the effort on the part of certain military\r\nleaders of Germany, after defeat, to insist that until the troops\r\nmarched they lived in an ivory tower of military technicalities, unable\r\nor unwilling to observe the end to which their work led. The documentary\r\nevidence which follows fully refutes any such contentions.\r\n\r\nThe purposes and objectives of the German General Staff and High Command\r\ngroup during the period prior to the absorption of Austria may be\r\nsummarized as follows:\r\n\r\n    (i) Secret rearmament, including the training of military\r\n    personnel, the production of war munitions, and the building of\r\n    an air force;\r\n\r\n    (ii) The creation of a military air force, announced by Goering\r\n    on 10 March 1935;\r\n\r\n    (iii) The law for compulsory military service, of 16 March 1935,\r\n    fixing the peace-time strength of the German Army at 500,000;\r\n    and\r\n\r\n    (iv) The reoccupation of the Rhineland on 7 March 1936 and the\r\n    refortification of that area.\r\n\r\nThese events are historical facts not requiring proof. Likewise, the\r\nimpossibility of the Nazis’ achieving these ends without cooperation by\r\nthe Armed Forces is indisputable from the very nature of things.\r\n\r\nEvents and circumstances during the period 1933-36 are discussed in\r\nSection 2 of Chapter IX. Chief among these were the secret expansion of\r\nthe German Navy in violation of treaty limitations, under the guidance\r\nof Raeder; the secret Reich Defense Law of 21 May 1935, adopted the same\r\nday that Germany unilaterally renounced the armament provision of the\r\nVersailles Treaty (_2261-PS_); von Blomberg’s plan, 2 May 1935, for the\r\nreoccupation of the Rhineland (_C-139_); and von Blomberg’s orders of 2\r\nMarch 1936 under which the reoccupation was actually carried out\r\n(_C-159_). All these events clearly required the closest collaboration\r\nbetween the military leaders and the Nazis.\r\n\r\nThe state of mind and objectives of the German military leaders during\r\nthis early period are significant. The viewpoint of the German Navy on\r\nthe opportunities which Naziism offered for rearmament so that Germany\r\ncould achieve its objectives by force or threat of force, is reflected\r\nin a memorandum published by the High Command of the German Navy in 1937\r\nentitled “The Fight of the Navy against Versailles, 1919-35” (_C-156_).\r\nThis memorandum was compiled by a naval captain named Schuessler in the\r\nGerman Admiralty. The preface contains the following statements:\r\n\r\n    “The object and aim of this memorandum is to draw a technically\r\n    reliable picture based on documentary records and the evidence\r\n    of those who took part, of the fight of the Navy against the\r\n    unbearable regulations of the Peace Treaty of Versailles.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “This compilation makes it clearer however, that even such ideal\r\n    and ambitious plans can be realized only to a small degree if\r\n    the concentrated and united strength of the whole people is not\r\n    behind the courageous activity of the soldier. Only when the\r\n    Fuehrer had created the second and even more important condition\r\n    for an effective rearmament, in the coordination of the whole\r\n    nation and in the fusion of the political, financial and\r\n    spiritual powers, could the work of the soldier find its\r\n    fulfilment.\r\n\r\n    “The framework of this Peace Treaty, the most shameful known in\r\n    world history, collapsed under the driving power of this united\r\n    will.” (_C-156_)\r\n\r\nThus, the German Navy and the Nazis were in comradely agreement and full\r\ncollaboration. Hitler was giving the military leaders the chance they\r\nwanted. Jodl stated the situation clearly in his speech to the\r\nGauleiters on 7 November 1943 (_L-172_):\r\n\r\n    “1. The fact that the National-Socialist movement and its\r\n    struggle for internal power were the preparatory stage of the\r\n    outer liberation from the bonds of the Dictate of Versailles is\r\n    not one on which I need enlarge in this circle. I should like\r\n    however to mention at this point how clearly all thoughtful\r\n    regular soldiers realize what an important part has been played\r\n    by the National-Socialist movement in re-awakening the will to\r\n    fight [_Wehrwillen_] in nurturing fighting strength\r\n    [_Wehrkraft_] and in rearming the German people. In spite of all\r\n    the virtue inherent in it, the numerically small _Reichswehr_\r\n    would never have been able to cope with this task, if only\r\n    because of its own restricted radius of action. Indeed, what the\r\n    Fuehrer aimed at—and has so happily been successful in bringing\r\n    about—was the fusion of these two forces.\r\n\r\n    “2. The seizure of power in its turn has meant in the first\r\n    place restoration of fighting sovereignty [_Wehrhoheit_]\r\n    (conscription, occupation of the Rhineland) and rearmament with\r\n    special emphasis being laid on the creation of a modern armoured\r\n    and air arm.” (_L-172_)\r\n\r\nNor were the high-ranking German officers unaware that the policies and\r\nobjectives of the Nazis were leading Germany in the direction of war.\r\nNotes made by Admiral Carls of the German Navy in September 1938 by way\r\nof comment on a “Draft study of Naval Warfare against England,” read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “A. There is full agreement with the main theme of the study.\r\n\r\n    “1. If according to the Fuehrer’s decision Germany is to acquire\r\n    a position as a world power she needs not only sufficient\r\n    colonial possessions but also secure naval communications and\r\n    secure access to the ocean.\r\n\r\n    “2. Both requirements can only be fulfilled in opposition to\r\n    Anglo-French interests and would limit their position as world\r\n    powers. It is unlikely that they can be achieved by peaceful\r\n    means. The decision to make Germany a world power therefore\r\n    forces upon us the necessity of making the corresponding\r\n    preparations for war.\r\n\r\n    “3. War against England means at the same time war against the\r\n    Empire, against France, probably against Russia as well and a\r\n    large number of countries overseas, in fact against one-half to\r\n    one-third of the whole world.\r\n\r\n    “It can only be justified and have a chance of success if it is\r\n    prepared _economically_ as well as _politically_ and\r\n    _militarily_ and waged with the aim of conquering for Germany an\r\n    outlet to the ocean.” (_C-23_)\r\n\r\nThe German Air Force, during this prewar period, was developing even\r\nmore radically aggressive plans for the aggrandizement of the Reich. A\r\nstudy prepared by the chief, Kammhuber, of a branch of the General Staff\r\nof the Air Force called the “Organization Staff”, contained\r\nrecommendations for the organization of the German Air Force in future\r\nyears up to 1950 (_L-43_). The recommendations are based on certain\r\nassumptions, one of which was that by 1950 the frontiers of Germany\r\nwould be as shown on the map which is attached as an inclosure to this\r\nstudy (_Chart Number 10_). On this map Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,\r\nPoland, and the Baltic coast up to the Gulf of Finland are all included\r\nwithin the borders of the Reich. Kammhuber also envisaged the future\r\npeacetime organization of the German Air Force as comprising seven\r\n“Group Commands.” Four of these were to lie within the borders of\r\nGermany proper, at Berlin, Brunswick, Munich, and Koenigsberg, but the\r\nthree others are proposed to be at Vienna, Budapest, and Warsaw.\r\n(_L-43_)\r\n\r\nThe basic agreement and harmony between the Nazis and the German\r\nmilitary leaders cannot be overemphasized. Without this agreement on\r\nobjectives there might never have been a war. In this connection, an\r\naffidavit (_3704-PS_) by von Blomberg, formerly Field Marshall, Reich\r\nWar Minister, and Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces until\r\nFebruary 1938, is significant:\r\n\r\n    “From 1919, and particularly from 1924, three critical\r\n    territorial questions occupied attention in Germany. These were\r\n    the questions of the Polish Corridor, the Ruhr and Memel.\r\n\r\n    “I myself, as well as the whole group of German staff officers,\r\n    believed that these three questions, outstanding among which was\r\n    the question of the Polish Corridor, would have to be settled\r\n    some day, if necessary by force of arms. About ninety percent of\r\n    the German people were of the same mind as the officers on the\r\n    Polish question. A war to wipe out the desecration involved in\r\n    the creation of the Polish Corridor and to lessen the threat to\r\n    separated East Prussia surrounded by Poland and Lithuania was\r\n    regarded as a sacred duty though a sad necessity. This was one\r\n    of the chief reasons behind the partially secret rearmament\r\n    which began about ten years before Hitler came to power and was\r\n    accentuated under Nazi rule.\r\n\r\n    “Before 1938-1939 the German generals were not opposed to\r\n    Hitler. There was no reason to oppose Hitler since he produced\r\n    the results which they desired. After this time some generals\r\n    began to condemn his methods and lost confidence in the power of\r\n    his judgment. However they failed as a group to take any\r\n    definite stand against him, although a few of them tried to do\r\n    so and as a result had to pay for this with their lives or their\r\n    positions.\r\n\r\n    “Shortly before my removal from the post of Commander-in-Chief\r\n    of the Armed Forces in January 1938, Hitler asked me to\r\n    recommend a successor. I suggested Goering, who was the ranking\r\n    officer, but Hitler objected because of his lack of patience and\r\n    diligence. I was replaced as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed\r\n    Forces by no officer, but Hitler personally took over my\r\n    function as Commander. Keitel was recommended by me as a Chef de\r\n    bureau. As far as I know he was never named Commander of the\r\n    Armed Forces but was always merely a ‘Chief of Staff’ under\r\n    Hitler and in effect conducted the administrative functions of\r\n    the Ministry of War. At my time Keitel was not opposed to Hitler\r\n    and therefore was qualified to bring about a good understanding\r\n    between Hitler and the Armed Forces, a thing which I myself\r\n    desired and had furthered as _Reichswehrminister_ and\r\n    _Reichskriegsminister_. To do the opposite would have led to a\r\n    civil war, for at that time the mass of the German people\r\n    supported Hitler. Many are no longer willing to admit this. But\r\n    it is the truth.\r\n\r\n    “As I heard, Keitel did not oppose any of Hitler’s measures. He\r\n    became a willing tool in Hitler’s hands for every one of his\r\n    decisions.\r\n\r\n    “He did not measure up to what might have been expected of him.”\r\n    (_3704-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis statement by von Blomberg is paralleled closely in some respects by\r\nan affidavit by Colonel General Blaskowitz (_3706-PS_). Blaskowitz\r\ncommanded an army in the campaign against Poland and the campaign\r\nagainst France. He subsequently took command of Army Group G in southern\r\nFrance, and held command of Army Group H, which retreated beyond the\r\nRhine at the end of the war. His statement is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * After the annexation of Czechoslovakia we hoped that the\r\n    Polish question would be settled in a peaceful fashion through\r\n    diplomatic means, since we believed that this time France and\r\n    England would come to the assistance of their ally. As a matter\r\n    of fact we felt that, if political negotiations came to naught,\r\n    the Polish question would unavoidably lead to war, that is, not\r\n    only with Poland herself, but also with the Western Powers.\r\n\r\n    “When in the middle of June I received an order from the OKH to\r\n    prepare myself for an attack on Poland, I knew that this war\r\n    came even closer to the realm of possibility. This conclusion\r\n    was only strengthened by the Fuehrer’s speech on 22 August 1939\r\n    on the Obersalzberg when it clearly seemed to be an actuality.\r\n    Between the middle of June 1939 and 1 September 1939 the members\r\n    of my staff who were engaged in preparations, participated in\r\n    various discussions which went on between the OKH and the army\r\n    group. During these discussions such matters of a tactical,\r\n    strategic and general nature were discussed as had to do with my\r\n    future position as Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Army during\r\n    the planned Polish campaign.\r\n\r\n    “During the Polish campaign, particularly during the Kutno\r\n    operations, I was repeatedly in communication with the\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and he, as well as the Fuehrer,\r\n    visited my headquarters. In fact it was common practice for\r\n    commanders-in-chief of army groups and of armies to be asked\r\n    from time to time for estimates of the situation and for their\r\n    recommendations by telephone, teletype or wireless, as well as\r\n    by personal calls. These front commanders-in-chief thus actually\r\n    became advisers to the OKH in their own field so that the\r\n    positions shown in the attached chart embrace that group which\r\n    was the actual advisory council of the High Command of the\r\n    German Armed Forces.” (_3706-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that General Blaskowitz, like Colonel General Halder\r\nand Field Marshall von Brauchitsch, vouches for the accuracy of the\r\nstructure and organization of the General Staff and High Command group\r\nas described by the prosecution.\r\n\r\nIt is, accordingly, clear beyond dispute that the military leaders of\r\nGermany knew of, approved, supported, and executed plans for the\r\nexpansion of the Armed Forces beyond the limits set by treaties. The\r\nobjectives they had in mind are obvious from the affidavits and\r\ndocuments to which reference has been made. In these documents and\r\naffidavits we see the Nazis and the Generals in agreement upon the basic\r\nobjective of aggrandizing Germany by force or threat of force, and\r\ncollaborating to build up the armed might of Germany in order to make\r\npossible the subsequent acts of aggression.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Austria._ Notes taken by Colonel Hossbach of a conference held in\r\nthe Reich Chancellery in Berlin on 5 November 1937 show that this\r\nconference, at which Hitler presided, was small and highly secret\r\n(_386-PS_). The only other participants were the four principal military\r\nleaders, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (von Neurath), and Hossbach\r\nacting as Secretary. The four chief leaders of the Armed\r\nForces—Blomberg, who was then Reich Minister for War, and the\r\nCommanders-in-Chief of the three branches of the Armed Forces, von\r\nFritsch for the Army, Raeder for the Navy, and Goering for the Air\r\nForce—were present. Hitler embarked on a general discussion of\r\nGermany’s diplomatic and military policy, and stated that the conquest\r\nof Austria and Czechoslovakia was an essential preliminary “for the\r\nimprovement of our military position” and “in order to remove any threat\r\nfrom the flanks”. (_386-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe military and political advantages envisaged included the acquisition\r\nof a new source of food, shorter and better frontiers, the release of\r\ntroops for other tasks, and the possibility of forming new divisions\r\nfrom the population of the conquered territories. Von Blomberg and von\r\nFritsch joined in the discussion and von Fritsch stated:\r\n\r\n    “That it was the purpose of a study which he had laid on for\r\n    this winter to investigate the possibilities of carrying out\r\n    operations against Czechoslovakia with special consideration of\r\n    the conquest of the Czechoslovakian system of fortifications”\r\n    (_386-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn the following Spring, March 1938, the German plans with respect to\r\nAustria came to fruition. Entries in the diary kept by Jodl show the\r\nparticipation of the German military leaders in the absorption of\r\nAustria (_1780-PS_). As is shown by Jodl’s diary entry for 11 February\r\n1938, Keitel and other generals were present at the Obersalzberg meeting\r\nbetween Schuschnigg and Hitler:\r\n\r\n    “_11 February_\r\n\r\n    “In the evening and on 12 February General K. with General V.\r\n    Reichenau and Sperrle at the Obersalzberg. Schuschnigg together\r\n    with G. Schmidt are again being put under heaviest political and\r\n    military pressure. At 2300 hours Schuschnigg signs protocol”.\r\n    (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nTwo days later Keitel and others were preparing proposals to be\r\nsubmitted to Hitler which would give the Austrian government the\r\nimpression that Germany would resort to force unless the Schuschnigg\r\nagreement was ratified in Vienna:\r\n\r\n    “_13 February_\r\n\r\n    “In the afternoon General K. asks Admiral C. and myself to come\r\n    to his apartment. He tells us that the Fuehrer order is to the\r\n    effect that military pressure by shamming military action should\r\n    be kept up until the 15th. Proposals for these deceptive\r\n    maneuvers are drafted and submitted to the Fuehrer by telephone\r\n    for approval”. (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese proposals are embodied in a document 14 February 1938 and signed\r\nby Keitel (_1775-PS_). Portions of Keitel’s proposals to the Fuehrer are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. To take no real preparatory measures in the Army or\r\n    Luftwaffe. No troop movements or redeployments.\r\n\r\n    “2. Spread false, but quite credible news, which may lead to the\r\n    conclusion of military preparations against Austria,\r\n\r\n        “_a._ through V-men (_V-Maenner_) in Austria,\r\n        “_b._ through our customs personnel (staff) at the frontier,\r\n        “_c._ through travelling agents.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “4. Order a very active make-believe wireless exchange in\r\n    _Wehrkreis VII_ and between Berlin and Munich.\r\n\r\n    “5. Real maneuvers, training flights, and winter maneuvers of\r\n    the Mountain Troops near the frontier.\r\n\r\n    “6. Admiral Canaris has to be ready beginning on February 14th\r\n    in the Service Command Headquarters in order to carry out\r\n    measures given by order of the Chief of the OKW.” (_1775-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs Jodl’s diary entry for 14 February shows, these deceptive maneuvers\r\nand threats of force were very effective in Austria:\r\n\r\n    “The effect is quick and strong. In Austria the impression is\r\n    created that Germany is undertaking serious military\r\n    preparations.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nAbout a month later armed intervention was precipitated by Schuschnigg’s\r\ndecision to hold a plebiscite in Austria. Hitler ordered mobilization in\r\naccordance with the preexisting plans for the invasion of Austria (these\r\nplans were known as “Case Otto”) in order to absorb Austria and stop the\r\nplebiscite. Jodl’s diary entry for 10 March 1938 states:\r\n\r\n    “By surprise and without consulting the ministers, Schuschnigg\r\n    ordered a plebiscite for Sunday, 13 March, which should bring\r\n    strong majority for the Legitimists in the absence of plan or\r\n    preparation.\r\n\r\n    “Fuehrer is determined not to tolerate it. The same night, March\r\n    9 to 10, he calls for Goering, General V. Reichenau is called\r\n    back from Cairo Olympic Committee. General V. Schobert is\r\n    ordered to come, as well as Minister Glaise Horstenau, who is\r\n    with the District Leader [_Gauleiter_] Burckel in the\r\n    Palatinate. General Keitel communicates the facts at 1:45. He\r\n    drives to the Reichskanzlei at 10 o’clock. I follow at 10:15,\r\n    according to the wish of General V. Viebahn, to give him the old\r\n    draft.\r\n\r\n    ‘Prepare case Otto’.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn an order 11 March, initialed by Keitel and Jodl, Hitler laid down the\r\ngeneral instructions for the invasion, and directed that the Army and\r\nAir Force be ready for action by 12 March (_C-102_). On the same evening\r\nHitler ordered the invasion of Austria to commence at daybreak on 12\r\nMarch. The order was initialed by Jodl. (_C-182_)\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Austria differs from the other German acts of aggression\r\nin that the invasion was not closely scheduled and timed in advance.\r\nThis was so simple because the invasion was precipitated by an outside\r\nevent, Schuschnigg’s order for the plebiscite. But although for this\r\nreason the element of deliberately timed planning was lacking, the\r\nforegoing documents make abundantly clear the participation of the\r\nmilitary leaders at all stages. At the small policy meeting in November\r\n1937, when Hitler’s general program for Austria and Czechoslovakia was\r\noutlined, the only others present were the four principal military\r\nleaders and the Foreign Secretary (_386-PS_). In February, Keitel,\r\nReichenau, and Sperrle were present at Obersalzberg to help subject\r\nSchuschnigg to “the heaviest military pressure” (_1780-PS_). Keitel and\r\nothers immediately thereafter worked out and executed a program of\r\nmilitary threat and deception for frightening the Austrian Government\r\ninto acceptance of the Schuschnigg protocol (_1775-PS_). When the actual\r\ninvasion took place it was, of course, directed by the military leaders\r\nand executed by the German Armed Forces. Jodl has given a clear\r\nstatement of why the German military leaders were delighted to join with\r\nthe Nazis in bringing about the end of Austrian independence. In his\r\nlecture to the Gauleiters in November 1943 (_L-172_) Jodl explained:\r\n\r\n    “The Austrian ‘Anschluss’, in its turn, brought with it not only\r\n    fulfilment of an old national aim but also had the effect both\r\n    of reinforcing our fighting strength and of materially improving\r\n    our strategic position. Whereas up till then the territory of\r\n    Czechoslovakia had projected in a most menacing way right into\r\n    Germany (a wasp waist in the direction of France and an air base\r\n    for the Allies, in particular Russia), Czechoslovakia herself\r\n    was now enclosed by pincers. Its own strategic position had now\r\n    become so unfavorable that she was bound to fall a victim to any\r\n    attack pressed home with vigour before effective aid from the\r\n    West could be expected to arrive”. (_L-172_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Czechoslovakia._\r\n\r\nThe steps in the planning for the invasion of Czechoslovakia (“Case\r\nGreen” or Fall Gruen) bear the evidence of knowing and wilful\r\nparticipation by Keitel, Jodl, and other members of the General Staff\r\nand High Command Group.\r\n\r\nThe Hossbach minutes of the conference between Hitler and the four\r\nprincipal German military leaders on 5 November 1937 show, that Austria\r\nand Czechoslovakia were then listed as the first intended victims of\r\nGerman aggression (_386-PS_). After the absorption of Austria in March\r\n1938, Hitler as head of the State and Keitel as Chief of all the armed\r\nforces lost no time in turning their attention to Czechoslovakia. In the\r\nHitler-Keitel discussions on 21 April 1938 a nice balance of political\r\nand military factors was worked out (_388-PS_):\r\n\r\n                         “A. _Political Aspect_\r\n\r\n1. Strategic surprise attack out of a clear sky without any cause or\r\npossibility of justification has been turned down. As result would be:\r\nhostile world opinion which can lead to a critical situation. Such a\r\nmeasure is justified only for the elimination of the last opponent on\r\nthe mainland.\r\n\r\n2. Action after a time of diplomatic clashes, which gradually come to a\r\ncrisis and lead to war.\r\n\r\n3. Lightning-swift action as the result of an incident (e.g.\r\nassassination of German ambassador in connection with an anti-German\r\ndemonstration).\r\n\r\n                       B. _Military Conclusions_\r\n\r\n1. The preparations are to be made for the political possibilities 2 and\r\n3. Case 2 is the undesired one since “Gruen” will have taken security\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n*            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n4. Politically, the first 4 days of military action are the decisive\r\nones. If there are no effective military successes, a European crisis\r\nwill certainly arise. Accomplished facts must prove the senselessness of\r\nforeign military intervention, draw Allies into the scheme (division of\r\nspoils!) and demoralize “Gruen”.\r\n\r\nTherefore: bridging the time gap between first penetration and\r\nemployment of the forces to be brought up, by a determined and ruthless\r\nthrust by a motorized army. (e.g. via Pi past Pr) [Pilsen, Prague].\r\n(_388-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrom this point on, nearly the whole story is contained in the Schmundt\r\nfile (_388-PS_) and in Jodl’s diary (_1780-PS_). These two sources of\r\ninformation demolish in advance what will, no doubt, be urged in defense\r\nof the military defendants and the General Staff and High Command Group.\r\nThey will seek to create the impression that the German generals were\r\npure military technicians; that they were uninterested and uninformed\r\nabout political and diplomatic considerations and events; that they\r\npassed their days mounting mock battles at the _Kriegsakadamie_; that\r\nthey prepared plans for military attack or defense, on a purely\r\nhypothetical basis. They will say all this in order to suggest that they\r\ndid not share and could not estimate Hitler’s aggressive intentions, and\r\nthat they carried out politically conceived orders like military\r\nautomatons, with no idea whether the wars they launched and waged were\r\naggressive or not.\r\n\r\nIf these arguments are made, the Schmundt file (_388-PS_) and Jodl’s\r\ndiary (_1780-PS_) make it abundantly apparent that aggressive designs\r\nwere conceived jointly between the Nazis and the generals; that the\r\nmilitary leaders were fully posted on the aggressive intentions of the\r\nNazis; that they were fully informed of political and diplomatic\r\ndevelopments; that indeed German generals had a habit of turning up at\r\ndiplomatic gatherings.\r\n\r\nIf the documents did not show these things so clearly, a moment’s\r\nthought must show them to be true. A highly successful program of\r\nconquest depends on armed might, and cannot be executed with an\r\nunprepared, weak, or recalcitrant military leadership. It has, of\r\ncourse, been said that war is too important a business to be left to\r\nsoldiers alone. It is equally true that aggressive diplomacy is far too\r\ndangerous a business to be conducted without military advice and\r\nmilitary support.\r\n\r\nNo doubt some of the German generals had qualms about Hitler’s timing\r\nand the boldness of some of his moves. Some of these doubts are rather\r\namusingly reflected in an entry in Jodl’s diary for 10 August 1938:\r\n\r\n    “The Army chiefs and the chiefs of the Air Force groups, Lt.\r\n    Col. Jeschonnek and myself are ordered to the Berghof. After\r\n    dinner the Fuehrer makes a speech lasting for almost three\r\n    hours, in which he develops his political thoughts. The\r\n    subsequent attempts to draw the Fuehrer’s attention to the\r\n    defects of our preparation, which are undertaken by a few\r\n    generals of the Army, are rather unfortunate. This applies\r\n    especially to the remark of General Wietersheim, in which to top\r\n    it off he claims to quote from General Adams [_die er noch dazu\r\n    dem General Adams in den Mund legt_] that the western\r\n    fortifications can only be held for three weeks. The Fuehrer\r\n    becomes very indignant and flames up, bursting into the remark\r\n    that in such a case the whole Army would not be good for\r\n    anything. ‘I assure you, General, the position will not only be\r\n    held for three weeks, but for three years.’ The cause of this\r\n    despondent opinion, which unfortunately enough is held very\r\n    widely within the Army General Staff, is based on various\r\n    reasons. First of all, it [the General Staff] is restrained by\r\n    old memories; political considerations play a part as well,\r\n    instead of obeying and executing its military mission. That is\r\n    certainly done with traditional devotion, but the vigor of the\r\n    soul is lacking because in the end they do not believe in the\r\n    genius of the Fuehrer. And one does perhaps compare him with\r\n    Charles XII. And since water flows downhill, this defeatism may\r\n    not only possibly cause immense political damage, for the\r\n    opposition between the General’s opinion and that of the Fuehrer\r\n    is common talk, but may also constitute a danger for the morale\r\n    of the troops. But I have no doubt that [?] the Fuehrer will be\r\n    able to boost the morale of the people in an unexpected way when\r\n    the right moment comes.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nBut if this entry shows that some of the German generals at that time\r\nwere cautious with respect to Germany’s ability to take on Poland and\r\nthe Western Powers simultaneously, nonetheless the entry shows no lack\r\nof sympathy with the Nazi aims for conquest. And there is no evidence in\r\nJodl’s diary or elsewhere that any substantial number of German generals\r\nlacked sympathy with Hitler’s objectives. Furthermore, the top military\r\nleaders always joined with and supported his decisions, with formidable\r\nsuccess in the years from 1938 to 1942.\r\n\r\nIf it is said that German military leaders did not know that German\r\ngeneral policy toward Czechoslovakia was aggressive, or based on force\r\nand threat of force, it may be noted that on 30 May 1938 Hitler signed a\r\nMost Secret directive to Keitel (_388-PS Item 11_) in which he said:\r\n\r\n    “It is my unalterable decision to smash Czechoslovakia by\r\n    military action in the near future. It is the job of the\r\n    political leaders to await or bring about the politically and\r\n    militarily suitable moment.\r\n\r\n    “An inevitable development of conditions inside Czechoslovakia\r\n    or other political events in Europe creating a surprisingly\r\n    favorable opportunity and one which may never come again may\r\n    cause me to take early action.\r\n\r\n    “The proper choice and determined and full utilization of a\r\n    favorable moment is the surest guarantee of success. Accordingly\r\n    the preparations are to be made at once.” (_388-PS Item 11_)\r\n\r\nJodl was in no doubt what this meant. He noted in his diary that same\r\nday:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer signs directive ‘Green’, where he states his final\r\n    decision to destroy Czechoslovakia soon and thereby initiates\r\n    military preparation all along the line”. (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe succeeding evidence in the Schmundt file (_388-PS Items 14, 16, 17_)\r\nand in the Jodl diary (_1780-PS_) shows how those military preparations\r\nwent forward “all along the line.” Numerous examples of discussions,\r\nplanning, and preparation during the last few weeks before the Munich\r\nPact, including discussions with Hungary and the Hungarian General Staff\r\nin which General Halder participated, are contained in the Jodl diary\r\n(_1780-PS_) and the later items in the Schmundt file (_388-PS Items 18\r\nto 22, 24, 26 to 28, 31 to 34, 36 to 54_). The day the Munich Pact was\r\nsigned, Jodl noted in his diary:\r\n\r\n    “The Munich Pact is signed. Czechoslovakia as a power is out.\r\n    Four zones as set forth will be occupied between the 2nd and 7th\r\n    of October. The remaining part of mainly German character will\r\n    be occupied by the 10th of October. The genius of the Fuehrer\r\n    and his determination not to shun even a World War have again\r\n    won the victory without the use of force. The hope remains that\r\n    the incredulous, the weak and the doubtful people have been\r\n    converted and will remain that way.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nPlans for the “liquidation” of the remainder of Czechoslovakia were made\r\nsoon after Munich (_388-PS Item 40_; _C-136_; _C-138_). Ultimately the\r\nabsorption was accomplished by diplomatic bullying in which Keitel\r\nparticipated for the usual purposes of demonstrating that German armed\r\nmight was ready to enforce the threats (_2802-PS_). Once again, Jodl in\r\nhis 1943 lecture (_L-172_) explained clearly why the objective of\r\neliminating Czechoslovakia lay as close to the hearts of the German\r\nmilitary leaders as to the hearts of the Nazis:\r\n\r\n    “The bloodless solution of the Czech conflict in the autumn of\r\n    1938 and spring of 1939 and the annexation of Slovakia rounded\r\n    off the territory of Greater Germany in such a way that it then\r\n    became possible to consider the Polish problem on the basis of\r\n    more or less favorable strategic premises.” (_L-172_)\r\n\r\nThis serves to recall the affidavits by Blomberg (_3704-PS_) and\r\nBlaskowitz (_3706-PS_) already quoted:\r\n\r\n    “The whole group of German staff and front officers believed\r\n    that the question of the Polish Corridor would have to be\r\n    settled some day, if necessary by force of arms.”\r\n\r\n    “A war to wipe out the political and economic losses resulting\r\n    from the creation of the Polish Corridor was regarded as a\r\n    sacred duty though a sad necessity.”\r\n\r\n    “Before 1938-39, the German generals were not opposed to\r\n    Hitler.”\r\n\r\n    “Hitler produced the results which all of us warmly desired.”\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Poland._ The story of the German attack on Poland furnishes an\r\nexcellent case study of the functioning of the General Staff and High\r\nCommand Group.\r\n\r\nReference is made to the series of directives from Hitler and Keitel\r\ninvolving “Fall Weiss” (_C-120_). The series starts with a re-issuance\r\nof the “Directive for the Uniform Preparation for War by the Armed\r\nForces”. This periodically re-issued directive was encountered\r\npreviously in the case of Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nIn essence these directives are (_a_) statements of what the Armed\r\nForces must be prepared to accomplish in view of political and\r\ndiplomatic policies and developments, and (_b_) indications of what\r\nshould be accomplished diplomatically in order to make the military\r\ntasks easier and the chances of success greater. They constitute, in\r\nfact, a fusion of diplomatic and military thought and strongly\r\ndemonstrate the mutual inter-dependence of aggressive diplomacy and\r\nmilitary planning. The distribution of these documents early in April\r\n1939, in which the preparations of plans for the Polish war is ordered,\r\nwas limited. Five copies only are distributed by Keitel: one to\r\nBrauchitsch (OKH), one to Raeder (OKM), one to Goering (OKL), and two to\r\nWarlimont in the Planning Branch of OKW. Hitler lays down that the plan\r\nmust be susceptible of execution by 1 September 1939, and that target\r\ndate was adhered to. The fusion of military and diplomatic thought is\r\nclearly brought out by the following part of one of those documents:\r\n\r\n    “1. _Political Requirements and Aims._ German relations with\r\n    Poland continue to be based on the principle of avoiding any\r\n    quarrels. Should Poland, however, change her policy towards\r\n    Germany, based up to now on the same principles as our own, and\r\n    adopt a threatening attitude towards Germany, a final settlement\r\n    might become necessary, notwithstanding the pact in effect with\r\n    Poland.\r\n\r\n    “The aim then will be to destroy Polish military strength, and\r\n    create in the East a situation which satisfies the requirements\r\n    of national defense. The Free State of Danzig will be proclaimed\r\n    a part of the Reich-territory at the outbreak of the conflict,\r\n    at the latest.\r\n\r\n    “The political leadership considers it its task in this case to\r\n    isolate Poland if possible, that is to say, to limit the war to\r\n    Poland only.\r\n\r\n    “The development of increasing internal crises in France and the\r\n    resulting British cautiousness might produce such a situation in\r\n    the not too distant future.\r\n\r\n    “Intervention by Russia so far as she would be able to do this\r\n    cannot be expected to be of any use for Poland, because this\r\n    would imply Poland’s destruction by Bolshevism.\r\n\r\n    “The attitudes of the _Baltic States_ will be determined wholly\r\n    by German military exigencies.\r\n\r\n    “On the German side, Hungary cannot be considered a certain\r\n    German ally. Italy’s attitude is determined by the Berlin-Rome\r\n    Axis.\r\n\r\n    “2. _Military Conclusions._ The great objectives in the building\r\n    up of the German Armed Forces will continue to be determined by\r\n    the antagonism of the ‘Western Democracies’. ‘Fall Weiss’\r\n    constitutes only a precautionary complement to these\r\n    preparations. It is not to be looked upon in any way, however,\r\n    as the necessary prerequisite for a military settlement with the\r\n    Western opponents.\r\n\r\n    “The isolation of Poland will be more easily maintained, even\r\n    after the beginning of operations, if we succeed in starting the\r\n    war with heavy, sudden blows and in gaining rapid successes.\r\n\r\n    “The entire situation will require, however, that precautions be\r\n    taken to safeguard the western boundary and the German North Sea\r\n    coast, as well as the air over them.” (_C-120_)\r\n\r\nIt cannot be suggested that these are hypothetical plans, or that the\r\nGeneral Staff and High Command Group did not know what was in prospect.\r\nThe plans show on their face that they are in earnest and no war game.\r\nThe point is reinforced by Schmundt’s notes on the conference in\r\nHitler’s study at the Reich Chancellery, Berlin, on 23 May 1939\r\n(_L-79_). At this conference Hitler announced:\r\n\r\n    “There is, therefore, no question of sparing Poland, and we are\r\n    left with the decision: _to attack Poland at the first suitable\r\n    opportunity_”. (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nBesides Hitler and a few military aides and adjutants, the following\r\nwere present: Goering (C-in-C _Luftwaffe_); Raeder (C-in-C Navy); Keitel\r\n(Chief, OKW); von Brauchitsch (C-in-C Army); Col. General Milch\r\n(Inspector General of the _Luftwaffe_); Gen. Bodenschatz (Goering’s\r\npersonal assistant); Rear Admiral Schnievindt (Chief of the Naval War\r\nStaff); Col. Jeschonnek (Chief of the Air Staff); Col. Warlimont\r\n(Planning Staff of OKW). All except Milch, Bodenschatz, and the\r\nadjutants are members of the Group as defined in the Indictment.\r\n\r\nThe initial and general planning of the attack on Poland, however, had\r\nto be examined, checked, corrected, and perfected by the field\r\ncommanders who were to carry out the attack. In a document issued in the\r\nmiddle of June 1939 (_C-142_), von Brauchitsch as C-in-C of the Army\r\npassed on the general outlines of the plan to the field\r\ncommanders-in-chief (the _Oberbefehlshaber_ of Army Groups and Armies)\r\nso that they could work out the actual preparation and deployments in\r\naccordance with the general plan:\r\n\r\n    “The object of the operation is to _destroy the Polish Armed\r\n    Forces_. High policy demands that the war should be begun by\r\n    heavy surprise blows in order to achieve quick results. _The\r\n    intention of the Army High Command_ is to prevent a regular\r\n    mobilization and concentration of the Polish Army by a surprise\r\n    invasion of Polish territory and to destroy the mass of the\r\n    Polish Army which is to be expected to be west of the\r\n    Vistula-Narve line. This is to be achieved by a concentric\r\n    attack from Silesia on one side and Pomerania-East Prussia on\r\n    the other side. The possible influence from Galicia against this\r\n    operation must be eliminated. The main idea of the destruction\r\n    of the Polish Army west of the Vistula-Narve Line with the\r\n    elimination of the possible influence from Galicia remains\r\n    unchanged even if advanced preparedness for defense on the part\r\n    of the Polish Army, caused by previous political tension, should\r\n    have to be taken into consideration. In such a case it may be a\r\n    question of not making the first attack mainly with mechanized\r\n    and motorized forces but of waiting for the arrival of stronger,\r\n    non-motorized units. The Army High Command will then give the\r\n    correspondingly later time for the crossing of the frontier. The\r\n    endeavour to obtain a quick success will be maintained.\r\n\r\n    “The Army Group Commands and the Army Commands (A.O.K.) will\r\n    make their preparations on the basis of surprise of the enemy.\r\n    There will be alterations necessary if surprise should have to\r\n    be abandoned: these will have to be developed simply and quickly\r\n    on the same basis: they are to be prepared mentally to such an\r\n    extent, that in case of an order from the Army High Command they\r\n    can be carried out quickly.” (_C-142_)\r\n\r\nA document of approximately the same date reveals an _Oberbefehlshaber_\r\nat work in the field planning the attack (_2327-PS_). This document,\r\nsigned by Blaskowitz, at the time the commander-in-chief of the Third\r\nArmy Area Command and commander-in-chief of the 8th Army during the\r\nPolish campaign, states in part:\r\n\r\n    “The commander-in-chief of the army has ordered the working out\r\n    of a _plan of deployment against Poland_ which takes in account\r\n    the demands of the political leadership for the opening of war\r\n    by surprise and for quick success.\r\n\r\n    “The order of deployment by the High Command, ‘_Fall Weiss_’\r\n    authorizes the Third Army Group [in _Fall Weiss_, 8th Army\r\n    Headquarters] to give necessary directions and orders to all\r\n    commands subordinated to it for ‘_Fall Weiss_’.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The whole correspondence on ‘_Fall Weiss_’ has to be conducted\r\n    under the classification Top Secret [_Chefsache_]. This is to be\r\n    disregarded only if the content of a document, in the judgment\r\n    of the chief of the responsible command is harmless in every\r\n    way—even in connection with other documents.\r\n\r\n    “For the middle of July a conference is planned where details on\r\n    the execution will be discussed. Time and place will be ordered\r\n    later on. Special requests are to be communicated to Third Army\r\n    Group before 10 July.\r\n\r\n    “I declare it the duty of the Commanding Generals, the\r\n    divisional commanders and the commandants to limit as much as\r\n    possible the number of persons who will be informed, and to\r\n    limit the extent of the information and ask that all suitable\r\n    measures be taken to prevent persons not concerned from getting\r\n    information.\r\n\r\n    “The Commander-in-Chief of Army Area Command\r\n\r\n                       “(signed)  F. Blaskowitz.”\r\n\r\n    “_Aims of Operation ‘Fall Weiss’_\r\n\r\n    “1. a. The operation, in order to forestall an orderly Polish\r\n    mobilization and concentration, is to be opened by surprise with\r\n    forces which are for the most part armored and motorized, placed\r\n    on alert in the neighborhood of the border. The initial\r\n    superiority over the Polish frontier-guards and surprise that\r\n    can be expected with certainty are to be maintained by quickly\r\n    bringing up other parts of the army as well to counteract the\r\n    marching up of the Polish Army.\r\n\r\n    “Accordingly all units have to keep the initiative against the\r\n    foe by quick action and ruthless attacks.” (_2327-PS_)\r\n\r\nFinally, a week before the actual onslaught, when all the military plans\r\nhave been laid, The General Staff and High Command Group all gathered in\r\none place, in fact all in one room. On 23 August 1939 the\r\n_Oberbefehlshaber_ assembled at Obersalzberg to hear Hitler’s\r\nexplanation of the timing of the attack, and to receive political and\r\ndiplomatic orientation from the head of the State (_798-PS_). This\r\nspeech, the second of the two examples referred to in the initial\r\naffidavits by Halder (_3702-PS_) and Brauchitsch (_3703-PS_), was\r\naddressed to the very group defined in the indictment as the General\r\nStaff and High Command Group.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The War Period, September 1939-June 1941: Norway, Denmark,\r\nHolland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Yugoslavia, Greece._ On 1 September 1939\r\nGermany launched the war. Within a few weeks, and before any important\r\naction on the western front, Poland was overrun and conquered. German\r\nlosses were insignificant.\r\n\r\nThe “three principal territorial questions” mentioned in the Blomberg\r\n(_3704-PS_) and Blaskowitz (_3706-PS_) affidavits had all been solved.\r\nThe Rhineland had been reoccupied and fortified, Memel annexed, and the\r\nPolish Corridor annexed. And much more too. Austria had become a part of\r\nthe Reich, and Czechoslovakia was occupied and a Protectorate of\r\nGermany. All of western Poland was in German hands. Germany was superior\r\nin arms, and in experience in their use, to her western enemies, France\r\nand England.\r\n\r\nThen came the three years of the war—1939, 1940, 1941—when German\r\narmed might swung like a great scythe from north to south to east.\r\nItaly, Rumania, Hungary, and Bulgaria had become German allies. Norway\r\nand Denmark; the Low Countries; France; Tripoli and Egypt; Yugoslavia\r\nand Greece; the western part of the Soviet Union—all this territory was\r\ninvaded and overrun.\r\n\r\nIn the period from the fall of Poland in October 1939 to the attack\r\nagainst the Soviet Union in June 1941, occurred the aggressive wars, in\r\nviolation of treaties, against Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium,\r\nLuxembourg, Yugoslavia, and Greece. But one thing is certain: neither\r\nthe Nazis nor the generals thought during this period in terms of a\r\nseries of violations of neutrality and treaties. They thought in terms\r\nof a war, a war for the conquest of Europe.\r\n\r\nSix weeks after the outbreak of war, and upon the successful termination\r\nof the Polish campaign, on 9 October 1939, there was issued a\r\n“Memorandum and Directive for the Conduct of the War in the West.”\r\n(_L-52_). It is unsigned, was distributed only to the four service\r\nchiefs (Keitel, Brauchitsch, Goering, and Raeder) and gives every\r\nindication of having been issued by Hitler. The following are pertinent\r\nextracts:\r\n\r\n    “The aim of the Anglo-French conduct of war is to dissolve or\r\n    disintegrate the 80 million state again so that in this manner\r\n    the European equilibrium, in other words the balance of power,\r\n    which serves their ends, may be restored. This battle therefore\r\n    will have to be fought out by the German people one way or\r\n    another. Nevertheless, the very great successes of the first\r\n    month of war could serve, in the event of an immediate signing\r\n    of peace to strengthen the Reich psychologically and materially\r\n    to such an extent that from the German viewpoint there would be\r\n    no objection to ending the war immediately, insofar as the\r\n    present achievement with arms is not jeopardized by the\r\n    peace-treaty.\r\n\r\n    “It is not the object of this memorandum to study the\r\n    possibilities in this direction or even to take them into\r\n    consideration. In this paper I shall confine myself exclusively\r\n    to the other case; the necessity to continue the fight, the\r\n    object of which, as already stressed, consists so far as the\r\n    enemy is concerned in the dissolution or destruction of the\r\n    German Reich. In opposition to this, the German war aim is the\r\n    final military dispatch of the West, i.e. destruction of the\r\n    power and ability of the Western Powers ever again to be able to\r\n    oppose the state consolidation and further development of the\r\n    German people in Europe.\r\n\r\n    “As far as the outside world is concerned, however, this\r\n    internal aim will have to undergo various propaganda\r\n    adjustments, necessary from a psychological point of view. This\r\n    does not alter the war aim. It is and remains the destruction of\r\n    our Western enemies.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The successes of the Polish campaign have made possible first\r\n    of all a war on a single front, awaited for past decades without\r\n    any hope of realization, that is to say, Germany is able to\r\n    enter the fight in the West with all her might, leaving only a\r\n    few covering troops.\r\n\r\n    “The remaining European states are neutral either because they\r\n    fear for their own fates, or lack interest in the conflict as\r\n    such, or are interested in a certain outcome of the war, which\r\n    prevents them from taking part at all or at any rate too soon.\r\n\r\n    “The following is to be firmly borne in mind * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_Belgium and Holland_—Both countries are interested in\r\n    preserving their neutrality but incapable of withstanding\r\n    prolonged pressure from England and France. The preservation of\r\n    their colonies, the maintenance of their trade, and thus the\r\n    securing of their interior economy, even of their very life,\r\n    depend wholly upon the will of England and France. Therefore, in\r\n    their decisions, in their attitude, and in their actions, both\r\n    countries are dependent upon the West, in the highest degree. If\r\n    England and France promise themselves a successful result at the\r\n    price of Belgian neutrality, they are at any time in a position\r\n    to apply the necessary pressure. That is to say, without\r\n    covering themselves with the odium of a breach of neutrality,\r\n    they can compel Belgium and Holland to give up their neutrality.\r\n    Therefore, in the matter of the preservation of Belgo-Dutch\r\n    neutrality time is not a factor which might promise a favorable\r\n    development for Germany.\r\n\r\n    “_The Nordic States_—Provided no completely unforeseen factors\r\n    appear, their neutrality in the future is also to be assumed.\r\n    The continuation of German trade with these countries appears\r\n    possible even in a war of long duration.” (_L-52_)\r\n\r\nSix weeks later, on 23 November 1939, the group of _Oberbefehlshaber_\r\nagain assembled and heard from Hitler much of what he had said\r\npreviously to the four service chiefs (_789-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “For the first time in history we have to fight on only one\r\n    front, the other front is at present free. But no one can know\r\n    how long that will remain so. I have doubted for a long time\r\n    whether I should strike in the east and then in the west.\r\n    Basically I did not organize the armed forces in order not to\r\n    strike. The decision to strike was always in me. Earlier or\r\n    later I wanted to solve the problem. Under pressure it was\r\n    decided that the east was to be attacked first. If the Polish\r\n    war was won so quickly, it was due to the superiority of our\r\n    armed forces. The most glorious appearance in history.\r\n    Unexpectedly small expenditures of men and material. Now the\r\n    eastern front is held by only a few divisions. It is a situation\r\n    which we viewed previously as unachievable. Now the situation is\r\n    as follows: The opponent in the west lies behind his\r\n    fortifications. There is no possibility of coming to grips with\r\n    him. The decisive question is: how long can we endure this\r\n    situation.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Everything is determined by the fact that the moment is\r\n    favorable now; in 6 months it might not be so anymore.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “England cannot live without its imports. We can feed ourselves.\r\n    The permanent sowing of mines on the English coasts will bring\r\n    England to her knees. However, this can only occur if we have\r\n    occupied Belgium and Holland. It is a difficult decision for me.\r\n    None has ever achieved what I have achieved. My life is of no\r\n    importance in all this. I have led the German people to a great\r\n    height, even if the world does hate us now. I am setting this\r\n    work on a gamble. I have to choose between victory or\r\n    destruction. I choose victory. Greatest historical choice, to be\r\n    compared with the decision of Friedrich the Great before the\r\n    first Silesian war. Prussia owes its rise to the heroism of one\r\n    man. Even there the closest advisers were disposed to\r\n    capitulation. Everything depended on Friedrich the Great. Even\r\n    the decisions of Bismarck in 1866 and 1870 were no less great.\r\n    My decision is unchangeable. I shall attack France and England\r\n    at the most favorable and quickest moment. Breach of the\r\n    neutrality of Belgium and Holland is meaningless. No one will\r\n    question that when we have won. We shall not bring about the\r\n    breach of neutrality as idiotically as it was in 1914. If we do\r\n    not break the neutrality, then England and France will. Without\r\n    attack the war is not to be ended victoriously. I consider it as\r\n    possible to end the war only by means of an attack. The question\r\n    as to whether the attack will be successful no one can answer.\r\n    Everything depends upon the favorable instant”. (_789-PS_)\r\n\r\nThereafter the winter of 1939-40 passed quietly—the winter of “phony\r\nwar”. The General Staff and High Command Group all knew what the plan\r\nwas; they had all been told. It was to attack ruthlessly at the first\r\nopportunity, to smash the French and English forces, to pay no heed to\r\ntreaties with, or the neutrality of, the Low Countries.\r\n\r\n    “Breaking of the neutrality of Belgium and Holland is\r\n    meaningless. No one will question that when we have won.”\r\n    (_789-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat is what Hitler told the _Oberbefehlshaber_. The generals and\r\nadmirals agreed and went forward with their plans.\r\n\r\nThe military leaders may contend that all the steps in this march of\r\nconquest were conceived by Hitler, and that the military leaders\r\nembarked on them with reluctance and misgivings. Or they may be\r\nrestrained by pride from taking so undignified and degrading a position\r\nas to suggest that German military leadership, the bearers of the\r\ntradition of Schlieffen, Moltke, Spee and Hindenburg, was cowed and\r\ncoerced into war and plans of which they did not approve by a gang of\r\npolitical adventurers. But whether they make the argument or not, it is\r\nutterly without foundation.\r\n\r\nHitler’s utterances in October (_L-79_) and November (_789-PS_) 1939 are\r\nfull of plans against France, England, and the Low Countries but contain\r\nno suggestion of an attack on Scandinavia. Indeed, Hitler’s memorandum\r\nof 9 October 1939 (_L-52_) to the four service chiefs affirmatively\r\nindicates that he saw no reason to disturb the situation to the North:\r\n\r\n    “_The Northern States_—Providing no completely unforeseen\r\n    factors appear, their neutrality in the future is also to be\r\n    assumed. The continuance of trade with these countries appears\r\n    possible even in a war of long duration.” (_L-52_)\r\n\r\nBut a week previous, on 3 October 1939, Raeder had caused a\r\nquestionnaire to be circulated within the Naval War Staff, seeking\r\ncomments on the advantages which might be gained from a naval standpoint\r\nby securing bases in Norway and Denmark (_C-122_). Raeder was stimulated\r\nto circulate this questionnaire by a letter from another Admiral named\r\nCarls, who pointed out the importance of an occupation of the Norwegian\r\ncoast by Germany (_C-66_). (Rolf Carls later attained the rank of\r\nAdmiral of the Fleet, and commanded Naval Group North from January 1940\r\nto February 1943. In that capacity he is a member of the General Staff\r\nand High Command Group as defined in the Indictment.)\r\n\r\nDoenitz, at that time Flag Officer Submarines, on 9 October 1939,\r\nreplied to the questionnaire that from his standpoint Trondheim and\r\nNarvik met his requirements, that Trondheim was preferable, and proposed\r\nthe establishment of a U-boat base there (_C-5_). Raeder’s visit to\r\nHitler the next day and certain subsequent events are described as\r\nfollows (_L-323_):\r\n\r\n    “_Entry in the War Diary of the C-in-C of the Navy (Naval War\r\n    Staff) on ‘Weseruebung’._ 1. 10 October 1939. First reference of\r\n    the C-in-C of the Navy (Naval War Staff), when visiting the\r\n    Fuehrer, to the significance of Norway for sea and air warfare.\r\n    The Fuehrer intends to give the matter consideration.\r\n\r\n    “12 December 1939. Fuehrer received Q & H.\r\n\r\n    “Subsequent instructions to the Supreme Command of the Armed\r\n    Forces to make mental preparations. The C-in-C of the Navy is\r\n    having an essay prepared, which will be ready in January. With\r\n    reference to this essay, _Kapitan zur see_ Krancke is working on\r\n    ‘_Weseruebung_’, and OKW.\r\n\r\n    “During the time which followed, H maintained contact with the\r\n    Chief of Staff of the C-in-C of the Navy. His aim was to develop\r\n    the Party Q with a view to making it capable of making a coup,\r\n    and to give the Supreme Command of the Navy information on\r\n    political developments in Norway and military questions. In\r\n    general he pressed for a speeding-up of preparations, but\r\n    considered that it was first necessary to expand the\r\n    organization. The support which had been promised him in the\r\n    form of money and coal was set in motion only very slowly and\r\n    came in small quantities, and he repeatedly complained about\r\n    this. It was not until the end of March that Q considered the\r\n    coup [_Aktion_] so urgent that the expansion of his organization\r\n    could not wait. The military advice of H was passed on to the\r\n    OKW.” (_L-323_)\r\n\r\nOn 12 December the Naval War Staff discussed the Norwegian project with\r\nHitler at a meeting which Keitel and Jodl also attended (_C-64_). In the\r\nmeantime, illustrating the close link between the service chiefs and the\r\nNazi politicians, Raeder was in touch with Rosenberg on the\r\npossibilities of using Quisling (_C-65_). As result of all this, on\r\nHitler’s instructions Keitel issued an OKW directive on 27 January 1940.\r\nThe directive related that Hitler had commissioned Keitel to take charge\r\nof preparation for the Norway operation, to which he then gave the code\r\nname “_Weseruebung_.” On 1 March 1940 Hitler issued the directive\r\nsetting forth the general plan for the invasion of Norway and Denmark\r\n(_C-174_). The invasion itself took place on 9 April 1940. The directive\r\nwas initialled by Admiral Kurt Fricke who at that time was head of the\r\nOperations Division of the Naval War Staff, and who at the end of 1941\r\nbecame Chief of the Naval War Staff. In that capacity he too is a member\r\nof the Group as defined in the Indictment.\r\n\r\nSo, as these documents make clear, the plan to invade Norway and Denmark\r\nwas not conceived in Nazi Party circles or forced on the military\r\nleaders. On the contrary it was conceived in the naval part of the\r\nGeneral Staff and High Command Group, and Hitler was persuaded to take\r\nup the idea. Treaties and neutrality meant just as little to the General\r\nStaff and High Command Group as to the Nazis. Launching aggressive war\r\nagainst inoffensive neighboring states gave the generals and admirals no\r\nqualms.\r\n\r\nAs for the Low Countries, neither Hitler nor the military leaders were\r\ndisturbed about Treaty considerations. At the conferences between Hitler\r\nand the principal military leaders in May 1939 (_L-79_), when the\r\nintention to attack Poland was announced, Hitler in discussing the\r\npossibility of war with England said:\r\n\r\n    “The Dutch and Belgian air bases must be occupied by armed\r\n    force. Declarations of neutrality will be ignored”. (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nAnd in the speech to the _Oberbefehlshaber_ in November 1939 (_789-PS_),\r\nafter the Polish victory, Hitler made clear his intention to attack\r\nFrance and England by first invading the Low Countries. “No one will\r\nquestion that when we have won,” he said.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the winter of 1939-40 and the early spring of 1940 was a\r\nperiod of intensive planning in German military circles. The major\r\nattack in the West through the Low Countries, and the attack on Norway\r\nand Denmark had to be planned. Jodl’s diary for the period 1 February to\r\n26 May 1940 (_1809-PS_) contains many entries reflecting the course of\r\nthis planning. These entries show that during February and early March\r\nthere was considerable doubt in German military circles as to whether\r\nthe attack on Norway and Denmark should precede or follow the attack on\r\nthe Low Countries; and that at some points there even was doubt as to\r\nwhether all these attacks were necessary from a military standpoint. But\r\nthere is not a single entry which reflects any hesitancy, from a moral\r\nangle, on the part of Jodl or any of the people he mentions to overrun\r\nthese neutral countries.\r\n\r\nOn 1 February 1940, General Jeschonnek (Chief of the Air Staff and a\r\nmember of the Group as defined in the Indictment) visited Jodl and\r\nsuggested that it might be wise to attack only Holland, on the ground\r\nthat Holland alone would “be a tremendous improvement in conducting\r\naerial warfare”. On 6 February, Jodl conferred with Jeschonnek,\r\nWarlimont, and Col. von Waldau, and what Jodl calls a “new idea” was\r\nproposed at this meeting: that the Germans should “carry out actions H\r\n(Holland) and Weser exercise (Norway and Denmark) only and guarantee\r\nBelgium’s neutrality for the duration of the war” (_1809-PS_). The\r\nGerman Air Force may have felt that occupation of Holland alone would\r\ngive them sufficient scope for air bases for attacks on England, and\r\nthat if Belgium’s neutrality were preserved the bases in Holland would\r\nbe immune from attack by the French and the British armies in France.\r\nIf, to meet this situation, the French and British attacked through\r\nBelgium, the violation of neutrality would be on the other foot. But\r\nwhether or not the “new idea” made sense from a military angle, it\r\nappears to be a most extraordinary notion from a diplomatic angle. It\r\nwas a proposal to violate, without any substantial excuse, the\r\nneutrality of three neighboring small countries, and simultaneously to\r\nguarantee the neutrality of a fourth. What value the Belgians might have\r\nattributed to a guarantee of neutrality offered under such circumstances\r\nit is difficult to imagine and in fact the “new idea” projected at this\r\nmeeting of military leaders is an extraordinary combination of cynicism\r\nand naivete.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, as Jodl’s diary shows, on 5 February 1940 the “special\r\nstaff” for the Norway invasion met for the first time and got its\r\ninstructions from Keitel (_1809-PS_). On 21 February Hitler put General\r\nvon Falkenhorst (who subsequently became an _Oberbefehlshaber_ and a\r\nmember of the Group) in command of the Norway undertaking; and Jodl’s\r\ndiary records that “Falkenhorst accepts gladly” (_1809-PS_). On 26\r\nFebruary Hitler was still in doubt whether to go first into Norway or\r\nthe Low Countries, but on 3 March, he decided to do Norway first and the\r\nLow Countries a short time thereafter. This decision proved final.\r\nNorway and Denmark were invaded on 9 April and the success of the\r\nventure was certain by the first of May; the invasion of the Low\r\nCountries took place 10 days thereafter.\r\n\r\nFrance and the Low Countries fell, Italy joined the war on the side of\r\nGermany, and the African campaign began. In the meantime, Goering’s Air\r\nForce hammered at England unsuccessfully, and the planned invasion of\r\nBritain (“Operation _Seeloewe_”) never came to pass. In October 1940\r\nItaly attacked Greece and was fought to better than a standstill. The\r\nItalo-Greek stalemate and the uncertain attitude of Yugoslavia were\r\nembarrassing to Germany, particularly because the attack on the Soviet\r\nUnion was being planned in the winter of 1940-41, and Germany felt she\r\ncould not risk an uncertain situation at her rear in the Balkans.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, it was decided to end the Greek situation by coming to\r\nItaly’s aid, and the Yugoslavian coup d’etat of 26 March 1940 brought\r\nabout the final German decision to crush Yugoslavia also. The aggressive\r\nnature of the German attacks on Greece and Yugoslavia are demonstrated\r\nin _444-PS_; _1541-PS_; _C-167_; _1746-PS_. The decisions were made, and\r\nthe Armed Forces drew up the plans and executed the attacks. The\r\nonslaught was particularly ruthless against Yugoslavia for the special\r\npurpose of frightening Turkey and Greece. The final deployment\r\ninstructions were issued by Brauchitsch (_R-95_):\r\n\r\n    “1. The political situation in the Balkans having changed by\r\n    reason of the Yugoslav military revolt, Yugoslavia has to be\r\n    considered as an enemy even should it make declarations of\r\n    loyalty at first.\r\n\r\n    “_The Fuehrer and Supreme Commander has decided therefore to\r\n    destroy Yugoslavia as quickly as possible_ * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “5. _Timetable for the operations._ a. On 5th April as soon as\r\n    sufficient forces of the Air Forces are available and weather\r\n    permitting, the Air Forces shall attack continuously by day and\r\n    night the Yugoslav ground organization and Belgrade.” (_R-95_)\r\n\r\n(_e_) _The Soviet Union._ It is quite possible that some members of the\r\nGeneral Staff and High Command Group opposed “Barbarossa,” the German\r\nattack on the Soviet Union, as unnecessary and unwise from a military\r\nstandpoint. Raeder so indicated in a memorandum he wrote on 10 January\r\n1944 (_C-66_):\r\n\r\n    “1. At this time the Fuehrer had made known his ‘unalterable\r\n    decision’ to conduct the Eastern campaign in spite of all\r\n    remonstrances. After that, further warnings, if no new situation\r\n    had arisen, were found to be completely useless. As Chief of\r\n    Naval War Staff, I was never convinced of the ‘compelling\r\n    necessity’ for Barbarossa.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer very early had the idea of one day settling\r\n    accounts with Russia, doubtless his general ideological attitude\r\n    played an essential part in this. In 1937-38 he once stated that\r\n    he intended to eliminate the Russians as a Baltic power; they\r\n    would then have to be diverted in the direction of the Persian\r\n    Gulf. The advance of the Russians against Finland and the Baltic\r\n    States in 1939-40 probably further strengthened him in this\r\n    idea.\r\n\r\n    “The fear that control of the air over the Channel in the autumn\r\n    of 1940 could no longer be attained—a realization which the\r\n    Fuehrer, no doubt, gained earlier than the Naval War Staff, who\r\n    were not so fully informed of the true results of air raids on\r\n    England (our own losses)—surely caused the Fuehrer, as far back\r\n    as August and September, to consider whether—even prior to\r\n    victory in the West—an Eastern campaign would be feasible with\r\n    the object of first eliminating our last serious opponent on the\r\n    Continent. The Fuehrer did not openly express this fear,\r\n    however, until well into September.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “7. As no other course is possible, I have submitted to\r\n    compulsion. If, in doing so, a difference of opinion arises\r\n    between 1 SKL and myself, it is perhaps because the arguments\r\n    the Fuehrer used on such occasion (dinner speech in the middle\r\n    of July to the Officers in Command) to justify a step he had\r\n    planned, usually had a greater effect on people not belonging to\r\n    the ‘inner circle,’ than on those who often heard this type of\r\n    reasoning.\r\n\r\n    “Many remarks and plans indicate that the Fuehrer calculated on\r\n    the final ending of the Eastern campaign in the autumn of 1941,\r\n    whereas the Supreme Command of the Army (General Staff) was very\r\n    skeptical.” (_C-66_)\r\n\r\nBut the passage last quoted indicates that the other members of the\r\nGeneral Staff favored “Barbarossa”. Raeder’s memorandum actually says\r\nsubstantially what Blomberg’s affidavit (_3704-PS_) says; that some of\r\nthe generals lost confidence in the power of Hitler’s judgment, but that\r\nthe generals failed as a group to take any definite stand against him\r\nalthough a few tried and suffered thereby. Certainly the High Command\r\nGroup took no stand against Hitler on “Barbarossa” and the events of\r\n1941 and 1942 do not suggest that the High Command embarked on the\r\nSoviet war tentatively or with reservations, but rather with ruthless\r\ndetermination backed by careful planning. The plans themselves have\r\nalready been cited. (_446-PS_; _C-35_; _872-PS_; _C-78_; _447-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Nature of the General Staff and High Command Group Responsibility\r\nfor Aggression._ The nature of the accusation against this Group for\r\nplotting and launching wars of aggression must be clearly understood.\r\nThey are not accused on the ground that they are soldiers. They are not\r\naccused because they did the usual things a soldier is expected to do,\r\nsuch as make military plans and command troops.\r\n\r\nIt is among the normal duties of a diplomat to engage in negotiations\r\nand conferences; to write notes and side memoires to the government to\r\nwhich he is accredited; and to cultivate good will toward the country he\r\nrepresents. Ribbentrop is not indicted for doing these things. It is the\r\nusual function of a politician to weigh and determine matters of\r\nnational policy and to draft regulations and decrees and make speeches.\r\nHess, Frick, and the other politician-defendants are not indicted for\r\ndoing these things. It is an innocent and respectable business to be a\r\nlocksmith but it is none the less a crime if the locksmith turns his\r\ntalents to picking the locks of neighbors and looting their homes. And\r\nthat is the nature of the charge against all the defendants, and against\r\nthe General Staff and High Command Group as well. The charge is that in\r\nperforming the functions of diplomats, politicians, soldiers, sailors,\r\nor whatever they happened to be, they conspired to and did plan,\r\nprepare, initiate, and wage wars of aggression and in violation of\r\nTreaties.\r\n\r\nThe Charter (Article 6(a)) declares that wars of aggression and wars in\r\nviolation of international treaties, agreements, and assurances are\r\ncrimes against peace. It is no defense for those who commit such crimes\r\nto plead that they practice a particular profession, whether it is arms\r\nor the law. It is perfectly legal for military men to prepare military\r\nplans to meet national contingencies, to carry out such plans and engage\r\nin war if in so doing they do not knowingly plan and wage illegal wars.\r\n\r\nThere might well be individual cases where drawing the line between\r\nlegal and illegal conduct would involve some difficulties. That is not\r\nan uncommon situation in the legal field. But there can be no doubt as\r\nto the criminality of the General Staff and High Command Group, nor as\r\nto the guilt of the five defendants who are members of the Group. The\r\nevidence is clear that these defendants, and the leaders of the Group,\r\nand most of the members of the Group, were fully advised in advance of\r\nthe aggressive and illegal war plans, and carried them out with full\r\nknowledge that the wars were aggressive and in violation of treaties.\r\n\r\nIn the case of defendants Goering, Keitel, and Jodl, the evidence is\r\nvoluminous and their participation in aggressive plans and wars is\r\nconstant. The same is true of the defendant Raeder, and his individual\r\nresponsibility for the aggressive and savage attack on Norway and\r\nDenmark is especially clear. The evidence so far offered against Doenitz\r\nis less voluminous, for the reason that he was younger and not one of\r\nthe top group until later in the war, but his knowing participation in\r\nand advocacy of the Norwegian venture is clear.\r\n\r\nNumerous other members of the General Staff and High Command Group,\r\nincluding its other leaders, participated knowingly and willfully in\r\nthese illegal plans and wars. Brauchitsch, the Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nArmy, and his Chief of Staff, Halder; Warlimont the deputy to Jodl and\r\nchief repository of plans—in the nature of things these men knew all\r\nthat was going on, and participated fully, as the evidence has shown.\r\nReichenau and Sperrle helped to bully Schuschnigg; Reichenau and von\r\nSchobert, together with Goering, were immediately sent for by Hitler\r\nwhen Schuschnigg ordered the plebiscite. At later date, Blaskowitz as an\r\n_Oberbefehlshaber_ in the field knowingly prepared for the attack on\r\nPoland; Field Marshal List educated the Bulgarians for their role during\r\nthe attacks on Yugoslavia and Greece; von Falkenhorst “gladly” accepted\r\nthe assignment to command the invasion of Norway and Denmark. On the air\r\nside, Jeschonnek had proposed that Germany attack Norway, Denmark, and\r\nHolland, and simultaneously assured Belgium that there was nothing to\r\nfear. On the naval side, Admiral Carls foresaw at an early date that\r\nGerman policy was leading to a general European war, and at a later date\r\nthe attack on Norway and Denmark was his brainchild; Krancke was one of\r\nthe chief planners of this attack; Schniewindt was in the inner circle\r\nfor the attack on Poland; Fricke certified the final orders for\r\n“_Weseruebung_” and a few months later proposed that Germany annex\r\nBelgium and northern France and reduce the Netherlands and Scandinavia\r\nto vassalage. Most of these 19 officers were at the time members of the\r\nGroup, and the few who were not subsequently became members. At the\r\nfinal planning and reporting conference for “_Barbarossa_,” 17\r\nadditional members were present. At the two meetings with Hitler, at\r\nwhich the aggressive plans and the contempt for treaties were fully\r\ndisclosed, the entire group was present.\r\n\r\nThe military defendants may perhaps argue that military men are pure\r\ntechnicians, bound to do whatever the political leaders order them to\r\ndo. Such a suggestion must fail, on any test of reason or logic. It\r\namounts to saying that military men are a race apart from and different\r\nfrom the ordinary run of human beings—men above and beyond the moral\r\nand legal requirements that apply to others; men incapable of exercising\r\nmoral judgment on their own behalf.\r\n\r\nIt stands to reason that the crime of planning and waging aggressive\r\nwarfare is committed most consciously, deliberately, and culpably by a\r\nnation’s leaders—the leaders in all the major fields of activity\r\nnecessary to and closely involved in the waging of war. It is committed\r\nby the principal propagandists and publicists who whip up the necessary\r\nbeliefs and enthusiasms among the people as a whole, so that the people\r\nwill acquiesce and join in attacking and slaughtering the peoples of\r\nother nations. It is committed by the political leaders who purport to\r\nrepresent and execute the national will. It is committed by the\r\ndiplomats who handle the nation’s foreign policy and endeavor to create\r\na favorable diplomatic setting for successful warfare, and by the chief\r\nministers who adapt the machinery of government to the needs of a nation\r\nat war. It is committed by the principal industrial and financial\r\nleaders who shape the national economy and marshall the productive\r\nresources for the needs of an aggressive war program. It is no less\r\ncommitted by the military leaders who knowingly plan aggressive war,\r\nmobilize the men and equipment of the attacking forces, and execute the\r\nactual onslaught.\r\n\r\nIn the nature of things, planning and executing aggressive war is\r\naccomplished by agreement and consultation among all these types of\r\nleaders. If the leaders in any notably important field of activity stand\r\naside, resist, or fail to cooperate in launching and executing an\r\naggressive war program, the program will at the very least be seriously\r\nobstructed, and probably its successful accomplishment will be\r\nimpossible. That is why the principal leaders in all these fields of\r\nactivity share responsibility for the crime, and the military leaders no\r\nless than the others. Leadership in the military field, as in any other\r\nfield, calls for moral wisdom as well as technical astuteness.\r\n\r\nThe responsible military leaders of any nation can hardly be heard to\r\nsay that their role is that of a mere janitor, custodian, or pilot of\r\nthe war machine which is under their command, and that they bear no\r\nresponsibility whatsoever for the use to which that machine is put. Such\r\na view would degrade and render ignoble the profession of arms. The\r\nprevalence of such a view would be particularly unfortunate today, when\r\nthe military leaders control forces infinitely more powerful and\r\ndestructive than ever before. Should the military leaders be declared\r\nexempt from the declaration in the Charter that planning and waging\r\naggressive war is a crime, it would be a crippling if not fatal blow to\r\nthe efficacy of that declaration.\r\n\r\nThe American prosecution here representing the United Nations believes\r\nthat the profession of arms is a distinguished and noble profession. It\r\nbelieves that the practice of that profession by its leaders calls for\r\nthe highest degree of integrity and moral wisdom no less than for\r\ntechnical skill. It believes that in consulting and planning with\r\nleaders in other national fields of activity, the military leaders will\r\nact and counsel in accordance with International Law and the dictates of\r\nthe public conscience. Otherwise, the military resources of the nation\r\nwill be used, not in accordance with the laws of modern civilization,\r\nbut with the law of the jungle. The military leaders share\r\nresponsibility with other leaders of a nation.\r\n\r\nObviously the military leaders are not the final and exclusive arbiters,\r\nand the German military leaders do not bear exclusive responsibility for\r\nthe aggressive wars which were waged. If the leading German diplomats\r\nand industrialists and other leaders had not been infected with similar\r\ncriminal purposes, the German military leaders might not have had their\r\nway. But the German military leaders conspired with others to undermine\r\nand destroy the conscience of the German nation. The German military\r\nleaders wanted to aggrandize Germany and if necessary to resort to war\r\nfor that purpose. As the Chief Prosecutor for the United States said in\r\nhis opening statement, “the German military leaders are here before you\r\nbecause they, along with others, mastered Germany and drove it to war.”\r\n\r\n(2) _War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity._ It is proposed to show\r\nthat members of the General Staff and High Command Group, including the\r\nfive defendants who are members of the Group, ordered and directed the\r\ncommission of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, as defined in the\r\nIndictment. It is also proposed to show, in certain instances, the\r\nactual commission of war crimes by members of the German Armed Forces,\r\nas a result of these orders, or as a result of other orders or\r\narrangements made by members of the General Staff and High Command\r\nGroup, which controlled the German Armed Forces and bears responsibility\r\nfor war crimes committed by them.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed, however, to make a full showing of war crimes\r\ncommitted by the German Armed Forces. The full presentation of this\r\nevidence is to be made, pursuant to agreement among the Chief\r\nProsecutors, by the French and Soviet delegations.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown that the General Staff and High Command became wedded\r\nto a policy of terror. In some cases, where the evidence of this policy\r\nis in documentary form, the activating papers which were signed by,\r\ninitialed by, and circulated among the members of the Group will be\r\npresented. In other instances, where the actual crimes were committed by\r\nothers than members of the German Armed Forces (where, for example\r\nprisoners of war or civilians were handed over to and mistreated or\r\nmurdered by the SS or SD), it will be shown that members of the Group\r\nwere well aware that they were assisting in the commission of war\r\ncrimes. It will be shown that many crimes committed by the SS or SD were\r\ncommitted with the knowledge and necessary support of the General Staff\r\nand High Command, and that frequently members of the German Armed Forces\r\nacted in conjunction with the SS and SD in carrying out tasks then known\r\nby such respectable-sounding terms as “pacification,” “cleansing,” and\r\n“elimination of insecure elements.”\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Murder of Commandos, Paratroopers, and Members of Military\r\nMissions._ This story starts with an order issued by Hitler on 18\r\nOctober 1942 (_498-PS_). The order began with a recital that allied\r\ncommandos were using methods of warfare alleged to be outside the scope\r\nof the Geneva Conventions, and thereafter proceeded to specify the\r\nmethods of warfare which German troops should use against allied\r\ncommandos, and the disposition which should be made of captured\r\ncommandos. This order reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. For some time our enemies have been using in their warfare\r\n    methods which are outside the international Geneva Conventions.\r\n    Especially brutal and treacherous is the behavior of the\r\n    so-called commandos, who, as is established, are partially\r\n    recruited even from freed criminals in enemy countries. From\r\n    captured orders it is divulged that they are directed not only\r\n    to shackle prisoners, but also to kill defenseless prisoners on\r\n    the spot at the moment in which they believe that the latter as\r\n    prisoners represent a burden in the further pursuit of their\r\n    purposes or could otherwise be a hindrance. Finally, orders have\r\n    been found in which the killing of prisoners has been demanded\r\n    in principle.\r\n\r\n    “2. For this reason it was already announced in an addendum to\r\n    the Armed Forces report of 7 October 1942, that in the future,\r\n    Germany, in the face of these sabotage troops of the British and\r\n    their accomplices, will resort to the same procedure, i.e., that\r\n    they will be ruthlessly mowed down by the German troops in\r\n    combat, wherever they may appear.\r\n\r\n    “3. I therefore order:\r\n    From now on all enemies on so-called Commando missions in Europe\r\n    or Africa challenged by German troops, even if they are to all\r\n    appearances soldiers in uniform or demolition troops, whether\r\n    armed or unarmed, in battle or in flight, are to be slaughtered\r\n    to the last man. It does not make any difference whether they\r\n    are landed from ships and aeroplanes for their actions, or\r\n    whether they are dropped by parachute. Even if these\r\n    individuals, when found, should apparently be prepared to give\r\n    themselves up, no pardon is to be granted them on principle. In\r\n    each individual case full information is to be sent to the OKW\r\n    for publication in the Report of the Military Forces.\r\n\r\n    “4. If individual members of such commandos, such as agents,\r\n    saboteurs, etc. fall into the hands of the military forces by\r\n    some other means, through the police in occupied territories for\r\n    instance, they are to be handed over immediately to the SD. Any\r\n    imprisonment under military guard, in PW stockades for instance,\r\n    etc., is strictly prohibited, even if this is only intended for\r\n    a short time.\r\n\r\n    “5. This order does not apply to the treatment of any enemy\r\n    soldiers who in the course of normal hostilities (large-scale\r\n    offensive actions, landing operations and airborne operations),\r\n    are captured in open battle or give themselves up. Nor does this\r\n    order apply to enemy soldiers falling into our hands after\r\n    battles at sea, or enemy soldiers trying to save their lives by\r\n    parachute after battles.\r\n\r\n    “6. I will hold responsible under Military Law, for failing to\r\n    carry out this order, all commanders and officers who either\r\n    have neglected their duty of instructing the troops about this\r\n    order, or acted against this order where it was to be executed.\r\n\r\n                                   “(S)  Adolf Hitler”  (_498-PS_).\r\n\r\nThis order was issued by the OKW in twelve copies, and the distribution\r\nincluded the three supreme commands and the principal field commands.\r\n(_498-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn the same day Hitler issued a supplementary order (_503-PS_) for the\r\npurpose of explaining the reasons for the issuance of the basic order.\r\nIn this explanation, Hitler pointed out that allied commando operations\r\nhad been extraordinarily successful in the destruction of rear\r\ncommunications, intimidation of laborers, and destruction of important\r\nwar plants in occupied areas. Among other things Hitler stated in this\r\nexplanation:\r\n\r\n    “Added to the decree concerning the destruction of terror and\r\n    sabotage troops (_OKW/WFst No. 003830/42 Top Secret of 18\r\n    October 1942_) a supplementary order of the Fuehrer is enclosed.\r\n\r\n    “_This order is intended for commanders only and must not under\r\n    any circumstances fall into enemy hands._\r\n\r\n    “_The further distribution is to be limited accordingly by the\r\n    receiving bureaus._\r\n\r\n    “The bureaus named in the distribution list are held\r\n    responsible, for the return and destruction of all distributed\r\n    pieces of the order and copies made thereof.\r\n\r\n        “The Chief of the High Command of\r\n        the Armed Forces\r\n\r\n                                                            “By order of\r\n                                                            “Jodl”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I have been compelled to issue strict orders for the\r\n    destruction of enemy sabotage troops and to declare\r\n    noncompliance with these orders severely punishable. I deem it\r\n    necessary to announce to the competent commanding officers and\r\n    commanders the reasons for this decree.\r\n\r\n    “As in no previous war, a method of destruction of\r\n    communications behind the front, intimidation of the populace\r\n    working for Germany, as well as the destruction of war-important\r\n    industrial plants in territories occupied by us has been\r\n    developed in this war.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The consequences of these activities are of extraordinary\r\n    weight. I do not know whether each commander and officer is\r\n    cognizant of the fact that the destruction of one single\r\n    electric power plant, for instance, can deprive the _Luftwaffe_\r\n    of many thousand tons of aluminum, thereby eliminating the\r\n    construction of countless aircraft that will be missed in the\r\n    fight at the front and so contribute to serious damage of the\r\n    Homeland as well as bloody losses of the fighting soldiers.\r\n\r\n    “Yet this form of war is completely without danger for the\r\n    adversary. Since he lands his sabotage troops in uniform but at\r\n    the same time supplies them with civilian clothes, they can,\r\n    according to need, appear as soldiers or civilians. While they\r\n    themselves have orders to ruthlessly remove any German soldiers\r\n    or even natives who get in their way, they run no danger of\r\n    suffering really serious losses in their operations, since at\r\n    the worst, if they are caught, they can immediately surrender\r\n    and thus believe that they will theoretically fall under the\r\n    provisions of the Geneva Convention. There is no doubt, however,\r\n    that this is a misuse in the worst form of the Geneva\r\n    agreements, especially since part of these elements are even\r\n    criminals, liberated from prisons, who can rehabilitate\r\n    themselves through these activities.\r\n\r\n    “England and America will therefore always be able to find\r\n    volunteers for this kind of warfare as long as they can\r\n    truthfully assure them that there is no danger of loss of life\r\n    for them. At worse, all they have to do is to successfully\r\n    commit their attack on people, traffic installations, or other\r\n    installations, and upon being encountered by the enemy, to\r\n    capitulate.\r\n\r\n    “If the German conduct of war is not to suffer grievous damage\r\n    through these incidents, it must be made clear to the adversary\r\n    that all sabotage troops will be exterminated, without\r\n    exception, to the last man.\r\n\r\n    “This means that their chance of escaping with their lives is\r\n    nil. Under no circumstances can it be permitted, therefore, that\r\n    a dynamite, sabotage, or terrorist unit simply allows itself to\r\n    be captured, expecting to be treated according to rules of the\r\n    Geneva Convention. It must under all circumstances be ruthlessly\r\n    exterminated.\r\n\r\n    “The report on this subject appearing in the Armed Forces\r\n    communique will briefly and laconically state that a sabotage,\r\n    terror, or destruction unit has been encountered and\r\n    exterminated to the last man.\r\n\r\n    “I therefore expect the commanding officers of armies\r\n    subordinated to them as well as individual commanders not only\r\n    to realize the necessity of taking such measures, but to carry\r\n    out this order with all energy. Officers and noncommissioned\r\n    officers who fail through some weakness are to be reported\r\n    without fail, or under circumstances when there is danger in\r\n    delay to be at once made strictly accountable. The Homeland as\r\n    well as the fighting soldier at the front has the right to\r\n    expect that behind their back the essentials of nourishment as\r\n    well as the supply of war-important weapons and ammunition\r\n    remains secure.\r\n\r\n    “These are the reasons for the issuance of this decree.\r\n\r\n    “If it should become necessary, for reasons of interrogation, to\r\n    initially spare one man or two, then they are to be shot\r\n    immediately after interrogation.\r\n\r\n                                 “(signed)  A. Hitler”  (_503-PS_).\r\n\r\nTen days later, on 28 October 1942, while Raeder was Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the Germany Navy, the Naval War Staff in Berlin transmitted its copy\r\nof the basic order of 18 October to the lower Naval commands. The copy\r\ndistributed by the Navy and the covering memorandum from the Naval War\r\nStaff (_C-179_) shows clearly the secrecy which surrounded the\r\ndissemination of this order:\r\n\r\n    “Enclosed pleased find a Fuehrer Order regarding annihilation of\r\n    terror and sabotage units.\r\n\r\n    “This order must not be distributed in writing by Flotilla\r\n    leaders, Section Commanders or officers of this rank.\r\n\r\n    “After verbal distribution to subordinate sections the above\r\n    authorities must hand this order over to the next highest\r\n    section which is responsible for its confiscation and\r\n    destruction.\r\n\r\n                                          “(s)  Wagner”  (_C-179_).\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n    “_Note for Distribution_:\r\n\r\n    “These instructions are not to be distributed over and above the\r\n    battalions and corresponding staffs of the other services. After\r\n    notification, those copies distributed over and above the\r\n    Regimental and corresponding staffs of the other services must\r\n    be withdrawn and destroyed.” (_C-179_)\r\n\r\nOn 11 February 1943, just twelve days after Doenitz had become\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the German Navy, the Naval War Staff promulgated a\r\nfurther memorandum on this subject in order to clear up certain\r\nmisunderstandings as to the scope of the basic order of 18 October 1942\r\n(_C-178_). It was stated in this subsequent memorandum that all\r\ncommanders and officers who neglected their duty in failing to instruct\r\ntheir units concerning the order would run the risk of serious court\r\nmartial penalties:\r\n\r\n    “From the notice given by 3/SKL [Naval War Staff] on February\r\n    1st 43, it has been discovered that the competent departments of\r\n    the General Staff of the Army, as well as those of the Air Force\r\n    Operations Staff have a wrong conception regarding the treatment\r\n    of saboteurs. A telephone inquiry at 3/SKL proved that this\r\n    Naval authority was not correctly informed either. In view of\r\n    this situation, reference is made to figure _6_ of the Fuehrer\r\n    order of October 18, 42 (Appendix to Volume No. 1 SKL 1 Ops 26\r\n    367/42 Top Secret of October 28, 42) according to which all\r\n    commanders and officers, who have neglected their duty in\r\n    instructing their units about the order referring to treatment\r\n    of saboteurs, are threatened with punishment by court martial.\r\n\r\n    “The first Fuehrer order concerning this matter of October 18,\r\n    42 (Appendix to Volume No. 1 SKL 1 Ops 2108/42 Top Secret of\r\n    October 27, 42) was given the protection of Top Secret merely\r\n    because it is stated therein:\r\n\r\n    “1. That, according to the Fuehrer’s views the spreading of\r\n    military sabotage organizations in the East _and_ West may have\r\n    portentous consequences for our whole conduct of the war and\r\n\r\n    “2. That the shooting of uniformed prisoners acting on military\r\n    orders must be carried out even _after_ they have surrendered\r\n    voluntarily and asked for pardon.\r\n\r\n    “On the other hand, the annihilation of sabotage units in battle\r\n    is not at all to be kept secret but on the contrary to be\r\n    currently published in the OKW (Supreme Command of the Armed\r\n    Forces) reports. The purpose of these measures to act as a\r\n    deterrent, will not be achieved, if those taking part in enemy\r\n    ‘Commando Operations’ would not learn that certain death and not\r\n    safe imprisonment awaits them. As the saboteurs are to be\r\n    annihilated immediately, unless their statements are first\r\n    needed for military reasons, it is necessary that not only all\r\n    members of the Armed Forces must receive instructions that these\r\n    types of saboteurs, even if they are in uniform, are to be\r\n    annihilated, but also all departments of the home staff, dealing\r\n    with this kind of question, must be informed of the course of\r\n    action which has been ordered.” (_C-178_)\r\n\r\nThe Hitler order of October 1942 was actually carried out in a number of\r\ninstances. During the night of the 19-20 November 1942, a British\r\nfreight glider crashed near Egersund in Norway. The glider carried a\r\nBritish commando unit of 17 men, of whom 3 were apparently killed in the\r\ncrash. All were in English uniform. The 14 survivors were executed in\r\naccordance with the Hitler order in the evening of 20 November 1942. The\r\nproof is contained in the following document (_508-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “1. Following supplementary report is made about landing of a\r\n    British freight glider at Hegers and in the night of November\r\n    20:\r\n\r\n    “a. No firing on the part of German defense.\r\n\r\n    “b. The towing plane (Wellington) has crashed the ground, 7 man\r\n    crew dead.

Of the 17 member crew 3 are dead, 6 are\r\n    severely, the others slightly wounded.\r\n\r\n    “All wore English khaki uniforms without sleeve-insignia.\r\n    Furthermore following items were found: 8 knapsacks, tents, skis\r\n    and radio sender, exact number is unknown.

Therefore the sabotage purpose was\r\n    absolutely proved. The 280th Inf. Div. (J.D.) ordered the\r\n    execution of the action according to the Fuehrer’s order. The\r\n    execution was carried out toward the evening of Nov. 20. Some of\r\n    the prisoners wore blue ski-suits under their khaki uniforms\r\n    which had no insignia on the sleeves. During a short\r\n    interrogation the survivors have revealed nothing but their\r\n    names, ranks and serial numbers.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In connection with the shooting of the 17 members of the crew,\r\n    the Armed Forces Commander of Norway (WBN) has issued an order\r\n    to the district commanders, according to which the interrogation\r\n    by G-2 (Ic) and by BDS are important before the execution of the\r\n    Fuehrer order; in case of No. 4 of the Fuehrer order the\r\n    prisoners are to be handed over to the BDS.” (_508-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn three specific instances the Hitler order was carried out in Norway\r\n(_512-PS_). The procedure was to take individual commandos prisoner and\r\ninterrogate them to extract military intelligence before executing them.\r\nThis procedure was in accordance with the last sentence of Hitler’s\r\nsupplementary order (_503-PS_), and is obviously in flat contradiction\r\nof the requirements of the Hague and Geneva Conventions. The reason for\r\nthis procedure is explained as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_TOP SECRET_—According to the last sentence of the Fuehrer\r\n    order of 18th October (_CHEFS_), individual saboteurs can be\r\n    spared for the time being in order to keep them for\r\n    interrogation. The importance of this measure was proven in the\r\n    cases of Glomfjord, Twoman torpedo Drontheim, and glider plane\r\n    Stavanger, where interrogations resulted in valuable knowledge\r\n    of enemy intentions. Since in the case of Egersund the saboteur\r\n    was liquidated immediately and no clues were won; therefore,\r\n    Armed Forces Commander (WB) referred to above mentioned (OA)\r\n    last sentence of the Fuehrer order (Liquidation only after short\r\n    interrogation).” (_512-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother instance from the Norwegian theater of war (_526-PS_): On 30\r\nMarch 1943, 10 Norwegian navy personnel were taken prisoner from a\r\nNorwegian cutter at Toftefjord. The 10 prisoners were executed by the SD\r\nin accordance with the Hitler order, but the published report announced\r\nonly that the unit was destroyed:\r\n\r\n    “On the 30.3 1943 in Toftefjord (70° Lat.) an enemy cutter was\r\n    sighted, cutter was blown up by the enemy. Crew: 2 dead men, 10\r\n    prisoners.\r\n\r\n    “Cutter was sent from Scalloway (Shetland Is.) by the Norwegian\r\n    Navy.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_Purpose_: Construction of an organization for sabotaging of\r\n    strong-points, battery positions, staff and troop billets and\r\n    bridges.\r\n\r\n    “_Assigner of Mission in London_: Norwegian, Maj.

A telegram (_509-PS_)\r\nfrom the Supreme Commander in Italy to OKW, dated 7 November 1943, shows\r\nthat on 2 November 1943 three British commandos captured at Pascara,\r\nItaly, were given “special treatment” (_Sonderbehandelt_), which, as\r\nprevious evidence has shown, (_3040-PS_) means death. What happened to\r\nthe remaining nine prisoners of war who were wounded and in the hospital\r\nis not known. (_509-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn affidavit (_2610-PS_) dated 7 November 1945, by Frederick W. Roche, a\r\nMajor in the Army of the United States, furnishes other evidence of the\r\ncarrying out of the Hitler order. Major Roche was the Judge Advocate of\r\nan American Military Commission which tried General Anton Dostler,\r\nformerly Commander of the 75th German Army Corps, for the unlawful\r\nexecution of 15 members of the United States Armed Forces. His affidavit\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “FREDERICK W. ROCHE being duly sworn deposes and says:\r\n\r\n    “I am a Major in the Army of the United States.\r\n\r\n    “I was the Judge Advocate of the Military Commission which tried\r\n    Anton Dostler for ordering the execution of the group of fifteen\r\n    United States Army personnel who comprised the ‘Ginny Mission.’\r\n    This Military Commission consisting of five officers was\r\n    appointed by command of General McNarney, by Special Orders No.\r\n    269, dated 26 September 1945, Headquarters, Mediterranean\r\n    Theater of Operations, United States Army, APO 512.\r\n\r\n    “The Military Commission met at Rome, Italy, on 8 October 1945\r\n    and proceeded with the trial of the case of the United States v.\r\n    Anton Dostler. The trial of this case consumed four days and the\r\n    findings and sentence were announced on the morning of 12\r\n    October 1945. The charge and specification in this case are as\r\n    follows:\r\n\r\n    “‘Charge: Violation of the law of war.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Specification: In that Anton Dostler, then General, commanding\r\n    military forces of the German Reich, a belligerent enemy nation,\r\n    to wit the 75th Army Corps, did, on or about 24 March 1944, in\r\n    the vicinity of La Spezia, Italy, contrary to the law of war,\r\n    order to be shot summarily, a group of United States Army\r\n    personnel, consisting of two officers and thirteen enlisted men\r\n    who had then recently been captured by forces under General\r\n    Dostler, which order was carried into execution on or about 26\r\n    March 1944, resulting in the death of the said fifteen members\r\n    of the Army of the United States identified as follows * * *’.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I was present throughout the entire proceeding. I heard all the\r\n    testimony, and I am familiar with the record in this case. The\r\n    facts developed in this proceeding are as follows: On the night\r\n    of 22 March 1944, two officers and thirteen enlisted men of the\r\n    2677th Special Reconnaissance Battalion of the Army of the\r\n    United States disembarked from some United States Navy boats and\r\n    landed on the Italian coast near Stazione di Framura. All\r\n    fifteen men were members of the Army of the United States and\r\n    were in the military service of the United States. When they\r\n    landed on the Italian coast they were all properly dressed in\r\n    the field uniform of the United States Army and they carried no\r\n    civilian clothes. Their mission was to demolish a railroad\r\n    tunnel on the main line between La Spezia and Genoa. That rail\r\n    line was being used by the German Forces to supply their\r\n    fighting forces on the Cassino and Anzio Beachhead fronts. The\r\n    entire group was captured on the morning of 24 March 1944 by a\r\n    patrol consisting of Fascist soldiers and a group of members of\r\n    the German Army. All fifteen men were placed under interrogation\r\n    in La Spezia and they were held in custody until the morning of\r\n    26 March 1944 when they were all executed by a firing squad.\r\n    These men were never tried nor were they brought before any\r\n    court or given any hearing; they were shot by order of Anton\r\n    Dostler, then General Commanding the 75th German Army Corps.\r\n\r\n    “Anton Dostler took the stand in this case and testified by way\r\n    of defense that he ordered the fifteen American soldiers to be\r\n    shot pursuant to the Hitler order of 18 October 1942 on commando\r\n    operations, which provided that commandos were to be shot and\r\n    not taken prisoners of war, even after they had been\r\n    interrogated. He also testified that he would have been subject\r\n    to court martial proceedings if he did not obey the Hitler\r\n    order.\r\n\r\n    “The following is a true copy of the findings and sentence in\r\n    the case of the United States v. Anton Dostler, as these\r\n    findings and sentence appear in the original record of the trial\r\n    and as they were announced in open court at Rome, Italy on 12\r\n    October 1945:\r\n\r\n   “‘_FINDINGS_: General Dostler, as president of this commission it is\r\n                 my duty to inform you that the commission in closed\r\n                 session and upon secret written ballot, at least\r\n                 two-thirds of all the members of the commission\r\n                 concurring in each finding of guilty, finds you of the\r\n                 specification and of the charge:\r\n                       “‘GUILTY’.\r\n     “‘SENTENCE: And again in closed session and upon secret written\r\n                 ballot, at least two-thirds of all of the members of\r\n                 the commission concurring, sentences you:\r\n                 “‘TO BE SHOT TO DEATH BY MUSKETRY’.”  (_2610-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe order of 18 October 1942 remained in force, so far as the evidence\r\nshows, until the end of the war. On 22 June 1944 in a document initialed\r\nby Warlimont (_506-PS_) the OKW made it clear that the Hitler order was\r\nto be applied even in cases where the commando operation was undertaken\r\nby only one person:\r\n\r\n    “WFSt agrees with the view taken in the letter of the army group\r\n    judge [_Heeresgruppenrichter_] with the Supreme Commander\r\n    Southwest of 20 May 44 (Br. B. Nr 68/44 g.K.). The Fuehrer order\r\n    is to be applied even if the enemy employs only _one_ person for\r\n    a task. Therefore, it does not make any difference if several\r\n    persons or a single person take part in a commando operation.\r\n    The reason for the special treatment of participants in a\r\n    commando operation is that such operations do not correspond to\r\n    the German concept of usage and customs of (land) warfare.”\r\n    (_506-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe allied landing in Normandy early in June 1944, in the course of\r\nwhich large scale air-borne operations took place, raised among the\r\nGermans the question as to how far the Hitler order would be applied to\r\nNormandy, and in France behind the German lines. A memorandum (_531-PS_)\r\ndated 23 June 1944 and signed by Warlimont, starts by quoting a teletype\r\nfrom the Supreme Command in the West inquiring what should be done about\r\napplying the Hitler order to air-borne troops and commandos:\r\n\r\n    “Supreme Command West reports by teletype message No. 1750/44\r\n    Top Secret of 23 June 44:\r\n\r\n    “The treatment of enemy commando groups has so far been carried\r\n    out according to the order referred to. With the large-scale\r\n    landing achieved, a new situation has arisen. The order referred\r\n    to directs in number 5 that enemy soldiers who are taken\r\n    prisoner in open combat or surrender within the limits of normal\r\n    combat operations (large-scale landing operations and\r\n    undertakings) are not to be treated according to numbers 3 and\r\n    4. It must be established in a form easily understood by the\r\n    troops how far the concept ‘within the limits of normal combat\r\n    operations, etc.’ is to be extended.\r\n\r\n    “The application of number 5 for all enemy _soldiers in uniform_\r\n    penetrating from the outside into the occupied western areas is\r\n    held by Supreme Command West to be the most correct and clearest\r\n    solution.” (_531-PS_)\r\n\r\nWarlimont’s memorandum (_531-PS_) continues by reciting the position\r\ntaken with reference to the request by the OKW Operations Staff, of\r\nwhich Warlimont was the Deputy Chief:\r\n\r\n    “_Position taken by Armed Forces Operational Staff_:\r\n\r\n    “1. The Commando order remains basically in effect even after\r\n    the enemy landing in the west.\r\n\r\n    “2. Number 5 of the order is to be clarified to the effect, that\r\n    the order is not valid for _those_ enemy soldiers in uniform,\r\n    who are captured in open combat in the immediate combat area of\r\n    the beachhead by our troops committed there, or who surrender.\r\n    Our troops committed in the immediate combat area means the\r\n    divisions fighting on the front line as well as reserves up to\r\n    and including corps headquarters.\r\n\r\n    “3. Furthermore, in doubtful cases enemy personnel who have\r\n    fallen into our hands alive are to be turned over to the SD,\r\n    upon whom it is encumbent to determine whether the Commando\r\n    order is to be applied or not.\r\n\r\n    “4. Supreme Command West is to see to it that all units\r\n    committed in its zone are orally acquainted in a suitable manner\r\n    with the order concerning the treatment of members of commando\r\n    undertakings of 18 Oct. 42 along with the above explanation.”\r\n    (_531-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 25 June 1944 the OKW replied to this inquiry in a teletype message\r\n(_551-PS_) signed by Keitel and initialed by Warlimont and Jodl:\r\n\r\n    “_Subject_: Treatment of Commando Participants.\r\n\r\n    “1. Even after the landing of Anglo-Americans in France, the\r\n    order of the Fuehrer on the destruction of terror and sabotage\r\n    units of 18 Oct. 1942 remains fully in force.\r\n\r\n    “Enemy soldiers in uniform in the immediate combat area of the\r\n    bridgehead, that is, in the area of the divisions fighting in\r\n    the most forward lines as well as of the reserves up to the\r\n    Corps Commands, according to No. 5 of the basic order of 18 Oct.\r\n    1942, remain exempted.\r\n\r\n    “2. All members of terror and sabotage units, found outside the\r\n    immediate combat area, who include fundamentally all\r\n    parachutists, are to be killed in combat. In special cases, they\r\n    are to be turned over to the SD.\r\n\r\n    “3. All troops, committed outside the combat area of Normandy,\r\n    are to be informed about the duty to destroy enemy terror and\r\n    sabotage units briefly and succinctly according to the\r\n    directives, issued for it.\r\n\r\n    “4. Supreme Commander West will report immediately daily, how\r\n    many saboteurs have been liquidated in this manner. This applies\r\n    especially also to undertakings by the military commanders. The\r\n    number is to be published daily in the Armed Forces Communique\r\n    to exercise a frightening effect, as has already been done\r\n    toward previous commando undertakings in the same manners.”\r\n\r\n                                       “[Initial]  W  [Warlimont]\r\n                                       “[signature]  Keitel  (_551-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn July 1944, the question was raised within the German High Command as\r\nto whether the order of October 1942 should be applied to members of\r\nforeign military missions, with special regard to the British, American,\r\nand Soviet military missions which were cooperating with allied forces\r\nin Southeastern Europe, notably in Yugoslavia. A long document signed by\r\nWarlimont (_1279-PS_) embodies the discussions which were had at that\r\ntime at OKW. It discloses that the Armed Forces Operational Staff\r\nrecommended that the order should be applied to these military missions\r\nand drew up a draft order to this effect. The order which actually\r\nresulted from these discussions (_537-PS_), dated 30 July 1944 and\r\nsigned by Keitel, provides:\r\n\r\n    “_Re: Treatment of members of foreign ‘Military Missions,’\r\n    captured together with partisans._\r\n\r\n    “In the areas of the High Command Southeast and Southwest\r\n    members of foreign so-called ‘Military Missions’ (Anglo-American\r\n    as well as Soviet-Russian) captured in the course of the\r\n    struggle against partisans shall not receive the treatment as\r\n    speculated in the Special Orders regarding the treatment of\r\n    captured partisans. Therefore they are not to be treated as PWs\r\n    but in conformity with the Fuehrer’s order re the elimination of\r\n    terror and sabotage troops of 18 October 1942 (OKW/WFSt.\r\n    003830/42 g. Kdos).\r\n\r\n    “This order shall not be transmitted to other units of the Armed\r\n    forces via the High Commands and equivalent staffs and is to be\r\n    destroyed after being made record.\r\n\r\n    “The Chief of the High Command of the _Wehrmacht_\r\n\r\n                                               “Keitel”  (_537-PS_)\r\n\r\nPursuant to this order, approximately 15 members of an allied military\r\nmission to Slovakia were executed in January 1945. An affidavit (_L-51_)\r\nsigned by one Adolf Zutter, who was the adjutant at the camp where the\r\nexecutions took place, reads in part:\r\n\r\n    “Concerning the American Military Mission which had landed\r\n    behind the German main line of resistance in Slovakian or\r\n    Hungarian territory in January 1945, I remember when in January\r\n    1945 it was brought to the concentration camp at Mauthausen. I\r\n    suppose there were about 12 to 15 newcomers. They wore an\r\n    American or Canadian uniform, of brown-green color, blouse, and\r\n    cap made of cloth. Eight or ten days after their arrival the\r\n    order for execution came in by radiogram or teletype. Colonel\r\n    Ziereis came to me in the office and said: now Kaltenbrunner has\r\n    authorized the execution. The letter was secret and had the\r\n    signature: signed Kaltenbrunner. These people were then shot\r\n    according to martial law and T/Sgt [_Oberscharfuehrer_]\r\n    Niedermeyer handed their belongings over to me. In spring 1945,\r\n    a written order based on an Army manual to destroy all files was\r\n    received by the security officer in Mauthausen, 1st Lt.\r\n    [_Obersturmfuehrer_] Reimer; this order had been sent by Lt.\r\n    [_Untersturmfuehrer_] Meinhardt, security officer of Section D\r\n    in Oranienburg. Reimer forwarded this order personally in\r\n    written form to the various sections and supervised the\r\n    compliance with it. Among the files were also all the execution\r\n    orders.” (_L-51_)\r\n\r\nThe foregoing documents with respect to the order of 18 October 1942,\r\nand its subsequent enforcement and application, clearly demonstrate that\r\nmembers of the General Staff and High Command Group, including the\r\ndefendants Keitel, Jodl, Doenitz, and Raeder, ordered and directed the\r\ncommission of war crimes by members of the German Armed Forces, and that\r\nthese orders were carried out in numerous instances.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _War Crimes on the Eastern Front._ The order of October 1942 with\r\nrespect to the murdering of captured commandos operated chiefly in the\r\nWestern theater of war, against British and American commando troops.\r\nThis was natural since Germany occupied almost the entire Western coast\r\nof Europe from 1940 until the last year of the war, and during that\r\nperiod land fighting in Western Europe was largely limited to commando\r\noperations. The Mediterranean Theater likewise lent itself to this type\r\nof warfare.\r\n\r\nOn the Eastern Front, where there was large-scale land fighting in\r\nPoland and the Soviet Union from 1941 on, the German forces were\r\nfighting amongst a hostile population and had to face extensive partisan\r\nactivities behind their lines. It will be shown that the activities of\r\nthe German Armed Forces against partisans and other elements of the\r\npopulation became a vehicle for carrying out Nazi political and racial\r\npolicies, and a cloak for the ruthless and barbaric massacre of Jews and\r\nof numerous segments of the Slavic population which were regarded by the\r\nNazis as undesirable. It was the policy of the German Armed Forces to\r\nbehave with the utmost severity to the civilian population of the\r\noccupied territories, and to conduct its military operations,\r\nparticularly against partisans, so as to further these Nazi policies. It\r\nwill be shown that the German Armed Forces supported, assisted, and\r\nacted in cooperation with the SS Groups which were especially charged\r\nwith anti-partisan activities. Members of the General Staff and High\r\nCommand Group ordered, directed, encouraged, and were fully aware of\r\nthese criminal policies and activities.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed to make a full or even partial showing of war crimes\r\ncommitted by the Nazis on the Eastern Front; evidence of those crimes\r\nare to be presented by the Soviet delegation. Evidence concerning the\r\nactivities of the SS, SD, and Gestapo will be discussed only to the\r\nextent necessary to clarify the relations between these organizations\r\nand the German Armed Forces and to demonstrate their close collaboration\r\nin the occupied territories of Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nThese policies of ruthless severity to the civilian population of the\r\noccupied Eastern territories were determined upon and made official for\r\nthe German Armed Forces even before the invasion of the Soviet Union\r\ntook place. An order by Hitler, dated 13 May 1941, and signed by Keitel\r\nas Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces (_C-50_) provided:\r\n\r\n                                “_Order_\r\n\r\n    “_Concerning the exercise of martial jurisdiction and PROCEDURE\r\n    IN THE AREA ‘Barbarossa’ and special military measures._\r\n\r\n    “The application of martial law aims in the first place at\r\n    _maintaining discipline_.\r\n\r\n    “The fact that the operational areas in the East are so\r\n    farflung, the battle strategy which this necessitates, and the\r\n    peculiar qualities of the enemy, confront the courts-martial\r\n    with problems which, being short-staffed, they cannot solve\r\n    while hostilities are in progress, and until some degree of\r\n    pacification has been achieved in the conquered areas, unless\r\n    jurisdiction is confined, in the first instance, to its main\r\n    task.\r\n\r\n    “This is possible only if _the troops_ take ruthless action\r\n    themselves against any threat from the enemy population.\r\n\r\n    “For these reasons I herewith issue the following order\r\n    effective for the area ‘Barbarossa’ (area of operations, army\r\n    rear area, and area of political administration).\r\n\r\n    “I. _Treatment of offences committed by Enemy Civilians._\r\n\r\n    “1.

It is _expressly forbidden_ to _keep_ suspects _in custody_\r\n    in order to hand them over to the courts after the reinstatement\r\n    of civil courts.\r\n\r\n    “6. The C-in-Cs of the Army Groups may by agreement with the\r\n    competent Naval and Air Force Commanders reintroduce _military\r\n    jurisdiction for civilians_, in areas which are sufficiently\r\n    settled.\r\n\r\n    “For the _area of the_ ‘_Political Administration_’ this order\r\n    will be given by the Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed\r\n    Forces.\r\n\r\n    “II. _Treatment of offences committed against inhabitants by\r\n    members of the Armed Forces and its employees._\r\n\r\n    “1. With regard to offences committed against enemy civilians by\r\n    members of the Wehrmacht and its employees _prosecution is not\r\n    obligatory_ even where the deed is at the same time a military\r\n    crime or offence.\r\n\r\n    “2. When judging such offences, it must be borne in mind,\r\n    whatever the circumstances, that the collapse of Germany in\r\n    1918, the subsequent sufferings of the German people and the\r\n    fight against National Socialism which cost the blood of\r\n    innumerable supporters of the movement, were caused primarily by\r\n    Bolshevik influence and that no German has forgotten this fact.\r\n\r\n    “3. Therefore the judicial authority will decide in such cases\r\n    whether a disciplinary penalty is indicated, or whether _legal\r\n    measures_ are necessary. In the case of offences against\r\n    inhabitants it will order a _court martial_ only if _maintenance\r\n    of discipline_ or _security of the Forces_ call for such a\r\n    measure. This applies for instance to serious offences\r\n    originating in lack of self control in sexual matters, or in a\r\n    criminal disposition, and to those which indicate that the\r\n    troops are threatening to get out of hand. Offences which have\r\n    resulted in senseless destruction of billets or stores or other\r\n    captured material to the disadvantage of our Forces should as a\r\n    rule be judged no less severely.\r\n\r\n    “_The order to institute proceedings_ requires in every single\r\n    case the signature of the Judicial Authority.\r\n\r\n    “4. _Extreme caution_ is indicated in assessing the credibility\r\n    of statements made by enemy civilians.\r\n\r\n    “III. _Responsibility of the Military Commanders._\r\n\r\n    “Within their sphere of competence Military Commanders are\r\n    _personally_ responsible for seeing that:\r\n\r\n    “1. Every commissioned officer of the units under their command\r\n    is instructed promptly and in the most emphatic manner on\r\n    principles set out under I above.\r\n\r\n    “2. Their legal advisers are notified promptly of these\r\n    instructions and of _verbal information in which the political\r\n    intentions of the High Command were explained to C-in-Cs_.\r\n\r\n    “3. Only those court sentences are confirmed which are in\r\n    accordance with the political intentions of the High Command.\r\n\r\n    “IV. _Security._\r\n\r\n    Once the camouflage is lifted this decree will be treated as\r\n    “Most Secret”:\r\n\r\n                               “By order\r\n                     “Chief of the Supreme Command\r\n                          of the Armed Forces\r\n                                        “(signed) Keitel”  (_C-50_)\r\n\r\nLess than three months after the invasion of the Soviet Union, these\r\ninstructions were amplified and made even more drastic. An order dated\r\n16 September 1941 and signed by Keitel, was widely distributed\r\n(_C-148_). This order was of general application in all theaters of war,\r\nbut was clearly of primary importance for the Eastern Front:\r\n\r\n    “_Subject_: Communist Insurrection in occupied territories.\r\n\r\n    “1. Since the beginning of the campaign against Soviet Russia,\r\n    Communist insurrection movements have broken out everywhere in\r\n    the areas occupied by Germany. The type of action taken is\r\n    growing from propaganda measures and attacks on individual\r\n    members of the Armed Forces, into open rebellion and widespread\r\n    guerilla warfare.\r\n\r\n    “It can be seen that this is a _mass movement centrally directed\r\n    by Moscow_, who is also responsible for the apparently trivial\r\n    isolated incidents in areas which up to now have been otherwise\r\n    quiet.\r\n\r\n    “In view of the many political and economic crises in the\r\n    occupied areas, it must, moreover, be anticipated, that\r\n    _nationalist and other circles_ will make full use of this\r\n    opportunity of making difficulties for the German occupying\r\n    forces by associating themselves with the Communist\r\n    insurrection.\r\n\r\n    “This creates an increasing _danger to the German war effort_,\r\n    which shows itself chiefly in general insecurity for the\r\n    occupying troops, and has already led to the withdrawal of\r\n    forces to the main centers of disturbance.\r\n\r\n    “2. _The measures taken up to now_ to deal with general\r\n    insurrection movement _have proved inadequate_. The Fuehrer has\r\n    now given orders that we take action _everywhere with the most\r\n    drastic means_ in order to crush the movement in the shortest\r\n    possible time.\r\n\r\n    “Only this course, which has always been followed successfully\r\n    throughout the history of the extension of influence of great\r\n    peoples, can restore order.\r\n\r\n    “3. Action taken in this matter should be in accordance with the\r\n    following _general directions_:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ It should be inferred, in _every case_ of resistance to\r\n    the German occupying Forces, no matter what the individual\r\n    circumstances, that it is of _Communist origin_.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ In order to nip these machinations in the bud, the most\r\n    drastic measures should be taken immediately on _the first\r\n    indication_, so that the authority of the occupying Forces may\r\n    be maintained, and further spreading prevented. In this\r\n    connection it should be remembered that a human life in\r\n    unsettled countries frequently counts for nothing and a\r\n    deterrent effect can be attained only by unusual severity. The\r\n    death penalty for 50-100 Communists should generally be regarded\r\n    in these cases as suitable atonement for one German soldier’s\r\n    life. The way in which sentence is carried out should still\r\n    further increase the deterrent effect.\r\n\r\n    “The reverse course of action, that of imposing relatively\r\n    lenient penalties, and of being content, for purposes of\r\n    deterrence, with the threat of more severe measures, does not\r\n    accord with these principles and should therefore not be\r\n    followed.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “4. _The Commanding Officers in the occupied territories_ are\r\n    seeing to it that these principles are made known without delay\r\n    to all military establishments concerned in dealing with\r\n    Communist measures of insurrection.”\r\n\r\n                                          “[Indecipherable initial]\r\n                                                “Keitel”  (_C-148_)\r\n\r\nThe German military leaders took up, sponsored, and instructed their\r\ntroops to practice the racial policies of the Nazis. On 10 October 1941\r\na directive was issued by Field Marshal von Reichenau, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief (_Oberbefehlshaber_) of the German 8th Army, then\r\noperating on the Eastern Front (_UK-81_). Reichenau (who died in 1942)\r\nwas therefore a member of the group, and here is what he had to say:\r\n\r\n    “Subject: Conduct of Troops in Eastern Territories.\r\n\r\n    “Regarding the conduct of troops towards the bolshevistic\r\n    system, vague ideas are still prevalent in many cases. The most\r\n    essential aim of war against the Jewish-bolshevistic system is a\r\n    complete destruction of their means of power and the elimination\r\n    of Asiatic influence from the European culture. In this\r\n    connection the troops are facing tasks which exceed the\r\n    one-sided routine of soldiering. The soldier in the eastern\r\n    territories is not merely a fighter according to the rules of\r\n    the art of war but also a bearer of ruthless national ideology\r\n    and the avenger of bestialities which have been inflicted upon\r\n    German and racially related nations.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore the soldier must have full understanding for the\r\n    necessity of a severe but just revenge on subhuman Jewry. The\r\n    Army has to aim at another purpose, i.e., the annihilation of\r\n    revolts in hinterland which, as experience proves, have always\r\n    been caused by Jews.\r\n\r\n    “The combatting of the enemy behind the front line is still not\r\n    being taken seriously enough. Treacherous, cruel partisans and\r\n    unnatural women are still being made prisoners of war and\r\n    guerilla fighters dressed partly in uniforms or plain clothes\r\n    and vagabonds are still being treated as proper soldiers, and\r\n    sent to prisoner of war camps. In fact, captured Russian\r\n    officers talk even mockingly about Soviet agents moving openly\r\n    about the roads and very often eating at German field kitchens.\r\n    Such an attitude of the troops can only be explained by complete\r\n    thoughtlessness, so it is now high time for the commanders to\r\n    clarify the meaning of the present struggle.\r\n\r\n    “The feeding of the natives and of prisoners of war who are not\r\n    working for the Armed Forces from Army kitchens is an equally\r\n    misunderstood humanitarian act as is the giving of cigarettes\r\n    and bread. Things which the people at home can spare under great\r\n    sacrifices and things which are being brought by the Command to\r\n    the front under great difficulties, should not be given to the\r\n    enemy by the soldier not even if they originate from booty. It\r\n    is an important part of our supply.\r\n\r\n    “When retreating the Soviets have often set buildings on fire.\r\n    The troops should be interested in extinguishing of fires only\r\n    as far as it is necessary to secure sufficient numbers of\r\n    billets. Otherwise the disappearance of symbols of the former\r\n    bolshevistic rule even in the form of buildings is part of the\r\n    struggle of destruction. Neither historic nor artistic\r\n    considerations are of any importance in the eastern territories.\r\n    The command issues the necessary directives for the securing of\r\n    raw materials and plants, essential for war economy. The\r\n    complete disarming of the civil population in the rear of the\r\n    fighting troops is imperative considering the long and\r\n    vulnerable lines of communications. Where possible, captured\r\n    weapons and ammunition should be stored and guarded. Should this\r\n    be impossible because of the situation of the battle so the\r\n    weapons and ammunition will be rendered useless. If isolated\r\n    partisans are found using firearms in the rear of the army\r\n    drastic measures are to be taken. These measures will be\r\n    extended to that part of the male population who were in a\r\n    position to hinder or report the attacks. The indifference of\r\n    numerous apparently anti-Soviet elements which originates from a\r\n    ‘wait and see’ attitude, must give way to a clear decision for\r\n    active collaboration. If not, no one can complain about being\r\n    judges and treated a member of the Soviet System.\r\n\r\n    “The fear of the German countermeasures must be stronger than\r\n    the threats of the wandering bolshevistic remnants. Being far\r\n    from all political considerations of the future the soldier has\r\n    to fulfill two tasks:\r\n\r\n    “1. _Complete annihilation of the false bolshevistic doctrine of\r\n    the Soviet State and its armed forces._\r\n\r\n    “2. _The pitiless extermination of foreign treachery and cruelty\r\n    and thus the protection of the lives of military personnel in\r\n    Russia._\r\n\r\n    “This is the only way to fulfill our historic task to liberate\r\n    the German people once for ever from the Asiatic-Jewish danger.\r\n\r\n                                             “Commander-in-Chief\r\n                                             “(Signed) von Reichenau\r\n                                             “Field Marshal.”  (_UK-81_)\r\n\r\nImmediately preceding Reichenau’s order is a memorandum, dated 28\r\nOctober 1941, which shows that Reichenau’s order met with Hitler’s\r\napproval and was thereafter circulated by order of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the German Army. It is also clear that Reichenau’s\r\norder was thereafter circulated down to divisional level, and was\r\nreceived by the 12th Infantry Division on 27 November 1941. (_UK-81_)\r\n\r\nThese being the directives and policies prescribed by the German\r\nmilitary leaders, it is no wonder that the _Wehrmacht_ joined in the\r\nmonstrous behavior of the SS and SD on the Eastern Front. Units (known\r\nas _Einsatzgruppen_) were formed by the SIPO and SD and sent out to\r\noperate in and behind the operational areas on the Eastern Front, in\r\norder to combat partisans and to “cleanse” and “pacify” the civilian\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn a directive dated 19 March 1943, the Commanding Officer of one of\r\nthese units praised and justified such activities as the shooting of\r\nHungarian Jews, the shooting of children, and the total burning down of\r\nvillages (_3012-PS_). The officer directed that in order not to obstruct\r\nthe procuring of slave labor for the German armament industry,\r\n\r\n    “as a rule no more children will be shot” (_3012-PS_).\r\n\r\nA report covering the work of the _Einsatzgruppen_ in the German\r\noccupied territories of the Soviet Union during the month of October\r\n1941 disregards every vestige of decency (_R-102_). It states cynically\r\nthat, in the Baltic areas,\r\n\r\n    “spontaneous demonstrations against Jewry followed by pogroms on\r\n    the part of the population against the remaining Jews have not\r\n    been recorded, on account of the lack of adequate\r\n    indoctrination” (_R-102_).\r\n\r\nThis report shows clearly that “pacification” and “anti-partisan\r\nactivity” are mere code words for “extermination of Jews and Slavs” just\r\nas much as “_Weserubung_” was a code word for the invasion and\r\nsubjugation of Norway and Denmark.\r\n\r\nDocuments quoted earlier show that the German Army was operating under\r\nsimilar policies and directives. It only remains to show that, in these\r\npractices, the Army and the SS worked hand in glove. The report\r\ndescribing the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto (_1061-PS_) stresses the\r\nclose cooperation between the SS and the Army:\r\n\r\n    “The longer the resistance lasted, the tougher the men of the\r\n    _Waffen SS_, Police and _Wehrmacht_ became; they fulfilled their\r\n    duty indefatigably in faithful comradeship and stood together as\r\n    models and examples of soldiers. Their duty hours often lasted\r\n    from early morning until late at night. At night, search patrols\r\n    with rags wound round their feet remained at the heels of the\r\n    Jews and gave them no respite. Not infrequently they caught and\r\n    killed Jews who used the night hours for supplementing their\r\n    stores from abandoned dugouts and for contacting neighboring\r\n    groups or exchanging news with them.” (1061-PS)\r\n\r\nTo the same general effect is a report dated 5 June 1943 by the German\r\nGeneral Commissioner for Minsk (_R-135_). This report describes an\r\nanti-partisan operation in which 4,500 “enemies” were killed, 5,000\r\nsuspected partisans were killed, and 59 Germans were killed. The\r\ncooperation in this adventure by the German Army is shown in the\r\nfollowing excerpt:\r\n\r\n    “The above mentioned figures show, that we have to count with a\r\n    strong annihilation of the population. The fact that only 492\r\n    rifles were found on the 4,500 enemy dead, demonstrates that the\r\n    numerous peasants from the country were also among the enemy\r\n    dead. The battalion _Direwanger_ is particularly known to have\r\n    destroyed numerous human lives. Among the 5,000 partisan\r\n    suspects who were shot, are numerous women and children.\r\n\r\n    “Units of the troops [_Wehrmannschaften_] also took part in the\r\n    action, by order of SS Lt. General [_Obergruppenfuehrer_] von\r\n    dem Bach. SA Colonel [_Standartenfuehrer_] Kunze led the troops\r\n    [Wehrmannschaften], who included also 90 members of my authority\r\n    and of the district-commissarate Minsk-Stadt. Our men returned\r\n    yesterday from the action without any losses. I refuse the use\r\n    of officials and Reich-Employees of the General Commissarate in\r\n    the rear areas. The men who work for me have not been classified\r\n    as essential, after all in order to fight the partisans actively\r\n    in the place of the Armed Forces and the Police.\r\n\r\n    “Of the troops [_Wehrmannschaften_], one railroad employee had\r\n    been wounded (shot through the lung). The political effect of\r\n    this large scale action on the peaceful population had been\r\n    disastrous, because of the numerous executions of women and\r\n    children. The town BEGOMIE was cleared by the Armed Forces and\r\n    the Police in December. The population of Begomie was\r\n    predominantly favorable to us. Begomie, which has been fortified\r\n    as a strong point by the partisans, has been destroyed by German\r\n    Air Attacks during the fighting.” (_R-135_)\r\n\r\nThe _SS Obergruppenfuehrer_ von dem Bach referred to in this quotation\r\nis mentioned in Himmler’s speech to a gathering of SS generals at Posen\r\non 4 October 1943 (_1919-PS_). In this speech Himmler announced the\r\nappointment of von dem Bach to be Chief of all anti-partisan units:\r\n\r\n    “In the meantime I have also set up the department of Chief of\r\n    the Anti-partisan Units” [_Bandenkampf-Verbunde_]. Our comrade\r\n    _SS-Obergruppenfuehrer_ von dem Bach is Chief of the\r\n    anti-partisan units. I considered it necessary for the\r\n    Reichsfuehrer SS to be in authoritative command in all these\r\n    battles, for I am convinced that we are best in a position to\r\n    take action against this enemy struggle, which is a decidedly\r\n    political one. Except where the units which had been supplied\r\n    and which we had formed for this purpose were taken from us to\r\n    fill in gaps at the front, we have been very successful.\r\n\r\n    “It is notable that, by setting up this department we have\r\n    gained (p. 58) for the SS in turn a division, a corps, an army,\r\n    and the next step, which is the High Command of an army or even\r\n    of a group—if you wish to call it that.” _(1919-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe report of _Einsatzgruppe A_, (_L-180_) covering the period up to 15\r\nOctober 1941, makes clear beyond doubt the participation of the German\r\nmilitary leaders and Armed Forces in these extermination policies:\r\n\r\n    “Action-Group A, after preparing their vehicles for action\r\n    proceeded to their area of concentration as ordered on 23 June\r\n    1941, the second day of the campaign in the East. Army Group\r\n    North consisting of the 16th and 18th Armies and Panzer-Group 4\r\n    had left the day before. Our task was to hurriedly establish\r\n    personal contact with the commanders of the Armies and with the\r\n    commander of the army of the rear area. It must be stressed from\r\n    the beginning that cooperation with the Armed Forces was\r\n    generally good, in some cases, for instance with Panzer-Group 4\r\n    under Col. Gen. Hoeppner, it was very close, almost cordial.\r\n    Misunderstandings which cropped up with some authorities in the\r\n    first days, were cleared up mainly through personal\r\n    discussions.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Similarly, native anti-Semitic forces were induced to start\r\n    pogroms against Jews during the first hours after capture,\r\n    though this inducement proved to be very difficult. Following\r\n    out orders, the Security Police was determined to solve the\r\n    Jewish question with all possible means and most decisively. But\r\n    it was desirable that the Security Police should not put in an\r\n    immediate appearance, at least in the beginning, since the\r\n    extraordinarily harsh measures were apt to stir even German\r\n    circles. It had to be shown to the world that the native\r\n    population itself took the first action by way of natural\r\n    reaction against the suppression by Jews during several decades\r\n    and against the terror exercised by the Communists during the\r\n    preceding period.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “After the failure of purely military activities such as the\r\n    placing of sentries and combing through the newly occupied\r\n    territories with whole divisions, even the Armed Forces had to\r\n    look out for new methods. The Action-Group undertook to search\r\n    for new methods. Soon therefore the Armed Forces adopted the\r\n    experiences of the Security Police and their methods of\r\n    combatting the partisans. For details I refer to the numerous\r\n    reports concerning the struggle against the partisans.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “1. _Instigation of self-cleansing actions._\r\n\r\n    “Considering that the population of the Baltic countries had\r\n    suffered very heavily under the government of Bolshevism and\r\n    Jewry while they were incorporated in the USSR, it was to be\r\n    expected that after the liberation from that foreign government,\r\n    they (i.e., the population themselves) would render harmless\r\n    most of the enemies left behind after the retreat of the Red\r\n    Army. It was the duty of the Security Police to set in motion\r\n    these self-cleansing movements and to direct them into the\r\n    correct channels in order to accomplish the purpose of the\r\n    cleansing operations as quickly as possible. It was no less\r\n    important in view of the future to establish the unshakable and\r\n    provable fact that the liberated population themselves took the\r\n    most severe measures against the Bolshevist and Jewish enemy\r\n    quite on their own, so that the direction by German authorities\r\n    could not be found out.\r\n\r\n    “In Lithouania this was achieved for the first time by partisan\r\n    activities in Kowno. To our surprise it was not easy at first to\r\n    set in motion an extensive pogrom against Jews. KLIMATIS, the\r\n    leader of the partisan unit, mentioned above, who was used for\r\n    this purpose primarily, succeeded in starting a pogrom on the\r\n    basis of advice given to him by a small advanced detachment\r\n    acting in Kowno, and in such a way that no German order or\r\n    German instigation was noticed from the outside. During the\r\n    first pogrom in the night from 25. to 26.6 the Lithouanian\r\n    partisans did away with more than 1,500 Jews, set fire to\r\n    several Synagogues or destroyed them by other means and burned\r\n    down a Jewish dwelling district consisting of about 60 houses.\r\n    During the following nights about 2,300 Jews were made harmless\r\n    in a similar way. In other parts of Lithouania similar actions\r\n    followed the example of Kowno, though smaller and extending to\r\n    the Communists who had been left behind.\r\n\r\n    “These self-cleansing actions went smoothly because the Army\r\n    authorities who had been informed showed understanding for this\r\n    procedure. From the beginning it was obvious that only the first\r\n    days after the occupation would offer the opportunity for\r\n    carrying out pogroms. After the disarmament of the partisans the\r\n    self-cleansing actions ceased necessarily.\r\n\r\n    “It proved much more difficult to set in motion similar\r\n    cleansing actions in _Latvia_. Essentially the reason was that\r\n    the whole of the national stratum of leaders had been\r\n    assassinated or destroyed by the Soviets, especially in Riga. It\r\n    was possible though through similar influences on the Latvian\r\n    auxiliary to set in motion a pogrom against Jews also in Riga.\r\n    During this pogrom all synagogues were destroyed and about 400\r\n    Jews were killed. As the population of Riga quieted down\r\n    quickly, further pogroms were not convenient.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “5. _Other jobs of the Security Police._\r\n\r\n    “1. Occasionally the conditions prevailing in the lunatic\r\n    asylums necessitated operations of the Security Police. Many\r\n    institutions had been robbed by the retreating Russians of their\r\n    whole food supply. Often the guard and nursing personnel had\r\n    fled. The inmates of several institutions broke out and became a\r\n    danger to the general security; therefore\r\n\r\nin Aglona (Lithouania)                                  544 lunatics\r\nin Mariampol (Lithouania)                               109 lunatics and\r\nin Magutowo (near Luga)                                  95 lunatics\r\n\r\n    were liquidated.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “When it was decided to extend the German operations to\r\n    Leningrad and also to extend the activities of Action Group A to\r\n    this town, I gave orders on 18 July 1941 to parts of Action\r\n    Detachments 2 and 3 and to the Staff of the Group to advance to\r\n    Novosselje, in order to prepare these activities and to be able\r\n    to advance as early as possible into the area around Leningrad\r\n    and into the city itself.

An affidavit (_3710-PS_) by Walter Schellenberg who, at\r\nthe time under discussion, was an important official in the RSHA,\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “In the middle of May 1941, as far as I remember, the Chief of\r\n    Amt 4 of the RSHA (SS-Brigadefuehrer Mueller), in the name of\r\n    the Chief of the RSHA (SS-Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich), held\r\n    discussions with the Generalquartiermeister of the Army (General\r\n    Wagner) about questions connected with the operations of the\r\n    SIPO and SD within the bounds of the Field Army during the\r\n    imminent campaign against Russia. Wagner could come to no\r\n    agreement with Mueller and therefore asked Heydrich to send\r\n    another representative. I was at that time Chief of Section E in\r\n    Amt 4 of the RSHA under Chief of Amt Mueller and was sent by\r\n    Heydrich to Wagner because of my experience in matters of\r\n    protocol for the purpose of drawing up the final agreement.\r\n    According to the instructions given to me, I was supposed to\r\n    make sure that this agreement would provide that the responsible\r\n    headquarters in the Army would be firmly obligated to give\r\n    complete support to all activities of the Combat Groups and\r\n    Combat Commandos of the SIPO and SD. I discussed the problem of\r\n    this mutual relationship in great detail with Wagner. In\r\n    accordance with this discussion I then presented him with the\r\n    completed draft of an agreement, which met with his full\r\n    approval. This draft of an agreement was the basis for a final\r\n    discussion between Wagner and Heydrich towards the end of May\r\n    1941.\r\n\r\n    “The contents of this agreement, as far as I remember, were\r\n    substantially as follows. Its basis was the Fuehrer’s command,\r\n    mentioned at the very beginning of the agreement, that the SIPO\r\n    and SD should operate within the combat elements of the Field\r\n    Army, with the mission of utterly smashing all resistance in\r\n    conquered front-line areas as well as in conquered rear supply\r\n    zones by every means and as quickly as possible. The various\r\n    areas were then set down in which the SIPO and SD were to be\r\n    active and operating. The individual Combat Groups were then\r\n    assigned to the army groups which were to take part in the\r\n    campaign and the individual Combat Commandos to the respective\r\n    armies which were to take part in the campaign.\r\n\r\n    “The Combat Groups and Combat Commandos were to operate in\r\n    detail:\r\n\r\n    “1. In front-line areas: in complete subordination to the Field\r\n    Army, tactically, functionally and administratively;\r\n\r\n    “2. In rear operational areas: in merely administrative\r\n    subordination to the Field Army, but under command and\r\n    functional control of the RSHA;\r\n\r\n    “3. In rear Army areas: arrangement as in 2;\r\n\r\n    “4. In areas of the civil administration in the East: same as in\r\n    the Reich.\r\n\r\n    “The tactical and functional authority and responsibility of\r\n    front-line headquarters of the Field Army over the Combat\r\n    Commandos found no limitation in the agreement and therefore\r\n    needed no further clarification.\r\n\r\n    “The agreement made it clear that the administrative\r\n    subordination embraced not only disciplinary subordination but\r\n    also the obligation for rear headquarters of the Field Army to\r\n    support the Combat Groups and Combat Commandos in matters of\r\n    supply (gasoline, rations, etc.) as well as in the use of the\r\n    communications network.\r\n\r\n    “This agreement was signed by Heydrich and Wagner in my\r\n    presence. Wagner signed it either ‘acting for’ or ‘by order of’\r\n    the OKH.\r\n\r\n    “After Wagner and Heydrich had affixed their signatures, both of\r\n    them asked me to leave the room for half an hour. Just while\r\n    leaving I heard how they both wanted to discuss in complete\r\n    privacy the Fuehrer’s command, which was apparently known in\r\n    advance by each of them personally, and its far-reaching\r\n    implications. After the half hour was over I was called in once\r\n    more just to say goodbye.\r\n\r\n    “Today I read the ‘Operational and Situational Report No. 6 of\r\n    the Combat Groups of the SIPO and SD in the USSR (covering the\r\n    period from 1 to 31 October 1941),’ as well as the\r\n    ‘Comprehensive Report of Combat Group A up to 15 October 1941.’\r\n    The whole substance of these reports shows that the prime\r\n    mission of the Combat Groups and Combat Commandos of the SIPO\r\n    and SD was to undertake and carry out mass executions of Jews,\r\n    Communists and other elements of resistance. It is also clear\r\n    from the above-cited ‘Comprehensive Report,’ which embraces no\r\n    more than the first four months of these operations, that the\r\n    cooperation of the respective _Oberbefehlshabers_ with Combat\r\n    Group A was ‘in general good and in individual instances, for\r\n    instance that of Panzergruppe 4 under Colonel General Hoeppner,\r\n    very close, in fact almost cordial’ (page 1). From an inclosure\r\n    to this same report, bearing the title ‘Summary of the Number of\r\n    Executed Persons,’ particularly from the figures arranged\r\n    according to the successively conquered areas, it is evident\r\n    that the SIPO and SD operated in front-line areas so as fully to\r\n    carry out their prime function of conducting mass executions of\r\n    all elements of resistance even from the very beginning of the\r\n    advance against Russia. I acknowledge the reliability and\r\n    authenticity of both of the above cited reports. Therefore I\r\n    must today express my firm conviction that the Oberbefehlshabers\r\n    of the army groups and armies which were to take part in the\r\n    Russian campaign were accurately informed through the normal OKH\r\n    channels of communication about the extensive future mission of\r\n    the Combat Groups and Combat Commandos of the SIPO and SD as\r\n    including planned mass executions of Jews, Communists and all\r\n    other elements of resistance.\r\n\r\n    “In the beginning of June 1941 all of the Ic\r\n    counter-intelligence officers, and, as far as I remember, all of\r\n    the Ic officers of all army groups, armies, army corps and some\r\n    of the divisions which were to take part in the coming Russian\r\n    campaign were called in by Wagner, together with Heydrich and\r\n    the Chief of the Amt for Counter-Intelligence Abroad in the OKW\r\n    (Admiral Canaris) for a general conference in the OKW Building\r\n    at Berlin. The responsible leaders of the Combat Groups and\r\n    Combat Commandos of the SIPO and SD were for the most part\r\n    likewise present. I was also there. The essential substance and\r\n    purpose of this meeting was to outline the military strategy\r\n    against Russia and to announce the above-mentioned details of\r\n    the written agreement reached by Wagner and Heydrich.\r\n\r\n    “This group of Ic counter-intelligence officers and Ic officers\r\n    remained at Berlin a few days longer and was carefully\r\n    instructed in several additional conferences, at which I was not\r\n    present, about further details of the coming Russian campaign. I\r\n    assume that these discussions were concerned with the exact\r\n    delineation of the Fuehrer’s command ‘to smash utterly all\r\n    resistance in occupied areas by every means and as quickly as\r\n    possible,’ including even planned mass executions of all\r\n    elements of resistance. Otherwise the cooperation between the\r\n    Field Army and the Combat Groups, which in the above-cited\r\n    documents is clearly revealed as existing but a few weeks\r\n    thereafter, could not in my opinion have been forthcoming. In\r\n    any event there is hardly any reason to doubt that these Ic\r\n    counter-intelligence officers, immediately upon their return\r\n    from Berlin, accurately informed their own superiors, including\r\n    all Oberbefehlshabers of the army groups and armies which were\r\n    to march against Russia, about the full extent of the\r\n    agreement.”\r\n\r\n                                     “(signed) Walter Schellenberg\r\n                                          “26. XI. 45”  (_3710-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother affidavit which sheds light on the relations between the\r\n_Wehrmacht_ and the SS at the top level with respect to anti-partisan\r\nwarfare (_3711-PS_) is sworn to by Wilhelm Scheidt, a retired captain of\r\nthe German Army who worked in the War History Section of OKW from 1941\r\nto 1945:\r\n\r\n    “I, Wilhelm Scheidt, belonged to the War History Section of the\r\n    OKW from the year 1941 to 1945.\r\n\r\n    “Concerning the question of partisan warfare I state that I\r\n    remember the following from my knowledge of the documents of the\r\n    Operations Staff of the OKW as well as from my conversations in\r\n    the Fuehrer’s headquarters with Generalmajor Walter Scherff, the\r\n    Fuehrer’s appointee for the compilation of the history of the\r\n    war.\r\n\r\n    “Counter-partisan warfare was originally a responsibility of\r\n    Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, who sent police forces to\r\n    handle this matter.\r\n\r\n    “In the years 1942 and 1943 however counter-partisan warfare\r\n    developed to such an extent that the Operations Staff of the OKW\r\n    had to give it particular attention. In the Army Operations\r\n    Section of the Operations Staff of the OKW a specific officer\r\n    was assigned the development of counter-partisan warfare as his\r\n    special job. It proved necessary to conduct extensive operations\r\n    against the partisans with _Wehrmacht_ troops in Russian as well\r\n    as Yugoslavian territory. Partisan operations for a long while\r\n    threatened to cut off the lines of communication and transport\r\n    routes that were necessary to support the German _Wehrmacht_.\r\n    For instance, a monthly report concerning the attacks on the\r\n    railroad lines in occupied Russia revealed that in the Russian\r\n    area alone from 800 to 1,000 attacks occurred each month during\r\n    that period, causing among other things, the loss of from 200 to\r\n    300 locomotives.\r\n\r\n    “It was a well-known fact that partisan warfare was conducted\r\n    with cruelty on both sides. It was also well-known that\r\n    reprisals were inflicted on hostages and communities whose\r\n    inhabitants were suspected of being partisans or of supporting\r\n    them. It is beyond question that these facts must have been\r\n    known to the leading officers in the Operations Staff of the OKW\r\n    and in the Army’s General Staff. It was further well-known that\r\n    Hitler believed that the only successful method of conducting\r\n    counter-partisan warfare was to employ cruel punishments as\r\n    deterrents.\r\n\r\n    “I remember that at the time of the Polish revolt in Warsaw,\r\n    SS-Gruppenfuehrer Fegelein reported to Generaloberst Guderian\r\n    and Jodl about the atrocities of the Russian SS-Brigade\r\n    Kaminski, which fought on the German side.”\r\n\r\n                                         “(Signed) Wilhelm Scheidt\r\n                      “Retired Captain of the Reserve”  (_3711-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe foregoing documents show the arrangements which were made between\r\nthe OKW, OKH and Himmler’s headquarters with respect to anti-partisan\r\nwarfare. They show conclusively that the plans and arrangements were\r\nmade jointly, and that the High Command of the Armed Forces was not only\r\nfully aware of but an active participant in these plans. The same is\r\ntrue of the field commanders. General Roettiger, who attained the rank\r\nof General of Panzer Troops (the equivalent of a Lt. General in the\r\nAmerican Army), has made three statements (_3713-PS_; _3714-PS_).\r\nRoettiger was Chief of Staff of the German 4th Army, and later of Army\r\nGroup Center, on the Eastern Front during the period of which he speaks:\r\n\r\n    “As Chief of Staff of the 4th Army from May 1942 to June 1943,\r\n    to which was later added the area of the 9th Army, I often had\r\n    occasion to concern myself officially with anti-partisan\r\n    warfare. During these operations the troops received orders from\r\n    the highest authority, as for example even the OKH, to use the\r\n    harshest methods. These operations were carried out by troops of\r\n    the Army Group and of the Army, as for example security\r\n    battalions.\r\n\r\n    “At the beginning, in accordance with orders which were issued\r\n    through official channels, only a few prisoners were taken. In\r\n    accordance with orders, Jews, political commissars and agents\r\n    were delivered up to the SD.\r\n\r\n    “The number of enemy dead mentioned in official reports was very\r\n    high in comparison with our own losses. From the documents which\r\n    have been shown to me I have now come to realize that the order\r\n    from highest authorities for the harshest conduct of the\r\n    anti-partisan war can have been intended to make possible a\r\n    ruthless liquidation of Jews and other undesirable elements by\r\n    using for this purpose the military struggle of the army against\r\n    the partisans.” (_3713-PS_)\r\n\r\nRoettiger’s second statement reads:\r\n\r\n    “Supplementary to my above declaration I declare:\r\n\r\n    “As I stated orally on 28 November, my then Commander-in-Chief\r\n    of the Fourth Army instructed his troops many times not to wage\r\n    war against the partisans more severely than was required at the\r\n    time by the position. This struggle should only be pushed to the\r\n    annihilation of the enemy after all attempts to bring about a\r\n    surrender failed. Apart from humanitarian reasons we necessarily\r\n    had an interest in taking prisoners since very many of them\r\n    could very well be used as members of native volunteer units\r\n    against the partisans.\r\n\r\n    “Alongside the necessary active combatting of partisans there\r\n    was propaganda directed at the partisans and also at the\r\n    population with the object, by peaceful means, of causing them\r\n    to give up partisan activities. For instance, in this way the\r\n    women too were continually urged to get their men back from the\r\n    forests or to keep them by other means from joining the\r\n    partisans. And this propaganda had good results. In the spring\r\n    of 1943 the area of the 4th Army was as good as cleared of\r\n    partisans. Only on its boundaries and then from time to time\r\n    were partisans in evidence at times when they crossed into the\r\n    area of the 4th Army from neighboring areas. The army was\r\n    obliged on this account on the orders of the Army Group to give\r\n    up security forces to the neighboring army to the south.\r\n\r\n                                  “(signed) Roettiger”  (_3713-PS_)\r\n\r\nRoettiger’s third statement reads:\r\n\r\n    “During my period of service in 1942/3 as chief of staff of the\r\n    4th Army of the Central Army Group, SD units were attached in\r\n    the beginning, apparently for the purpose of\r\n    counter-intelligence activity in front-line areas. It was clear\r\n    that these SD units were causing great disturbances among the\r\n    local civilian population with the result that my commanding\r\n    officer therefore asked the commander-in-chief of the army\r\n    group, Field Marshal von Kluge, to order the SD units to clear\r\n    out of the front-line areas, which took place immediately. The\r\n    reason for this first and foremost was that the excesses of the\r\n    SD units by way of execution of Jews and other persons assumed\r\n    such proportions as to threaten the security of the Army in its\r\n    combat areas because of the aroused civilian populace. Although\r\n    in general the special tasks of the SD units were well known and\r\n    appeared to be carried out with the knowledge of the highest\r\n    military authorities, we opposed these methods as far as\r\n    possible, because of the danger which existed for our troops.\r\n\r\n                                  “(Signed) Roettiger”  (_3714-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn extract from the War Diary of the Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces\r\nOperational Staff (Warlimont), dated 14 March 1943, deals with the\r\nproblem of shipping off suspected partisans to concentration camps in\r\nGermany (_1786-PS_). It appears clearly from this extract that the Army\r\nwas chiefly concerned with preserving a sufficient severity of treatment\r\nfor suspected partisans, without at the same time obstructing the\r\nprocurement of labor from the occupied territories:\r\n\r\n    “The General Quartermaster [_General Quartiermeister_] together\r\n    with the Economic Staff (East) [_Wirtschaftsstab Ost_] has\r\n    proposed that the deportees should be sent either to prison\r\n    camps or to ‘training centres in their own area,’ and that\r\n    deportation to Germany should take place only when the deportees\r\n    are on probation and in less serious cases.\r\n\r\n    “In view of the Armed Forces Operations Staff\r\n    [_Wehrmachtfuehrungstab_] this proposal does not take sufficient\r\n    account of the severity required and leads to a comparison with\r\n    the treatment meted out to the ‘peaceful population’ which has\r\n    been called upon to work. He recommends therefore transportation\r\n    to concentration camps in Germany which have already been\r\n    introduced by the Reichsfuehrer SS for his sphere and which he\r\n    is prepared to introduce for the Armed Forces [_Wehrmacht_] in\r\n    the case of an extension to the province of the latter. The High\r\n    Command of the Armed Forces [_Oberkommando der Wehrmacht_]\r\n    therefore orders that partisan helpers and suspects who are not\r\n    to be executed should be handed over to the competent Higher SS\r\n    and Police Leader [_Hoehrer SS und Polizeifuehrer_] and orders\r\n    that the difference between ‘punitive work’ and ‘work in\r\n    Germany’ is to be made clear to the population.” (_1786-PS_)\r\n\r\nA final group of four affidavits show that the SD _Einsatzgruppen_ on\r\nthe Eastern Front operated under the command and with the necessary\r\nsupport of the _Wehrmacht_, and that the nature of their activities were\r\nfully known to the _Wehrmacht_. The first of these is a statement\r\n(_3715-PS_) by Ernst Rode, who was an SS Brigadefuehrer and Generalmajor\r\nof the Police, and was head of Himmler’s personal command staff from\r\n1943 to 1945:\r\n\r\n                               STATEMENT\r\n\r\n    “I, Ernst Rode, was formerly chief of the Command Staff of the\r\n    Reichsfuehrer-SS, having taken over this position in the spring\r\n    of 1943 as successor to former SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Kurt\r\n    Knoblauch. My last rank was Generalmajor of Police and of the\r\n    Waffen-SS. My function was to furnish forces necessary for\r\n    anti-partisan warfare to the higher SS and police leaders and to\r\n    guarantee the support of army forces. This took place through\r\n    personal discussions with the leading officers of the Operations\r\n    Staff of the OKW and OKH, namely with General Warlimont, General\r\n    von Buttlar, Generaloberst Guderian, Generaloberst Zeitzler,\r\n    General Heusinger, later General Wenk, Colonel Graf Kielmannsegg\r\n    and Colonel v. Bonin. Since anti-partisan warfare also was under\r\n    the sole command of the respective Army commander-in-chief in\r\n    operational areas (for instance in the Central Army Group under\r\n    Field Marshal Kluge and later Busch) and since police troops for\r\n    the most part could not be spared from the Reichscommissariates,\r\n    the direction of this warfare lay practically always entirely in\r\n    the hands of the army. In the same way orders were issued not by\r\n    Himmler but by the OKH. SS and police troops transferred to\r\n    operational areas from the Reichscommissariates to support the\r\n    army groups were likewise under the latter’s command. Such\r\n    transfers often resulted in harm to anti-partisan warfare in the\r\n    Reichscommissariates. According to a specific agreement between\r\n    Himmler and the OKH, the direction of individual operations lay\r\n    in the hands of the troop leader who commanded the largest troop\r\n    contingent. It was therefore possible that an army general could\r\n    have SS and police under him, and on the other hand that army\r\n    troops could be placed under a general of the SS and police.\r\n    Anti-partisan warfare in operational areas could never be\r\n    ordered by Himmler. I could merely request the OKH to order it,\r\n    until 1944 mostly through the intervention of\r\n    Generalquartiermeister Wagner or through State Secretary\r\n    Ganzenmueller. The OKH then issued corresponding orders to the\r\n    army groups concerned, for compliance.\r\n\r\n    “The severity and cruelty with which the intrinsically\r\n    diabolical partisan warfare was conducted by the Russians had\r\n    already resulted in Draconian laws being issued by Hitler for\r\n    its conduct. These orders, which were passed on to the troops\r\n    through the OKW and OKH, were equally applicable to army troops\r\n    as well as to those of the SS and police. There was absolutely\r\n    no difference in the manner in which these two components\r\n    carried on this warfare. Army soldiers were exactly as\r\n    embittered against the enemy as those of the SS and police. As a\r\n    result of this embitterment orders were ruthlessly carried out\r\n    by both components, a thing which was also quite in keeping with\r\n    Himmler’s desires or intentions. As proof of this the order of\r\n    the OKW and OKH can be adduced, which directed that all captured\r\n    partisans, for instance such as Jews, agents and political\r\n    commissars, should without delay be handed over by the troops to\r\n    the SD for special treatment. This order also contained the\r\n    provision that in anti-partisan warfare no prisoners except the\r\n    above named be taken. That anti-partisan warfare was carried on\r\n    by army troops mercilessly and to every extreme I know as the\r\n    result of discussions with army troop leaders, for instance with\r\n    General Herzog, Commander of the XXXVIII Army Corps and with his\r\n    chief of staff, Colonel Pamberg in the General Staff, both of\r\n    whom support my opinion. Today it is clear to me that\r\n    anti-partisan warfare gradually became an excuse for the\r\n    systematic annihilation of Jewry and Slavism.\r\n\r\n                                 “(Signed) Ernst Rode”  (_3715-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother and shorter statement by Rode reads:\r\n\r\n    “As far as I know, the SD Combat Groups with the individual army\r\n    groups were _completely subordinate_ to them, that is to say\r\n    tactically as well as in every other way. The\r\n    commanders-in-chief were therefore thoroughly cognizant of the\r\n    missions and operational methods of these units. They approved\r\n    of these missions and operational methods because apparently\r\n    they never opposed them. The fact that prisoners, such as Jews,\r\n    agents and commissars, who were handed over to the SD underwent\r\n    the same cruel death, as victims of so-called ‘purifications,’\r\n    is a proof that the executions had their approval. This also\r\n    corresponded with what the highest political and military\r\n    authorities wanted. Frequent mention of these methods were\r\n    naturally made in my presence at the OKW and OKH, and they were\r\n    condemned by most SS and police officers, just as they were\r\n    condemned by most army officers. On such occasions I always\r\n    pointed out that it would have been quite within the scope of\r\n    the authority of the commanders-in-chief of army groups to\r\n    oppose such methods. I am of the firm conviction that an\r\n    energetic and unified protest by all field marshals would have\r\n    resulted in a change of these missions and methods. If they\r\n    should ever assert that they would then have been succeeded by\r\n    even more ruthless commanders-in-chief, this, in my opinion,\r\n    would be a foolish and even cowardly dodge.\r\n\r\n                                 “(Signed) Ernst Rode”  (_3716-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn an affidavit by Colonel Bogislav von Bonin, who at the beginning of\r\nthe Russian campaign was a staff officer with the 17th Panzer Division,\r\nthe following statement is made:\r\n\r\n    “At the beginning of the Russian campaign I was the first\r\n    General Staff officer of the 17th Panzer Division which had the\r\n    mission of driving across the Bug north of Brest-Litovsk.\r\n    Shortly before the beginning of the attack my division received\r\n    through channels from the OKW a written order of the Fuehrer.\r\n    This order directed that Russian commissars be shot upon\r\n    capture, without judicial process, immediately and ruthlessly.\r\n    This order extended to all units of the Eastern Army.

From the beginning of the war in 1939 until autumn 1940 I\r\n    was Ia of the Operations Section of the OKH, and from autumn\r\n    1940 until 20 July 1944 I was chief of that section.\r\n\r\n    “When Hitler took over supreme command of the Army, he gave to\r\n    the chief of the General Staff of the Army the function of\r\n    advising him on all operational matters in the Russian theater.\r\n\r\n    “This made the chief of the General Staff of the Army\r\n    responsible for all matters in the operational areas in the\r\n    east, while the OKW was responsible for all matters outside the\r\n    operational areas, for instance, all troops (security units, SS\r\n    units, police) stationed in the Reichscommissariates.\r\n\r\n    “All police and SS units in the Reichscommissariates were also\r\n    subordinate to the Reichsfuehrer-SS. When it was necessary to\r\n    transfer such units into operational areas, this had to be done\r\n    by order of the chief of the OKW. On the other hand,\r\n    corresponding transfers from the front to the rear were ordered\r\n    by the OKW with the concurrence of the chief of the General\r\n    Staff of the Army.\r\n\r\n    “The high SS and police leaders normally had command of\r\n    operations against partisans. If stronger army units were\r\n    committed together with the SS and police units within\r\n    operational areas, a high commander of the army could be\r\n    designated commander of the operation.\r\n\r\n    “During anti-partisan operations _within_ operational areas all\r\n    forces committed for these operations were under the command of\r\n    the respective commander-in-chief of the army group.\r\n\r\n    “2. Directives as to the manner and methods of carrying on\r\n    counter-partisan operations were issued by the OKW (Keitel) to\r\n    the OKH upon orders from Hitler and after consultation with\r\n    Himmler. The OKH was responsible merely for the transmission of\r\n    these orders to army groups, for instance such orders as those\r\n    concerning the treatment to be accorded to commissars and\r\n    communists, those concerning the manner of prosecuting by courts\r\n    martial army personnel who had committed offenses against the\r\n    population, as well as those establishing the basic principles\r\n    governing reprisals against the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n    “3. The detailed working out of all matters involving the\r\n    treatment of the local populace as well as anti-partisan warfare\r\n    in operational areas, in pursuance of orders from the OKW, was\r\n    the responsibility of the Generalquartiermeister of the OKH.\r\n\r\n    “4. It had always been my personal opinion that the treatment of\r\n    the civilian population and the methods of anti-partisan warfare\r\n    in operational areas presented the highest political and\r\n    military leaders with a welcomed opportunity of carrying out\r\n    their plans, namely the systematic extermination of Slavism and\r\n    Jewry. Entirely independent of this, I always regarded these\r\n    cruel methods as military insanity, because they only helped to\r\n    make combat against the enemy unnecessarily more difficult.\r\n\r\n                                               “(Signed) Heusinger\r\n                                    “Generalleutnant.”  (_3717-PS_)\r\n\r\n(At this point, Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski was called upon for oral\r\ntestimony.

The German High Command\r\ndeveloped and applied a policy of terror against commandos and\r\nparatroopers, in violation of the Hague and Geneva Conventions, on the\r\nWestern Front. On the Eastern Front it descended to savagery. In advance\r\nof the attack against the Soviet Union, the High Command ordered the\r\ntroops to take “ruthless action”, left it to the discretion of any\r\nofficer to decide whether suspected civilians should be immediately\r\nshot, and empowered any officer with the powers of a Battalion Commander\r\nto take “collective despotic measures” against localities. Offenses\r\ncommitted against civilians by German soldiers, however, were not\r\nrequired to be prosecuted, and prosecution was suggested only where\r\ndesirable in order to maintain discipline and security from a military\r\nstandpoint.\r\n\r\nSoon after the invasion of the Soviet Union, German troops were told by\r\nthe OKW that “a human life in unsettled countries frequently counts for\r\nnothing” and were encouraged to observe a punitive ratio of 50 to 100\r\nCommunists for one German soldier. German troops were told that they\r\nwere to take “revenge on sub-human Jewry” and that they were not merely\r\nsoldiers but “bearers of ruthless national ideology and avengers of\r\nbestialities”. The High Command and the chief lieutenants of Himmler\r\njointly planned the establishment of the _Einsatzgruppen_, the behavior\r\nof which has been shown in detail. These groups when in operational\r\nareas were under the command of the German Army, and German soldiers\r\njoined in their savagery. The _Einsatzgruppen_ were completely dependent\r\nupon the Armed Forces for supplies with which to carry out their\r\natrocities. The practices employed against the civilian population and\r\nagainst partisans were well known to all high ranking German officers on\r\nthe Eastern Front. No doubt some of them disapproved of what was going\r\non. Nonetheless, the full support of the military leaders continued to\r\nbe given to these activities.\r\n\r\nThe record is clear that the General Staff and High Command Group,\r\nincluding the defendants, who were members of the Group and numerous\r\nother members ordered, directed, and participated in war crimes and\r\ncrimes against humanity as specified in counts 3 and 4 of the\r\nIndictment.\r\n\r\n                            C. _Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThe world must bear in mind that the German High Command is not an\r\nevanescent thing, the creature of a decade of unrest, or a school of\r\nthought or tradition which is shattered or utterly discredited. The\r\nGerman High Command and military tradition have in the past achieved\r\nvictory and survived defeat. They have met with triumph and disaster,\r\nand have survived through a singular durability not unmixed with\r\nstupidity. An eminent American statesman and diplomat, Mr. Sumner\r\nWelles, has written (“The Time for Decision”, 1944, pp. 261-262) that:\r\n\r\n    “* * * the authority to which the German people have so often\r\n    and so disastrously responded was not in reality the German\r\n    Emperor of yesterday, or the Hitler of to-day, but the German\r\n    General Staff.\r\n\r\n    “It will be said that this insistence that the German General\r\n    Staff has been the driving force in German policy is a dangerous\r\n    oversimplification. I am not disposed to minimize the importance\r\n    of other factors in German history. They all have their place.\r\n    But I am convinced that each of them has played its part only in\r\n    so far as it was permitted to do so by the real master of the\r\n    German race, namely, German militarism, personified in, and\r\n    channelled through, the German General Staff.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Whether their ostensible ruler is the Kaiser, or Hindenburg, or\r\n    Adolf Hitler, the continuing loyalty of the bulk of the\r\n    population is given to that military force controlled and guided\r\n    by the German General Staff. To the German people, the army\r\n    to-day, as in the past, is the instrument by which German\r\n    domination will be brought about. Generations of Germans may\r\n    pass. The nation may undergo defeat after defeat. But if the\r\n    rest of the world permits it, the German General Staff will\r\n    continue making its plans for the future.”\r\n\r\nThe German General Staff and High Command is indicted not now at the bar\r\nof history, but on specific charges of crimes against International Law\r\nand the dictates of the conscience of mankind as embodied in the\r\nCharter. The picture that emerges from the evidence is that of a group\r\nof men with great powers for good or ill who chose the latter; who\r\ndeliberately set out to arm Germany to the point where the German will\r\ncould be imposed on the rest of the world; and who gladly joined with\r\nthe most evil forces at work in Germany. “Hitler produced the results\r\nwhich all of us warmly desired”, Blomberg and Blaskowitz say, and that\r\nis obviously the truth. The converse is no less clear; the military\r\nleaders furnished Hitler with the means and might which were necessary\r\nto his mere survival, to say nothing of the accomplishment of those\r\npurposes which seem to the world so ludicrously impossible in 1932 and\r\nso fearfully imminent in 1942.\r\n\r\nIt was said above that the German militarists were inept as well as\r\npersistent. Helpless as Hitler would have been without them, he\r\nsucceeded in mastering them. The generals and the Nazis were allies in\r\n1933. But it was not enough for the Nazis that the generals should be\r\nvoluntary allies; Hitler wanted them permanently and completely under\r\nhis control. Devoid of political skill or principle, the generals lacked\r\nthe mentality or morality to resist. On the day of the death of\r\nPresident Hindenburg in August 1934, the German officers swore a new\r\noath. Their previous oath had been to the Fatherland; now it was to a\r\nman, Adolf Hitler. It was not until 18 days later that the law requiring\r\nthis change was passed. A year later the Nazi emblem became part of\r\ntheir uniform and the Nazi flag their standard. By a clever process of\r\ninfiltration into key positions, Hitler seized control of the entire\r\nmilitary machine.\r\n\r\nNo doubt these generals will ask what they could have done about it. It\r\nwill be said that they were helpless, and that to protect their jobs and\r\nfamilies and their own lives they had to follow Hitler’s decisions. No\r\ndoubt this became true. But the generals were a key factor in Hitler’s\r\nrise to complete power and a partner in his criminal aggressive designs.\r\nIt is always difficult and dangerous to withdraw from a criminal\r\nconspiracy. Never has it been suggested that a conspirator may claim\r\nmercy on the ground that his fellow-conspirators threatened him with\r\nharm should he withdraw from the plot.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the spectacle which the German General Staff and High\r\nCommand group presents today is the most degrading of all the groups and\r\norganizations charged in the Indictment. The bearers of a tradition not\r\ndevoid of valour and honour, they emerge from this war stained both by\r\ncriminality and ineptitude. Attracted by the militaristic and aggressive\r\nNazi policies, the German generals found themselves drawn into\r\nadventures of a scope they had not foreseen. From crimes in which almost\r\nall of them participated willingly and approvingly were born others in\r\nwhich they participated because they were too ineffective to alter the\r\ngoverning Nazi policies, and because they had to continue collaboration\r\nto save their own skins.\r\n\r\nHaving joined the partnership, the General Staff and High Command group\r\nplanned and carried through manifold acts of aggression which turned\r\nEurope into a charnel-house, and caused the Armed Forces to be used for\r\nfoul practices foully executed of terror, pillage, murder and wholesale\r\nslaughter. Let no one be heard to say that the military uniform shall be\r\ntheir cloak, or that they may find sanctuary by pleading membership in\r\nthe profession to which they are an eternal disgrace.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nLEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE GENERAL STAFF AND\r\n                    HIGH COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 9.                │  I   │       6\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix B.                         │  I   │  29, 72\r\n 3737-PS          │Hague Convention of 1907 respecting   │      │\r\n                  │  the Laws and Customs of War on Land,│      │\r\n                  │  Annex, Articles 4, 23.              │  VI  │590, 594\r\n 3738-PS          │Geneva Convention of 1929 relative to │      │\r\n                  │  treatment of Prisoners of War,      │      │\r\n                  │  Articles 2,3.                       │  VI  │     600\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

The Anglo-American doctrine of conspiracy, despite\r\ntechnical differences, is analogous in purpose to the Soviet notion of a\r\n“criminal gang” and the French _association de malfaiteurs_. German law,\r\nboth before and after the Nazi seizure of power, also contained a\r\nsimilar concept. The fundamentals of the doctrine, common to most\r\nsystems of law, are reflected in Article 6 of the Charter, which\r\ndeclares it a crime to participate in “the formulation or execution of a\r\ncommon plan or conspiracy” to plan or wage aggressive war, to commit War\r\nCrimes, or to commit Crimes against Humanity. Count I of the Indictment\r\ncharges the existence of such a conspiracy on the part of the\r\ndefendants, acting together with divers other persons.\r\n\r\nThe essence of conspiracy is the joining together of persons to pursue\r\nunlawful ends, by legal or illegal means, or to pursue lawful ends by\r\nillegal means. A conspiracy may exist even though the ends or means\r\nemployed by the conspirators might have been perfectly legal if carried\r\nout by one person acting alone. The gravamen of the crime is association\r\nand acting in concert for the purpose of formulating and executing a\r\ncommon plan involving criminal ends or means.\r\n\r\nParticipation in a common plan or conspiracy results in vicarious\r\nliability, in the sense that each member of the conspiracy is liable for\r\nthe acts of every other conspirator, even though he may have actually\r\ncommitted no criminal acts himself. He still may be adjudged criminal\r\nfor mere participation in a common plan to pursue a common criminal\r\npurpose, regardless of disparities in the functions performed by\r\nindividual conspirators.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in order to prove the participation of a certain person in\r\na conspiracy, his own acts must be considered. The roles played by the\r\nvarious members of the Nazi conspiracy are necessarily different. The\r\nfollowing sections sketch in rough outline the parts played by each of\r\nthe 22 defendants (excepting Sauckel and Speer who are discussed in\r\nChapter X) and the former defendant and co-conspirator, Krupp von Bohlen\r\nund Halbach, in the conspiracy to commit Crimes against Peace, War\r\nCrimes against Humanity, as alleged in Count I of the Indictment. These\r\nsections are by no means exhaustive but merely indicate the general\r\nlines of a particular defendant’s participation. Further and more\r\ndetailed discussion of the parts played by the conspirators in\r\nparticular phases of the conspiracy will be found under the pertinent\r\nsubject matter in the preceding chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       1. HERMANN WILHELM GOERING\r\n\r\nFor more than two decades Hermann Goering played one of the foremost\r\nroles amongst the Nazi conspirators. He, who called himself the most\r\nfaithful paladin of the Fuehrer, was a key figure within the conspiracy,\r\nparticipating in nearly all phases of the conspiratorial activities. He\r\ntook part in the Munich Beer Hall putsch of 1923; he promoted Hitler’s\r\nrise to power in 1933; he founded the Gestapo in 1933 and the\r\nconcentration camps in 1934; and he created the German Luftwaffe, making\r\nit an instrument for aggressive war and using it to destroy other\r\ncountries. As Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan and chairman of the\r\nMinisterial Council for Defense, Goering became the Czar of German\r\neconomy and administration and eventually the executive manager of the\r\nentire conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe following list, the correctness of which has been certified by\r\nGoering and his attorney (_2836-PS_) is a partial statement of positions\r\nand offices held by him from 1922 to 1945:\r\n\r\n    1. Party member (1922-1945).\r\n\r\n    2. Supreme Leader of the SA (1923—November 1923).\r\n\r\n    3. Member of the Reichstag (1928).\r\n\r\n    4. President of the Reichstag (1932).\r\n\r\n    5. Prussian Minister of the Interior (1933-34).\r\n\r\n    6. Prussian Prime Minister (1933-45).\r\n\r\n    7. Prussian Chief of Secret State Police (1933-36).\r\n\r\n    8. Prussian Chief of State Council (1933-36).\r\n\r\n    9. Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan (1936-45).\r\n\r\n    10. Reichsminister for Air (1933-45).\r\n\r\n    11. Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force (1935-45).\r\n\r\n    12. President of the Cabinet Council for the Defense of the\r\n    Reich (1939-45).\r\n\r\n    13. Member of the Secret Cabinet Council (1938-45).\r\n\r\n    14. Reichsmarschall (1939-45).\r\n\r\n    15. Successor Designate to Hitler (1939-45).\r\n\r\n    16. Head of Reichswerke Hermann Goering (1938-45).\r\n\r\n    17. Head of Gestapo in Prussia (1933-34).\r\n\r\nGoering was a member of and assisted in the Nazi conspiracy to commit\r\ncrimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, in the\r\nfollowing ways:\r\n\r\n                       A. _CRIMES AGAINST PEACE._\r\n\r\n(1) _Acquisition and Consolidation of Power in Germany._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Before 1933._ Soon after joining the Party, Goering in 1923 was\r\nplaced in command of the entire SA (_2168-PS_). In November 1923, he\r\ntook part in the ill-fated attempt at Munich to gain control of the\r\nGerman State by force. In the encounter with the police, Goering was\r\nwounded and fled from Germany. (_2532-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter his return, Goering became more than a commander of street\r\nfighters. He was designated Hitler’s first political assistant.\r\n\r\n    “The movement was conducted by the Fuehrer from Munich. But one\r\n    man has to act for him in Berlin, while Gauleiter Goebbels stirs\r\n    up the masses and makes them ripe for National Socialism, a man\r\n    on whom he could rely unconditionally to the same extent as if\r\n    he acted himself. And thus, Hermann Goering became the political\r\n    deputy of Adolf Hitler.” (_3252-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering’s official biographer, the Ministerial Dirgent Gritzbach, tells\r\nof his dealings with the Bruening government, his attempts to “break\r\ndown the barrier” around the Reich President, von Hindenburg, and of his\r\n“coup” as Reichstag President in September 1932 in procuring a vote of\r\nnonconfidence against the Papen government just before the Reichstag\r\ncould be dissolved (_3252-PS_). Goering says in his own book, _Aufbau\r\neiner Nation_:\r\n\r\n    “The moment was unforgettable for me who have gone back and\r\n    forth as representative so often between the Kaiserhof and the\r\n    Wilhelmstrasse during the past year, when I hurried out to my\r\n    car and could report to the questioning masses as the first one:\r\n    ‘Hitler has become Reich Chancellor.’” (_3251-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoebbels also gave him full measure of credit:\r\n\r\n    “‘This is surely Goering’s happiest hour’ wrote Dr. Goebbels in\r\n    his book Von Kaiserhof zur Reichskanzlei, and, quoting from it,\r\n    said: that ‘Goering prepared diplomatically and politically in a\r\n    long lasting all hard struggle the basis for Hitler’s rise.”\r\n    (_3252-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a letter written in 1935, Hitler summarized Goering’s contributions\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “My dear Goering: When in November 1923 the Party tried for the\r\n    first time to conquer the power of the State, you as Commander\r\n    of the SA created within an extraordinarily short time that\r\n    instrument with which I could bear that struggle. Highest\r\n    necessity had forced us to act, but a wise providence at that\r\n    time denied that success. After receiving a grave wound you\r\n    again entered the ranks as soon as circumstances permitted as my\r\n    most loyal comrade in the battle for power. You contributed\r\n    essentially to creating the basis for the 30th of January.\r\n    Therefore, at the end of a year of the National Socialist\r\n    Revolution, I desire to thank you whole-heartedly, my dear Party\r\n    Comrade Goering, for the great values which you have for the\r\n    National Socialist Revolution and consequently, for the German\r\n    people. In cordial friendship and grateful appreciation.\r\n\r\n                                                            Yours,\r\n                                                     Adolf Hitler.”\r\n                                                        (_3259-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering himself has boasted:\r\n\r\n    “Numerous titles and honors have been bestowed on me during the\r\n    past months, and still no title and no decoration could make me\r\n    so proud, as the designation, given to me by the German people:\r\n    ‘The most faithful paladin of our Fuehrer.’ In that, my\r\n    relationship to the Fuehrer finds expression. I followed him for\r\n    over a decade with unreserved faith, and I will follow him with\r\n    the same unconditional faith until my end.” (_3251-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Prussia, 1933-36._ Immediately after the 30th of January 1933,\r\nGoering was awarded the key post of acting Prussian Minister of the\r\nInterior, and shortly thereafter, that of Minister President of Prussia.\r\nIn these capacities, he proceeded promptly to establish a regime of\r\nterror in Prussia designed to suppress all opposition to the Nazi\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nHis chief tool was the Prussian police, which remained under his\r\njurisdiction until 1936. As early as February 1933, he ordered the\r\nentire police forces to render unqualified assistance to the\r\npara-military organizations supporting the new government, such as the\r\nSA and the SS, and to crush all political opponents with firearms, if\r\nnecessary, regardless of the consequences. (Directive of 10 February\r\n1933, Ministerialblatt fuer die Preussische innere Verwaltung 1933, p.\r\n148; Directive of 17 February 1933, _id_, p. 169). Goering has\r\nfrequently and proudly acknowledged his own personal responsibility for\r\nthe crimes committed pursuant to orders of this character:\r\n\r\n    “I declared at that time before thousands of fellow Germans,\r\n    each bullet which leaves the barrel of a police pistol now is my\r\n    bullet. If one calls this murder, then I have murdered; I\r\n    ordered all this, I back it up. I assume the responsibility, and\r\n    I am not afraid to do so.” (_2324-PS; 3252-PS._)\r\n\r\nSoon after he became Prussian Minister President, Goering began to\r\ndevelop the Gestapo, or Secret State Police. To quote from his own book:\r\n\r\n    “The most important thing for me was first, to get the\r\n    instrument of power of the protective police and political\r\n    police firmly in my hand. Here I undertook the first sweeping\r\n    changes of personnel. Of the 32 available colonels of the\r\n    protective police, I dismissed 22. Hundreds of officers and\r\n    thousands of sergeants followed them in the course of the next\r\n    months. New forces were procured, and everywhere, these forces\r\n    were taken out of the large reserve pool of the SA and the SS.\r\n\r\n    “For weeks, I personally worked on this transformation, and\r\n    finally I created alone and from my own conviction and own\r\n    thought the ‘Secret State Police Office’. That instrument,\r\n    feared so much by the enemies of the state, which above all has\r\n    contributed so much, that today a Communist or Marxist danger in\r\n    Germany or Prussia is hardly worth talking about anymore.”\r\n    (_3251-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a public address delivered on 11 December 1934, Goering boasted:\r\n\r\n    “We were firmly determined after assumption of power to hit the\r\n    Communists so that in Germany they would never recover from our\r\n    blow. For that we do not require a Reichstag fire. That has been\r\n    one of the most important points on our program. In the former\r\n    Weimar Constitution the destruction of Communism was\r\n    unthinkable. For the execution of these measures we needed the\r\n    instrument of a through and through reliable, and of the highest\r\n    degree powerful, police force. I have created this instrument\r\n    through the reorganization of the field police (_Landespolizei_)\r\n    and the formation of a Secret State Police. These organizations\r\n    will constitute a means for implanting fear in all enemies of\r\n    the State, which a State needs if it wishes to defend itself for\r\n    always”. (_3440-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 26 April 1933 Goering signed the first law officially establishing\r\nthe Secret State Police in Prussia (_2104-PS_). On 30 November 1933,\r\nGoering signed a law naming himself, as Prime Minister, Chief of the\r\nPrussian Secret State Police (_2105-PS_). He continued in this position\r\nuntil sometime in 1936, when Himmler secured control of all police in\r\nthe Reich.\r\n\r\nMen and women taken into custody by the Gestapo were thrown, without\r\njudicial or other form of trial, into concentration camps, which had\r\nbeen established in Prussia as early as the spring of 1933. (_3252-PS_;\r\n_L-83_.)\r\n\r\nAs explained by Goering in his own book:\r\n\r\n    “Against the enemies of the State, we must proceed ruthlessly.\r\n    It cannot be forgotten, that at the moment of our rise to power,\r\n    according to the official election figures of March 1933, six\r\n    million people still confess their sympathy for Marxism. * * *\r\n    Therefore the concentration camps have been created, where we\r\n    have first confined thousands of Communists and Social Democrat\r\n    functionaries. * * *” (_2344-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 10 February 1936, Goering, as Prussian Minister President, signed a\r\nfurther basic law on the Prussian Secret State Police. Article 7 of this\r\nlaw provided:\r\n\r\n    “Orders in matters of the Secret State Police are not subject to\r\n    the review of the administrative courts”. (_2107-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus it was made quite clear by Goering’s own law that those imprisoned\r\nin concentration camps without trial of any kind were to have no\r\nrecourse to any court. On the same day Goering signed a decree for the\r\nexecution of the foregoing law, which further acknowledged his\r\nresponsibility for Prussian concentration camps. Its provisions included\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    “Art. 2 * * * (4) The Secret State Police Bureau administers the\r\n    state concentration camps.” (_2108-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe range of police terrorism under Goering’s leadership was almost\r\nlimitless. A glance at a few of his police directives in these early\r\ndays will indicate the extent and thoroughness with which every\r\ndissident voice was silenced:\r\n\r\n    _Directive of 22 June 1933_ (_Ministerial-Blatt fuer die\r\n    Preussische innere Verwaltung, 1933, p. 731_): Ordered all\r\n    officials to watch the statements of employees of the Prussian\r\n    civil service and to denounce to Goering those who made critical\r\n    remarks (“_Miesmacher_”); failure to do so regarded as proof of\r\n    hostile attitude.\r\n\r\n    _Directive of 23 June 1933_ (_Ministerial-Blatt fuer die\r\n    Preussische innere Verwaltung, 1933, p. 749_): Suppressed all\r\n    activities of the Social Democratic Party, including meetings\r\n    and press, and ordered confiscation of its property.\r\n\r\n    _Directive of 30 June 1933_ (_Ministerial-Blatt fuer die\r\n    Preussische innere Verwaltung, 1933, p. 793_): Ordered the\r\n    Gestapo authorities to report to the Labor Trustees on political\r\n    attitudes of workers, particularly in cases of criticism of the\r\n    regime.\r\n\r\n    _Directive of 15 January 1934_ (_Ministerial-Blatt fuer die\r\n    Preussische innere Verwaltung, 1933, p. 137_): Ordered the\r\n    Gestapo and frontier police to keep track of and to watch\r\n    emigres, particularly political emigres and Jews, residing in\r\n    neighboring countries, and ordered them arrested and put into\r\n    concentration camps if they returned to Germany.\r\n\r\nAfter the elimination of the forces of the opposition, the Nazis felt it\r\nnecessary to dispose of nonconformists within their own ranks. During\r\nthe Roehm purge of 30 June 1934, many people were murdered who had\r\nnothing to do with the internal SA revolt but were just “not liked very\r\nwell” (_2950-PS_). Goering’s role in this bloody affair was related less\r\nthan two weeks later by Hitler in a speech to the Reichstag:\r\n\r\n    “Meanwhile Minister President Goering had previously received my\r\n    instructions that in case of a purge, he was to take analogous\r\n    measures at once in Berlin and in Prussia. With an iron fist he\r\n    beat down the attack on the National Socialist State before it\r\n    could develop.” (_3442-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Reich, 1933-39._ Meanwhile, in the central Reich government,\r\nGoering occupied a series of the highest and most influential positions.\r\nThe broad powers which devolved upon him made him, under Hitler, the\r\nChief Executive of the Nazi State.\r\n\r\nWith the accession to power, Goering retained the somewhat empty title\r\nof Reichstag President but was also appointed Minister Without Portfolio\r\nand became a cabinet member. When in an early meeting (15 March 1933)\r\nthe cabinet discussed the pending Enabling Act (which gave the Cabinet\r\nplenary powers of legislation) he offered the suggestion that the\r\nrequired two-thirds majority might be obtained simply by refusing\r\nadmittance to the Social Democratic delegates (_2962-PS_). He became\r\nReich Air Minister in May 1933 (_2089-PS_). In his capacity as Air\r\nMinister and Supreme Commander of the Luftwaffe, he sat as a member of\r\nand the Fuehrer’s deputy on the Reich Defense Council, which was\r\nestablished by the secret law of 21 May 1933 and continued by the secret\r\nlaw of 4 September 1938 (_2261-PS_; _2194-PS_). This Council was a war\r\nplanning group whose purpose was “to plan preparations and decrees in\r\ncase of war which later on were published by the Ministerial Council for\r\nthe Defense of the Reich.” (_2986-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1936, Goering was made Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan and\r\nacquired plenary legislative and administrative powers over all German\r\neconomic life. (_1862-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering was a member of the Secret Cabinet Council established in 1938\r\nto act as “an advisory board in the direction of foreign policy”\r\n(_2031-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe Ministerial Council for the Defense of the Reich, created in 1939,\r\ntook over, in effect, all the legislative powers of the Cabinet which\r\nhad not been reserved to Hitler’s personal control or to Goering as the\r\nDelegate for the Four-Year Plan. Goering became the Chairman of this\r\nCouncil. (_2018-PS_)\r\n\r\nFinally, as the invading Nazi armies marched into Poland, Hitler\r\nannounced the designation of Goering as successor designate, the heir\r\napparent of the “New Order.”\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Economic Preparation for War, 1933-1939._\r\n\r\nIn April 1936, Goering was appointed Coordinator for Raw Materials and\r\nForeign Exchange and empowered to supervise all State and Party\r\nactivities in these fields (_2827-PS_). In this capacity he convened the\r\nWar Minister, the Minister of Economics, the Reich Finance Minister, the\r\nPresident of the Reichsbank, and the Prussian Finance Minister to\r\ndiscuss inter-agency problems connected with war mobilization. At a\r\nmeeting of this group on 12 May 1936, when the question of the\r\nprohibitive cost of synthetic raw material substitutes arose, Goering\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    “If we have war tomorrow, we must help ourselves by substitutes.\r\n    Then money will not play any role at all. If that is the case,\r\n    then we must be ready to create the prerequisites for that in\r\n    peace.” (_1301-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent meeting of the same men on 27 May 1936, Goering\r\nsuggested a program of plant construction for the production of\r\nsynthetic substitutes but warned against the financial strain involved\r\nin excessive overexpansion. He opposed any limitations dictated by\r\northodox financial policy and stated:\r\n\r\n    “All measures are to be considered from the standpoint of an\r\n    assured waging of war.\r\n\r\n    “Ready reserves must ordinarily be accumulated already in\r\n\r\nOn the Nurnberg Party Day in the fall of 1936, Hitler proclaimed the\r\nestablishment of the Four-Year Plan, a comprehensive program of national\r\nself-sufficiency, and announced the appointment of Goering as\r\n“Plenipotentiary” in charge. In October, a decree was promulgated which\r\nimplemented this announcement and provided for the execution of the\r\nplan. (_1862-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is clear from Goering’s own statements in an interrogation on 25 June\r\n1945 that the purpose of the Plan was to place Germany on a war footing\r\neconomically:\r\n\r\n    “Goering: ‘My job was to organize the German economy and my\r\n    energy was put to work to get things started and carried through\r\n    * * *. My main task was to secure the food supply for Germany\r\n    for many years ahead and to make Germany self-sufficient. The\r\n    most important items were iron, petroleum and rubber. * * * The\r\n    industry only wanted to have very high grade Swedish iron for\r\n    business reasons. There was danger that during the war Germany\r\n    would not be able to get iron from Sweden and there would be no\r\n    iron.’\r\n\r\n    Interrogator: ‘What war are you talking about? This is 1936\r\n    you’re speaking of.’\r\n\r\n    Goering: ‘Any possibility of war. Perhaps with Russia, or in\r\n    case there was war with anyone at any time and anywhere.’”\r\n\r\nWhen asked the reasons why the Four-Year Plan lost importance in 1942,\r\nGoering explained that his preoccupation with the Air Force did not\r\nallow him the necessary concentration on the affairs of the Four-Year\r\nPlan, and stated:\r\n\r\n    “The main task of the Four-Year Plan had been accomplished. This\r\n    task was to get Germany ready.”\r\n\r\nThese answers confirm the comment Goering made in 1936, that his chief\r\ntask as Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan was “to put the whole\r\neconomy on a war footing within four years.” (_EC-408_) As\r\nPlenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan, Goering was virtually the\r\neconomic dictator for Germany with control over all other interested\r\nReich agencies. He was the “boss of the economy,” and all important\r\ndecisions had to be referred to him.\r\n\r\nTwo important conferences show clearly how Goering inspired and directed\r\nthe preparation of the German economy for aggressive war. On 8 July 1938\r\nhe addressed a number of leading German aircraft manufacturers,\r\nexplained the political situation, and laid the groundwork for a vast\r\nincrease in aircraft production. After stating that war with\r\nCzechoslovakia was imminent and boasting that the German air force was\r\nalready superior in quality and quantity to the English, he continued:\r\n\r\n    “If Germany wins the war, she will be the greatest power in the\r\n    world, dominating the world market, and Germany will be a rich\r\n    nation. For this goal, risks must be taken. The only thing that\r\n    matters is increased output regarding quantity and quality. Even\r\n    if the manufacturers know that their present policies may mean\r\n    their bankruptcy within three years, they will have to do it all\r\n    the same * * * I want you to be perfectly resolved, today\r\n    already, how you will run your business when war comes. The\r\n    earlier the manufacturers make their preparations for\r\n    mobilization today, the less danger there will be of work being\r\n    held up. It must be determined for every worker whether he is\r\n    essential for production upon outbreak of war, and measures must\r\n    be taken to secure his deferment in case of mobilization.\r\n    (_3441-PS_). An executive will be put in charge to work on\r\n    nothing but the complete preparation of each plant for\r\n    mobilization day.” (_R-140_)\r\n\r\nA few weeks after the Munich agreement, on 14 October 1938, another\r\nconference was held in Goering’s office. He began with the statement\r\nthat Hitler had instructed him to organize a gigantic armament program\r\nwhich would make insignificant all previous achievements. He indicated\r\nthat he had been ordered to build as rapidly as possible an air force\r\nfive times as large, to increase the speed of Army and Navy armament,\r\nand to concentrate on offensive weapons, principally heavy artillery and\r\nheavy tanks. He then proposed a specific program designed to accomplish\r\nthese ends. (_1301-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Military Mobilization for War._ In his dual role as Reich Air\r\nMinister and Commander-in-Chief of the German Air Force, it was\r\nGoering’s function to develop the Luftwaffe to practical war strength.\r\nAs early as March 1935 Goering frankly announced to the world that he\r\nwas in the process of building a true military air force:\r\n\r\n    “After the German government expressed willingness to help, it\r\n    became necessary to make a clear demarcation within German\r\n    aviation, namely in this respect: which air force will be able\r\n    to be made available? This situation brought about the decision\r\n    as to those of the German aviation who will in future belong to\r\n    the Air Force and those who will in future remain in civil\r\n    aviation or in sport aviation. It was necessary to mark this\r\n    separation also outwardly, so that the members of the German Air\r\n    Force became soldiers according to the law and their leaders\r\n    became officers.” (_2292-PS_)\r\n\r\nTwo months later, in a speech to 1,000 Air Force officers, Goering spoke\r\nin a still bolder vein:\r\n\r\n    “I repeat: I intend to create a Luftwaffe which, if the hour\r\n    should strike, shall burst upon the foe like a chorus of\r\n    revenge. The enemy must have a feeling of being lost already\r\n    before even having fought. * * *”\r\n\r\nIn the same year, he signed his name to the Conscription Law which\r\nprovided for compulsory military service and constituted an act of\r\ndefiance on the part of Nazi Germany in violation of the Versailles\r\nTreaty. (_1654-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering’s statements during this period left no doubt in the minds of\r\nAllied diplomats that Germany was engaged in full mobilization of air\r\npower for an impending war.\r\n\r\n    “Goering and Milch often said to me or in my presence that the\r\n    Nazis had decided to concentrate on air power as the weapon of\r\n    terror most likely to give Germany a dominant position and the\r\n    weapon which could be developed the most rapidly and in the\r\n    shortest time . . . High ranking Nazis with whom I had to\r\n    maintain official contact, particularly men such as Goering,\r\n    Goebbels, Ley, Frick, Frank, Darré and others, repeatedly\r\n    scoffed at my position as to the binding character of treaties\r\n    and openly stated to me that Germany would observe her\r\n    international undertakings only so long as it suited Germany’s\r\n    interests to do so.” (_2385-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _The Launching of Aggressive War._ Goering was the central figure in\r\nthe preparation of Germany for military aggression. In German economic\r\ndevelopment and military growth he held the key positions throughout the\r\nprewar period. Although he held no official position in the field of\r\nforeign affairs, Goering also figured prominently in all of the major\r\nphases of Nazi international aggression between 1937 and 1941. As “No. 2\r\nNazi” he was a leading participant in every major plan of territorial\r\naggrandizement or offensive military strategy.\r\n\r\nGoering was the prompter and director of the diplomatic tragi-comedy\r\nleading to the Austrian Anschluss. In the middle of November 1937, Mr.\r\nBullitt, the American Ambassador to France, reported the following\r\nconversation with Goering:\r\n\r\n    “I asked Goering if he meant that Germany was absolutely\r\n    determined to annex Austria to the Reich. He replied that this\r\n    was an absolute determination of the German Government. The\r\n    German Government at the present time was not pressing this\r\n    matter because of certain momentary political considerations,\r\n    especially in their relations with Italy; but Germany would\r\n    tolerate no solution of the Austrian question other than the\r\n    consolidation of Austria in the German Reich. He then added a\r\n    statement which went further than any I have heard on this\r\n    subject: He said, ‘There are schemes being pushed now for a\r\n    union of Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, either with or\r\n    without a Hapsburg at the head of the unit. Such a solution is\r\n    absolutely inacceptable to us, and for us the conclusion of such\r\n    an agreement would be an immediate _casus belli_’.” (_L-151_)\r\n\r\nWhen the time came, on 11 March 1938, Goering was in complete command.\r\nThroughout the afternoon and evening of that day he directed by\r\ntelephone the activities of Seyss-Inquart, also of Keppler, Ullrich, and\r\nthe other Nazi operatives in Vienna. (_2949-PS_); (the pertinent\r\nportions of these telephone conversations have already been referred to\r\nin Section 3 of Chapter IX on Aggression Against Austria.)\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon Goering gave the following order to Seyss-Inquart:\r\n\r\n    “Now, remember the following: You go immediately together with\r\n    Lt. General Muff and tell the Federal President that if the\r\n    conditions which are known to you are not accepted immediately,\r\n    the troops who are already stationed in and advancing to the\r\n    frontier will march in tonight along the whole line, and Austria\r\n    will cease to exist.” (_2949-PS_)\r\n\r\nEarly the same evening he dictated to Seyss-Inquart the telegram which\r\nthe latter was to send to Berlin requesting the Nazi Government to send\r\nGerman troops to “prevent bloodshed”. Two days later he was able to call\r\nRibbentrop in London and say:\r\n\r\n    “Yes, the last march into the Rhineland is completely\r\n    over-shadowed. The Fuehrer was deeply moved, when he talked to\r\n    me last night. You must remember it was the first time that he\r\n    saw his homeland again. Now, I merely want to talk about\r\n    political things. Well, this story we have given an ultimatum,\r\n    that is just foolish gossip.” (_2949-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering played a similarly important role in the attack on\r\nCzechoslovakia. In March of 1938, at the time of the Anschluss with\r\nAustria, he had given a solemn assurance to the Czechoslovakian Minister\r\nin Berlin that the developments in Austria would in no way have a\r\ndetrimental influence on the relations between Germany and\r\nCzechoslovakia, and had emphasized the continued earnest endeavor on the\r\npart of Germany to improve these mutual relations. In this connection,\r\nGoering used the expression: “_Ich gebe Ihnen mein Ehrenwort._ (I give\r\nyou my word of honor)” (_TC-27_). On the other hand, in his address to\r\nGerman airplane manufacturers on 8 July 1938, he made his private views\r\non this subject clear:\r\n\r\n    “Beyond this they fear that once we have pocketed\r\n    Czechoslovakia, we will attack Hungary, the Rumanian oil wells,\r\n    etc. Moreover, since there are democratic countries on the one\r\n    hand, and authoritarian ones on the other, there is enough\r\n    inflammable matter in the world anyway. When, how and where this\r\n    inflammable matter will explode, no one among us can say. It may\r\n    happen within some months, but it may also take some years. At\r\n    present, the situation is this that Czechoslovakia has promised\r\n    the Sudeten Germans to meet them half way. I am convinced that\r\n    they will satisfy no more than some of their unimportant\r\n    demands. Such action on their part would probably suit our\r\n    policy best, since in this case we could put the entire\r\n    responsibility on England because she has engaged herself so\r\n    deeply in this business.” (_R-140_)\r\n\r\nOn 14 October 1938, shortly after the Munich agreement, Goering gave his\r\nviews on the Czechoslovakian question at a conference in the Air\r\nMinistry:\r\n\r\n    “The Sudetenland has to be exploited with all the means. General\r\n    Field Marshal Goering counts upon a complete industrial\r\n    assimilation of the Slovakia. Czech and Slovakia would become\r\n    German dominions. Everything possible must be taken out. The\r\n    Oder-Danube Canal has to be speeded up. Searches for oil and ore\r\n    have to be conducted in Slovakia, notably by State Secretary\r\n    Keppler.” (_1301-PS_)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he was deceiving the representatives of the puppet Slovakian\r\ngovernment to the same end:\r\n\r\n    “The Field Marshal considers that the Slovak negotiations toward\r\n    independence are to be supported in a suitable manner.\r\n    Czechoslovakia without Slovakia is still more at our mercy.”\r\n    (_2801-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the following year, with the rape of Czechoslovakia complete Goering\r\nfrankly stated what Germany’s purpose had been throughout the whole\r\naffair:\r\n\r\n    “In a rather long statement the field marshal explained that the\r\n    incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia into the German economy had\r\n    taken place, among other reasons to increase the German War\r\n    potential by exploitation of the industry there.” (_R-133_)\r\n\r\nGoering was also a moving force in the later crimes against the peace.\r\nAs the successor designate to Hitler, as Chief of the Air Forces, and as\r\neconomic czar of Greater Germany, he was a party to all the planning for\r\nmilitary operations of the Nazi forces in the East and the West. In the\r\nPolish affair, for example, it was Goering who in 1935 gave assurances\r\nto the Polish government that “there should be not the slightest fear in\r\nPoland that on the German side it (the German-Polish alliance) would not\r\nbe continued in the future.” Yet, four years later, Goering helped\r\nformulate plans for the invasion of Polish territory.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the attack upon the Soviet Union, plans for the ruthless\r\nexploitation of Russian territory were made months in advance of the\r\nopening of hostilities. Goering was placed in charge of this army of\r\nspoliation, whose mission was that of “seizing raw materials and taking\r\nover all important concerns.” (_1317-PS_; _1157-PS_.)\r\n\r\nThese specific instances cover only a small part of Goering’s activities\r\nin the field of aggressive war. There follows a partial list of\r\nadditional documents which demonstrate Goering’s knowledge of and\r\ncontinued participation in the Nazi war program. They deal either with\r\nconferences on the highest war-planning levels which he attended, or\r\nwith secret orders communicated to him outlining in advance the official\r\nplans for the execution of the successive acts of aggression.\r\n\r\n                  _Meetings and Conferences Attended:_\r\n\r\nConference in Reichskanzlei, 5 November 1937, to outline the necessity\r\nfor expanding German foreign policy; plans discussed for the acquisition\r\nof Austria and Czechoslovakia.

The first was to satisfy the labor requirements of the Nazi\r\nwar machine by forcing residents of occupied countries to work in\r\nGermany, often directly in the German armament industry, and the second\r\nwas to destroy or weaken the peoples of the occupied territories.\r\nMillions of foreign workers were taken to Germany, for the most part\r\nunder pressure and generally by physical force. These workers were\r\nforced to labor under conditions of undescribable brutality and\r\ndegredation, and often they were used in factories and industries\r\ndevoted exclusively to the production of munitions of war. (_See Chapter\r\nX on The Slave Labor Program._)\r\n\r\nGoering was at all times implicated in the slave labor program.\r\nRecruitment and allocation of manpower and determination of working\r\nconditions were included in his jurisdiction as Plenipotentiary for the\r\nFour-Year Plan, and from its beginning a part of the Four-Year Plan\r\nOffice was devoted to such work. (_1862-PS_; _2827-PS_.)\r\n\r\nThe defendant Goering was present at a meeting in Hitler’s study on 23\r\nMay 1939 at which Hitler, after declaring his intention to attack Poland\r\nat the first suitable opportunity, said:\r\n\r\n    “If fate brings us into conflict with the West, the possession\r\n    of extensive areas in the East will be advantageous. * * * The\r\n    population of non-German areas will perform no military service\r\n    and will be available as a source of labor.” (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nSoon after the fall of Poland, Goering as Plenipotentiary for the\r\nFour-Year Plan, began the enslavement of large numbers of Poles. On 25\r\nJanuary 1940, the defendant Frank, then Governor General of Poland,\r\nreported to Goering as follows:\r\n\r\n    “For the execution of the task of systematically placing the\r\n    economic strength of the Generalgouvernement, within the\r\n    framework of the Four-Year Plan, in the service of the German\r\n    defense industry, I give the following\r\n\r\n                              _DIRECTIVES_\r\n\r\n    “1. In view of the present requirements of the Reich for the\r\n    defense industry, it is at present fundamentally impossible to\r\n    carry on a long-term economic policy in the Generalgouvernement.\r\n    Rather, it is necessary so to steer the economy of the\r\n    Generalgouvernement that it will, in the shortest possible time,\r\n    accomplish results representing the maximum that can be gotten\r\n    out of the economic strength of the Generalgouvernement for\r\n    immediate strengthening of our capacity for defense. * * *\r\n\r\n    “2. (g) Supply and transportation of at least 1 million male and\r\n    female agricultural and industrial workers to the Reich—among\r\n    them at least 7500 000 [sic] agricultural workers of which at\r\n    least 50% must be women—in order to guarantee agricultural\r\n    production in the Reich and as a replacement for industrial\r\n    workers lacking in the Reich. * * *” (_1375-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat orders for this enormous number of workers originated with the\r\ndefendant Goering is clear from the following statement in Frank’s Diary\r\nfor 10 May 1940:\r\n\r\n    “Then the Governor General deals with the problem of the\r\n    _Compulsory Labor Service_ of the Poles. Upon the demands from\r\n    the Reich it has now been decreed that compulsion may be\r\n    exercised in view of the fact that sufficient manpower was not\r\n    voluntarily available for service inside the German Reich. This\r\n    compulsion means the possibility of arrest of male and female\r\n    Poles. Because of these measures a certain disquietude had\r\n    developed which, according to individual reports, was spreading\r\n    very much, and which might produce difficulties everywhere.\r\n    General Fieldmarshal Goering some time ago pointed out in his\r\n    long speech the necessity to deport into the Reich a million\r\n    workers. The supply so far was 160,000. However, great\r\n    difficulties had to be overcome. Therefore it would be advisable\r\n    to consult the district and town chiefs in the execution of the\r\n    compulsion, so that one could be sure from the start that this\r\n    action would be reasonably successful. The arrest of young Poles\r\n    when leaving church service or the cinema would bring about an\r\n    increasing nervousness of the Poles. Generally speaking, he had\r\n    no objections at all if the rubbish, capable of work yet often\r\n    loitering about, would be snatched from the streets. The best\r\n    method for this, however, would be the organization of a raid,\r\n    and it would be absolutely justifiable to stop a Pole in the\r\n    street and to question him what he was doing, where he was\r\n    working, etc.” (_2233-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering was also responsible for the harsh treatment given these workers\r\nwhen they reached Germany. On 8 March 1940, as Plenipotentiary of the\r\nFour-Year Plan and as Chairman of the Cabinet Counsel for the Defense of\r\nthe Reich, he issued a directive to the Supreme Reich authorities,\r\nentitled: “Treatment of male and female civilian workers of Polish\r\nNationality in the Reich.” In this directive Goering provided in part:\r\n\r\n    “The mass employment of male and female civilian workers of\r\n    Polish nationality in the Reich necessitates a comprehensive\r\n    ruling on treatment of these workers.\r\n\r\n    “The following orders are to be executed at once:\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “4. The blameless conduct of the Poles is to be assured by\r\n    special regulations. The legal and administrative regulations,\r\n    necessary for this, will be issued by the Reichsfuehrer-SS and\r\n    Chief of the German Police at the Reich Ministry of the\r\n    Interior.\r\n\r\n    “6. Attention is drawn to the explanations enclosed as\r\n    appendix.” (_R-148_)\r\n\r\nAttached to this directive, and also dated 8 March 1940, were a series\r\nof regulations issued by Himmler, as Reichfuehrer SS and Chief of the\r\nGerman Police. These regulations provided for stringent measures and\r\ndiscrimination against Polish workers in the Reich. In a covering\r\nExpress Letter addressed to all State Police district-offices and State\r\nPolice offices, also dated 8 March 1940, Himmler made clear what was\r\nintended in order to secure “blameless conduct”. He stated:\r\n\r\n    “The steps to be taken to combat insubordination and\r\n    noncompliance with the duty to work, must be decided according\r\n    to the severity of the case and to the spirit of resistance of\r\n    the offender. It is of most importance that they be taken\r\n    immediately after the offense is committed so that they have a\r\n    decisive effect. In accordance with my instructions in the\r\n    appended decrees, especially severe measures must be taken\r\n    during the first eight weeks, in order to bring home to the\r\n    workers of Polish nationality from the outset the consequences\r\n    of noncompliance with the orders issued. * * *\r\n\r\n    “In general, in all cases where a warning, by the State Police\r\n    or a short imprisonment is not sufficient to induce the worker\r\n    to fulfill his duties, application is to be made for his\r\n    transfer to a labor training camp, and an opinion given on what\r\n    treatment he should receive there. The treatment in the labor\r\n    training camps will have to be in accordance with, the severity\r\n    of the offense. It is suitable, e.g., to make obstinate shirkers\r\n    work in the stone-quarries of the Mauthausen camp. By a special\r\n    decree, to the heads of SS-Deathshead Units and concentration\r\n    camps, I have ordered that the treatment of these persons under\r\n    protective custody be undertaken in a concentration camp.\r\n\r\n    “Extraordinarily serious cases have to be reported to the Chief\r\n    of the Security Police and the SD who, after examination, make\r\n    the decision on a special treatment of the workers of Polish\r\n    nationality in question.” (_R-148_)\r\n\r\nOn 29 January 1942 the Division for the Employment of Labor in the\r\nFour-Year Plan Office issued a circular, signed by Dr. Mansfeld, the\r\nGeneral Delegate for Labor Employment in the Four-Year Plan Office, and\r\naddressed to various civilian and military authorities in the occupied\r\nterritories, explaining the various means to be used to force workers to\r\ngo to Germany. The circular provides in part:\r\n\r\n    “Subject: Increased mobilization of man-power for the German\r\n    Reich from the occupied territories and preparations for\r\n    mobilization by force.\r\n\r\n    “On the one hand, the labor shortage which was rendered more\r\n    acute by the draft for the Wehrmacht, and on the other hand, the\r\n    increased scope of the armament problem in the German Reich,\r\n    render it necessary that manpower for service in the Reich be\r\n    recruited from the occupied territories to a much greater extent\r\n    than heretofore, in order to relieve the shortage of labor.\r\n    Therefore, any and all methods must be adopted which make\r\n    possible the transportation, without exception and delay, for\r\n    employment in the German Reich, of manpower in the occupied\r\n    territories which is unemployed or which can be released for use\r\n    in Germany after most careful screening.\r\n\r\n    “This mobilization shall first of all, as heretofore, be carried\r\n    out on a voluntary basis. For this reason, the recruiting effort\r\n    for employment in the German Reich must be strengthened\r\n    considerably. But if satisfactory results are to be obtained,\r\n    the German authorities, who are functioning in the occupied\r\n    territories, must be able to exert any pressure necessary to\r\n    support the voluntary recruiting of labor for employment in\r\n    Germany. Accordingly, to the extent that may be necessary, the\r\n    regulations in force in the occupied territories in regard to\r\n    shift in employment and withdrawal of support upon refusal to\r\n    work, must be tightened. Supplementary regulations concerning\r\n    shift in employment must above all insure that older personnel\r\n    who are freed must be exchanged for younger personnel to make up\r\n    for it, so that the latter may be made available for the Reich.\r\n    A far-reaching decrease in the amount of relief granted by\r\n    Public Welfare must also be effected in order to induce laborers\r\n    to accept employment in the Reich. Unemployment relief must be\r\n    set so low that the amount in comparison with the average wages\r\n    in the Reich and the possibilities there for sending remittances\r\n    home may serve as an inducement to accept employment in the\r\n    Reich. When refusal to accept work in the Reich is not\r\n    justified, the compensation must be reduced to an amount barely\r\n    enough for subsistence, or even be cancelled. In this\r\n    connection, partial withdrawal of ration cards and assignment to\r\n    particularly heavy obligatory labor may be considered.\r\n\r\n    “However, all misgivings must give way before the necessity of\r\n    supplying the deficit in manpower caused by excessive draft\r\n    calls into the Armed Forces, in order to avoid detriment to the\r\n    armament industry. For this purpose the forcible mobilization of\r\n    workers from the occupied territories cannot be disregarded, in\r\n    case the voluntary recruiting is unsuccessful. The mere\r\n    possibility of mobilization by force will, in many cases, make\r\n    recruiting easier.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, I ask you immediately to take any measures in your\r\n    district which will promote the employment of workers in the\r\n    German Reich on a voluntary basis. I herewith request you to\r\n    prepare for publication regulations applying to forced\r\n    mobilization of laborers from your territory for Germany, so\r\n    that they may be decreed at once, in case recruiting on a\r\n    voluntary basis will not have the desired result, that is relief\r\n    of the manpower shortage in the Reich. I request you to inform\r\n    me of the measures taken by you.” (_1183-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 21 March 1942, Hitler promulgated a decree appointing Sauckel\r\nPlenipotentiary General for Man Power. This decree provided in part:\r\n\r\n    “In order to secure the manpower requisite for the war\r\n    industries as a whole, and particularly for armaments, it is\r\n    necessary that the utilization of all available manpower,\r\n    including that of workers recruited [erwerben] abroad and of\r\n    prisoners of war, should be subject to a uniform control,\r\n    directed in a manner appropriate to the requirements of war\r\n    industry, and further that all still incompletely utilized\r\n    manpower in the Greater German Reich, including the\r\n    Protectorate, and in the General Government and in the occupied\r\n    territories, should be mobilized.\r\n\r\n    “Reichsstatthalter and Gauleiter Fritz Sauckel will carry out\r\n    this task within the framework of the Four-Year Plan, as\r\n    plenipotentiary general, for the employment of manpower. In that\r\n    capacity he will be directly responsible to the Commissioner for\r\n    the Four-Year Plan.” (_1666-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 27 March 1942, Goering, as Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan,\r\nissued a decree in pursuance of the Fuehrer’s decree of 21 March 1942.\r\nThis decree provided:\r\n\r\n    “In pursuance of the Fuehrer’s Decree of 21 March 1942 (RGBl I,\r\n    179), I decree as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. My manpower sections (_Geschaeftsgruppen Arbeitseinsatz_)\r\n    are hereby abolished (circular letter of 22 Oct 1936/ St M. Dev.\r\n    265). Their duties (recruitment and allocation of manpower,\r\n    regulations for labor conditions (_Arbeitsbedingungen_)) are\r\n    taken over by the Plenipotentiary General for Arbeitseinsatz,\r\n    who is directly under me.\r\n\r\n    “2. The Plenipotentiary General for Arbeitseinsatz will be\r\n    responsible for regulating the conditions of labor (wage policy)\r\n    employed in the Reich Territory, having regard to the\r\n    requirements of Arbeitseinsatz.\r\n\r\n    “3. The Plenipotentiary General for Arbeitseinsatz is part of\r\n    the Four-Year Plan. In cases where new legislation is required,\r\n    or existing laws required to be modified, he will submit\r\n    appropriate proposals to me.\r\n\r\n    “4. The Plenipotentiary General for Arbeitseinsatz will have at\r\n    his disposal for the performance of his task the right delegated\r\n    to me by the Fuehrer for issuing instructions to the higher\r\n    Reich authorities, their branches and the Party offices, and\r\n    their associated organisms and also the Reich Protector, the\r\n    General Governor, the Commander-in-Chief, and heads of the civil\r\n    administrations. In the case of ordinances and instructions of\r\n    fundamental importance a report is to be submitted to me in\r\n    advance.” (_1666-PS_)\r\n\r\nSince Sauckel was an authority of the Four-Year Plan, it is clear that\r\nGoering remains responsible for the war crimes committed by Sauckel as\r\nPlenipotentiary-General for Manpower. (_See Chapter X on The Slave Labor\r\nProgram._)\r\n\r\n(2) _Employment of Prisoners of War in War Industry._ The Nazi\r\nconspirators ordered prisoners of war to work under dangerous\r\nconditions, and in the manufacturing and transportation of arms or\r\nmunitions, in violation of the Laws of War and of Articles 31 and 32 of\r\nthe Geneva Convention of 27 July 1929 on Prisoners of War. (_See Chapter\r\nX on The Illegal Use of Prisoners of War._)\r\n\r\nGoering had a part in these crimes. At a conference on 7 November 1941,\r\nthe subject of which was the employment of Russians, including Russian\r\nprisoners of war, it appears from a memorandum signed by Koerner, State\r\nSecretary to the defendant Goering as Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year\r\nPlan, that Goering gave the following directives for use of Russians as\r\nlaborers:\r\n\r\n    “I. _The stronger labor reserves in the zone of the interior are\r\n    also decisive for the war._\r\n\r\n    “The Russian workers have proved their productive capacity\r\n    during the development of the huge Russian industry. Therefore\r\n    it must be made available to the Reich from now on. Objections\r\n    against this order of the Fuehrer are of the secondary nature.\r\n    The disadvantages which can be created by the Arbeitseinsatz\r\n    have to be reduced to a minimum: the task especially of\r\n    counter-intelligence and security police.\r\n\r\n    “II. _The Russian in the zone of operations._\r\n\r\n    “He is to be employed particularly in building roads and\r\n    railroads, in clearing work, clearing of mines and in building\r\n    airports. The German construction battalions have to be\r\n    dissolved to a great extent (Example: Air Forces!); the German\r\n    skilled workers belong to the war industry; it is not their task\r\n    to shovel and to break stones, the Russian is there for that.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “IV. _The Russian in the Reich territory including the\r\n    Protectorate._\r\n\r\n    “The number of the employed depends on the requirement. By\r\n    determining the requirement, it is to be considered that workers\r\n    of other states who produce little and eat much are to be\r\n    shipped out of the Reich and that in the future the German woman\r\n    should come less into the foreground in the labor process.\r\n    Beside the Russian prisoners of war, free Russian workers should\r\n    also be used.\r\n\r\n    “A. _The Russian Prisoner of War._\r\n\r\n    “1.

Sufficient, adequate\r\n    nourishment is also the main thing for the free workers.”\r\n    (_1193-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a set of top secret notes on what was apparently the same conference,\r\nthe following appears:\r\n\r\n    “NOTES\r\n\r\n    On outlines layed down by the Reichsmarschall in the meeting of\r\n    7 November 1941 in the Reich Ministry for Air (RLM)\r\n\r\n    “SUBJECT: Employment of laborers in war industries.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer’s point of view as to employment of prisoners of\r\n    war in war industries has changed basically. So far a total of 5\r\n    million prisoners of war—employed so far 2 million.\r\n\r\n    “Directives for employment:\r\n\r\n     “Frenchmen:  Individual employment, transposition into armament\r\n                  industry (Rue-wirtschaft)\r\n     “Serbs:      Preferably agriculture.\r\n     “Poles:      If feasible no individual employment achievement\r\n                  of Russian armament industry surpasses the German\r\n                  one. Assembly linework, a great many mechanical\r\n                  devices with relatively few skilled workers.\r\n\r\n    “Readiness of Russians in the operational area to work is\r\n    strong. In the Ukraine and other areas discharged prisoners of\r\n    war already work as free labor.

Strong\r\n    action.” (_1206-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a secret letter from the Reichsminister of Labor to the Presidents of\r\nthe Regional Labor Exchange Offices, the following appears:\r\n\r\n    “Upon personal order of the Reich Marshal, 100,000 men are to be\r\n    taken from among the French PW’s not yet employed in the\r\n    armament industry, and are to be assigned to the armament\r\n    industry (airplane industry). Gaps in manpower supply resulting\r\n    therefrom will be filled by Soviet PW’s. The transfer of the\r\n    above-named French PW’s is to be accomplished by 1 October.”\r\n    (_3005-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Looting and Destruction of Works of Art._ The Nazi conspirators\r\nplanned and organized the cultural impoverishment of every country in\r\nEurope: the plunder of works of art by the Government General in\r\noccupied Poland and the activities of the Einsatzstab Rosenberg are\r\noutstanding examples. (_See Chapter XIV on the Plunder of Art\r\nTreasures._)\r\n\r\nGoering was continuously connected with these activities. In October\r\n1939 he requested a Dr. Kajetan Muehlmann to undertake immediately the\r\n“securing” of all Polish art treasures. In an affidavit, Dr. Muehlmann\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “I was the special deputy of the Governor General of Poland,\r\n    Hans Frank, for the safeguarding of art treasures in the General\r\n    Government, October 1939 to September 1943.\r\n\r\n    “Goering, in his function as chairman of the Reich Defense\r\n    Council, had commissioned me with this duty.\r\n\r\n    “I confirm, that it was the official policy of the Governor\r\n    General, Hans Frank, to take into custody all important art\r\n    treasures, which belonged to Polish public institutions, private\r\n    collections and the Church. I confirm, that the art treasures,\r\n    mentioned, were actually confiscated, and it is clear to me,\r\n    that they would not have remained in Poland in case of a German\r\n    victory, but that they would have been used to complement German\r\n    artistic property.” (_3042-PS_)\r\n\r\nIndicative of the continued interest taken by Goering in these\r\noperations, it appears from Dr. Muehlmann’s report that at one time 31\r\nvaluable sketches by the artist Albrecht Durer were taken from a Polish\r\ncollection and personally handed to the defendant Goering, who took them\r\nto the Fuehrer’s headquarters. (_1709-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe part played by Goering in looting of art by the _Einsatzstab\r\nRosenberg_ has been shown in Chapter XIV. On 5 November 1940 Goering\r\nissued an order under his own signature directed to the Chief of the\r\nMilitary Administration Paris, and to the _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “In conveying the measures taken until now, for the securing of\r\n    Jewish art property by the Chief of the Military Administration\r\n    Paris and the special service staff Rosenberg (the Chief of the\r\n    Supreme Command of the Armed Forces 2 f 28.14. W.Z.Nr 3812/40\r\n    g), the art objects brought to the Louvre will be disposed of in\r\n    the following way:\r\n\r\n    “1. Those art objects about which the Fuehrer has reserved for\r\n    himself the decision as to their use.\r\n\r\n    “2. Those art objects which serve to the completion of the Reich\r\n    Marshal’s collection.\r\n\r\n    “3. Those art objects and library stocks the use of which seem\r\n    useful to the establishing of the higher institutes of learning\r\n    and which come within the jurisdiction of Reichsleiter\r\n    Rosenberg.\r\n\r\n    “4. Those art objects that are suited to be sent to German\r\n    museums, of all these art objects a systematic inventory will be\r\n    made by the special purpose staff Rosenberg; they will then be\r\n    packed and shipped to Germany with the assistance of the\r\n    Luftwaffe.” (_141-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn view of the high priority afforded by the foregoing order to the\r\ncompletion of Goering’s own collection, it is not surprising to find\r\nthat he continued to aid the operations of the _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_.\r\nThus, on 1 May 1941, Goering issued an order to all Party, State, and\r\nWehrmacht Services, under his own signature, requesting them—\r\n\r\n    “* * * to give all possible support and assistance to the Chief\r\n    of Staff of Reichsleiter Rosenberg’s staffs. * * * The\r\n    above-mentioned persons are requested to report to us on their\r\n    work, particularly on any difficulties that might arise.”\r\n    (_1117-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy 30 May 1942, Goering was able to boast of the assistance which he had\r\nrendered to the work of the _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_. In a letter to\r\nRosenberg, of that date, he stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * On the other hand I also support personally the work of\r\n    your Einsatzstab wherever I can do so, and a great part of the\r\n    seized cultural goods can be accounted for because I was able to\r\n    assist the Einsatzstab with my organization.” (_1015-I-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Germanization and Spoliation._ With respect to Poland the Nazi\r\nconspirators’ plans for Germanization and spoliation commenced with the\r\nincorporation of the four western provinces of Poland into the German\r\nReich. In the remaining portions occupied by Germany they set up the\r\nGovernment General. The Nazis planned to Germanize the so-called\r\nincorporated territories ruthlessly by deporting Polish intelligentsia,\r\nJews, and dissident elements to the Government General, for eventual\r\nelimination; by confiscating Polish property, particularly farms; by\r\nsending those so deprived of their property to Germany as laborers; and\r\nby importing German settlers. It was specifically planned to exploit the\r\npeople and material resources of the territory within the Government\r\nGeneral by taking whatever was needed to strengthen the Nazi war\r\nmachine, thus impoverishing this region and reducing it to a vassal\r\nstate. (_See Chapter XIII on Germanization and Spoliation._)\r\n\r\nGoering, together with Hitler, Lammers, Frick, and Hess, signed the\r\ndecree purporting to incorporate certain parts of Polish territory into\r\nthe Reich. (Decree of the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor concerning the\r\nOrganization and Administration of the Eastern Territories, 8 October\r\n1939, 1939 Reichsgesetzblatt, Part I, p. 2042.)\r\n\r\nPurporting to act by virtue of section 8 of the foregoing decree,\r\nGoering, as Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan, signed an order\r\nconcerning the introduction of the Four-Year Plan in the Eastern\r\nTerritories. (Order concerning the Introduction of the Four-Year Plan in\r\nthe Eastern Territories, 30 October 1939, 1939 Reichsgesetzblatt, Part\r\nI, p. 2125.)\r\n\r\nGoering in a directive dated 19 October 1939 stated:\r\n\r\n    “In the meeting of October 13th, I have given detailed\r\n    instructions for the economical administration of the occupied\r\n    territories. I will repeat them here in short: 1. The task for\r\n    the economic treatment of the various administrative regions is\r\n    different depending on whether a country is involved which will\r\n    be incorporated politically into the German Reich or whether we\r\n    deal with the Government General, which, in all probability,\r\n    will not be made a part of Germany.\r\n\r\n    “In the first mentioned territories the reconstruction and\r\n    expansion of the economy, the safeguarding of all their\r\n    production facilities and supplies must be aimed at, as well as\r\n    a complete incorporation into the Greater German economic system\r\n    at the earliest possible time. On the other hand there must be\r\n    removed from the territories of the Government General all raw\r\n    materials, scrap materials, machines, etc., which are of use for\r\n    the German war economy. Enterprises which are not absolutely\r\n    necessary for the meager maintenance of the naked existence of\r\n    the population must be transferred to Germany, unless such\r\n    transfer would require an unreasonably long period of time and\r\n    would make it more practical to exploit those enterprises by\r\n    giving them German orders to be executed at their present\r\n    location.” (_EC-410_)\r\n\r\nGoering acted as chairman of a meeting on 12 February 1940 to discuss\r\n“questions concerning the East,” attended also by Himmler and Frank.\r\nFrom the minutes of this meeting it appears:\r\n\r\n    “By way of introduction, the General Field Marshal explained\r\n    that the strengthening of the war potential of the Reich must be\r\n    the chief aim of all measures to be taken in the East.”\r\n    (_EC-305_).\r\n\r\nThe hand of Goering may also be found in the remainder of the Nazi plans\r\nfor Poland. It was he, for example, who signed, with Hitler and Keitel,\r\nthe secret decree which entrusted Himmler with the task of executing the\r\nGermanization program (_686-PS_). Similarly, it was Goering who, by\r\nvirtue of his powers as Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan, issued a\r\ndecree concerning confiscations in the incorporated eastern territories.\r\nThis decree applied to “property of citizens of the former Polish State\r\nwithin the territory of the Greater German Reich, including the\r\nincorporated Eastern Territories”, and provided in part:\r\n\r\n    “SECTION 1. (1) The property of citizens of the former Polish\r\n    State within the territory of the Greater German Reich,\r\n    including the incorporated Eastern territories, shall be subject\r\n    to sequestration, trustee administration, and confiscation in\r\n    accordance with the following provisions.\r\n\r\n    “(2) Subsection 1 shall not apply to the property of persons\r\n    who, in accordance with Section 6 of the decree of the Fuehrer\r\n    and Reich Chancellor relating to the organization and\r\n    administration of the Eastern Territories of October 8, 1935\r\n    (RGBl, I, p. 2042), have acquired German nationality. The agency\r\n    having jurisdiction in accordance with Section 12 may allow\r\n    further exemptions.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “SECTION 2. (2) Sequestration shall be ordered in connection\r\n    with the property of:\r\n\r\n        _a_. Jews.\r\n\r\n        _b_. Persons who have fled or are not merely temporarily\r\n        absent.\r\n\r\n    “(2) Sequestration may be ordered:\r\n\r\n        _a_. If the property is required for the public welfare,\r\n        particularly in the interests of Reich defense or the\r\n        strengthening of Germanism.\r\n\r\n        _b_. If the owners or other title holders immigrated\r\n        into the territory of the German Reich as it was then\r\n        delimited, after October 1, 1918.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    SECTION 9. (1) Sequestrated property may be confiscated by the\r\n    competent agency (Section 12) for the benefit of the German\r\n    Reich if the public welfare, particularly the defense of the\r\n    Reich, or the strengthening of Germanism, so requires.”\r\n    (_1665-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe spoliation of Soviet territory and resources and the barbarous\r\ntreatment inflicted on Soviet citizens were the result of plans long\r\nmade and carefully drawn up by the Nazis before they launched their\r\naggressive war on the Soviet Union. The Nazis planned to destroy the\r\nindustrial potential of the northern regions occupied by their armies\r\nand to administer the production of food in the south and southeast,\r\nwhich normally produced a surplus of food, in such a way that the\r\npopulation of the northern region would inevitably be reduced to\r\nstarvation because of diversion of such surplus food to the German\r\nReich. The Nazis also planned to incorporate Galicia and all the Baltic\r\ncountries into Germany and to convert the Crimea, an area north of the\r\nCrimea, the Volga territory, and the district around Baku into German\r\ncolonies. Their plans were to Germanize or destroy. (_See Chapter XIII\r\non Germanization and Spoliation._)\r\n\r\nBy 29 April 1941, seven weeks prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union,\r\nit appears that Hitler had entrusted Goering with the over-all direction\r\nof the economic administration in the area of operations and in the\r\nareas under political administration. It further appears that Goering\r\nhad set up an economic staff and subsidiary authorities to carry out\r\nthis function. (_1157-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe form of organization thus created by Goering and the duties of its\r\nvarious sections appear more clearly in a set of directives “for the\r\noperation of the economy in the newly occupied territories” issued by\r\nGoering, as Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich in July 1941. By\r\nthe terms of these directives, it is stated “The Orders of the Reich\r\nMarshal cover all economic fields, including nutrition and agriculture.\r\nThey are to be executed by the subordinate economic offices.” An\r\n“Economic Staff, East” was charged with the execution of orders\r\ntransmitted to it from higher authority. One subdivision of this staff,\r\nentitled “Group La”, was charged with the following functions:\r\n“Nutrition and Agriculture, the economy of all agricultural products,\r\nprovision of supplies for the Army, in cooperation with the Army groups\r\nconcerned.” (_EC-472_; _1743-PS_.)\r\n\r\nAs appears from the foregoing documents, it was a subdivision of the\r\neconomic organization set by Goering, the Economic Staff, East,\r\nAgricultural Group, which rendered a top secret report on 23 May 1941,\r\ncontaining a set of policy directives for the exploitation of Soviet\r\nagriculture. These directives contemplated abandonment of all industry\r\nin the food deficit regions, with certain exceptions, and the diversion\r\nof food from the food surplus regions to German needs, even though\r\nmillions of people would inevitably die of starvation as a result.\r\n(_EC-126_)\r\n\r\nMinutes of a meeting at Hitler’s Headquarters on 16 July 1941, kept by\r\nBormann, disclose Hitler’s announcement that the Nazis never intended to\r\nleave the countries then being occupied by their Armies. The Fuehrer\r\nfurther declared that although the rest of the world was to be deceived\r\non this point, nevertheless, “this need not prevent us taking all\r\nnecessary measures—shooting, desettling, etc.—and we shall take them,”\r\nand he discussed making the Crimea and other parts of Russia into German\r\ncolonies. Goering was present and participated in this conference.\r\n(_L-221_)\r\n\r\nAs a final illustration, it appears from a memorandum dated 16 September\r\n1941 that Goering presided over a meeting of German military officials\r\nconcerned with the “better exploitation of the occupied territories for\r\nthe German food economy” and that in discussing this topic, Goering\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    “It is clear that a graduated scale of food allocations is\r\n    needed.\r\n\r\n    “First in line are the _combat troops_, then the remainder of\r\n    troops in _enemy territory_, and then those _troops stationed at\r\n    home_. The rates are adjusted accordingly. The supply of the\r\n    _German_ non-military population follows and only then comes the\r\n    _population of the occupied territories_.\r\n\r\n    “In the occupied territories on principle only those people are\r\n    to be supplied with an adequate amount of food who work for us.\r\n    Even if one _wanted_ to feed all the other inhabitants, one\r\n    _could not_ do it in the newly occupied eastern areas. It is,\r\n    therefore, wrong to funnel off food supplies for this purpose,\r\n    if it is done at the expense of the Army and necessitates\r\n    increased supplies from home.” (_EC-3_)\r\n\r\n                     C. _CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY._\r\n\r\n(1) _Murder, Extermination, Enslavement, Deportation, and other Inhumane\r\nActs Committed against Civilian Populations before and during the War._\r\nIn 1936, Himmler became Chief of the German Police. Goering was\r\nthereafter able to devote his attention chiefly to the tasks of creating\r\nthe German Air Force and preparing the nation economically for\r\naggressive war. As was inevitable from his position, however, Goering\r\ncontinued to be concerned from time to time with the institutions of his\r\ncreation, such as the Gestapo and the concentration camps. For example,\r\non 14 February 1944, he sent the following teletype to Himmler:\r\n\r\n    “I received your request to form another squadron of air force\r\n    group for special purposes 7 (Z.B.V.7) and ordered examination\r\n    by the air force operational staff [_Luftwaffenfuerungstab_]. At\r\n    the same time I ask you to put at my disposal as great a number\r\n    of concentration camp [K Z—] convicts as possible for air\r\n    armament, as this kind of manpower proved to be very useful\r\n    according to previous experience. The situation of the air war\r\n    makes subterranean transfer of industry necessary. For work of\r\n    this kind concentration camp [K Z—] convicts can be especially\r\n    well concentrated at work and in the camp. Such installations\r\n    are necessary in order to secure production of the now fully\r\n    developed most modern airplanes. The Fuehrer upon his visit in\r\n    Insterburg has attached great value to these airplanes.\r\n    Intermediate negotiations have already been held between my and\r\n    your departments. I would be especially grateful for your\r\n    support in carrying out this task.” (_1584-I-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 9 March 1944 Himmler replied to the foregoing teletype as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Most honored Reichsmarshal:\r\n\r\n    “Following my teletype letter of the 18 February 1944 I herewith\r\n    transmit a survey on the employment of prisoners in the aviation\r\n    industry.\r\n\r\n    “This survey indicates that at the present time about _36,000\r\n    prisoners_ are employed for the purposes of the air force. An\r\n    increase to a total of _90,000 prisoners_ is contemplated.\r\n\r\n    “The production is being discussed, established and executed\r\n    between the Reich Ministry of Aviation and the chief of my\r\n    Economic-Administrative Main Office, SS-Obergruppenfuehrer and\r\n    General of the Waffen-SS, Pohl respectively.\r\n\r\n    “We assist with all forces at our disposal.”\r\n\r\nThere follows a report on the use of concentration camp prisoners in the\r\naviation industry. (_1584-III-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XI on Concentration Camps and Chapter XV, section 5, on the\r\nSS, reference is made to medical experiments performed on humans at the\r\nconcentration camp in Dachau. On 20 May 1942, Field Marshal Milch,\r\nSecretary of State and Deputy to Goering as Air Minister, wrote to\r\nSS-Obergruppenfuehrer Wolff the following letter:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Wolffy:\r\n\r\n    “In reference to your telegram of 12 May our sanitary inspector\r\n    reports to me that the altitude experiments carried out by the\r\n    SS and Air Force at Dachau have been finished. Any continuation\r\n    of these experiments seems essentially unreasonable. However,\r\n    the carrying out of experiments of some other kind, in regard to\r\n    perils at high seas, would be important. These have been\r\n    prepared in immediate agreement with the proper offices; Major\r\n    (M.C.) Weltz will be charged with the execution and Capt. (M.C.)\r\n    Rascher will be made available until further orders in addition\r\n    to his duties within the Medical Corps of the Air Corps. A\r\n    change of these measures does not appear necessary, and an\r\n    enlargement of the task is not considered pressing at this time.\r\n\r\n    “The low-pressure chamber would not be needed for these\r\n    low-temperature experiments. It is urgently needed at another\r\n    place and therefore can no longer remain in Dachau.\r\n\r\n    “I convey the special thanks from the supreme commander of the\r\n    Air Corps to the SS for their extensive cooperation.\r\n\r\n    “I remain with best wishes for you and in good comradeship and\r\n    with\r\n\r\n                                                      Heil Hitler!\r\n                                                        Always yours\r\n                                          /s/ E. Milch” (_343-PS_).\r\n\r\nThat Milch kept informed of the progress of the experiments may be seen\r\nfrom the following letter which he sent to Himmler on 31 August 1942:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Mr. Himmler:\r\n\r\n    “I thank you very much for your letter of the 25 Aug. I have\r\n    read with great interest the reports of Dr. Rascher and Dr.\r\n    Romberg. I am informed about the current experiments. I shall\r\n    ask the two gentlemen to give a lecture combined with the\r\n    showing of motion pictures to my men in the near future.\r\n\r\n    “Hoping that it will be possible for me to see you at the\r\n    occasion of my next visit to Headquarters I remain with best\r\n    regards and\r\n\r\n                                                      Heil Hitler!\r\n                                                         /s/ yours\r\n                                              E. Milch” (_343-PS_).\r\n\r\nThus it is clear that the highest circles in the Air Ministry, of which\r\nGoering was the head, were interested in these experiments.\r\n\r\n(2) _Persecution of the Jews._ As was to be expected from his position\r\nas Number 2 Nazi, Goering took an active part in the waging of the Nazi\r\nprogram of persecution, the ultimate purpose of which was the\r\nextermination of all Jews. To quote from Goering’s own book:\r\n\r\n    “The solution of the Jewish question has not yet been reached.\r\n    Whatever has happened so far has been done in a state of\r\n    necessity, in the interest of our own people; it was a reaction\r\n    against the ruin which this race has brought upon us.”\r\n    (_3461-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1935, Goering, as President of the Reichstag, in a speech urging that\r\nbody to pass the Nurnberg race laws, said:\r\n\r\n    “God has created the races. He did not want equality and\r\n    therefore we energetically reject any attempt to falsify the\r\n    concept of race purity by making it equivalent with racial\r\n    equality. * * * This equality does not exist. We have never\r\n    accepted such an idea and therefore we must reject it in our\r\n    laws likewise and must accept that purity of race which nature\r\n    and providence have destined for us.” (_3458-PS_)\r\n\r\nAgain, on 26 March 1938, Goering said in a speech in Vienna:\r\n\r\n    “I must direct a serious word to the City of Vienna. Today\r\n    Vienna cannot rightly claim to be a German City. One cannot\r\n    speak of a German City in which 300,000 Jews live. This city has\r\n    an important German mission in the field of culture as well as\r\n    in economics. For neither of these can we make use of the Jews.”\r\n    (_3460-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the late fall of 1938, using as an excuse the murder of von Rath,\r\nSecretary of the German Legation in Paris, the Nazi conspirators, acting\r\nwithin the frame-work of economic preparation for aggressive war, began\r\nthe complete elimination of Jews from economic life, preparatory to\r\ntheir physical annihilation. Goering as head of the Four-Year Plan, was\r\nin active charge of this phase of the persecutions. The first step in\r\nhis campaign was a law requiring registration of all Jewish-owned\r\nproperty. In April 1938 Goering and Frick signed such a law (_1406-PS_).\r\nArmed with the information thus secured, the Nazi conspirators were\r\nfully prepared to take the next step. The killing of von Rath in Paris\r\non 9 November 1938 was made the pretext for widespread “spontaneous”\r\nriots, which included the looting and burning of many Jewish synagogues,\r\nhomes, and shops, all of which were carefully organized and supervised\r\nby the Nazi conspirators. Goering was fully informed of measures taken.\r\n(_3051-PS_; _3058-PS_)\r\n\r\nImmediately after these riots, on 12 November 1938, Goering acted as\r\nChairman of a meeting at the Reich Ministry of Air, on the “Jewish\r\nquestion,” attended by Funk, Goebbels, Heydrich, and others (_1816-PS_).\r\nGoering made the purpose of the meeting clear at the outset. He said:\r\n\r\n    “Today’s meeting is of a decisive nature. I have received a\r\n    letter written on the Fuehrer’s orders by the Stabsleiter of the\r\n    Fuehrer’s deputy, Bormann, requesting that the ‘Jewish Question\r\n    be now, once and for all, coordinated and solved one way or\r\n    another. And yesterday, once again did the Fuehrer request by\r\n    ‘phone for me to take coordinated action in the matter’.\r\n\r\n    “Since the problem is mainly an economic one, it is from an\r\n    economic angle that it shall have to be tackled. Naturally a\r\n    number of legal measures shall have to be taken which fall into\r\n    the sphere of the Minister for Justice and into that of the\r\n    Minister of the Interior; and certain propaganda measures shall\r\n    have to be taken care of by the office of the Minister for\r\n    Propaganda. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for\r\n    Economic Affairs shall take care of problems falling into their\r\n    respective resorts.” (_1816-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering then said that it was not sufficient to have demonstrations and\r\nto burn down Jewish property. In such cases the real loss usually fell\r\non German insurance companies. He continued:\r\n\r\n    “I should not want to leave any doubt, gentlemen, as to the aim\r\n    of today’s meeting. We have not come together merely to talk\r\n    again but to make decisions, and I implore the competent\r\n    agencies to take all measures for elimination of the Jews from\r\n    German economy and to submit them to me, as far as it is\r\n    necessary.\r\n\r\n    “The fundamental idea in this program of elimination of the Jew\r\n    from German economy, is first, the Jew being ejected from the\r\n    economy transfers his property to the State. He will be\r\n    compensated. The compensation is to be listed in the debit\r\n    ledger and shall bring a certain percentage of interest. The Jew\r\n    shall have to live out of this interest. It is a foregone\r\n    conclusion, that this aryanizing, if it is to be done quickly,\r\n    cannot be made in the Ministry for Economy in Berlin. That way,\r\n    we would never finish * * *.\r\n\r\n    “It is my lot, so that the damage will not be greater than the\r\n    profit, which we are striving for.\r\n\r\n    “It is obvious, gentlemen, that the Jewish stores are for the\r\n    people, and not the stores. Therefore, we must begin here,\r\n    according to the rules previously laid down.\r\n\r\n    “The Minister for Economic Affairs shall announce which stores\r\n    he’ll want to close altogether. These stores are excluded from\r\n    aryanizing at once. Their stocks are to be made available for\r\n    sale in other stores; what cannot be sold, shall be processed\r\n    through the “Winterhilfe” or taken care of otherwise. However,\r\n    the sales values of these articles shall always be considered,\r\n    since the State is not to suffer but should profit through this\r\n    transformation. For the Chain and Department stores—I speak now\r\n    only of that, which can be seen, certain categories have to be\r\n    established, according to the importance of the various\r\n    branches.\r\n\r\n    “The trustee of the State will estimate the value of the\r\n    property and decide what amount the Jew shall receive.\r\n    Naturally, this amount is to be set as low as possible. The\r\n    representative of the State shall then turn the establishment\r\n    over to the “Arian” proprietor, that is, the property shall be\r\n    sold according to its real value.\r\n\r\n    “There begins the difficulties. It is easily understood that\r\n    strong attempt will be made to get all these stores to Party\r\n    members and to let them have some kind of compensations. I have\r\n    witnessed terrible things in the past; little chauffeurs of\r\n    Gauleiters have profited so much by these transactions that they\r\n    have now about half a million. You, gentlemen, know it. Is that\r\n    correct?” (_1816-PS_)\r\n\r\nSpecific measures to effect the “Arianization” of Jewish businesses were\r\nthen discussed. A representative of German insurance companies was\r\ncalled in to assist in solving the difficulties created by the fact that\r\nmost of the Jewish stores and other property destroyed in the rioting\r\nwere in fact insured, in some cases ultimately by foreign insurance\r\ncompanies. All present were agreed that it would be unfortunate to pass\r\na law which would have the effect of allowing foreign insurance\r\ncompanies to escape from liability, and that moreover, so far as the\r\ninsurance companies were concerned, they had made a bargain and should\r\nstand by it. The defendant Goering then suggested a solution:\r\n\r\n    “Goering: No. I don’t even dream of refunding the insurance\r\n    companies the money. The companies are liable. No, the money\r\n    belongs to the State. That’s quite clear. That would indeed be a\r\n    present for the insurance companies. You make a wonderful\r\n    Petidum there. You’ll fulfill your obligations, you may count on\r\n    that.” (_1816-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here to quote further from the extensive discussion of\r\nall phases of persecution of the Jews which took place at this meeting.\r\nIt is sufficient to point out that on the same day Goering, over his own\r\nsignature, promulgated three decrees putting into effect the most\r\nimportant matters decided at the meeting. In the first of these decrees,\r\na collective fine of 1,000,000,000 RM was placed on all German Jews\r\n(_1412-PS_). The second decree, entitled “A Decree on Elimination of\r\nJews from German Economic Life”, barred Jews from trades and crafts\r\n(_2875-PS_). The third decree took care of the insurance question raised\r\nin the morning’s meeting, by providing that insurance due to Jews for\r\nvarious losses sustained by them was to be collected by the State.\r\n\r\nFor other examples, the energetic manner in which Goering took part in\r\ndriving the Jews from economic life at this period, see: _069-PS_;\r\n_1208-PS_.\r\n\r\nAs the German armies moved into other countries, the anti-Jewish laws\r\nwere extended, often in a more stringent form, to the occupied\r\nterritories. Many of the decrees were not signed by Goering himself, but\r\nwere issued on the basis of decrees signed by Goering and introducing\r\nthe Four-Year Plan in the occupied territories. For example, reference\r\nis made to the:\r\n\r\n    Order Concerning the Introduction of the Four-Year Plan in the\r\n    Eastern Territories, 30 October 1939. 1939 Reichsgesetzblatt,\r\n    Part I, p. 2125.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in his capacity as Commissioner of the Four-Year Plan, or\r\nas Chairman of the Ministerial Council for National Defense, Goering\r\nhimself signed several anti-Jewish decrees for occupied territories,\r\nincluding the following:\r\n\r\n    1939 Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 1703, Verordnung ueber die\r\n    Ammeldung der Vermoegens von Juden in den sudetendeutschen\r\n    Gebieten, 2 December 1938 (Order concerning the registration of\r\n    the property of Jews in the Sudeten German territories), which\r\n    was the preliminary for sequestration of such property,\r\n\r\n    1939 Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 702, Verordnung ueber die\r\n    Einfuehrung der Luftschutzgesetzes in den sudetendeutschen\r\n    Gebieten, 31 March 1939 (Order concerning the introduction of\r\n    the Air Defense Law in the Sudeten German territories),\r\n    discriminating against Jews,\r\n\r\n    1940 Reichsgesetzblatt, I, p. 1270, Verordnung ueber die\r\n    Behandlung von Vermoegen der Angehoerigen des ehemaligen\r\n    polnischen Staates, 17 September 1940 (Order concerning\r\n    treatment of property of nationals of the former Polish State),\r\n    by which the property of Polish Jews was confiscated,\r\n\r\n    1940 Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 1547, Kriegsachschaeden Verordnung\r\n    (War Damages Law), 30 November 1940, also discriminating against\r\n    Jews, and\r\n\r\n    1941 Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 759, Decree regarding\r\n    Administration of Criminal Law against Poles and Jews in the\r\n    Incorporated Eastern Territories, 4 December 1941, which\r\n    introduced especially stringent penal laws for Jews.\r\n\r\nDuring the later years of the war, the program of the Nazi conspirators\r\nfor the complete physical annihilation of all Jews in Europe achieved\r\nits full fury. While the execution of this program was for the most part\r\nhandled by the SS and the Security Police, Goering remains implicated in\r\nthe final phases of the Nazi “Solution” of the Jewish problem. On 31\r\nJuly 1941, he wrote the following letter to the conspirator Heydrich:\r\n\r\n    “Complementing the task that was assigned to you on 24 January\r\n    1939, which dealt with arriving at—through furtherance of\r\n    emigration and evacuation, a solution of the Jewish problem, as\r\n    advantageous as possible, I hereby charge you with making all\r\n    necessary preparations in regard to organizational and financial\r\n    matters for bringing about a complete solution of the Jewish\r\n    question in the German sphere of influence in Europe.\r\n\r\n    “Wherever other governmental agencies are involved, these are to\r\n    cooperate with you.\r\n\r\n    “I charge you furthermore to send me, before long, an overall\r\n    plan concerning the organizational, factual and material\r\n    measures necessary for the accomplishment of the desired\r\n    solution of the Jewish question.” (_710-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n   LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO HERMANN WILHELM\r\n                                GOERING\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       6\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 57\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

C. to Hitler, 1925-1932 (_3192-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_j_) Head of the Central Political Committee of the N.S.D.A.P.,\r\nappointed 15 December 1932 (_3132-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_k_) _Reichsleiter_ of the N.S.D.A.P. (Member of the Party Directorate)\r\n(_3198-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_l_) Member of the Reichs Defense Council (_2261-PS_).\r\n\r\n      B. _PROMOTION OF THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS’ ACCESSION TO POWER._\r\n\r\nThe Nazi Party was the conspiracy’s main instrument of control. As its\r\ndirecting head, Hess used this instrument vigorously to advance the\r\npurposes of the conspiracy. He thus played a decisive part in the\r\npreparation and execution of its criminal designs.\r\n\r\nHess began his conspiratorial activities immediately upon the\r\ntermination of World War I by joining militaristic and nationalistic\r\norganizations. He became a member of the Thule Society and of the Free\r\nCorps Epp. In June 1920 he joined the Nazi Party, receiving membership\r\ncard No. 16 (_3191-PS_; _3347-PS_).\r\n\r\nBy 1923 Hess was an SA leader and head of the Nazi University\r\nOrganization in Munich. He took part in the Nazi Putsch of 8-9 November\r\n1923. As a result he was tried and convicted on a charge of high treason\r\n(_3132-PS_). He spent 7½ months of his 18 months’ sentence with Hitler\r\nat the Landsberg Fortress (_3191-PS_). There Hitler dictated _Mein\r\nKampf_ to him (_3132-PS_).\r\n\r\nAfter their release, Hess remained extremely close to Hitler. In 1925,\r\nhe became officially his private secretary and A. d. C. (_3192-PS_).\r\n\r\nDuring the Party crisis which resulted from the sudden resignation of\r\nGregor Strasser, head of the Party’s Political Organization, in December\r\n1932, Hitler called on Hess to take charge of the newly formed Central\r\nPolitical Committee of the Party, in order to restore its strength and\r\nunity (_3132-PS_).\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, Hess took part in the decisive negotiations which\r\nbrought the Nazi conspirators into power on 30 January 1933 (_3132-PS_).\r\n\r\n        C. _ESTABLISHMENT OF TOTALITARIAN CONTROL OVER GERMANY._\r\n\r\nUpon the conspirators’ accession to power, Hess was appointed Deputy to\r\nthe Fuehrer of the NSDAP (_3196-PS_). His broad powers and\r\nresponsibilities in that position were officially described as follows:\r\n\r\n    “All the threads of the Party work are gathered together by the\r\n    Deputy of the Fuehrer. He gives the final word on all\r\n    intra-Party plans and all questions vital for the existence of\r\n    the German people. The Deputy of the Fuehrer gives the\r\n    directives required for all the Party work, in order to maintain\r\n    the unity, determination and striking power of the N.S.D.A.P. as\r\n    the bearer of the National-Socialist philosophy.” (_3163-PS_;\r\n    _Chart Number 15_).\r\n\r\nThrough Hess the Conspirators established the control of the Party over\r\nthe State. As a first step he obtained a seat in the Cabinet, which had\r\nin effect become the sole legislative organ of the Reich (_2001-PS_;\r\n_2426-PS_; _1395-PS_). As a Cabinet Minister, Hess signed the laws which\r\nfurther strengthened the political power of the Nazi Party. Among these\r\nenactments were the law of 1 August 1944 consolidating the positions of\r\nChief of State and Leader of the Party (_2003-PS_); and the law of 20\r\nDecember 1934 against treacherous attacks on Party and State\r\n(_1393-PS_).\r\n\r\nThrough a long series of decrees Hess obtained control over every aspect\r\nof public and private life in Germany, in order to subvert it to the\r\naims of the conspiracy, as represented by the Party.\r\n\r\n(1) _Hess gained control over all legislation._\r\n\r\nA Hitler Decree of 27 July 1934 provided for Hess’s participation in the\r\ndrafting of all legislation (_D-138_). In a circular to Cabinet members\r\non 9 October 1939, Hess stated that he would in the future veto every\r\nbill which reached him too late to allow him enough time for its\r\nthorough study from the Party point of view (_D-139_). A letter from\r\nChief of the Reich Chancellery Lammers, on 12 April 1938, announced a\r\nsupplementary decree extending Hess’s participation, especially with\r\nregard to the drafting of laws affecting individual States (_D-140_; see\r\n_1942-PS_).\r\n\r\n(2) _Hess gained control over all government appointments, including\r\nthose of the judiciary and university teachers._\r\n\r\nA decree of 24 September 1935 provided for the consultation of Hess in\r\nthe appointment of Reich and State civil servants (_3180-PS_). A decree\r\nof 10 July 1937 provided for the participation of the Fuehrer’s Deputy\r\nin the appointment of Reich and State civil servants (_3184-PS)_. A\r\ndecree of 14 October 1936, signed by Hess, regulated the status of Reich\r\nand State civil servants (_3183-PS_). A further decree of 3 April 1936\r\nprovided for Hess’s participation in the appointment of Labor Service\r\nofficials (_3182-PS_).\r\n\r\n(3) _Hess gained control over Local Government Administration._\r\n\r\nThis control was effected through the German Municipality Act of 30\r\nJanuary 1935 provided for the participation of Party delegates\r\n(_2008-PS_).\r\n\r\n(4) _Hess gained control over the administration of annexed\r\nterritories._\r\n\r\nThus, the Ordinance of 10 June 1939 provided for Hess’s participation in\r\nthe administration of Austria (_Reichsgesetzblatt_ 1939, Part I, p. 995)\r\nwhile another Ordinance of the same date provided for Hess’s\r\nparticipation in the administration of the Sudetenland\r\n(_Reichsgesetzblatt_ 1939, Part I, p. 997).\r\n\r\n(5) _Hess, in his capacity as Deputy Leader of the Party, gained control\r\nover the German Youth._\r\n\r\nAn order of 10 July 1934 set up a University Commission of the NSDAP\r\nunder Hess; an Order of 18 July 1934 placed the NS German Student League\r\ndirectly under Hess; and an Order of 14 November 1934 delegated to the\r\nStudent League exclusive jurisdiction over the political and ideological\r\neducation of German students (_3132-PS_). A Hess Decree of 3 June 1936\r\nestablished the NS Aid Fund for the Struggle in the Universities\r\n(_3203-PS_; see also _3132-PS_ and _1392-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe success of this entire program of legislation was described by\r\nHitler as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In this Reich everybody who has a responsible position is a\r\n    National Socialist * * * Every institution of this Reich is\r\n    under the orders of the supreme political leadership * * * The\r\n    Party leads the Reich (_2715-P_S; see _1774-PS_ and _3163-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn order to enable the conspirators to buttress their power through the\r\narmed terror of the SA and SS, Hess, while not actually in control of\r\nthese Party formations, nevertheless gave them active support. Thus, he\r\nwas instrumental in establishing the Hitler Grant (a large fund\r\ncontributed annually by heavy German industry under the chairmanship of\r\nKrupp) and in directing part thereof to the support of the SA and SS\r\n(_D-151_).\r\n\r\nWhen several SA men were convicted for mistreatment of inmates of the\r\nHohnstein concentration camp, two members of the jury which had voted\r\nthe conviction were expelled from the party (_784-PS_).\r\n\r\nFinally, when Himmler, Reich Leader of the SS, organized the SD, Hess\r\nissued an order establishing the SD as the sole political information\r\nservice of the Nazi Party, its functions to be exercised through the SS\r\n(_3385-PS_).\r\n\r\nHess also sought to destroy the influence of the independent churches\r\namong the German people, in order to wipe out every opposition to the\r\naims of the conspirators. Thus, Hess’s Chief of Staff, Bormann, issued\r\nnumerous orders and communications from Hess’s office against the\r\nindependent churches. Among these were the Secret Order of 27 July 1938\r\nmaking clergymen ineligible for party offices (_113-PS_); the Party\r\nDirective of 14 July 1939 making the clergy and theology students\r\nineligible for Party membership (_840-PS_); the letter of 22 February\r\n1940 discussing ways and means of eliminating religious instruction from\r\nthe schools (_098-PS_); the report of 25 April on the progressive\r\nsubstitution of National Socialist mottoes in place of morning prayers\r\nin the schools (_070-PS_); the letter to Rosenberg of 17 January 1940\r\nconcerning the undesirability of religious literature for members of the\r\n_Wehrmacht_ (_101-PS_); the instructions of 8 March 1940 against the\r\nfurther issuance of newsprint to confessional newspapers (_089-PS_); and\r\nthe letter to the Minister of the Interior, in May 1938, agreeing to the\r\ninvalidation of the Concordat between Austria and the Holy See\r\n(_675-PS_; _838-PS_ and _107-PS_).\r\n\r\n                       D. _PREPARATION FOR WAR._\r\n\r\nHess was one of the members of the conspiracy who professed as early as\r\n1933 the aim of complete world domination (_2385-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of that aim Hess threw the power of the Party which he\r\ndirected, behind the war preparations of the conspiracy. Hess himself\r\ndescribed the Party, in this connection, as the mechanism with which to\r\n“organize and direct offensively and defensively the spiritual and\r\npolitical strength of the people” (_2426-PS_).\r\n\r\nHess’s tasks in the preparations for aggressive wars fell mainly into\r\nthe fields of military preparedness, political planning, and\r\nfifth-column activities.\r\n\r\n(1) _Rearmament._ Even before 1933 Hess took a personal interest in the\r\nsecret military training program of the uniformed Party organizations\r\n(_1143-PS_).\r\n\r\nAfter the conspirators had come to power, Hess was one of those who\r\nechoed the cry of “guns for butter” in his speeches (_2426-PS_).\r\n\r\nHess signed the law which reintroduced universal military conscription\r\nin Germany on 16 March 1935 (_1654-PS_). Hess admitted that signing this\r\nlaw was no mere formality for him, but rather the realization of one of\r\nhis most important aims, when he declared in a speech to Army officers\r\nin 1937:\r\n\r\n    “When I spoke about conscription after the 16th of March 1935,\r\n    in what used to be the most radical industrial plant of Munich *\r\n    * * to thousands and thousands of the same workers who but a few\r\n    years before had been singing the Internationale, I was\r\n    interrupted again and again by such applause and cheers as I\r\n    would never have believed possible. That was the most beautiful\r\n    and at the same time the most moving demonstration of my life\r\n    (_3124-PS_).\r\n\r\nWhen the Nazi conspirators were ready to launch their aggressive wars in\r\nthe fall of 1938, Hess and the Party agencies under his control\r\ncooperated with the Army High Command in the mobilization of the German\r\nArmy (_388-PS, Item 32_).\r\n\r\n(2) _Political Planning for War._ When the Reich Defense Council was\r\nreorganized in September 1938, Hess became one of its members with the\r\nexpress assignment of assuring “the political direction of the nation”\r\n(_2261-PS_).\r\n\r\nHess was also made a member of the Ministers’ Council for the Defense of\r\nthe Reich upon its creation in 1939. Here he continued to exercise an\r\nimportant war-planning function with the specific task of “guaranteeing\r\nthe unity between Party and State” within that body (_2018-PS_;\r\n_2608-PS_).\r\n\r\nHess’s functions in the field of political planning for war were not\r\nlimited to the domestic sphere. He was also a member of the Secret\r\nCabinet Council formed to advise Hitler on foreign policy planning\r\n(_1377-PS_; _3189-PS_).\r\n\r\n(3) _Fifth Column Activities._ Hess’ most important contribution to the\r\nconspirators’ preparations for aggressive war lay in his organization of\r\nthe German fifth-columns abroad through the Foreign Organization\r\n(_Auslands Organisation_ (AO)) of the Nazi Party and its various\r\naffiliated semi-official organizations. Through these channels Hess\r\nsucceeded in building up conspiratorial shock-troops in foreign\r\ncountries, composed of citizens of these countries who were of German\r\n“racial stock.” These foreign citizens were incited by Hess to acts of\r\ntreason against their country in furtherance of the plans of the\r\nconspiracy. It was the subversive activities of these fifth-column\r\ngroups which prepared the way for the conspirators’ destruction of\r\nindependence of many countries. Principal among these were Austria,\r\nCzechoslovakia, and Poland.\r\n\r\nAs his chief instrument in this conspiratorial campaign Hess created the\r\nForeign Organization of the Nazi Party on 3 October 1933. This office\r\nwas placed directly under Hess, who from then on was known to take the\r\ngreatest personal interest in its rapid development and expansion\r\n(_3258-PS_; _3401-PS_; _3254-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Organization extended its activities not only to German\r\ncitizens living abroad but to all persons allegedly of German ancestry\r\nregardless of their foreign citizenship. In the early years after the\r\nconspirators’ rise to power and up to 1937 this aim was openly admitted\r\nby the responsible heads of the Foreign Organization (_3258-PS_).\r\n\r\nHess announced that it was the task of the Foreign Organization to\r\norganize all persons of the German race who lived abroad and to turn\r\nthem into active Nazi supporters, thus making them subservient to the\r\npurposes of the conspiracy. In his speech at the 1937 Congress of the\r\nForeign Organization, Hess declared:\r\n\r\n    “You stand before me as a slice of the great German racial\r\n    community, the racial community which extends beyond the borders\r\n    of our Reich, for National Socialism has not only at home\r\n    created a national community transcending all classes and groups\r\n    in a way previously unknown, but it has also included German\r\n    racial comrades [_Volks-Genossen_] in foreign countries. It has\r\n    made them conscious and proud members of this racial community!\r\n    * * *\r\n\r\n    “Under the leadership of the Foreign Organization, Germandom\r\n    abroad is also becoming more and more _filled with the National\r\n    Socialist spirit_. The Foreign Organization, of the NSDAP has\r\n    brought together the Germans out there, who even long after the\r\n    seizure of power were disunited and split by class differences,\r\n    and joined them with Adolf Hitler’s Reich. The National\r\n    Socialist care for Germandom abroad is maintaining an enormous\r\n    number of Germans for the nation, who otherwise would be\r\n    absorbed as cultural fertilizer for other nations” (_3258-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe same principle was expressed bluntly by Gauleiter Ernst Bohle, head\r\nof the Foreign Organization of the NSDAP directly under Hess from 1933\r\nto 1945, who stated in his address at the Nurnberg Party Congress of\r\n1936:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer had to come in order to hammer into all of us the\r\n    fact that the German cannot choose and may not choose whether or\r\n    not he will be German but that he was sent into this world by\r\n    God as a German, that God thereby had laid upon him as a German\r\n    duties of which he cannot divest himself without committing\r\n    treason to Providence. _Therefore we believe and we know that\r\n    the German everywhere_ is a _German_—whether he lives in the\r\n    Reich or in Japan, in France or in China or anywhere else in the\r\n    world. _Not countries or continents, not climate or environments\r\n    but blood and race determine the world of ideas of the German._”\r\n    (_3258-PS_).\r\n\r\nHess was also in control of all other semi-official organizations\r\nassociated with the Foreign Organization in fifth-column work among\r\nforeign citizens of German ancestry, for the purpose of gaining foreign\r\nsupport for the conspiracy. Thus, by a Secret Circular of 3 February\r\n1939, Hess ordered the consolidation of the undercover activities of all\r\norganizations active in the foreign field, subject to the central\r\ndirection of SS Gruppenfuehrer Werner Lorenz, head of the\r\n_Volks-deutsche Mittelstelle_ (Central Agency for Racial Germans)\r\n(_837-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe two most important of these semi-official agencies were the VDA\r\n(League for Germandom Abroad) and the DAI (German Foreign Institute).\r\nThe VDA was a vast world-wide organization giving financial support to\r\nvarious activities of German groups abroad without regard to their\r\nnationality. Its large funds were collected in Germany with the aid of\r\nthe Nazi Government (_3258-PS_). The aim of the activities of the VDA\r\nwas to establish a great German world empire of 100,000,000 inhabitants,\r\ncontaining all persons of German “racial stock” everywhere, including\r\nmillions of American citizens (_3258-PS_). The DAI was a world-wide\r\ninformation intelligence and propaganda service (_3258-PS_).\r\n\r\nHess repeatedly stressed the importance of using Germans abroad for\r\nspreading Nazi propaganda (_3124-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe DAI also based its activities on the proposition that all persons of\r\nGerman ancestry belonged to the Nazi German Reich, though they held\r\ncitizenship in foreign countries. This was stated by Nazi\r\nMinister-President Mergenthaler of Wuerttemberg in his address at the\r\n1933 annual meeting of the DAI:\r\n\r\n    “The liberalist ideology which has been overcome dealt with the\r\n    formal concept of the citizen. We have gotten rid of that. Today\r\n    the blood-united German racial comrade stands in the center.\r\n    That is the new foundation upon which we must build * * *. Hence\r\n    I want to impress on the DAI: Join us therefore in taking care\r\n    that the spirit of National Socialism also becomes alive among\r\n    the German racial comrades in foreign countries so that streams\r\n    of energy may emanate from it.” (_3258-PS_).\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting held by the DAI in 1937, Frick restated in his\r\naddress the fundamental aim of this organization: to unite every person\r\nof German “racial stock” under the control of the Nazi conspirators.\r\n\r\n    “* * * the new Germany has recognized that its attention and\r\n    devotion to the welfare of the millions of Germans who have not\r\n    the fortune to owe political allegiance to Germany, but who are\r\n    condemned to live abroad, are not merely a matter of natural\r\n    sympathy and solidarity but are in a higher degree dictated by\r\n    the strong political and economic interests of the Reich.”\r\n    (_3258-PS_).\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the DAI was closely affiliated with the\r\nGerman-American Bund, a subversive Nazi organization in the United\r\nStates. The DAI’s official periodical, “Germandom Abroad” (_Deutschtum\r\nim Ausland_), was edited during the war by Walter Kappe, former press\r\nchief of the Bund (_3258-PS_). Walter Kappe and Fritz Gissibl, another\r\nformer leader in the Bund, established on the premises of the DAI in\r\nStuttgart an organization called “Comradeship U. S. A.” The purpose of\r\nthis “Comradeship U. S. A.” was to maintain during the war an\r\norganization for all Nazi Party members who had been active in the Bund\r\nin the United States (_3258-PS_). Even before the outbreak of the war,\r\nin the spring of 1939, Walter Kappe had undertaken to collect a complete\r\narchive of Nazi activities in the U. S. on behalf of the DAI and the\r\nNazi Party (_3258-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe success of this world-wide fifth column directed by Hess is now a\r\nmatter of historical record. Hess himself guided the subversive foreign\r\ngroups which he had created until the day when the conspirators were\r\nready to annex the countries which they had undermined.\r\n\r\nThus, the annexation of Austria was principally due to the efforts of\r\nthe Nazi Party’s work within that country under the orders of Hess. As\r\nearly as 1934 Hess had appointed Reinthaler leader of the Nazi peasants\r\nin Austria, and thus placed him in a position to take over the\r\nleadership of the Nazi Fifth Column in Austria (_812-PS_). Hess took a\r\nmajor part in the negotiations carried on by Seyss-Inquart and other\r\nmembers of the conspiracy in preparation of the Anschluss (_3254-PS_;\r\n_3425-PS_). When on 12 March 1938 Germany invaded Austria, Hess,\r\naccompanied by Himmler, was the first member of the conspiracy to arrive\r\nin Vienna at noon on the same day (_L-292_). The next day Hess signed\r\nthe decree by which the conspirators destroyed the independence of\r\nAustria (_2307-PS_; _3075-PS_).\r\n\r\nOnce the conspirators had achieved their aim, Hess did not hesitate to\r\nadmit publicly that he had approved of the steps which led to the final\r\nsubjection of Austria. On 24 July 1938 he addressed a meeting held on\r\nthe fourth anniversary of the assassination of Austrian Chancellor\r\nDollfuss by members of the 89th SS Regiment. He devoted the larger part\r\nof his speech to a justification of that assassination (_L-273_).\r\n\r\nWhen the conspirators turned their attention to their next victim,\r\nCzechoslovakia, Hess was again in the forefront directing the German\r\nfifth-column in the Sudetenland. In his speech at the annual meeting of\r\nthe Foreign Organization of the NSDAP on 28 August 1938, Hess declared\r\nthat Nazi Germany was giving full backing to the demands of the Sudeten\r\nGerman agitators. What such support meant in fact became very clear when\r\nHess pointed to the success of the Nazi policy in Austria (_3258-PS_).\r\nAll through the summer of 1938 Hess was engaged in consultations with\r\nKarl H. Frank and Konrad Henlein, leaders of the Nazi Sudeten German\r\nParty (_3061-PS_).\r\n\r\nA few months later Hess could mark up another success for his\r\nfifth-column. When the Munich Agreement forced Czechoslovakia to\r\nsurrender the Sudeten territory to Germany, Hess went to Reichenberg,\r\nthe capital of that district, as Hitler’s representative in order to\r\naccept the official incorporation of the Sudeten German Party into the\r\nNazi Party on 5 November 1938. In his address on that occasion he\r\nemphasized repeatedly that the Nazi conspirators had been ready to go to\r\nwar for the possession of the Sudetenland (_3204-PS_).\r\n\r\nHess also put his signature to the Act of 14 April 1939 setting up the\r\ngovernment of the Sudetenland as an integral part of the Reich\r\n(_3076-PS_).\r\n\r\nLater during the same year, after the conspirators had loosed their\r\nfirst aggressive war, Hess signed the laws incorporating first Danzig\r\nand then a large portion of Poland into the Reich (_3077-PS_; see also\r\nDecree 8 October 1939 (RGBl 1939, Part I, p. 2042); Decree of 12 October\r\n1939, Part I, p. 2077).\r\n\r\nWhen in July 1941 the Nazi conspirators occupied Greece, the members of\r\nthe local Nazi Party were ready to take over as an auxiliary Army\r\nservice (_3258-PS_).\r\n\r\nThus, wherever the conspirators sent their invading armies Hess’\r\nfifth-column had prepared the soil.\r\n\r\n  E. _PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES\r\n                           AGAINST HUMANITY._\r\n\r\nHess, as Deputy Leader of the Nazi Party, had the task of realizing its\r\n“ideological” program (_3200-PS_).\r\n\r\nOne of the demands of this conspiratorial program was the destruction of\r\nso-called inferior racial stock. Persons who suffered from hereditary\r\ninsanity or other hereditary diseases were considered useless to the\r\nNazi community. They were therefore to be killed or at least to be\r\nprevented from procreating their kind.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out this plan Hess established a special Racial Policy\r\nDivision on his Staff under Dr. Walter Gross, by his order of 17\r\nNovember 1933. This Division was to “participate with the competent\r\ngovernment agencies in all race and population measures” (_3322-PS_;\r\n_3163-PS_). In addition, other agencies of the Nazi Party, under Hess,\r\nactively cooperated in the administration of this criminal program\r\n(_D-181_; _842-PS_; _1969-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn 1937 Hess publicly claimed credit for having used his Party\r\norganization in order to gain the nation’s approval for compulsory\r\nsterilization (_3124-PS_; _3067-PS_).\r\n\r\nMore important still in the Nazi program were the persecution and\r\nextermination of religious and racial minorities. Hess vigorously\r\npropagated the doctrine of the superiority of the German race with which\r\nthe conspirators sought to justify these persecutions (_3124-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe Nurnberg Laws, which constituted the legal basis of this campaign,\r\nwere the work of the Party. This was solemnly announced by Hitler in the\r\nperoration of the address in which he announced these laws to the\r\nReichstag in Nurnberg 15 September 1935:\r\n\r\n    “I now propose to the Reichstag the acceptance of those laws\r\n    which Party member Goering will read to you.\r\n\r\n    “The first and second laws fulfill the program of the National\r\n    Socialist Party in one important respect, and thereby pay a debt\r\n    of gratitude to the Movement under whose symbol Germany has\r\n    regained her freedom.\r\n\r\n    “The second law constitutes an attempt to solve by legislation a\r\n    problem, the final solution of which, if it should again fail,\r\n    will then have to be referred by law to the National Socialist\r\n    Party. All three laws are backed by the National Socialist Party\r\n    and with it and behind it by the German Nation.\r\n\r\n    “I ask you to accept these laws.” (_3419-PS_).\r\n\r\nHess, along with Frick, was placed in charge of the administration of\r\nthe Nurnberg Laws and of the issuance of ordnances and regulations\r\nthereunder (_1416-PS_; _3179-PS_; _1417-PS_; _2124-PS_).\r\n\r\nWith the launching of their aggressive wars, the Nazi conspirators\r\nembarked on the execution of their plan to exterminate the non-German\r\npopulations which fell into their hands. This plan, especially insofar\r\nas it concerned the Jews, had been bluntly revealed by Hitler well in\r\nadvance in his address to the Reichstag on 30 January 1939:\r\n\r\n    “If inter-national finance-Jewry inside and outside Europe\r\n    should succeed in throwing the nations into another _World War_,\r\n    the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth and thus\r\n    the victory of Jewry, but the _destruction of the Jewish race in\r\n    Europe_!” (_3418-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn support of this campaign, which was continued by his co-conspirators\r\nafter his flight to Scotland, Hess issued an order through his Party\r\nChancery on behalf of the SS, which had been put in charge of the\r\nextermination program. In this order, Hess demanded the support of all\r\nParty members for the recruiting drive of the SS Army Corps (Waffen SS).\r\nHess added that these SS formations were scheduled for service in the\r\nEastern occupied areas, where their “special training in race matters”\r\ncould be used to best advantage (_3245-PS_).\r\n\r\nBy a series of further legislative and administrative measures, Hess\r\nparticipated in the establishment of a special regime in Poland which\r\ndeprived the inhabitants of that country of their legal protection, and\r\nthus initiated their wholesale extermination (_R-139_; _R-96_; _R-141_).\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the same policy Hess signed the decree which forced\r\ncertain groups of Polish citizens to surrender their original national\r\nallegiance and to accept German citizenship (Decree of 24 October 1939,\r\nRGBl 1939, Part I, p. 2077).\r\n\r\nHess also signed the decree establishing the German Racial Register,\r\nunder which Allied nationals of German stock were registered and then\r\ncompelled to accept German nationality and to remove to German territory\r\n(_2917-PS_).\r\n\r\nHess also used Party channels in order to incite the German people to\r\nviolations of the rules of war. Thus, he ordered that the population be\r\ninstructed to seize Allied parachutists or to “liquidate them”\r\n(_062-PS_).\r\n\r\nHess also issued instructions to enforce Hitler’s orders prohibiting the\r\nreconstruction of the city of Warsaw or of any of Poland’s destroyed\r\nindustries (_EC-411_).\r\n\r\nOn 10 May 1941, Hess flew to Scotland for the purpose of seeking an end\r\nto the war with England, and support for Germany’s demands against\r\nRussia. Upon his arrival, he was incarcerated and thus forcibly\r\neliminated from further participation in the crimes of the conspiracy\r\n(_D-614_).\r\n\r\n                            F. _CONCLUSION._\r\n\r\nOf all the members of the Nazi conspiracy, Hess was closest to Hitler\r\nfrom the first. As Hitler’s secretary and A. d. C., as his Deputy, and\r\nfinally as his Second Successor Designate, Hess was at all times his\r\ndirect representative in all Party matters. Thus, the conspiracy’s most\r\npowerful instrument of political action rested in his hands.\r\n\r\nHess used this power to penetrate and dominate the German government\r\nadministration with National Socialist functionaries; to control\r\nlegislation and education; and to persecute all independent groups,\r\nespecially the churches and the Jews.\r\n\r\nBeing responsible for the political direction and control of the German\r\npeople, through the Party, Hess played a decisive role in preparing the\r\nnation for war. He furthered the secret rearmament of the Party’s\r\nmilitary formations; he signed the Conscription Law of 1935; he sat on\r\nthe Reichs Defense Council, the inner Cabinet in which the heads of the\r\nconspiracy blue-printed the administrative, economic, and political\r\npreparation of their aggressive wars.\r\n\r\nHess, above, all, was responsible for the creation and direction of the\r\nNazi fifth-column, in which foreign citizens of German extraction joined\r\nunder the Nazi banner to weaken and undermine those countries which the\r\nNazi conspirators had determined to subjugate.\r\n\r\nAll through the years from 1920 to 1941 Hess remained the most faithful\r\nand relentless executor of Hitler’s aims and designs. This complete\r\ndevotion to the success of the conspiracy was climaxed by his flight to\r\nScotland in an attempt to end the war with England and to receive\r\nEnglish support for Germany’s demands against Russia, which he had\r\nhelped to prepare.\r\n\r\nThe share of Hess’ participation in the Nazi conspiracy is as great as\r\nthat of the Party which he directed. The Party’s crimes are his.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n     LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO RUDOLF HESS\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 58\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

JOACHIM VON RIBBENTROP\r\n\r\n                   A. _POSITIONS HELD BY RIBBENTROP._\r\n\r\nAccording to Ribbentrop’s own certified statement (_2829-PS_), he became\r\na member of the Nazi Party in 1932, but according to the semi-official\r\nstatement in “_Das Archiv_,” he had gone to work for the Party before\r\nthat time by extending his business connections to political circles.\r\nHaving joined the service of the Party in 1930 at the time of the final\r\nstruggle for power in the Reich, “Ribbentrop played an important if not\r\nstrikingly obvious part in the bringing about of the decisive meetings\r\nbetween the representatives of the President of the Reich and the heads\r\nof the NSDAP, who had prepared the entry of Nazis into power on\r\n30-1-1933. Those meetings as well as those between Hitler and von Papen\r\ntook place in Ribbentrop’s house in Berlin Dahlen.” (_D-472_).\r\n\r\nRibbentrop was therefore present and active at the inception of the Nazi\r\nseizure of power. In that first period he was advisor to the Party on\r\nquestions of foreign affairs. His title was first, “Collaborator to the\r\nFuehrer on matters of Foreign Policy.” He later became Representative in\r\nMatters of Foreign Policy on the Staff of the Deputy.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by membership in the Nazi Reichstag in November 1933.\r\n\r\nOn 24 April 1934 after Germany had left the disarmament conference, he\r\nwas appointed Delegate of the Reich Government in matters of\r\nDisarmament. In this capacity he visited London and other foreign\r\ncapitals. He was then given a more important and imposing title, the\r\nGerman Minister Plenipotentiary at Large, and it was in that capacity\r\nthat he negotiated the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935.\r\n\r\nIn March 1936, after the Nazi Government had reoccupied the Rhineland\r\nzone, which had been demilitarized in accordance with the terms of the\r\nVersailles and Locarno Treaties, and the matter was brought before the\r\nCouncil of the League of Nations, Ribbentrop addressed the Council in\r\ndefense of Germany’s action.\r\n\r\nOn 11 August 1936 he was appointed Ambassador in London, and occupied\r\nthat position for a period of some eighteen months. His activities while\r\nholding that position are not highly relevant to the issues, but during\r\nthat period, in his capacity which he still had as German Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary at Large, he signed the original Anticomintern Pact with\r\nJapan in November 1936, and also the additional pact by which Italy\r\njoined it in 1937.\r\n\r\nFinally, on 24 February 1938, Ribbentrop was appointed Foreign Minister\r\nin place of von Neurath, and simultaneously was made a member of the\r\nSecret Cabinet Council (_Geheimer Kabinettsrat_) established by decree\r\nof Hitler of the same date (_1337-PS_).\r\n\r\nRibbentrop became an _Oberfuehrer_ in the SS, was subsequently promoted\r\nto SS _Gruppenfuehrer_ in 1938, and later became _Obergruppenfuehrer_.\r\nThere is no question of any honorary rank. The SS went into his ancestry\r\nin detail in order to deal with the law relating to that subject.\r\nRibbentrop was also permitted to adopt “von” as a prefix before his last\r\nname (_D-636_).\r\n\r\nThese activities of Ribbentrop in the earlier part of his career show in\r\nthemselves that he assisted willing and deliberately in bringing the\r\nNazis into power, and in the earlier stage of their obtaining control of\r\nthe German State.\r\n\r\n   B. _RIBBENTROP’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO LAUNCH AND WAGE WARS OF\r\n                              AGGRESSION._\r\n\r\n(1) _The Austrian Anschluss._ Ribbentrop was present at a meeting at\r\nBerchtesgaden on 12 February 1938, at which Hitler and von Papen met the\r\nAustrian Chancellor von Schuschnigg and his foreign minister, Guido\r\nSchmidt. The official German account of that interview is contained in\r\n_2461-PS_. What appears to be the truthful account of that interview is\r\ncontained in Jodl’s diary, the entries for 11 and 12 February 1938\r\n(_1780-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn 11 February Jodl wrote:\r\n\r\n    “In the evening, and on 12 February, General Keitel with General\r\n    von Reichenau and Sperrle at Obersalzburg. Schuschnigg, together\r\n    with R. G. Schmidt, are again being put under the heaviest\r\n    political and military pressure. At 2300 hours Schuschnigg signs\r\n    protocol.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe 13 February entry reads:\r\n\r\n    “In the afternoon, General Keitel asks Admiral Canaris and\r\n    myself to come to his apartment. He tells us that the Fuehrer’s\r\n    order is to the effect that military pressure by shamming\r\n    military action should be kept up until the 15th. Proposals for\r\n    these deceptive maneuvers are drafted and submitted to the\r\n    Fuehrer by telephone for approval.\r\n\r\n    “14 February:\r\n\r\n    “At 2:40 o’clock the agreement of the Fuehrer arrived. Canaris\r\n    went to Munich to the Counter-Intelligence Office VII and\r\n    initiates the different measures.\r\n\r\n    “The effect is quick and strong. In Austria the impression is\r\n    created that Germany is undertaking serious military\r\n    preparations.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe next step was the telephone conversation which took place between\r\nGoering and Ribbentrop on 13 March 1938, when Ribbentrop was still in\r\nLondon. Goering was passing on the false statement that there was no\r\nultimatum to Austria. The facts of the ultimatum were explained by the\r\nearlier telephone conversations between Goering and Vienna. But Goering\r\nthen passed the falsehood on to Ribbentrop in London in order that he\r\nmight placate and reassure political circles in London (_2949-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe third step was taken by Ribbentrop after his return from London.\r\nAlthough he had been appointed Foreign Minister in February, he had gone\r\nback to London to clear up his business at the embassy. Although he was\r\nstill in London until after the Anschluss had actually occurred, his\r\nname appears as a signatory of the law making Austria a province of the\r\nGerman Reich (_2307-PS_).\r\n\r\n(2) _Czechoslovakia._ Czechoslovakia furnishes a typical example of\r\naggression in its various aspects. To summarize the outstanding features\r\nbriefly: First, there was the necessity of stirring up trouble inside\r\nthe country against which aggression was planned.\r\n\r\nRibbentrop, as Foreign Minister, helped in the stirring up of the\r\nSudeten Germans under Henlein, who was in frequent contact with the\r\nGerman Foreign Office (_3060-PS_; _2789-PS_; _3059-PS_). These documents\r\ndemonstrate how the Foreign Office stirred up the Sudeten-German\r\nmovement so that it would act in accordance with the Government of the\r\nReich.\r\n\r\nLater on, Ribbentrop was present on 28 May 1938 at the conference at\r\nwhich Hitler gave instructions to prepare the attack on Czechoslovakia\r\n(_388-PS_; _2360-PS_). In a speech in January 1939 Hitler proclaimed\r\nthat aggression was to take place against Czechoslovakia (_2360-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “On the basis of this unbearable provocation, which was still\r\n    further emphasized by a truly infamous persecution and\r\n    terrorizing of our Germans there, I have now decided to solve\r\n    the Sudeten-German question in a final and radical manner.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “On 28 May I gave the order for the preparation of military\r\n    steps against this state, to be concluded by 2 October.”\r\n    (_2360-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe important point is that 28 May was the date when the _Fall Gruen_\r\nfor Czechoslovakia was the subject of orders, and that it was thereafter\r\nput into effect, to come to fruition at the beginning of October.\r\n\r\nThat was the second stage: To lay well in advance the plans of\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nThe third stage was to see that neighboring states were not likely to\r\ncause trouble. Hence, on 18 July 1938, Ribbentrop had a conversation\r\nwith the Italian Ambassador, Attolico, at which the attack on\r\nCzechoslovakia was discussed (_2800-PS_). Further discussions along the\r\nsame lines followed (_2791-PS_; _2792-PS_). The effect of these\r\ndocuments is, that it was made clear to the Italian Government that the\r\nGerman Government was going to move against Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nThe other interested country was Hungary, for Hungary had certain\r\nterritorial desires with regard to parts of the Czechoslovakian\r\nRepublic. Accordingly on 23 and 25 August Ribbentrop was present at the\r\ndiscussions and had discussions himself with the Hungarian politicians\r\nImredi and Kanya (_2796-PS_; _2797-PS_). These documents indicate that\r\nRibbentrop endeavored to get assurances of Hungarian help, and that the\r\nHungarian Government at the time was not too ready to commit itself to\r\naction, although it was ready enough with sympathy.\r\n\r\nContacts had been established with the Sudeten Germans, for theirs was\r\nthe long-term grievance that had to be exploited. But the next stage was\r\nto have a short-term grievance and to stir up trouble, preferably at the\r\nfountainhead. Therefore, between 16 and 24 September, the German Foreign\r\nOffice, of which Ribbentrop was the head, was engaged in stirring up\r\ntrouble in Prague (_2858-PS_; _2855-PS_; _2854-PS_; _2853-PS_; and\r\n_2856-PS_). An example of the type of these activities is the\r\ncommunication of 19 September from the Foreign Office to the German\r\nEmbassy in Prague (_2858-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “Please inform Deputy Kundt at Konrad Henlein’s request, to get\r\n    in touch with the Slovaks at once and induce them to start\r\n    _their_ demands _for_ autonomy tomorrow.” (_2858-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother of these documents deals with questions of arrest and the action\r\nto be taken against any Czechs in Germany in order to make the position\r\nmore difficult (_2855-PS_).\r\n\r\nThat was the contribution which Ribbentrop made to the pre-Munich\r\ncrisis, which culminated in the Munich agreement of 29 September 1938\r\n(_TC-23_).\r\n\r\nA significant aspect of Nazi plotting with regard to Czechoslovakia,\r\nwhich shows the sort of action and advice which the _Wehrmacht_ expected\r\nfrom the Foreign Office, is contained in a long document putting forward\r\nan almost infinite variety of breaches of International Law, which were\r\nlikely to arise or might have arisen from the action in regard to\r\nCzechoslovakia (_C-2_). On all these points the opinion of the Foreign\r\nOffice was sought, with a view to explanation and justification. That,\r\nof course, remained a hypothetical question because at that time no war\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nThe second stage of the acquisition of Czechoslovakia occurred when,\r\nhaving obtained the Sudetenland, the Nazis arranged a crisis in\r\nCzechoslovakia which would be an excuse for taking the rest. This action\r\nis important as constituting the first time that the German Government\r\ndisregarded its own commitment that its desires did not go beyond the\r\nreturn of German blood to the Reich. On that point, again, Ribbentrop\r\nwas active. On 13 March, as events were moving to a climax, he sent a\r\ntelegram to the German Minister in Prague, his subordinate, telling him\r\nto\r\n\r\n    “make a point of not being available if the Czech Government\r\n    wants to get in touch with you in the next few days.”\r\n    (_2815-PS_).\r\n\r\nAt the same time Ribbentrop attended a conference in Berlin with Hitler\r\nand a delegation of pro-Nazi Slovaks. Tiso, one of the heads of the\r\npro-Nazi Slovaks, was directed to declare an independent Slovak State in\r\norder to assist in the disintegration of Czechoslovakia (_2802-PS_). A\r\nprevious meeting along the same lines had been held a month before\r\n(_2790-PS_). Thus, Ribbentrop was assisting in the task, again, of\r\nfomenting internal trouble.\r\n\r\nOn 14 March 1939, the following day, Hacha, the President of\r\nCzechoslovakia, was called to Berlin. Ribbentrop was at this meeting, at\r\nwhich pressure and threats were used to obtain the aged President’s\r\nconsent to hand over the Czechoslovak State to Hitler (_2798-PS_;\r\n_3061-PS_).\r\n\r\nThat was the end of the Czech part of Czechoslovakia. The following week\r\nRibbentrop signed a treaty with Slovakia, Article II of which granted\r\nthe German Government the right to construct military posts and\r\ninstallations, and to keep them garrisoned within Slovakia (_1439-PS_).\r\nThus, after swallowing Bohemia and Moravia as an independent state,\r\nRibbentrop obtained military control over Slovakia.\r\n\r\n(3) _Lithuania._ An interesting point concerning the Northern Baltic\r\nshows how difficult it was for Ribbentrop to keep his hands out of the\r\ninternal affairs of other countries, even when it did not seem a very\r\nimportant matter. On 3 April 1939 Germany had occupied the Memeland\r\n(_TC-53-A_). It would have appeared, as far as the Baltic States were\r\nconcerned, that the position was satisfactory to the Nazis but in fact\r\nRibbentrop was acting in close concert with Heydrich, in stirring up\r\ntrouble in Lithuania with a group of pro-Nazi people called the\r\nWoldemaras Supporters (_2953-PS_; _2952-PS_). Heydrich was passing to\r\nRibbentrop a request for financial support for this group:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Party Comrade v. Ribbentrop,\r\n\r\n    “Enclosed please find a further report about the ‘Woldemaras\r\n    Supporters.’ As already mentioned in the previous report, the\r\n    ‘_Woldemaras Supporters’ are still asking for help from the\r\n    Reich._ I therefore ask you to examine the question of financial\r\n    support, brought up again by the ‘Woldemaras Supporters’ set\r\n    forth on page 4, para 2 of the enclosed report and to make a\r\n    definite decision.\r\n\r\n    “_The request of the ‘Woldemaras Supporters’ for financial\r\n    support could, in my opinion, be granted. Deliveries of arms\r\n    should not, however, be made, under any circumstances._”\r\n    (_2953-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt the end of a fuller report on the same matter (2952-PS) there is\r\nadded in handwriting,\r\n\r\n    “I support small regular payments, e.g. 2,000 to 3,000 marks\r\n    quarterly.” (_2952-PS_).\r\n\r\nIt is signed “W”, who was the Secretary of State. Such was the\r\nextraordinary interference, even with comparatively unimportant\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n(4) _Poland._ In the aggression against Poland, there were several\r\nperiods. The first was what might be called the Munich period, up to the\r\nend of September 1938, and at that time no language the Nazis could use\r\nwas too good for Poland. Examples of German assurances and reassurances\r\nto Poland during this period are Hitler’s Reichstag speech on 20\r\nFebruary 1938 (_2357-PS_), the secret Foreign Office memorandum of 26\r\nAugust 1938 (_TC-76_), and the conversation between M. Lipski, the\r\nPolish ambassador, and Ribbentrop (_TC-73, No. 40_). A final\r\nillustration of this technique is Hitler’s speech at the Sportzpalast on\r\n26 September 1938, in which he said that this was the end of his\r\nterritorial problems in Europe and expressed an almost violent affection\r\nfor the Poles (_TC-73, No. 42_).\r\n\r\nThe next stage occupied the period between Munich and the rape of\r\nPrague. With part of the German plan for Czechoslovakia having been\r\naccomplished and parts still remaining to be done, there was a slight\r\nchange towards Poland but still a friendly atmosphere. In a conversation\r\nwith M. Lipski, the Polish Ambassador to Berlin, on 24 October 1938,\r\nRibbentrop put forward very peaceful suggestions for the settlement of\r\nthe Danzig issue (_TC-73, No. 44_). The Polish reply, of 31 October\r\n1938, stated that it was unacceptable that Danzig should return to the\r\nReich, but made suggestions of a bilateral agreement (_TC-73, No. 45_).\r\nBetween these dates the German Government had made its preparations to\r\noccupy Danzig by surprise (_C-137_).\r\n\r\nBut although these preparations were made, still some two months later,\r\non 5 January 1939, Hitler was suggesting to M. Beck, the Polish Foreign\r\nMinister, a new solution (_TC-73, No. 48_).\r\n\r\nRibbentrop saw M. Beck on the next day and said that there was to be no\r\nviolent solution of the Danzig issue, but a further building up of\r\nfriendly relations (_TC-73, No. 49_). Not content with that, Ribbentrop\r\nwent to Warsaw on 25 January to talk of the continued progress and\r\nconsolidation of friendly relations (_2530-PS_). That was capped by\r\nHitler’s Reichstag speech on 30 January 1939, in the same tone (_TC-73,\r\nNo. 57_). That was the second stage—the mention of Danzig in honeyed\r\nwords, because the rape of Prague had not yet been attained.\r\n\r\nThen, in the meeting at the Reichschancellery on 23 May 1939, Hitler\r\nmade it quite clear, and so stated, that Danzig had nothing to do with\r\nthe real Polish question (_L-79_). “I have to deal with Poland because I\r\nwant _lebensraum_ in the East”—that is the effect of Hitler’s words at\r\nthat time: that Danzig was merely an excuse.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which Ribbentrop had adopted this attitude of mind of\r\nHitler at this time is shown in the introduction to Count Ciano’s Diary\r\n(_2987-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “In the Summer of 1939 Germany advanced her claim against\r\n    Poland, naturally without our knowledge; indeed, Ribbentrop had\r\n    several times denied to our Ambassador that Germany had any\r\n    intentions of carrying the controversy to extremes. Despite\r\n    these denials I remained in doubt; I wanted to make sure for\r\n    myself, and on August 11th I went to Salzburg. It was in his\r\n    residence at Fuschl that Ribbentrop informed me, while we were\r\n    waiting to sit down at the table, of the decision to start the\r\n    fireworks, just as he might have told me about the most\r\n    unimportant and commonplace administrative matter. ‘Well,\r\n    Ribbentrop,’ I asked him, while we were walking in the garden,\r\n    ‘What do you want? The Corridor, or Danzig?’ ‘Not any more’, and\r\n    he stared at me through those cold Musee Grevin eyes, ‘We want\r\n    war.’” (_2987-PS_).\r\n\r\nThat extraordinary declaration closely corroborates Hitler’s statement\r\nat his Chancellery conference on 23 May—that it was no longer a\r\nquestion of Danzig or the Corridor, but a question of war to achieve\r\n_lebensraum_ in the East (_L-79_).\r\n\r\nIt should be recalled in this connection that “_Fall Weiss_”, the plan\r\nfor operations against Poland, is dated 3 and 11 April 1939, thus\r\nshowing that preparations were already in hand (_C-120_). Another entry\r\nin Count Ciano’s Diary during the summer of 1939 makes this point quite\r\nclear:\r\n\r\n    “I have collected in the conference records verbal transcripts\r\n    of my conversations with Ribbentrop and Hitler. I shall only\r\n    note some impressions of a general nature. Ribbentrop is evasive\r\n    every time I ask him for particulars of the forthcoming German\r\n    action. He has a guilty conscience. He has lied too many times\r\n    about German intentions toward Poland not to feel embarrassment\r\n    now over what he must tell me and what he is preparing to do.\r\n\r\n    “The will to fight is unalterable. He rejects any solution which\r\n    might satisfy Germany and prevent the struggle. I am certain\r\n    that even if the Germans were given everything they demanded,\r\n    they would attack just the same, because they are possessed by\r\n    the demon of destruction.\r\n\r\n    “Our conversation sometimes takes a dramatic turn. I do not\r\n    hesitate to speak my mind in the most brutal manner. But this\r\n    doesn’t shake him in the least. I realize how little weight this\r\n    view carries in German opinion.\r\n\r\n    “The atmosphere is icy. And the cold feeling between us is\r\n    reflected in our followers. During dinner we do not exchange a\r\n    word. We distrust each other. But I at least have a clear\r\n    conscience. He has not.” (_2987-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe next stage in the German plan consisted of sharp pressure over the\r\nclaim for Danzig, commencing immediately after Czechoslovakia had been\r\nformally dealt with on 15 March 1939. The first sharp raising of the\r\nclaim was on 21 March (_TC-73, No. 61_).\r\n\r\nAn interesting sidelight during the last days before the war concerns\r\nthe return of Herr von Dirksen, the German Ambassador at the Court of\r\nSt. James, to Berlin on 18 August 1939. When interrogated (after\r\ncapture) regarding the significance of this event, Ribbentrop expressed\r\na complete absence of recollection of ever having seen the German\r\nAmbassador to England after his return. Ribbentrop thought he would have\r\nremembered him if he had seen him, and therefore he accepted the\r\nprobability that he did not see him (_D-490_). Thus when it was well\r\nknown that war with Poland would involve England and France, either\r\nRibbentrop was not sufficiently interested in opinion in London to take\r\nthe trouble to see his ambassador, or else, as he rather suggests, he\r\nhad appointed so weak and ordinary a career diplomat to London that his\r\nopinion was not taken into account, either by himself or by Hitler. In\r\neither case, Ribbentrop was completely uninterested in anything which\r\nhis Ambassador might have to tell him as to opinion in London or the\r\npossibility of war. It is putting the matter with great moderation to\r\nsay that in the last days before 1 September 1939, Ribbentrop did\r\nwhatever he could to avoid peace with Poland and to avoid anything which\r\nmight hinder the encouraging of the war which he and the Nazis wanted.\r\nHe did that, well knowing that war with Poland would involve Great\r\nBritain and France. (See also Section 8 of Chapter IX on Aggression\r\nAgainst Poland.)\r\n\r\nM. Lipski, the Polish Ambassador at Berlin, summarized all these events\r\nleading up to the war in his report of 10 October 1939 (_TC-73, No.\r\n147_).\r\n\r\n(5) _Norway and Denmark._ On 31 May 1939, Ribbentrop, on behalf of\r\nGermany, signed a non-aggression pact with Denmark which provided that:\r\n\r\n    “The German Reich and the Kingdom of Denmark will under no\r\n    circumstances go to war or employ force of any other kind\r\n    against one another.” (_TC-24_)\r\n\r\nAnd on 7 April 1940 the German armed forces invaded Denmark at the same\r\ntime they invaded Norway.\r\n\r\nRibbentrop was fully involved in the earlier preparations for the\r\naggression against Norway. Along with Rosenberg, Ribbentrop assisted\r\nQuisling in his early activities. A letter from Rosenberg to Ribbentrop\r\non 24 February states:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Party Comrade von Ribbentrop:\r\n\r\n    “Party Comrade Scheidt has returned and has made a detailed\r\n    report to Privy Councillor von Gruendherr who will address you\r\n    on this subject. We agreed the other day that 2-300,000 RM would\r\n    be made immediately available for the said purpose. Now it turns\r\n    out that Privy Councillor Gruendherr states that the second\r\n    instalment can be made available only after eight days. But as\r\n    it is necessary for Scheidt to go back immediately, I request\r\n    you to make it possible that this second instalment is given to\r\n    him at once. With a longer absence of _Reichsamtsleiter_ P. M.\r\n    Scheidt also the connection with your representatives would be\r\n    broken up, which just now, under certain circumstances, could be\r\n    very unfavorable.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore I trust that it is in everybody’s interest, if P. M.\r\n    Scheidt goes back immediately.” (_957-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a report to Hitler on the Quisling activities, Rosenberg outlined\r\nRibbentrop’s part in the preparation of the Norwegian operation:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Apart from financial support which was forthcoming from\r\n    the Reich in currency, Quisling had also been promised a\r\n    shipment of material for immediate use in Norway, such as coal\r\n    and sugar. Additional help was promised. These shipments were to\r\n    be conducted under cover of a new trade company, to be\r\n    established in Germany or through especially selected existing\r\n    firms, while Hagelin was to act as consignee in Norway. Hagelin\r\n    had already conferred with the respective Ministers of the\r\n    Nygaardsvold Government, as for instance, the Minister of Supply\r\n    and Commerce, and had been assured permission for the import of\r\n    coal. At the same time, the coal transports were to serve\r\n    possibly to supply the technical means necessary to launch\r\n    Quisling’s political action in Oslo with German help. It was\r\n    Quisling’s plan to send a number of selected, particularly\r\n    reliable men to Germany for a brief military training course in\r\n    a completely isolated camp. They were then to be detailed as\r\n    area and language specialists to German Special Troops, who were\r\n    to be taken to Oslo on the coal barges to accomplish a political\r\n    action. Thus Quisling planned to get hold of his leading\r\n    opponents in Norway, including the King, and to prevent all\r\n    military resistance from the very beginning. Immediately\r\n    following this political action and upon official request of\r\n    Quisling to the Government of the German Reich, the military\r\n    occupation of Norway was to take place. All military\r\n    preparations were to be completed previously. Though this plan\r\n    contained the great advantage of surprise, it also contained a\r\n    great number of dangers which could possibly cause its failure.\r\n    For this reason it received a quite dilatory treatment, while at\r\n    the same time, it was not disapproved as far as the Norwegians\r\n    were concerned.\r\n\r\n    “In February, after a conference with General Field Marshal\r\n    Goering, Reichsleiter Rosenberg informed the Secretary in the\r\n    Office of the Four Year Plan, only of the intention to prepare\r\n    coal shipments to Norway to the named confidant Hagelin. Further\r\n    details were discussed in a conference between Secretary\r\n    Wohlthat, Staff Director Schickedanz, and Hagelin. Since\r\n    Wohlthat received no further instructions from the General Field\r\n    Marshal, Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop—after a consultation\r\n    with Reichsleiter Rosenberg—consented to expedite these\r\n    shipments through his office. Based on a report of Reichsleiter\r\n    Rosenberg to the Fuehrer it was also arranged to pay Quisling\r\n    ten thousand English pounds per month for three months,\r\n    commencing on the 15 of March, to support his work”. (_004-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis sum was paid through Scheidt.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Ribbentrop dated 3 April 1940, Keitel wrote:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Herr von Ribbentrop:\r\n\r\n    “The military occupation of Denmark and Norway has been, by\r\n    command of the Fuehrer, long in preparation by the High Command\r\n    of the _Wehrmacht_. The High Command of the _Wehrmacht_ has\r\n    therefore had ample time to occupy itself with all the questions\r\n    connected with the carrying out of this operation. The time at\r\n    your disposal for the political preparation of this operation,\r\n    is on the contrary, very much shorter. I believe myself\r\n    therefore to be acting in accordance with your own ideas in\r\n    transmitting to you herewith, not only these wishes of the\r\n    _Wehrmacht_ which would have to be fulfilled by the Governments\r\n    in Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm for purely military reasons,\r\n    but also if I include a series of requests which certainly\r\n    concern the _Wehrmacht_ only indirectly but which are, however,\r\n    of the greatest importance for the fulfillment of its task * *\r\n    *.” (_D-629_)\r\n\r\nKeitel then proceeds to ask that the Foreign Office get in touch with\r\ncertain commanders. The important point is Keitel’s clear admission to\r\nRibbentrop that the military occupation of Denmark and Norway had been\r\nlong in preparation. It is interesting to connect this letter with the\r\nofficial Biography of Ribbentrop, in the Archives, which makes a point\r\nof mentioning the invasion of Norway and Denmark (_D-472_):\r\n\r\n    “With the occupation of Denmark and Norway on the 9 of April\r\n    1940, only a few hours before the landing of British troops in\r\n    these territories, the battle began against the Western Powers.”\r\n    (_D-472_)\r\n\r\nIt is clear that whoever else had knowledge or whoever else was\r\nignorant, Ribbentrop had been thoroughly involved in the Quisling\r\nplottings and knew at least a week before the invasion started that the\r\n_Wehrmacht_ and Keitel had been long in preparation for this act of\r\naggression. (See also Section 9 of Chapter IX on Aggression against\r\nNorway and Denmark.)\r\n\r\n(6) _The Low Countries: Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg._ The\r\nfacts as to the aggression against these countries, during the period\r\nwhen Ribbentrop was Foreign Minister, are discussed in Section 10 of\r\nChapter IX. Special attention should be called, however, to the\r\nstatement made by Ribbentrop 10 May 1940 to representatives of the\r\nforeign press with regard to the reasons for the German invasion of the\r\nLow Countries. These reasons demonstrated to be false in Section 10 of\r\nChapter IX on Aggression Against The Low Countries.\r\n\r\n(7) _Greece and Yugoslavia._ At a meeting in Salzburg in August 1939, at\r\nwhich von Ribbentrop participated, Hitler announced that the Axis had\r\ndecided to liquidate certain neutrals (_1871-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * Generally speaking, it would be best to liquidate the\r\n    pseudo-neutrals one after the other. This is fairly easily done,\r\n    if one Axis partner protects the rear of the other, who is just\r\n    finishing off one of the uncertain neutrals, and vice versa.\r\n    Italy may consider Yugoslavia such an uncertain neutral. At the\r\n    visit of Prince Regent Paul he [the Fuehrer] suggested,\r\n    particularly in consideration of Italy, that Prince Paul clarify\r\n    his political attitude towards the Axis by a gesture. He had\r\n    thought of a closer connection with the Axis and Yugoslavia’s\r\n    leaving the League of Nations. Prince Paul agreed to the latter.\r\n    Recently the Prince Regent was in London and sought reassurance\r\n    from the Western Powers. The same thing was repeated that\r\n    happened in the case of Gafencu, who was also very reasonable\r\n    during his visit to Germany and who denied any interest in the\r\n    aims of the western democracies. Afterwards it was learned that\r\n    he had later assumed a contrary standpoint in England. Among the\r\n    Balkan countries the Axis can completely rely only on Bulgaria,\r\n    which is in a sense a natural ally of Italy and Germany. * * *\r\n    At the moment when there would be a turn to the worse for\r\n    Germany and Italy, however, Yugoslavia would join the other side\r\n    openly, hoping thereby to give matters a final turn to the\r\n    disadvantage of the Axis.” (_1871-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat demonstrates the policy with regard to uncertain neutrals.\r\n\r\nThen, as early as September 1940 Ribbentrop reviewed the war situation\r\nwith Mussolini. Ribbentrop emphasized the heavy revenge bombing raids in\r\nEngland and the fact that London would soon be in ruins. It was agreed\r\nbetween the parties that only Italian interests were involved in Greece\r\nand Yugoslavia, and that Italy could count on German support. Ribbentrop\r\nwent on further to explain to Mussolini the Spanish plan for the attack\r\non Gibraltar and Germany’s participation therein. He added that he was\r\nexpecting to sign the Protocol with Spain, bringing the latter country\r\ninto the war, on his return to Berlin (_1842-PS_). Ribbentrop then gave\r\nMussolini a free hand with Greece and Yugoslavia:\r\n\r\n    “With regard to Greece and Yugoslavia, the Foreign Minister\r\n    stressed that it was exclusively a question of Italian\r\n    interests, the settling of which was a matter for Italy alone,\r\n    and in which Italy could be certain of Germany’s sympathetic\r\n    assistance.\r\n\r\n    “But it seemed to us to be better not to touch on these problems\r\n    for the time being, but to concentrate on the destruction of\r\n    England with all our forces instead. Where Germany was\r\n    concerned, she was interested in the northern German districts\r\n    (Norway, etc.), and this was acknowledged by the Duce.”\r\n    (_1842-PS_)\r\n\r\nSeveral months later, in January 1941, at the meeting between Hitler and\r\nMussolini in which Ribbentrop participated, the Greek operation was\r\ndiscussed. Hitler stated that the German troops in Rumania were for use\r\nin the planned campaign against Greece (_C-134_). Count Ciano, who\r\nattended that meeting as Italian Foreign Minister, recalls his\r\nimpression of that meeting in his diary entry for 20/21 January:\r\n\r\n    “The Duce is pleased with the conversation on the whole. I am\r\n    less pleased, particularly as Ribbentrop, who had always been so\r\n    boastful in the past, told me, when I asked him outright how\r\n    long the war would last, that he saw no possibility of its\r\n    ending before 1942.” (_2987-PS_)\r\n\r\nDespite that somewhat pessimistic statement to Count Ciano, three weeks\r\nlater, when it was a question of encouraging the Japanese to enter the\r\nwar, Ribbentrop took a more optimistic line. On 13 February 1941 he saw\r\nOshima, the Japanese Ambassador. In the course of their conversation\r\nRibbentrop gave an optimistic account of the military situation and the\r\nposition of Bulgaria and Turkey (_1834-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn the course of his efforts to get Yugoslavia to join the Axis,\r\nRibbentrop addressed a note, (_2450-PS_) on 25 March 1941, to Prime\r\nMinister Cvetkovitch, which contained this assurance:\r\n\r\n    “The Axis-Power Governments during this war will not direct a\r\n    demand to Yugoslavia to permit the march or transportation of\r\n    troops through the Yugoslav state or territory.” (_2450-PS_)\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, there occurred the coup d’etat in Yugoslavia, when\r\nGeneral Simovitch took over the Government. Two days after Ribbentrop’s\r\nassurance (_2450-PS_), at a meeting on 27 March 1941 at which Ribbentrop\r\nwas present, Hitler outlined the military campaign against Yugoslavia\r\nand promised the destruction of Yugoslavia and the demolition of\r\nBelgrade by the German Air Force (_1746-PS_).\r\n\r\nAfter the invasion of Yugoslavia Ribbentrop was one of the persons\r\ndirected by Hitler with the drawing of the boundaries for the partition\r\nand division of Yugoslavia. The preliminary directive for that action\r\nprovided:\r\n\r\n    “* * * If the drawing up of boundaries has not been laid down in\r\n    the above Part I, it will be carried out by the Supreme Command\r\n    of the Armed Forces in agreement with the Foreign Office\r\n    [Ribbentrop], the Plenipotentiary for the Four Year Plan\r\n    [Goering], and the Reich Minister of the Interior [Frick].”\r\n    (_1195-PS_)\r\n\r\n(8) _The U.S.S.R._ On 23 August 1939 Ribbentrop signed the German-Soviet\r\nnon-aggression Pact (_TC-25_). The first point at which Ribbentrop seems\r\nto have considered special problems of aggression against the Soviet\r\nUnion was just after 20 April 1941, when Rosenberg and Ribbentrop met or\r\ncommunicated to consider problems expected to arise in the Eastern\r\noccupied territory. Ribbentrop appointed his Counsellor, Grosskopf, to\r\nbe his liaison man with Rosenberg and also assigned a Consul General,\r\nBraeutigam, who had many years experience in the USSR, as a collaborator\r\nwith Rosenberg (_1039-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe following month, on 18 May 1941, the German Foreign Office prepared\r\na declaration setting forth operational zones in the Arctic Ocean and\r\nthe Baltic and Black Seas to be used by the German Navy and Air Force in\r\nthe coming invasion of the Soviet Union:\r\n\r\n    “The Foreign Office has prepared for use in _Barbarossa_ the\r\n    attached draft of a declaration of operational zones. The\r\n    Foreign Office has, however, reserved its decision as to the\r\n    date when the declaration will be issued, as well as discussion\r\n    of particulars.” (_C-77_)\r\n\r\nThus, it is clear that Ribbentrop was again fully involved in the\r\npreparation for this act of aggression. Finally, on 22 June 1941,\r\nRibbentrop announced to the world that the German armies were invading\r\nthe USSR (_3054-PS_).\r\n\r\nHow untrue were the reasons given by Ribbentrop is shown by the report\r\nof his own Ambassador in Moscow on 7 June 1941, who said that everything\r\nwas being done by the Russians to avoid a conflict.\r\n\r\n(9) _Instigation of Japanese Aggression._ On 25 November 1936, as a\r\nresult of negotiations of Ribbentrop as Ambassador at Large, Germany and\r\nJapan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact (_2508-PS_). The recital states the\r\npurpose of the agreement as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Government of the German Reich and the Imperial Japanese\r\n    Government, recognizing that the aim of the Communist\r\n    Internationale known as the Comintern is to disintegrate and\r\n    subdue existing States by all the means at its command;\r\n    convinced that the toleration of interference by the Communist\r\n    Internationale in the internal affairs of the nations not only\r\n    endangers their internal peace and social well-being, but is\r\n    also a menace to the peace of the world; desirous of cooperating\r\n    in the defense against Communist subversive activities; having\r\n    agreed as follows * * *.” (_2508-PS_)\r\n\r\nThere then follow the effective terms of the agreement under which\r\nGermany and Japan are to act together for five years. It is signed on\r\nbehalf of Germany by Ribbentrop (_2508-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn 27 September 1940 Ribbentrop, as Foreign Minister, signed the\r\nTripartite Pact with Japan and Italy, thereby bringing about a\r\nfull-scale military and economic alliance for the creation of a new\r\norder in Europe and East Asia (_2643-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn 13 February 1941—some four months later—Ribbentrop was urging the\r\nJapanese to attack British possessions in the Far East (_1834-PS_).\r\n\r\nThen, in April 1941, at a meeting between Hitler and Matsuoka,\r\nrepresenting Japan, at which Ribbentrop was present, Hitler promised\r\nthat Germany would declare war on the United States in the event of war\r\noccurring between Japan and the United States as a result of Japanese\r\naggression in the Pacific (_1881-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe development of Ribbentrop’s views is indicated by the minutes of\r\nanother conversation with the Japanese Foreign Minister (_1882-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * Matsuoka then spoke of the general high morale in\r\n    Germany, referring to the happy faces he had seen everywhere\r\n    among the workers during his recent visit to the Borsig Works.\r\n    He expressed his regret that developments in Japan had not as\r\n    yet advanced as far as in Germany and that in his country the\r\n    intellectuals still exercised considerable influence.\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Foreign Minister replied that at best a nation which\r\n    had realized its every ambition could afford the luxury of\r\n    intellectuals, most of whom are parasites, anyway. A nation,\r\n    however, which has to fight for a place in the sun must give\r\n    them up. The intellectuals ruined France; in Germany they had\r\n    already started their pernicious activities when National\r\n    Socialism put a stop to these doings; they will surely be the\r\n    cause of the downfall of Britain, which is to be expected with\r\n    certainty * * *.” (_1882-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat was on 5 April 1941.\r\n\r\nWithin a month after the German armies invaded the Soviet Union on 22\r\nJune 1941, Ribbentrop was urging Ott, his ambassador in Tokyo, to do his\r\nutmost to cause the Japanese Government to attack the Soviet in Siberia\r\n(_2896-PS_; _2897-PS_).\r\n\r\nA message, intercepted, which was sent by the Japanese Ambassador in\r\nBerlin on 29 November 1941, a week before the attack on the United\r\nStates at Pearl Harbor, reports the coaxings of Ribbentrop:\r\n\r\n    “Ribbentrop opened our meeting by again inquiring whether I had\r\n    received any reports regarding the Japanese-United States\r\n    negotiations. I replied that I had received no official word.\r\n\r\n    “Ribbentrop: ‘It is essential that Japan effect the New Order in\r\n    East Asia without losing this opportunity. There never has been\r\n    and probably never will be a time when closer cooperation under\r\n    the Tripartite Pact is so important. If Japan hesitates at this\r\n    time, and Germany goes ahead and establishes her European New\r\n    Order, all the military might of Britain and the United States\r\n    will be concentrated against Japan.\r\n\r\n    “‘As Fuehrer Hitler said today, there are fundamental\r\n    differences in the very right to exist between Germany and\r\n    Japan, and the United States. We have received advice to the\r\n    effect that there is practically no hope of the Japanese-United\r\n    States negotiations being concluded successfully because of the\r\n    fact that the United States is putting up a stiff front.\r\n\r\n    “‘If this is indeed the fact of the case, and if Japan reaches a\r\n    decision to fight Britain and the United States, I am confident\r\n    that that will not only be to the interest of Germany and Japan\r\n    jointly, but would bring about favorable results for Japan and\r\n    herself.’” (_D-656_).\r\n\r\nThen the Japanese Ambassador replied:\r\n\r\n    “‘I can make no definite statement as I am not aware of any\r\n    concrete intentions of Japan. Is Your Excellency indicating that\r\n    a state of actual war is to be established between Germany and\r\n    the United States?’\r\n\r\n    “Ribbentrop: ‘Roosevelt’s a fanatic, so it is impossible to tell\r\n    what he would do.’” (_D-656_).\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Ambassador thereupon concludes:\r\n\r\n    “Concerning this point, in view of the fact that Ribbentrop has\r\n    said in the past that the United States would undoubtedly try to\r\n    avoid meeting German troops, and from the tone of Hitler’s\r\n    recent speech, as well as that of Ribbentrop’s, I feel that\r\n    German attitude toward the United States is being considerably\r\n    stiffened. There are indications at present that Germany would\r\n    not refuse to fight the United States if necessary.” (_D-656_).\r\n\r\nPart 3 of the Japanese message quotes Ribbentrop as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In any event, Germany has absolutely no intention of entering\r\n    into any peace with England. We are determined to remove all\r\n    British influence from Europe. Therefore, at the end of this\r\n    war, England will have no influence whatsoever in international\r\n    affairs. The Island Empire of Britain may remain, but all of her\r\n    other possessions throughout the world will probably be divided\r\n    three ways by Germany, the United States, and Japan. In Africa,\r\n    Germany will be satisfied with, roughly, those parts which were\r\n    formerly German colonies. Italy will be given the greater share\r\n    of the African Colonies. Germany desires, above all else, to\r\n    control European Russia.” (_D-656_)\r\n\r\nIn reply the Japanese Ambassador said:\r\n\r\n    “‘I am fully aware of the fact that Germany’s war campaign is\r\n    progressing according to schedule smoothly. However, suppose\r\n    that Germany is faced with the situation of having not only\r\n    Great Britain as an actual enemy, but also having all of those\r\n    areas in which Britain has influence and those countries which\r\n    have been aiding Britain as actual enemies as well. Under such\r\n    circumstances, the war area will undergo considerable expansion,\r\n    of course. What is your opinion of the outcome of the war under\r\n    such an eventuality?’\r\n\r\n    “Ribbentrop: ‘We would like to end this war during next year\r\n    [1942]. However, under certain circumstances, it is possible\r\n    that it will have to be continued on to the following year.\r\n\r\n    ‘Should Japan become engaged in war against the United States,\r\n    Germany, of course, would join the war immediately. There is\r\n    absolutely no possibility of Germany’s entering into a separate\r\n    peace with the United States under such circumstances. The\r\n    Fuehrer is determined on that point.’” (_D-656_)\r\n\r\nRibbentrop was thus associated in the closest possible way, with the\r\naggression by Japan against the United States.\r\n\r\nAnother intercepted diplomatic message from the Japanese Ambassador in\r\nBerlin states (_D-657_):\r\n\r\n    “At 1 p. m. today [8 December 1941] I called on Foreign Minister\r\n    Ribbentrop and told him our wish was to have Germany and Italy\r\n    issue formal declarations of war on America at once. Ribbentrop\r\n    replied that Hitler was then in the midst of a conference at\r\n    general headquarters discussing how the formalities of declaring\r\n    war could be carried out so as to make a good impression on the\r\n    German people, and that he would transmit your wish to him at\r\n    once and do whatever he was able to have it carried out\r\n    promptly. At that time Ribbentrop told me that on the morning of\r\n    the 8th Hitler issued orders to the entire German Navy to attack\r\n    American ships whenever and wherever they might meet them.\r\n\r\n    “It goes without saying that this is only for your secret\r\n    information.” (_D-657_)\r\n\r\nThus, Hitler ordered attacks on American ships before the German\r\ndeclaration of war.\r\n\r\nThen on 11 December 1941 Ribbentrop, in the name of the German\r\nGovernment, announced a state of war between Germany and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nRibbentrop also made attempts to get Japan to attack the Soviet Union.\r\nIn his conversations with Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador, in July 1942\r\nand in March and April 1943, Ribbentrop continued to urge Japanese\r\nparticipation and aggression against the Soviet Union (_2911-PS_;\r\n_2954-PS_). The report of a discussion between Ribbentrop and Ambassador\r\nOshima reads:\r\n\r\n    “Ambassador Oshima declared that he has received a telegram from\r\n    Tokyo, and he is to report, by order of his Government to the\r\n    Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs the following:\r\n\r\n    “The suggestion of the German Government to attack Russia was\r\n    the object of a common conference between the Japanese\r\n    Government and the Imperial headquarters, during which the\r\n    question was discussed in detail and investigated exactly. The\r\n    result is the following: The Japanese Government absolutely\r\n    recognizes the danger which threatens from Russia and completely\r\n    understands the desire of its German ally that Japan on her part\r\n    will also enter the war against Russia. However, it is not\r\n    possible for the Japanese Government, considering the present\r\n    war situation, to enter into the war. It is rather of the\r\n    conviction that it would be in the common interest not to start\r\n    the war against Russia now. On the other hand, the Japanese\r\n    Government would never disregard the Russian question.”\r\n    (_2954-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhereupon Ribbentrop returned to the attack:\r\n\r\n    “However, it would be more correct that all powers allied in the\r\n    Three Power Pact would combine their forces to defeat England\r\n    and America, but also Russia, together. It is not good when one\r\n    part must fight alone.” (_2954-PS_)\r\n\r\nRibbentrop’s pressure on Japan to attack Russia is shown in another\r\nreport of Japanese-German discussions on 18 April 1943 (_2929-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs then stressed again that\r\n    without any doubt this year presented the most favorable\r\n    opportunity for Japan, if she felt strong enough and had\r\n    sufficient antitank weapons at her disposal, to attack Russia,\r\n    which certainly would never again be as weak as she is at the\r\n    moment * * *.” (_2929-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _RIBBENTROP’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES\r\n                           AGAINST HUMANITY._\r\n\r\n(The following discussion concerns only the planning of these crimes.\r\nThe execution of the crimes was left to the French and Soviet\r\nprosecuting staffs for proof.)\r\n\r\n(1) _The Killing of Allied Aviators._ With the increasing air raids on\r\nGerman cities in 1944 by the Allied Air Forces, the German Government\r\nproposed to undertake a plan to deter Anglo-American fliers from further\r\nraids on Reich cities. In a report of a meeting at which a definite\r\npolicy was to be established, there is stated the point of view that\r\nRibbentrop had been urging (_735-PS_). The meeting took place at the\r\nFuehrer’s headquarters on 6 June 1944, and proceeded in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_Obergruppenfuehrer_ Kaltenbrunner informed the Deputy Chief of\r\n    WFSt in Klessheim, on the afternoon of the 6th of June, that a\r\n    conference on this question had been held shortly before between\r\n    the Reich Marshal [Goering], the Reich Foreign Minister\r\n    [Ribbentrop], and the Reichsfuehrer SS [Himmler]. Contrary to\r\n    the original suggestion made by the Reich Foreign Minister, who\r\n    wished to include every type of terror attack on the German\r\n    civilian population, that is, also bombing attacks on cities, it\r\n    was agreed in the above conference that merely those attacks\r\n    carried out with aircraft armament, aimed directly at the\r\n    civilian population and their property, should be taken as the\r\n    standard for the evidence of a criminal action in this sense.\r\n    Lynch law would have to be the rule. On the contrary, there has\r\n    been no question of court martial sentence or handing over to\r\n    the police.” (_735-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat is, Ribbentrop was pressing that even where there was an attack on\r\na German city, the airmen who crash-landed should be handed over to be\r\nlynched by the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe minutes of the conference report further as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Deputy Chief of the WFSt mentioned that apart from lynch law, a\r\n    procedure must be worked out for segregating those enemy\r\n    aviators who are suspected of criminal action of this kind until\r\n    they are received into the reception camp for aviators at\r\n    Oberursel; if the suspicion was confirmed, they would be handed\r\n    over to the SD for special treatment.” (_735-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe sense of this seems to be that if they were not lynched under the\r\nfirst scheme, by the crowd, then they were to be kept from prisoners of\r\nwar, where they would be subject to the protecting power’s intervention.\r\nAnd if the suspicion was confirmed, they would be handed over to the SD\r\nto be killed.\r\n\r\nThe conference reached a decision on what would be regarded as\r\njustifying lynch law:\r\n\r\n    “At a conference with Colonel von Brauchitsch, representing the\r\n    C-in-C, Air Force, on the 6th of June, it was settled that the\r\n    following actions were to be regarded as terror actions\r\n    justifying lynch law:\r\n\r\n    “Low-level attacks with aircraft armament on the civilian\r\n    population, single persons as well as crowds.\r\n\r\n    “Shooting our own men in the air who had bailed out.\r\n\r\n    “Attacks with aircraft armament on passenger trains in the\r\n    public service.\r\n\r\n    “Attacks with aircraft armament on military hospitals,\r\n    hospitals, and hospital trains, which are clearly marked with\r\n    the Red Cross.” (_735-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese were to be the subject of lynching and not, as Ribbentrop had\r\nsuggested, the case of the bombing of a city.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of this report there occurs a somewhat curious\r\ncomment from Keitel:\r\n\r\n    “If one allows the people to carry out lynch law, it is\r\n    difficult to enforce rules!\r\n\r\n    “Minister Director Berndt got out and shot the enemy aviator on\r\n    the road. I am against legal procedure. It doesn’t work out.”\r\n    (_735-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat is signed by Keitel.\r\n\r\nThe remarks of Jodl then appear:\r\n\r\n    “This conference is insufficient. The following points must be\r\n    decided quite definitely in conjunction with the Foreign Office:\r\n\r\n“1. What do we consider as murder?\r\n    “Is RR in agreement with point 3_b_?\r\n“2. How should the procedure be carried out?\r\n    “_a._ By the people?\r\n    “_b._ By the authorities?\r\n“3. How can we guarantee that the procedure be not also carried out\r\n    against other enemy aviators?\r\n“4. Should some legal procedure be arranged or not?\r\n\r\n                                        “(Signed) Jodl” (_735-PS_).\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that Ribbentrop and the Foreign Office were\r\nfully involved in these breaches of the laws and usages of war. The\r\nclarity with which the Foreign Office perceived that there were such\r\nviolations is indicated by a document from the Foreign Office, approved\r\nof by Ribbentrop and transmitted by one of his officials, Ritter\r\n(_728-PS_). The approval of Ribbentrop is specifically stated in a\r\nmemorandum of 30 June 1944 (_740-PS_). The Foreign Office document\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    “In spite of the obvious objections, founded on international\r\n    law and foreign politics, the Foreign Office is basically in\r\n    agreement with the proposed measures.\r\n\r\n    “In the examination of the individual cases, a distinction must\r\n    be made between the cases of lynching and the cases of special\r\n    treatment by the Security Service, SD.\r\n\r\n    “1. In the cases of lynching, the precise establishment of the\r\n    circumstances deserving punishment, according to points 1-4 of\r\n    the communication of 15 June, is not very essential. First, the\r\n    German authorities are not directly responsible, since death had\r\n    occurred before a German official became concerned with the\r\n    case. Furthermore, the accompanying circumstances will be such\r\n    that it will not be difficult to depict the case in an\r\n    appropriate manner upon publication. Hence, in cases of\r\n    lynching, it will be of primary importance correctly to handle\r\n    the individual case upon publication.\r\n\r\n    “2. The suggested procedure for special treatment by the S.D.,\r\n    including subsequent publication, would be tenable only if\r\n    Germany, on this occasion, simultaneously would openly repudiate\r\n    the commitment of International Law, presently in force, and\r\n    still recognized by Germany. When an enemy aviator is seized by\r\n    the Army or by the Police, and is delivered to the Air Forces\r\n    (P.W.) Reception Camp Oberursel, he has received, by this very\r\n    fact, the legal status of a prisoner of war.\r\n\r\n    “The Prisoner of War Treaty of 27 July 1929 establishes definite\r\n    rules on the prosecution and sentencing of the Prisoner of War,\r\n    and the execution of the death penalty, as for example in\r\n    Article 66: Death sentences may be carried out only three months\r\n    after the protective power has been notified of the sentence; in\r\n    Article 63: a prisoner of war will be tried only by the same\r\n    courts and under the same procedure as members of the German\r\n    Armed Forces. These rules are so specific, that it would be\r\n    futile to try to cover up any violation of them by clever\r\n    wording of the publication of an individual incident. On the\r\n    other hand the Foreign Office cannot recommend on this occasion\r\n    a formal repudiation of the Prisoner of War Treaty.\r\n\r\n    “An emergency solution would be to prevent suspected fliers from\r\n    ever attaining a legal Prisoner of War status, that is, that\r\n    immediately upon seizure they be told that they are not\r\n    considered Prisoners of War but criminals; that they would not\r\n    be turned over to the agencies having jurisdiction over\r\n    Prisoners of War; hence not go to a Prisoner of War Camp; but\r\n    that they would be delivered to the authorities in charge of the\r\n    prosecution of criminal acts and that they would be tried in a\r\n    summary proceeding. If the evidence at the trial should reveal\r\n    that the special procedure is not applicable to a particular\r\n    case, the fliers concerned may subsequently be given the status\r\n    of Prisoner of War by transfer to the Air Forces (P.W.)\r\n    Reception Camp Oberursel.\r\n\r\n    “Naturally, not even this expedient will prevent the possibility\r\n    that Germany will be accused of the violation of existing\r\n    treaties, and maybe not even the adoption of reprisals upon\r\n    German prisoners of war. At any rate this solution would enable\r\n    us clearly to define our attitude, thus relieving us of the\r\n    necessity of openly having to renounce the present agreements or\r\n    of the need of having to use excuses, which no one would\r\n    believe, upon the publication of each individual case.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It follows from the above, that the main weight of the action\r\n    will have to be placed on lynchings. Should the campaign be\r\n    carried out to such an extent that the purpose, to wit ‘the\r\n    deterrence of enemy aviators’, is actually achieved, which goal\r\n    is favored by the Foreign Office, then the strafing attacks by\r\n    enemy fliers upon the civilian populations must be stressed in a\r\n    completely different propagandist manner than heretofore.”\r\n    (_728-PS_).\r\n\r\nThose words show clearly Ribbentrop’s point of view:\r\n\r\n    “Ambassador Ritter has advised us by telephone on 29 June that\r\n    the Minister for Foreign Affairs has approved this draft.”\r\n    (_740-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus, on the treatment of aviators, Ribbentrop furthered the deliberate\r\nadoption of a procedure evading International Law.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Destruction of the Peoples in Europe._ With regard to Poland,\r\nthe affidavit of Lahousen reports Ribbentrop participation in a\r\ndiscussion on 12 September 1939 on the Fuehrer’s train concerning the\r\nextermination of Poles and Jews (_Affidavit A_).\r\n\r\nWith regard to Bohemia and Moravia, on 16 March 1939 there was\r\npromulgated the decree of the Fuehrer and Reichschancellor, signed by\r\nRibbentrop, establishing the protectorate (_TC-51_). The effect of that\r\ndecree was to place the Reich Protector in a position of supreme power\r\nover Bohemia and Moravia, subordinate only to the Fuehrer. Article 5 of\r\nthat decree provides:\r\n\r\n    “* * * 2. The Reich Protector, as representative of the Fuehrer\r\n    and Chancellor of the Reich, and as commissioner of the Reich\r\n    Government, is charged with the duty of seeing to the observance\r\n    of the political principles laid down by the Fuehrer and\r\n    Chancellor of the Reich.\r\n\r\n    “3. The members of the government of the Protectorate shall be\r\n    confirmed by the Reich Protector. The confirmation may be\r\n    withdrawn.\r\n\r\n    “4. The Reich Protector is entitled to inform himself of all\r\n    measures taken by the government of the Protectorate and to give\r\n    advice. He can object to measures calculated to harm the Reich,\r\n    and, in case of danger, issue ordinances required for the common\r\n    interest.” (_TC-51_)\r\n\r\nIt is further provided that the promulgation of laws and the execution\r\nof certain judgments shall be annulled if the Reich Protector enters an\r\nobjection (_TC-51_).\r\n\r\nIn part as a result of the sweeping terms of this law, the two Reich\r\nProtectors of Bohemia and Moravia and their various deputies were able\r\nto commit numerous violations of the laws of war, and crimes against\r\nhumanity. (Discussion of these matters was assumed as the responsibility\r\nof the Soviet prosecuting staff.)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, with regard to the Netherlands, on 18 May 1940 a decree of\r\nthe Fuehrer concerning the exercise of governmental authority in the\r\nNetherlands was signed by Ribbentrop. Section 1 of that decree provided\r\n(_D-639_):\r\n\r\n    “The occupied Netherlands territories shall be administered by\r\n    the Reich Commissioner for the Occupied Netherlands territories\r\n    * * * the Reich Commissioner is guardian of the interests of the\r\n    Reich and vested with supreme civil authority.\r\n\r\n    “Dr. Arthur Seyss-Inquart is hereby appointed Reich Commissioner\r\n    for the Occupied Netherlands Territories.” (_D-639_)\r\n\r\nOn the basis of this decree, the Reich Commissioner, Seyss-Inquart,\r\npromulgated such orders as that of 4 July 1940, confiscating the\r\nproperty of those who had, or might have, furthered activities hostile\r\nto the German Reich (_2921-PS_). Tentative arrangements were also made\r\nfor the resettlement of the Dutch population (_1520-PS_). (This part of\r\nthe proof was assumed as the responsibility of the French prosecuting\r\nstaff.)\r\n\r\nWith regard to Bohemia and the Netherlands, the charge against\r\nRibbentrop is laying the basis and erecting the governmental structure\r\nunder which the war crimes and crimes against humanity were directed and\r\nfacilitated.\r\n\r\n(3) _Persecution of the Jews._ In December 1938 Ribbentrop, in a\r\nconversation with M. Bonnet, who was then Foreign Minister of France,\r\nexpressed his opinion of the Jews. That was reported by the United\r\nStates Ambassador, Mr. Kennedy, to the State Department as follows\r\n(_L-205_):\r\n\r\n    “During the day we had a telephone call from Berenger’s office\r\n    in Paris. We were told that the matter of refugees had been\r\n    raised by Bonnet in his conversation with von Ribbentrop. The\r\n    result was very bad. Ribbentrop, when pressed, had said to\r\n    Bonnet that the Jews in Germany without exception were\r\n    pickpockets, murderers and thieves. The property they possessed\r\n    had been acquired illegally. The German Government had therefore\r\n    decided to assimilate them with the criminal elements of the\r\n    population. The property which they had acquired illegally would\r\n    be taken from them. They would be forced to live in districts\r\n    frequented by the criminal classes. They would be under police\r\n    observation like other criminals. They would be forced to report\r\n    to the police as other criminals were obliged to do. The German\r\n    Government could not help it if some of these criminals escaped\r\n    to other countries which seemed so anxious to have them. It was\r\n    not, however, willing for them to take the property which had\r\n    resulted from their illegal operations with them. There was in\r\n    fact nothing that it could or would do.” (_L-205_)\r\n\r\nThat succinct statement of Ribbentrop’s views on Jews is elaborated in a\r\nlong document which he had sent out by the Foreign Office (_3358-PS_).\r\nThis document, entitled “The Jewish Question As A Factor In German\r\nForeign Policy in the year 1938” contains the following:\r\n\r\n    “It is certainly no coincidence that the fateful year 1938 has\r\n    brought nearer the solution of the Jewish question\r\n    simultaneously with the realization of the ‘idea of Greater\r\n    Germany’, since the Jewish policy was both the basis and\r\n    consequence of the events of the year 1938.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The final goal of German Jewish policy is the emigration of all\r\n    Jews living in Reich territory.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “These examples from reports from authorities abroad can, if\r\n    desired, be amplified. They confirm the correctness of the\r\n    expectation that criticism of the measures for excluding Jews\r\n    from German _lebensraum_, which were misunderstood in many\r\n    countries for lack of evidence, would only be temporary and\r\n    would swing in the other direction the moment the population saw\r\n    with its own eyes and thus learned what the Jewish danger was to\r\n    them. The poorer and therefore the more burdensome the immigrant\r\n    Jew to the country absorbing him, the stronger this country will\r\n    react and the more desirable is this effect in the interest of\r\n    German propaganda. The object of this German action is to be the\r\n    future international solution of the Jewish question, dictated\r\n    not by false compassion for the ‘United Religious Jewish\r\n    minority’ but by the full consciousness of all peoples of the\r\n    danger which it represents to the racial composition of the\r\n    nations.” (_3358-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis document was widely circulated by Ribbentrop’s ministry, to all\r\nsenior Reich authorities and to numerous other people on 25 January\r\n1939, just after the statement to M. Bonnet. Apparently Ribbentrop’s\r\nanti-Semitic incitements grew stronger, for in June 1944 Rosenberg made\r\narrangements for an international anti-Jewish Congress to be held in\r\nKrakow on 11 July 1944. The honorary members were to be Ribbentrop,\r\nHimmler, Goebbels, and Frank. The Foreign Office was to take over the\r\nmission of inviting prominent foreigners from Italy, France, Hungary,\r\nHolland, Arabia, Iraq, Norway etc. in order to give an international\r\naspect to the Congress. However, the military events of June 1944\r\nprompted Hitler to call off the Congress, which had lost its\r\nsignificance by virtue of the Allied landing in Normandy (_1752-PS_).\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Ribbentrop supported and encouraged the Nazi program\r\nagainst the Jews, which resulted in their transportation to\r\nconcentration camps, where things went on which he, as a minister in\r\nspecial touch with the head of the government must have known about. As\r\none who preached this doctrine and was in a position of authority,\r\nRibbentrop cannot suggest that he was ignorant of how the policy was\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n                            D. _CONCLUSION_\r\n\r\nHitler summed up Ribbentrop’s contribution to the Nazi conspiracy for\r\naggression, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In the historic year of 1938 the Foreign Minister, von\r\n    Ribbentrop, was of great help to me, in view of his accurate and\r\n    audacious judgment and the exceptionally clever treatment of all\r\n    problems of foreign policy.”\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the war, Ribbentrop was in close liaison with the\r\nother Nazi conspirators. He advised them and made available to them,\r\nthrough his foreign embassies and legations abroad, information which\r\nwas required. He at times participated in the planning of war crimes and\r\ncrimes against humanity. His guilt is clear.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n     LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO JOACHIM VON\r\n                               RIBBENTROP\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 57\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

(_3019-PS_)\r\n\r\nChief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces (Chief of OKW), equal\r\nin rank to a Reichs Minister. (_1915-PS_)\r\n\r\nMember of the Secret Cabinet Council, 4 February 1938 to 1945.\r\n(_2031-PS_)\r\n\r\nMember of Ministerial Council for the defense of the Reich, 30 August\r\n1939 to 1945. (_2018-PS_)\r\n\r\nMember of Reichs Defense Council, 4 September 1938 to 1945. (_2194-PS_)\r\n\r\nField Marshal, July 1940 to 1945. (_3020-PS_)\r\n\r\n                       B. _FUNCTIONS OF KEITEL._\r\n\r\nAs Chief of the _Wehrmachtsamt_ in the Ministry of War, Keitel was Chief\r\nof Staff for von Blomberg, who was both Minister of War and\r\nCommander-in-chief of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nOn 4 February 1938 Hitler abolished the Ministry of War, assumed direct\r\ncommand of the Armed Forces himself, and created the OKW (_Oberkommando\r\nder Wehrmacht_). The OKW advised Hitler on the most important military\r\nquestions, and prepared and transmitted directives to the Armed Forces.\r\nThus it exercised great influence on the formation of the German\r\nmilitary policy and the conduct of military affairs.\r\n\r\nKeitel was made Chief of the OKW, with rank equal to that of\r\nReichsminister. He was also given authorities of the former Minister of\r\nWar, and continued to perform the administrative duties of that\r\nposition. (_1915-PS_; _1954-PS_; _3704-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition to its ministerial functions, the OKW was Hitler’s military\r\nstaff. Its most important duty was the development of strategic and\r\noperational plans. Such plans were worked out by the OKW Operations\r\nStaff in broad outline, and then in more detail by the commanders and\r\nchiefs of staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. After Hitler had\r\napproved the plans they were transmitted by the OKW to the respective\r\nmilitary authorities. (_3705-PS_; _3702-PS_; _3707-PS_).\r\n\r\n  C. _KEITEL’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST PEACE._\r\n\r\nKeitel’s conspiratorial activities started immediately after the Nazis\r\ncame to power. As early as in May 1933, when Germany was still a member\r\nof the League of Nations, Keitel gave directives for deceiving “Geneva”\r\nin rearmament matters.\r\n\r\nAt the second meeting of the Working Committee of the Councillors for\r\nReich Defense on 22 May 1933, Colonel Keitel emphasized that the supreme\r\nconsideration guiding the work of the committee was to be secrecy. “No\r\ndocument”, he said, “ought to be lost, since otherwise it may fall into\r\nthe hands of the enemy’s intelligence service. Orally transmitted\r\nmatters are not provable; they can be denied by us in Geneva.” He\r\nrequested that written documents not be sent through the mails, or, if\r\nit was absolutely necessary to do so, that they be addressed, not to a\r\ngovernment agency or office (where they might be opened by the mail\r\nclerks) but to the recipient personally. (_EC-177_)\r\n\r\nThe fact that Keitel was a member of the Nazi conspiracy in good\r\nstanding is apparent from his statement that he held the Golden Party\r\nBadge, and that consequently the Party considered him a member as from\r\nthe autumn of 1944, when the law against military personnel being\r\nmembers of the Party was changed (1944 RGBl. I, 317). His political\r\nconvictions were those of National Socialism, and he was a loyal\r\nfollower of Hitler. (_1954-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt the second meeting of the Working Committee of the Councillors for\r\nReich Defense held on 26 April 1933, the chairman, Colonel Keitel,\r\npointed out the necessity and desirability for the creation of the Reich\r\nDefense Council which had been determined on by a cabinet decision of 4\r\nApril 1933. He said that a general program for the creation of a war\r\neconomy had already been completed, but that it would take a long time\r\nto carry out the program. He explained that it was the purpose and\r\nobjective of the Working Committee of the new Defense Council to\r\novercome these difficulties. (_EC-177_)\r\n\r\nOn 6 December 1935 General Major Keitel, chairman of the eleventh\r\nmeeting of the Reich Defense Council, pointed out that the mobilization\r\nyear was to begin on 1 April and to end on 31 March of the following\r\nyear. For the first time, a “Mobilization Book for Civilian Agencies”\r\nwas to be issued on 1 April 1936. Keitel said that this day, to the\r\nextent possible, should find the nation ready and prepared. He declared\r\nthat, according to the will of the Fuehrer, the economic management of\r\nthe country should put the enhancement of military capacity above all\r\nother national tasks. Keitel emphasized that it was the function of all\r\nmembers of the Reich Defense Council to use all available resources\r\neconomically and to ask for only such funds and raw materials as were\r\nabsolutely and exclusively needed for the defense of the Reich.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of Keitel, Colonel Jodl said that the “Mobilization Book\r\nfor the Civilian Agencies” constituted the unified basis for the\r\ncarrying out of mobilization outside of the Army. (_EC-406_)\r\n\r\nThe twelfth meeting of the Working Committee of the Reich Defense\r\nCouncil, held on 14 May 1936, was opened by Field Marshal von Blomberg,\r\nWar Minister and Supreme Army Commander. He stressed the necessity for a\r\ntotal mobilization, including the drafting of the necessary laws,\r\npreparations in the re-militarized Rhineland zone, financing and\r\nrearmament. Lt. General Keitel, in his capacity as chairman of the\r\nWorking Committee of the Reich Defense Council, again stressed the\r\nnecessity for secrecy. Ministerial Director Wohlthat pointed out that,\r\nin order to guarantee rearmament and an adequate food supply, an\r\nincrease in production and utmost economy were necessary, a postulate\r\nthat had led to the special mandate given by the Fuehrer to Minister\r\nPresident Goering. (_EC-407_)\r\n\r\nKeitel participated also in the activities of the conspirators to\r\nre-militarize the Rhineland. At that time he was Chief of the\r\n_Wehrmachtsamt_ under von Blomberg and signed, on the latter’s behalf,\r\nthe order for naval participation in the operation. (_C-194_)\r\n\r\nKeitel also took part in the war-planning activities of the Reich\r\nCabinet, of which he was a member. The cabinet consulted by meetings,\r\nand by the circulation of decrees among its members for their approval\r\nor disapproval. (See generally Section 3 of Chapter XV on the Reich\r\nCabinet.) Keitel was a member of the Secret Cabinet Council, which has\r\nbeen described as “a select committee” of the cabinet for deliberation\r\non foreign affairs. (_1774-PS_)\r\n\r\nA Reich Defense Council was established by the ordinary cabinet in 1933.\r\nIt was a war-planning group, and Keitel took part in the meetings of its\r\nworking committee. (_EC-177_; _EC-406_; _EC-407_)\r\n\r\nOn 4 December 1938 a Secret Defense Law was passed, which defined the\r\nduties of the Reich Defense Council. As Chief of OKW, Keitel was a\r\nmember of the council, and he also presided over the Council’s Working\r\nCommittee (_Reichsverteidigungsausschuss_). (_2194-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Secret Defense Law of 1938 provided for a Plenipotentiary for\r\nEconomy, whose task was to “put all economic forces into the service of\r\nthe Reich defense, and to safeguard economically the life of the German\r\nnation”, and for a Plenipotentiary for Administration, whose duties were\r\nto take over “the uniform leadership of the non-military administration\r\nwith exception of the economic administration” upon the declaration of a\r\n“state of defense”. Certain ministries were, in peace-time, bound by the\r\ndirectives of the plenipotentiaries. The latter were bound, in turn,\r\nunder certain conditions, together with the ministries subordinate to\r\nthem, to take directions from the Chief of OKW. Keitel could also, in a\r\nstate of defense, issue orders to the Minister of Transport and the\r\nMinister of Posts. In addition, he presided over the Council’s Working\r\nCommittee, which prepared the Council’s decisions, saw that they were\r\nexecuted, and obtained collaboration between the armed forces, the chief\r\nReich offices, and the Party. Keitel regulated the activities of this\r\ncommittee and issued directions to the plenipotentiaries and certain\r\nReich ministries to assure uniform execution of the council’s decisions.\r\n(_2194-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe two plenipotentiaries and the OKW formed what was known as a “Three\r\nMan College” (_2608-PS_). This system of a three man college functioned\r\nas follows, from a legislative point of view: The Plenipotentiary for\r\nEconomy was empowered by paragraph 4 of the Secret Defense Law of 4\r\nSeptember 1938 to issue laws within his sphere, with the consent of the\r\nOKW and the Plenipotentiary for Administration, which differed from\r\nexisting laws. Similarly, the Plenipotentiary for Administration was\r\nempowered by paragraph 3 of the same law to issue laws within his\r\nsphere, with the consent of the OKW and the Plenipotentiary for Economy,\r\nwhich differed from existing laws.\r\n\r\nIn the spheres of the Reich Minister of Posts, the Reich Minister of\r\nTransport and of the General Inspector for German roads\r\n(_Generalinspektor fuer die Strassenwesen_), the Chief of the OKW had\r\nthe right, under paragraph 5 of the same law, to issue laws, in\r\nagreement with the Plenipotentiaries for Administration and Economy,\r\nwhich differed from existing laws. (_2194-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe legislative function of the three man college, prior to 9 September\r\n1939 was one of drafting decrees to be used in time of war.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Ministers for the Defense of the Reich was established by\r\na decree of Hitler on 30 August 1939. It was formed out of the Reich\r\nDefense Council, and included among its members the two\r\nplenipotentiaries of the council and the Chief of OKW. (_2018-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Council had the power to pass decrees with the force of law, and to\r\nlegislate for the occupied Eastern Territories (1939 RGBl, I, 2077).\r\nDecrees of the council were circulated, before enactment, among all the\r\nmembers by written communication from Dr. Lammers, who was also on the\r\nCouncil. (_2231-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrick has referred to the Council of Ministers as “the highest permanent\r\norgan of the Reich with comprehensive jurisdiction, responsible only to\r\nthe Fuehrer”. “The composition of the Ministerial Council for the\r\nDefense of the Reich”, he added, “shows the real concentration of power\r\nin it”. He said also that Keitel was liaison between the council and the\r\narmed forces, it being primarily his duty to coordinate the measures for\r\ncivilian defense in the area of administration and economy with the\r\ngenuine military measures for the defense of the Reich. (_2608-PS_)\r\n\r\nKeitel also took an active part in collaborating with and in instigating\r\nthe Japanese to enter the war. Nazi policy with regard to Japan was\r\nexpressed in an order signed by Keitel on 5 March 1941. This order was\r\ndistributed to the OKH, OKM, and OKL, and also to Jodl. It stated that\r\nJapan must be drawn actively into the war, and that the taking of\r\nSingapore would mean a decisive success for the three powers. (_C-75_)\r\n\r\nAt about the time this order was issued, a meeting was held with Hitler,\r\nin which Raeder urged that Japan be induced to attack Singapore. Keitel\r\nand Jodl were both present at this meeting. (_C-152_)\r\n\r\nKeitel may have known of a report from the Military Attache in Tokyo\r\nthat preparations were continuing for a sudden attack on Singapore and\r\nManila. (_1538-PS_)\r\n\r\n    D. _KEITEL’S PART IN PLANNING AND LAUNCHING WARS OF AGGRESSION._\r\n\r\n(_See “F” 1 through 7, infra, where the joint responsibility of Keitel\r\nand Jodl for these activities is discussed._)\r\n\r\n  E. _KEITEL’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES\r\n                           AGAINST HUMANITY._\r\n\r\n(1) _Murder and ill treatment of civilian populations in occupied\r\nterritory and on the high seas._ Keitel committed many crimes of this\r\nnature, by ordering such criminal activities.\r\n\r\nOn 13 May 1941 Keitel, as Chief of OKW, signed an order from the\r\nFuehrer’s Headquarters providing that Russian civilians suspected of\r\noffenses against German troops should be shot or ruthlessly punished\r\nwithout a military trial, and that prosecution of German soldiers for\r\noffenses against Russian civilians was not required (_C-50_). On 27 July\r\n1941 he ordered that all copies of this decree should be destroyed, but\r\nwithout affecting its validity. (_C-51_)\r\n\r\nOn 23 July 1941 Keitel signed an order concerning the administration of\r\noccupied Russia. This order provided that legal punishments were\r\ninadequate in so great an area, and that troops should use terrorism in\r\ncrushing the population’s will to resist. (_C-52_)\r\n\r\nKeitel signed one of the so-called _Nacht und Nebel_ decrees on 7\r\nDecember 1941. It provided that in occupied territories of the west\r\ncivilians would be tried for offenses against the German state only if\r\nthe death sentence was likely to be carried out within a few days of\r\narrest. Otherwise the accused would be taken to Germany, and no\r\ninformation would be given about them in reply to any inquiries.\r\n(_666-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy a first ordinance of 7 December 1941 Keitel made the provisions of\r\nthe foregoing directive applicable to the following offenses; attacks\r\nagainst life or bodily health, espionage, sabotage, communistic\r\nconspiracy, offenses likely to create disturbances, assistance to the\r\nenemy, and illicit possession of arms. His ordinance also provided that\r\nthe offenses mentioned were to be tried in the occupied countries only\r\nif it were likely that the death sentence would be pronounced, and if it\r\nwere possible to complete trial and execution within a very short time,\r\nas a rule within a week after arrest. In case of trial in Germany, it\r\nwas provided that alien witnesses could be heard only with the consent\r\nof the High Command of the Armed Forces and that the public would not be\r\nadmitted to the proceedings. (_L-90_)\r\n\r\nIn a communication issued by him in his capacity as Chief of the High\r\nCommand of the Armed Forces Keitel on 12 December 1941 stated with\r\nrespect to the aforementioned directive and ordinance:\r\n\r\n    “Efficient and enduring terrorization can be achieved only\r\n    either by capital punishment or by measures to keep the\r\n    relatives of the criminal and the population in the dark as to\r\n    the fate of the criminal. This aim is achieved by transferring\r\n    the criminal to Germany.” (_L-90_)\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of Keitel’s _Nacht und Nebel_ decree, Admiral Canaris on 2\r\nFebruary 1942 issued instructions to the _Abwehr_ to punish crimes\r\nagainst the _Wehrmacht_ accordingly. At first the order was to apply\r\nonly to Norway, Holland, Belgium, and France. (_833-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the SIPO and SD reported to OKW on 24 June 1942 that a\r\nFrenchman had died while awaiting trial in Germany, and that, in order\r\nto create anxiety in accordance with the decree, his family had not been\r\nnotified. Keitel’s OKW approved of this procedure, which had been\r\nestablished for such cases by an OKW order of 16 April 1942. (_668-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhen, on 20 April 1941 Hitler appointed Rosenberg “Deputy for a\r\nCentralized Treatment of Problems concerning the Eastern Territories,”\r\nKeitel was asked to designate a representative of OKW to sit with\r\nRosenberg. Keitel designated Jodl as his representative and Warlimont as\r\ndeputy. (_865-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus Keitel and Jodl share the responsibility for crimes committed by\r\nRosenberg’s administration. In this connection reference is made to\r\nsection 7 of this chapter on Rosenberg.\r\n\r\nAmong the decrees issued by the Council of Ministers, of which Keitel\r\nwas a member, are two which connect him with harsh treatment of\r\ninhabitants of the Occupied Eastern Territories. (_2746-PS_; _2039-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Deportation of civilian populations in occupied territories for\r\nslave labor and other purposes._ Keitel’s connection with the forced\r\nlabor program began at a meeting with Hitler on 23 May 1939, when it was\r\nannounced that Poland would be invaded, and also that non-German\r\npopulations would be available as a source of labor. (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nKeitel directed the execution of Hitler’s order to use Russian prisoners\r\nof war in German war industries, and stated that OKW (AWA) would furnish\r\nto the Secretary of Labor information on the use of such labor, and\r\nprovide the labor force. (_EC-194_)\r\n\r\nSauckel was appointed Plenipotentiary General for Manpower by a decree\r\nof 21 March 1942, signed by Hitler, Lammers, and Keitel. (_1666-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 8 September 1942 Keitel initialled a Hitler order requiring citizens\r\nof France, Holland, and Belgium to work on the “Atlantic Wall”. The\r\norder was to be enforced by the withdrawal of food and clothing ration\r\ncards (_556-2-PS_). Keitel was informed of the quotas of foreign\r\nlaborers which Sauckel and his agents were to fill. Sauckel requested\r\nthe assistance of the Army, and asked that pressure be used to obtain\r\nthe quotas, if necessary. (_3012-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt a conference with Hitler on 4 January 1944, at which Keitel was\r\npresent, it was determined that Sauckel should obtain 4,000,000 new\r\nworkers from occupied territories. (_1292-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Murder and ill treatment of prisoners of war, and of other members\r\nof the armed forces of the countries with which Germany was at war, and\r\nof persons on the high seas._ On 18 October 1942 Hitler ordered that\r\ncommando troops, even if in uniform, should be killed, not only in\r\nbattle, but in flight or while attempting to surrender (_498-PS_). An\r\norder regulating the treatment of paratroopers had been issued by Keitel\r\nabout a month earlier. It provided that captured paratroopers were to be\r\nturned over to the SD. (_553-PS_)\r\n\r\nA supplementary explanation of the commando order, signed by Hitler, was\r\ndistributed to commanding officers only, with a covering memorandum\r\ndated 19 October 1942, signed by Jodl (_503-PS_). Several cases are\r\nknown in which the order was carried out (_508-PS_; _509-PS_). Three\r\nspecific instances were mentioned by the G-3 of the C-in-C, Norway,\r\nwhere captured members of sabotage units were executed after\r\ninterrogations which resulted in valuable intelligence. These occurred\r\nat Glomfjord, Drontheim, and Stavanger. (_512-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 23 June 1944 the Supreme Command West requested instructions\r\nredefining the scope of the commando order. In view of the extensive\r\nlandings in Normandy, it had become difficult to decide which paratroops\r\nshould be considered sabotage troops under the terms of the order, and\r\nwhich should be considered as engaged in normal combat operations. The\r\nquestion was answered by an order of 25 June 1944, one copy of which was\r\nsigned by Keitel, reaffirming the full force of the original order\r\n(_531-PS_; _551-PS_). Keitel extended the application of the commando\r\norder to members of Anglo-American and Russian “military missions” taken\r\nin the fighting against the partisans in the southeast and southwest.\r\n(_537-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhen allied fliers were forced to land in Germany, they were sometimes\r\nkilled by the civilian population. The police had orders not to protect\r\nthe fliers, nor to punish civilians for lynching them. A proposal was\r\nconsidered to order the shooting without court-martial of enemy airmen\r\nwho had been forced down after engaging in specified “acts of terror”.\r\nWhether or not the order was ever issued is immaterial, for it is\r\ncertain that Keitel and Jodl knew of the lynchings, did nothing to\r\nprevent them, and in fact considered giving them official justification.\r\n\r\n(_See also “F”, 8, infra, in which the joint responsibility of Keitel\r\nand Jodl for the lynching of Allied airmen is discussed._)\r\n\r\nKeitel’s criminal activities against Soviet prisoners of war are shown\r\nby the following. On 8 September 1941 Keitel’s OKW issued a regulation\r\nfor the treatment of Soviet prisoners of war. It stated that Russian\r\nsoldiers would fight by any methods for the idea of Bolshevism and that\r\nconsequently they had lost any claim to treatment in accordance with the\r\nGeneva Convention. Stern measures were to be employed against them,\r\nincluding the free use of weapons. The politically undesirable prisoners\r\nwere to be segregated from the others and turned over to “special\r\npurpose units” of the Security Police and the Security Service. There\r\nwas to be the closest cooperation between the military commanders and\r\nthese police units. (_1519-PS_)\r\n\r\nAdmiral Canaris of the Abwehr considered this order in such direct\r\nviolation of the general principles of International Law that he\r\naddressed a memorandum of protest to Keitel on 15 September 1941. He\r\npointed out that, while the Geneva Convention was not binding between\r\nGermany and the USSR, the usual rules of International Law should be\r\nobserved; that such instructions, particularly those concerning the use\r\nof weapons, would result in arbitrary killings; and that the disposition\r\nof politically undesirable prisoners would be decided by the SIPO and\r\nthe SD according to principles of which the _Wehrmacht_ was ignorant.\r\n(As to this argument, Keitel wrote in the margin “Very efficient” and\r\n“Not at all.”) Keitel received and considered this memorandum, for on\r\nits first page there is the following comment in his handwriting, dated\r\n23 September and initialled “K”:\r\n\r\n    “The objections arise from the military concept of chivalrous\r\n    warfare. This is the destruction of an ideology. Therefore I\r\n    approve and back the measures.” (_EC-338_)\r\n\r\nThe regulations which Canaris had protested were restated on 24 March\r\n1942, but their essential provisions were unchanged. (_695-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn order of Keitel’s OKW dated 29 January 1943, signed by Reinecke,\r\ncontains a broad interpretation of the guards’ right of self-defense\r\nagainst prisoners. For example, self-defense includes not only the\r\nguard’s person, but his honor and property, and third parties, such as\r\nthe State. (_656-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat Keitel knew of the appalling treatment of Russian prisoners of war,\r\nand the high death rate among them, appears from the statements in a\r\nletter sent to him by Rosenberg on 28 February 1942. The letter stressed\r\nthe need for better treatment of the Russians, so that they would be\r\nwell impressed by the Germans. (_081-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn order of Keitel’s OKW provided that escaped officers and non-working\r\nnon-commissioned officers other than Americans and British were to be\r\nturned over to the SIPO and SD upon recapture. The SIPO and SD, upon\r\ninstructions from their chief, would then transport the men to the\r\nMauthausen concentration camp under operation “Kugel” (_L-158_). Such\r\nprisoners were executed at Mauthausen upon arrival (_2285-PS_).\r\nAmericans and British who were recaptured might be turned over to the\r\nSIPO and SD, upon decision of the “W.Kdos” from the OKW/o.i.c. (_L-158_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Killing of Hostages._ Keitel’s criminal activities are shown by the\r\nfollowing two documents. On 16 December 1941 he signed an order stating\r\nthat uprisings among German troops in occupied territories must be\r\nconsidered as inspired by a communist conspiracy, and that the death of\r\none German soldier must mean death for fifty or one hundred communists.\r\n(_829-PS_)\r\n\r\nKeitel also signed an order (received by the OKH on 1 October 1941)\r\nspecifying that hostages should be well known, and that they should come\r\nfrom Nationalist, Democrat, or Communist political factions. After each\r\nact of sabotage hostages belonging to the saboteur’s group should be\r\nshot. (_1590-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _Plunder of public and private property._ The looting of cultural\r\nproperty was carried on chiefly under Rosenberg by the _Einsatzstab\r\nRosenberg_, an organization established for that purpose. In the West he\r\nwas to act in his capacity as Reichsleiter, and in the East in his\r\ncapacity as Reichsminister. Keitel’s OKW cooperated with Rosenberg, and\r\ndirections for carrying out the order were to be issued by the Chief of\r\nthe OKW in agreement with Rosenberg (_149-PS_). Keitel ordered the\r\nmilitary authorities to cooperate in this program (_137-PS_; _138-PS_).\r\nA memorandum of 17 May 1944 in the Rosenberg Ministry states that the\r\n_Wehrmacht_ was one of the principal agencies engaged in removing\r\ntreasures from Russia. (_1107-PS_)\r\n\r\nKeitel was also responsible for the removal of machine tools,\r\nfoodstuffs, and other materials from occupied territories. (_1161-PS_;\r\n_743-PS_)\r\n\r\n(6) _The exaction of collective penalties._ Collective penalties were\r\nexacted from the population for acts of individuals for which it could\r\nnot be held responsible. Keitel advocated such measures. This appears\r\nfrom correspondence on acts of sabotage in the shipbuilding yards.\r\n(_C-48_; _870-PS_; _871-PS_)\r\n\r\n(7) _Germanization of Occupied Territories._ On 16 July 1941 Keitel was\r\npresent at a meeting with Hitler where the policy was announced of\r\nexploiting occupied Russian territory and making it part of the Reich.\r\n(_L-221_)\r\n\r\nIn order to promote a racially valuable German heritage an order signed\r\nby Hitler, Lammers, and Keitel provides for payment of subsidies to\r\nNorwegian or Dutch women who had borne children of German soldiers. The\r\nChief of OKW was authorized to extend its application to other occupied\r\nterritories. (_2926-PS_)\r\n\r\n(8) _Persecution of minorities._ Keitel’s responsibility for the\r\npersecution of minorities in Germany appears from the fact that, with\r\nHitler, Goering, and Lammers, he signed a decree on 7 October 1939 which\r\nprovided that the harmful influence of foreigners must be eliminated\r\nfrom Germany; that Germans could be resettled by the Reichsfuehrer SS;\r\nand that the Reichsfuehrer SS could perform “all necessary general and\r\nadministrative measures” to discharge this duty. (_686-PS_)\r\n\r\nKeitel’s responsibility for the criminal treatment of Jews is apparent\r\nfrom his own statement that the struggle against Bolshevism necessitated\r\na ruthless proceeding against the Jews; the _Wehrmacht_ was not to use\r\nthem for any service, but they could be placed in labor columns under\r\nGerman supervision. (_878-PS_)\r\n\r\n F. _JOINT RESPONSIBILITY OF KEITEL AND JODL FOR PLANNING AND LAUNCHING\r\n      WARS OF AGGRESSION, AND FOR THE LYNCHING OF ALLIED AIRMEN._\r\n\r\n(1) _Aggression against Austria._ In June of 1937 von Blomberg ordered\r\npreparations for “Case Otto”—armed intervention in Austria in event of\r\na Hapsburg restoration (_C-175_). New plans were made in 1938 under the\r\nsame name. German policy in 1938 was to eliminate Austria and\r\nCzechoslovakia, and there was a campaign to undermine Austria’s will to\r\nresist, by pressure on the government, by propaganda, and by fifth\r\ncolumn activity. (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nKeitel was present at Berchtesgaden when Schuschnigg visited Hitler\r\nthere in February 1938. Schuschnigg was subjected to political and\r\nmilitary pressure, which resulted in such concessions to the Nazis as\r\nthe reorganization of the Austrian cabinet (_1780-PS_). Keitel and Jodl\r\nand Canaris were instructed to keep up the military pressure against\r\nAustria by simulating military measures until 15 February. (_1780-PS_)\r\nThe OKW submitted proposals to Hitler regarding the Austrian campaign;\r\nthese included suggestions of false rumors and broadcasts. A note in\r\nJodl’s handwriting states that Hitler approved the memorandum by\r\ntelephone and that Canaris was informed. (_1775-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler ordered preparation of “Case Otto”—mobilization of army units\r\nand air forces (_1780-PS_). Hitler’s directive for “Case Otto” was\r\ninitialled by Keitel and Jodl. Jodl issued supplementary instructions\r\n(_C-102_; _C-103_). Jodl initialled Hitler’s order for the invasion of\r\nAustria. (_C-182_)\r\n\r\n(2) _The Execution of the plan to invade Czechoslovakia._ On 21 April\r\n1938 Hitler and Keitel met and discussed plans for the taking of\r\nCzechoslovakia. They considered a military attack after a period of\r\ndiplomatic friction, or as the result of a created incident, such as the\r\nassassination of the German ambassador at Prague. (_388-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter the invasion of Austria, _Wehrmacht_ planning was devoted to “Case\r\nGreen,” the operation against Czechoslovakia (_1780-PS_). Case Green was\r\nfirst drafted in 1937, when it was thought that a “probable warlike\r\neventuality” would be “war on two fronts with the center of gravity in\r\nthe southeast.” A surprise attack on Czechoslovakia was considered\r\npossible (_C-175_). Through the late spring and summer of 1938 Case\r\nGreen was revised and modified. The memoranda and correspondence are\r\nfrequently signed or initialled by Keitel, and it is clear that he knew\r\nof Hitler’s intention to use force against Czechoslovakia and made the\r\nplans to carry out that intention. (_388-PS_; _1780-PS_; _2353-PS_)\r\n\r\nThere were many meetings on Case Green in September 1938, some with\r\nHitler, some with Keitel and Jodl. The timing of troop movements was\r\ndiscussed; the question of advance notice to OKH; preparations of\r\nrailroads and fortifications; even propaganda to counteract the\r\nanticipated violations of International Law which the invasion would\r\nentail (_388-PS_; _1780-PS_; _C-2_). Assistance was given by OKH to the\r\nSudeten German Free Corps, an auxiliary military organization which\r\noperated under Henlein to create disorder in Czechoslovakia. (_1780-PS_;\r\n_388-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn October 1938 Hitler addressed to the OKW four specific questions\r\nabout the time and the forces that would be required to break Czech\r\nresistance in Bohemia and Moravia, and Keitel submitted the answers\r\nprepared by the OKH and Luftwaffe (_388-PS_). On 21 October 1938 Hitler\r\nsigned an order (and Keitel initialled it) requiring the _Wehrmacht_ to\r\nmake preparations to take the remainder of Czechoslovakia. (_C-136_)\r\n\r\nTwo months later Keitel issued a supplement to this order, stating that\r\non the order of the Fuehrer preparations for the liquidation of\r\nCzechoslovakia were to continue, and stressing the importance of having\r\nthe attack well camouflaged and unwarlike in appearance. (_C-138_)\r\n\r\nKeitel was present at the interview between Hitler and Hacha at the\r\nReich Chancellery on 15 March 1939, when the Czech representatives\r\ndelivered their country to Hitler, after hours of duress, which included\r\nthe threat of immediate bombing of Prague. (_2798-PS_; _2943-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Aggression against Poland._ On 25 March 1939—four days after\r\nRibbentrop pressed new demands for Danzig on the Polish\r\nAmbassador—Hitler told von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-chief of the Army,\r\nthat he did not intend to solve the Polish question by force for the\r\ntime being but requested that plans for that operation be developed.\r\n(_R-100_)\r\n\r\nOn 3 April 1939 Keitel, as Chief of the High Command of the Armed\r\nForces, reissued over his signature the directive for the Uniform\r\nPreparation for War by the Armed Forces for 1939/40. The directive,\r\nnoting that the basic principles for the sections on “Frontier Defense”\r\nand “Danzig” remained unaltered, stated that Hitler had added the\r\nfollowing directives to “Fall Weiss”:\r\n\r\n    “1. Preparations must be made in such a way that the operation\r\n    can be carried out at any time from _1.9.39_ onwards.\r\n\r\n    “2. The High Command of the Armed Forces has been directed to\r\n    draw up a precise timetable for “Fall Weiss” and to arrange by\r\n    conferences the synchronized timings between the three branches\r\n    of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n    “3. The plans of the branches of the Armed Forces and the\r\n    details for the timetable must be submitted to the OKW by\r\n    1.5.39.” (_C-120_)\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that, even in April of 1939, the tentative timetable\r\ncalled for the invasion of Poland to be carried out at any time from 1\r\nSeptember 1939 onwards.\r\n\r\nAbout a week later, an order signed by Hitler was circulated to the\r\nhighest commands of the Army, Navy and Air Force. This confirmed\r\nKeitel’s directive to prepare for three eventualities: “Frontier\r\nDefense”, “Fall Weiss”, and the Annexation of Danzig. Annex II contained\r\nfurther instructions for “Fall Weiss”. In the first paragraph, headed\r\n“Political Hypotheses and Aims”, it was stated that should Poland adopt\r\na threatening attitude toward Germany, a “final settlement” would be\r\nnecessary _notwithstanding the pact with Poland_. “The aim is then to\r\ndestroy Polish military strength . . .”\r\n\r\nIt was further stated that the Free State of Danzig would be\r\nincorporated into Germany at the outbreak of the conflict, at the\r\nlatest. The directive continued: “Policy aims at limiting the war to\r\nPoland, and this is considered possible in view of the internal crisis\r\nin France and British restraint as a result of this.”\r\n\r\nThe general political background against which the Armed Forces were to\r\nwork having thus been set down, the later paragraphs outlined the tasks\r\nand operational objectives of the three branches of the Armed Forces. It\r\nwas also decreed that a “camouflaged or open (‘general’ added in ink)\r\nmobilization will not be ordered before D-Day 1 at the latest possible\r\nmoment”, and further that the “preparations for the opening of\r\noperations are to be made in such a way that—without waiting for the\r\nplanned assembly of mobilized units—positions can be taken up\r\nimmediately by the first available troops.” (_C-120_)\r\n\r\nOn 10 May an order signed by Hitler promulgated his instructions for the\r\nseizure of economic installations in Poland and directed the\r\ncommanders-in-chief of the three branches of the armed forces to report\r\nby 1 August 1939 on the measures taken in consequence of these\r\ninstructions. (_C-120_)\r\n\r\nOn 23 May 1939 Hitler called a meeting of his military leaders at the\r\nReich Chancellery. Keitel was at the meeting; Jodl was not, but\r\nWarlimont (also from the Planning Department of OKW) was. Hitler\r\nannounced the necessity of a war against Poland, not over Danzig, but in\r\norder to acquire living space in the East. He recognized the possibility\r\nthat this would provoke a war against France and England, but the\r\n_Wehrmacht_ was instructed to prepare detailed plans. (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nA directive dated 22 June 1939, signed by Keitel as Chief of the OKW,\r\nindicates an advanced stage of preparation. On the basis of particulars\r\nalready available from the Navy, Army, and Air Force, he stated, he had\r\nsubmitted to Hitler a “preliminary timetable” for “Fall Weiss.” The\r\nFuehrer was reported to be in substantial agreement with the intentions\r\nsubmitted by the three branches; he had also made suggestions with\r\nregard to the need to camouflage the scheduled maneuvers “in order not\r\nto disquiet the population,” and had commented on the disposition of an\r\nSS Artillery Regiment. (_C-126_)\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Keitel issued instructions for further study on two\r\nspecific problems: the capture, in undamaged condition, of bridges over\r\nthe Vistula; and the possible adverse effect of Navy mining in Danzig\r\nBay on the element of surprise in the Army’s attack against the bridge\r\nat Dirschau, southeast of Danzig. (_C-120_)\r\n\r\nOn 22 August 1939, Hitler called together at Obersalzberg the Supreme\r\nCommanders of the three branches of the armed forces, as well as the\r\nlower ranking Commanding Generals (_Oberbefehlshaber_), and announced\r\nhis decision to attack Poland near dawn on 26 August. Keitel was at this\r\nmeeting. (_L-3_; _798-PS_; _1014-PS_)\r\n\r\nThree documents reporting this meeting have been uncovered: the text of\r\none, _L-3_, overlaps the contents of the other two, _798-PS_ and\r\n_1014-PS_; the latter two appear to be complementary, _798-PS_ being a\r\nrecord of a morning speech, and _1014-PS_ of an afternoon speech.\r\nViolent and abusive language appears in both _L-3_ and _798-PS_. That\r\nHitler made, at a minimum, the following points, appears from all of\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n1. The decision to attack Poland was made last spring. (_L-3_; _798-PS_)\r\n\r\n2. The aim of the war in Poland is to destroy the Polish armed forces,\r\nrather than to reach a fixed line. (_L-3_; _1014-PS_)\r\n\r\n3. The attack will start early Saturday morning, 26 August (_L-3_;\r\n_1014-PS_)\r\n\r\n4. A spurious cause for starting the war will be devised by German\r\npropaganda. It is a matter of indifference whether it is plausible or\r\nnot. The world will not question the victor (_L-3_; _1014-PS_). The text\r\nin _L-3_ further describes the pretext to be used to start the war:\r\n“I’ll let a couple of companies, dressed in Polish uniforms, make an\r\nassault in Upper Silesia or in the Protectorate.”\r\n\r\nA handwritten entry in the diary of Jodl, at that time Chief of the\r\nOperations Department of the OKW, confirms that the time for the attack\r\non Poland had been fixed for 0430 on 26 August 1939. (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Aggression against Norway and Denmark._ On or about 12 September\r\n1939 Hitler ordered the OKW to start preparations for the occupation of\r\nNorwegian bases early in 1940. (_1546-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe possibility of using Quisling was discussed with Hitler on 12\r\nDecember 1939, in a conference at which Raeder, Keitel, and Jodl were\r\npresent. Hitler agreed with Raeder’s suggestion that, if he was\r\nfavorably impressed with Quisling, the OKW should be authorized to\r\nprepare for the occupation either with Quisling’s assistance, or by\r\nforce. (_C-64_)\r\n\r\nIn January of 1940 the Navy was ordered to concentrate barges for the\r\ninvasion, and further preparations were to be conducted under the code\r\nname “_Weserubung_” (_C-63_). The general directive for the invasion was\r\nissued by Hitler on 1 March 1940. (_C-174_; _1809-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _Aggression against Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg._ At a\r\nconference with Hitler on 23 May 1939 it was determined that the\r\noccupation of the Low Countries was necessary to the successful conduct\r\nof the war against England. A small planning staff was formed at OKW\r\nwith responsibility for further planning of the invasion, and complete\r\nsecrecy was invoked. Keitel was at this meeting. (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nOn 9 October 1939 it was stated in a general directive for the conduct\r\nof the war in the West that the invasion should be started soon, in\r\norder to protect the Ruhr and to provide air bases for use against\r\nEngland. A copy of this directive was distributed to OKW. (_L-52_)\r\n\r\nIn October and November of 1939 a number of military orders was issued\r\nconcerning the invasion of the Low Countries—“Fall Gelb”. Questions of\r\nhow far the troops should advance under the plan were clarified (_C-62_;\r\n_440-PS_). Instructions were issued concerning the deployment of troops,\r\ncommunications systems, crossing of the borders, and the administration\r\nand pacification of the countries to be taken (_2329-PS_). Provisions\r\nwere made for special operations by the 7th Flieger Division near the\r\nBelgian-French border. (_C-10_)\r\n\r\nBetween 7 November 1939 and 9 May 1940 seventeen orders were issued\r\nsetting and postponing the day for starting operations. These delays\r\nwere caused by the weather. One of the orders, dated 11 January 1940,\r\nshows that all the others were concerned with the action against the Low\r\nCountries, and that the 7th Flieger Division (see _C-10_) was involved.\r\nAll these orders were signed either by Keitel or Jodl. (_C-72_)\r\n\r\nThe development of the plans, and the various questions which came up\r\nfor consideration are shown in the entries in Jodl’s diary. At one point\r\nthe Foreign Office did not regard the prepared justification for the\r\nattack as satisfactory, but Jodl thought it was sufficient. His diary\r\nshows the existence of the plan against the Low Countries and the steps\r\ntaken to put it into execution. (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\n(6) _Aggression against Greece and Yugoslavia._ On 12 November 1940\r\nHitler issued orders to the Army to prepare for the occupation of the\r\nGreek mainland (_444-PS_). On 13 December 1940 a Hitler order stated\r\nthat the invasion of Greece was planned and would start as soon as the\r\nweather became favorable. The composition of combat teams and their\r\nroutes of march were given. When the Greek operation was concluded, the\r\nmass of the troops involved were to be employed for a new task. This\r\norder was distributed to the OKW, as well as to the three armed\r\nservices. (_1541-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 11 January 1941 Hitler ordered preparation for armed intervention in\r\nAlbania, to assist the Italians against Greece. The order was initialled\r\nby Keitel and Jodl (_448-PS_). On 20 January 1941 Jodl reported, in\r\nnotes of a meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, that Hitler stated that\r\none of the purposes of German troop concentrations in Rumania was for\r\nuse in his plan for the operation against Greece. This was four months\r\nprior to the attack. (_C-134_)\r\n\r\nOn 19 February 1941 an OKW order signed by Warlimont gave decisions for\r\ncarrying out the Greek campaign, providing that pontoon building would\r\ncommence on 26 February, and that the Danube would be crossed on 2\r\nMarch. (_C-59_)\r\n\r\nOn 18 March 1941 Raeder, in the presence of Keitel and Jodl, asked for\r\nconfirmation that the whole of Greece would have to be occupied even in\r\nthe event of a peaceful settlement, and Hitler replied that complete\r\noccupation was a prerequisite to any settlement. (_C-167_)\r\n\r\nAt a meeting on 27 March 1941, attended by both Keitel and Jodl, Hitler\r\noutlined the proposed operations against Yugoslavia and Greece. The\r\nactual plan for military operations, Directive No. 25, was issued on the\r\nsame day. (_1746-PS_)\r\n\r\n(7) _Aggression against the U.S.S.R._ On 12 November 1940 Hitler issued\r\na directive in which, among other things, it was stated that\r\npreparations for the East already verbally ordered should be continued,\r\nregardless of the outcome of current political discussions for the\r\nclarification of Russia’s attitude. The directive was initialled by\r\nJodl. (_444-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe original directive for preparation of the attack on Russia—case\r\n“Barbarossa”—was signed by Hitler on 18 December 1940 and initialled by\r\nKeitel and Jodl (_446-PS_). On 3 February 1941 Hitler held a meeting to\r\ndiscuss the intended invasion. Keitel and Jodl were both present\r\n(_872-PS_). On 1 March 1941 an OKW map was prepared to show the intended\r\ndivision of occupied Russian territory. The distribution list shows that\r\nKeitel and Jodl received copies. (_1642-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn March of 1941 Keitel wrote to Reich Minister Todt to give him\r\ndetailed instructions about camouflaging the coming invasion. The letter\r\nwas initialled by Jodl. (_874-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 13 March 1941 Keitel issued an operational supplement to Hitler’s\r\nBarbarossa order (_446-PS_). This order defined the area of operations\r\nand established the relationship between political and military officers\r\nin those areas (_447-PS_). On 1 June 1941 there was issued, with\r\nHitler’s approval, a timetable for the invasion, showing the disposition\r\nand missions of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This paper was signed by\r\nKeitel (_C-39_). On 14 June 1941 an order was issued for final reports\r\non Barbarossa to be made in Berlin by Army, Navy, and Air Commanders.\r\n(_C-78_)\r\n\r\nWhile the foregoing preparations were being made, planning for the\r\nproduction of armaments and supplies was being conducted by one of\r\nKeitel’s subordinates, General Thomas, Chief of the _Wirtschaft\r\nRuestungsamt_ in OKW. (_2353-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy a Fuehrer order dated 20 April 1941 Rosenberg was appointed “Deputy\r\nfor a Centralized Treatment of Problems concerning the Eastern\r\nTerritories”. Jodl and Warlimont were appointed Keitel’s representatives\r\nwith the Rosenberg office (_865-PS_). A preliminary report by Rosenberg\r\non his work up to the time of the invasion mentions Keitel and Jodl as\r\nhaving consulted and worked with him in those preparations. (_1039-PS_)\r\n\r\nA memorandum written by General Thomas on 20 June 1941 states that\r\nKeitel had confirmed to him Hitler’s policy on raw materials—that it\r\ntook less manpower to seize territories containing raw materials, than\r\nit did to make synthetic substitutes. (_1456-PS_)\r\n\r\n(8) _War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity;—Crimes against Military\r\nPersonnel—Lynching of Allied Airmen._ On 21 May 1944 Keitel received a\r\nnote from WFSt to the effect that Hitler had decided that enemy fliers\r\nwho had been forced down should be shot without court-martial, if they\r\nhad engaged in “acts of terror”. Keitel wrote on the note “Please\r\narrange for order to be drafted. K”. (_731-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy 4 June 1944 Jodl and Warlimont were ready to go ahead with\r\nformulating the plans. Goering was to be asked what actions of enemy\r\nfliers should be punishable by death; the Airmen’s Reception Camp at\r\nOberursel was to be told which fliers should be delivered to the SD; and\r\nthe Foreign Office was to be kept advised. (_737-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt subsequent conferences Keitel and Jodl raised questions about the\r\ndifficulty of establishing general rules in such a matter. The “Acts of\r\nTerror” were:\r\n\r\n    1. Low level attacks on civilians.\r\n\r\n    2. Shooting German fliers in parachutes.\r\n\r\n    3. Attacks on civilian passenger planes.\r\n\r\n    4. Attacks on Red Cross hospitals or trains. (_735-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 17 June 1944 Keitel wrote to the Foreign Office to ask their approval\r\nof the proposed measure and the agreed definition of “Acts of Terror”\r\n(_730-PS_). On the same day Keitel wrote to Goering to ask for his\r\napproval of the definitions of “Acts of Terror”, and also to ask that he\r\ngive verbal instructions to the Commandant of the camp at Oberursel to\r\nhand over fliers guilty of such acts to the SD. Both Keitel and Jodl\r\ninitialled this letter (_729-PS_). Goering replied that fliers not\r\nguilty of acts of terror must be protected, and suggested that such\r\nmatters be handled by the courts. (_732-PS_)\r\n\r\nA draft of a Foreign Office letter dated 20 June 1944 expresses\r\nmisgivings about the Geneva Convention, and concern about the publicity\r\nthat would be involved. (_728-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 26 June 1944 Goering’s adjutant telephoned the WFSt to say that\r\nGoering agreed to the procedures suggested. (_733-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 29 June Warlimont was informed that Ribbentrop had approved the\r\nForeign Office draft (_728-PS_), but wished to obtain Hitler’s approval\r\nbefore communicating his own final written approval to Keitel.\r\n(_740-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n   LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO WILHELM KEITEL\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 66\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

Vienna and Brno, Oct 1938-27 Aug. 1939.\r\n\r\n    Chief of Operation Staff of the High Command of the Armed Forces\r\n    (_Chef des Wehrmachtsfuhrungstabes in Oberkommando der\r\n    Wehrmacht_), August 1939-1945.\r\n\r\nDates of Promotion:\r\n\r\n    1932—Major and Oberstleutnant\r\n    1936—Oberst\r\n    1939—Generalmajor\r\n    1940—General der Artillerie\r\n    1944—Generaloberst (2865-PS).\r\n\r\n                  B. _FUNCTIONS OF JODL’S POSITIONS._\r\n\r\nJodl’s most important office was that of Chief of the Operations Staff\r\n(_Wehrmachtsfuehrungstab_) in OKW. In this capacity he was directly\r\nsubordinate to Keitel and equal in status to other departmental chiefs\r\nin OKW. However, insofar as the planning and conduct of military affairs\r\nare concerned, Jodl and his staff were more influential than the other\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nThe OKW Operations Staff was also divided into sections. Of these the\r\nmost important was the “National Defense” section, of which Warlimont\r\nwas chief. He was primarily concerned with the development of strategic\r\nquestions. From 1941 onwards Warlimont, though charged with the same\r\nduties, was known as Deputy Chief of the OKW Operations Staff.\r\n(_3707-PS_)\r\n\r\nJodl drafted many directives for Hitler to sign, for the preparation of\r\nmilitary operations and plans of deployment, and for the possible\r\ninitiation and commencement of military measures relating to matters of\r\norganization, operations, or “war-economics.” While in a theater of\r\noperations, Jodl would report twice daily to Hitler about operations,\r\nand then prepare the Fuehrer directives. There was direct contact\r\nbetween Hitler and Jodl, though Keitel was kept informed of what passed\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nIn addition to certain ministerial functions, the OKW was Hitler’s\r\nmilitary staff. Its most important duty was the development of strategic\r\nand operational plans. Such plans were worked out by the OKW Operations\r\nStaff in broad outline, and then in more detail by the Commanders and\r\nChiefs of Staffs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. After Hitler had\r\napproved the plans they were transmitted by the OKW to the appropriate\r\nmilitary authorities (_3705-PS_; _3702-PS_; _3707-PS_).\r\n\r\n   C. _JODL’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST PEACE._\r\n\r\nJodl’s loyalty to the Nazi party doctrine is evident in a speech he\r\ndelivered on 7 November 1943. He spoke of the National Socialist\r\nMovement and its struggle for internal power as the preparation for\r\nliberation from the Treaty of Versailles. (_L-172) _ He also stated, in\r\na speech on the occasion of the attempted assassination of Hitler, that\r\nhis aims had been in general agreement with the aims of the party.\r\n(_1808-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt the sixth meeting of the Working Committee of the Reich Defense\r\nCouncil on 7 February 1934 Jodl pointed out that the practical execution\r\nof the preparations for mobilization, which had been ordered by the Army\r\nand the highest Reich authorities, were making a considerable\r\nenlargement of personnel necessary. He suggested, however, that this\r\nenlargement of personnel ought not to result in “the disquieting of\r\nforeign countries through conspicuous mobilization measures.” (_EC-405_)\r\n\r\nIn the presence of Jodl, Generalmajor Keitel pointed out at the eleventh\r\nmeeting that the mobilization year was to begin on 1 April and to end on\r\n31 March of the following year. A “Mobilization Book for Civilian\r\nAgencies” was to be issued for the first time on 1 April 1936. Keitel\r\nsaid that this day, to the extent possible, should find the nation ready\r\nand prepared. He declared that, according to the will of the Fuehrer,\r\nthe economic management of the country should put the enhancement of\r\nmilitary capacity deliberately above all other national tasks. It was\r\nthe function of all members of the Reich Defense Council, he emphasized,\r\nto use all available resources economically and to ask for only such\r\nfunds and raw materials that were absolutely and exclusively needed for\r\nthe defense of the Reich. Colonel Jodl said that the Mobilization Book\r\nfor the Civilian Departments constituted the unified basis for the\r\ncarrying out of mobilization outside of the Army (_EC-406_).\r\n\r\n     D. _JODL’S PART IN PLANNING AND LAUNCHING WARS OF AGGRESSION._\r\n\r\n(_See “F,” 1 through 7, in Section 4 of this Chapter on Keitel, where\r\nthe joint responsibility of Keitel and Jodl for these activities is\r\ndiscussed._)\r\n\r\n   E. _JODL’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES\r\n                           AGAINST HUMANITY._\r\n\r\n(1) _Murder and ill treatment of civilian population in occupied,\r\nterritories and on the high seas._ Jodl ordered the forcible evacuation\r\nof all persons in a northern district of Norway, and the burning of all\r\ntheir dwellings. This was to be done so that the inhabitants of that\r\narea could not help the Russians (_754-PS_). Shortly thereafter an\r\nevacuation took place in Finnmark County in northern Norway, in the\r\ncourse of which 30,000 houses were damaged. (_1800-PS_)\r\n\r\nJodl was aware that in 1942 there were continual arrests in Belgrade,\r\nand that from fifteen to thirty followers of Mihalovic were shot every\r\nday. (_1383-PS_)\r\n\r\nJodl initialled an order signed for Hitler by Keitel, which provided\r\nthat enemy civilians guilty of offenses against German troops should be\r\nkilled without a military trial, and that punishment could be waived in\r\nthe case of German soldiers who committed offenses against enemy\r\ncivilians. (_886-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg was appointed by Hitler on 20 April 1941 “Deputy for a\r\nCentralized Treatment of Problems concerning the Eastern Territories.”\r\nThe highest Reich authorities were to cooperate fully, and Keitel was\r\nasked to designate a representative of OKW to sit with Rosenberg. Jodl\r\nwas appointed as Keitel’s representative with Warlimont as his deputy,\r\nand Keitel wrote to Rosenberg on 25 April 1941 that Jodl and Warlimont\r\nwould be the OKW representatives. (_865-PS_)\r\n\r\nResponsibility for crimes committed under Rosenberg’s authority thus\r\nattach to Jodl as well. In this connection reference is made to Section\r\n7 of this chapter on Rosenberg.\r\n\r\n(2) _Deportation of civilian populations of and in Occupied Territories\r\nfor slave labor and for other purposes._ Jodl knew of the deportation of\r\nworkers, for he once told Hitler that the military commander of France\r\nhad reported that over 220,000 workers had been deported into the Reich\r\nin the past six months. (_1383-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Murder and ill treatment of prisoners of war, and of other members\r\nof the Armed Forces of the countries with whom Germany was at war and of\r\npersons on the high seas._ On 18 October 1942 Hitler ordered that\r\ncommando troops, even if in uniform, should be killed, not only in\r\nbattle, but in flight or while attempting to surrender. This order was\r\nissued by Jodl’s department. (_498-PS_)\r\n\r\nA supplementary explanation of the commando order, signed by Hitler, was\r\ndistributed to commanding officers only, with a covering memorandum\r\ndated 19 October 1942, signed by Jodl (_503-PS_). Several cases are\r\nknown in which the order was carried out. (_508-PS_; _509-PS_)\r\n\r\nThree specific instances were mentioned by the G-3 of the C in C,\r\nNorway, where captured members of sabotage units were executed after\r\ninterrogations which resulted in valuable intelligence. These occurred\r\nat Gloafjord, Drontheim, and at Stavanger. (_512-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 23 June 1944 C in C West requested instructions re-defining the scope\r\nof the commando order. In view of the extensive landings in Normandy, it\r\nhad become difficult to decide which paratroops should be considered\r\nsabotage troops under the terms of the order, and which should be\r\nconsidered as engaged in normal combat operations. The question was\r\nanswered by an order of 25 June 1944, one copy of which was signed by\r\nKeitel, reaffirming the full force of the original order. (_531-PS_;\r\n_551-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhen allied fliers were forced to land in Germany, they were sometimes\r\nkilled by the civilian population. The police had orders not to protect\r\nthe fliers, nor to punish civilians for lynching them. A proposal was\r\nconsidered to order the shooting without court-martial of enemy airmen\r\nwho had been forced down after engaging in specified “acts of terror.”\r\nIt is not certain that the order was ever issued, but it is certain that\r\nKeitel and Jodl knew of the lynchings, did nothing to prevent them and\r\nin fact considered giving them official justification.\r\n\r\n(_See also “F” at the end of Section 4 of this Chapter on Keitel, where\r\nthe joint responsibility of Keitel and Jodl for the lynching of Allied\r\nairmen is discussed._)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n     LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ALFRED JODL\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 66\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

ERNST KALTENBRUNNER\r\n\r\n A. _KALTENBRUNNER ENTERED THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST MOVEMENT IN ITS EARLY\r\n    STAGES, AND SUPPORTED IT, AND WAS A LEADER IN IT UNTIL THE END._\r\n\r\nErnst Kaltenbrunner was born on 4 October 1903 at Ried on Inn (near\r\nBraunau) Austria. He spent his youth in Hitler’s native district. Later\r\nhe moved to Linz, where he attended the State _Realgymnasium_. He\r\nstudied law and obtained a law degree in 1926. He spent the first year\r\nas apprentice lawyer at Linze-on-Danube and then worked as a\r\nlawyer-candidate, first at Salzburg and after 1928 at Linz (_2938-PS_).\r\n\r\nKaltenbrunner joined the Nazi Party and the SS in Austria in 1932. Prior\r\nto 1933 he was the District speaker (_Gauredner_) and legal counsellor\r\n(_Rechtsberater_) of the SS division (_Abschnitt_) VIII. After 1933 he\r\nwas the fuehrer of regiment (_Standarte_) 37 and later of the SS\r\ndivision VIII (_2892-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn January 1934 Kaltenbrunner was jailed by the Dollfuss government on\r\naccount of his Nazi views, and sent with other leading National\r\nSocialists into the concentration camp Kaisersteinbruch. He is said to\r\nhave started and led a hunger strike of the prisoners and thereby to\r\nhave forced the government to dismiss 490 National Socialist prisoners.\r\nIn the following year he was jailed again because of suspicion of High\r\nTreason and committed to the military court at Wels (Upper Danube).\r\nAfter an investigation of many months the accusation of High Treason was\r\ndropped, but he was condemned to six months’ imprisonment for\r\nconspiracy. His right to practice law was suspended because of his Nazi\r\nactivities (_2938-PS_).\r\n\r\nAfter the Spring of 1935 Kaltenbrunner was the leader of the Austrian\r\nSS. In the magazine of the SIPO and SD, issue of 15 May 1943, it is\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “It redounds to his credit that in this important position he\r\n    succeeded through energetic leadership in maintaining the unity\r\n    of the Austrian SS, which he had built up, in spite of all\r\n    persecution, and succeeded in committing it successfully at the\r\n    right moment. After the annexation, in which the SS was a\r\n    decisive factor, he was appointed State Secretary for Security\r\n    Matters on 11 March 1938 in the new National-Socialist cabinet\r\n    of Seyss-Inquart. A few hours later he was able to report to\r\n    Reichsfuehrer SS Heinrich Himmler, who had landed at Aspern, the\r\n    Vienna airport, on 12 March 1938, 3 a. m., as the first National\r\n    Socialist leader, that the Movement had achieved a complete\r\n    victory and that ‘The SS is in formation and awaiting further\r\n    orders.’” (_2938-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler promoted Kaltenbrunner on the date of the Anschluss to the rank\r\nof SS Brigadefuehrer and leader of the SS _Oberabschnitt_ Donau. On 11\r\nSeptember 1938 he was promoted to the rank of SS Gruppenfuehrer. During\r\nthe liquidation of the Austrian national government and the\r\nreorganization of Austria into Alps and Danube Districts, he was\r\nappointed Higher SS and Police Leader to the governors of Vienna, Lower\r\nDanube, and Upper Danube, in Corps Area (_Wehrkreis_) XVII, and in April\r\n1941 was promoted to Major General of the Police (_2938-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn 30 January 1943 Kaltenbrunner was appointed Chief of the Security\r\nPolice and SD (RSHA), succeeding Heydrich, who had been assassinated in\r\nPrague in June 1942. Kaltenbrunner held this position until the end of\r\nthe war (_2644-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn 4 October 1943 at Pozen, Poland, in a speech delivered to\r\nGruppenfuehrers of the SS, Himmler made special reference to “our\r\ncomrade Obergruppenfuehrer Kaltenbrunner, who has succeeded our fallen\r\nfriend Heydrich” (_1919-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn 9 December 1944 the decoration known as the Knight’s Cross of the War\r\nMerit, Cross with Swords, was given to SS Obergruppenfuehrer and General\r\nof the Police Dr. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Chief of the Security Police and\r\nthe SD (_2770-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn addition he held the Golden insignia of Honor and the _Blutorden_. He\r\nwas a member of the Reichstag after the 9th election period 1938\r\n(_2892-PS_).\r\n\r\nToward the end of the war, Kaltenbrunner’s power increased greatly,\r\nespecially after the attack on Hitler of 20 July 1944. He gained direct\r\naccess to Hitler. He was very friendly with Fegelein and his wife, who\r\nwas the sister of Eva Braun. So powerful had Kaltenbrunner become toward\r\nthe end that even Himmler feared him. On 13 April 1945 the chief of the\r\nGerman foreign intelligence service, Schellenberg, asked Himmler to\r\nreceive the representative of the Jewish World Congress, Mr. Storsch,\r\nfrom Stockholm, and Himmler said,\r\n\r\n    “But how am I going to do that in regard to Kaltenbrunner? I\r\n    shall then be completely at his mercy!” (_2990-PS_).\r\n\r\n   B. _DURING KALTENBRUNNER’S TERM IN OFFICE AS CHIEF OF THE SECURITY\r\n POLICE AND SD, NUMEROUS AND VAST CRIMES WERE COMMITTED BY THE SIPO AND\r\n                 SD IN THE COURSE OF OFFICIAL DUTIES._\r\n\r\nAs Chief of the Security Police after 30 January 1943, Kaltenbrunner was\r\nthe head of the RSHA and the regional offices of the Gestapo, SD, and\r\nKripo. Directly under Kaltenbrunner were the Chiefs of the main offices\r\nof the RSHA, including Amt III (the SD), Amt IV (the Gestapo), Amt V\r\n(the Kripo), and Amt VI (the SD in foreign intelligence) (_L-219_).\r\n\r\nKaltenbrunner had direct responsibility over the offices of the RSHA.\r\nAll important matters had to be referred to him or had to be handled\r\nunder general or special authority granted by him to office chiefs.\r\n\r\n    “All decisions of principal character are signed by the Chief of\r\n    the Security Police personally. An office chief has only the\r\n    authority to sign ‘acting for’ and a chairman ‘by order of’ if\r\n    the subjects treated in the respective decrees fit into the\r\n    general laid-down principles according to the plan of\r\n    distribution of authority. In case of doubt it was the duty to\r\n    get the question cleared up by reporting it to the Chief of\r\n    Security Police and SD.” (_L-34_)\r\n\r\n    “To my knowledge no chief of office or any of the officials of\r\n    the RSHA, authorized to sign, had the right to sign in any\r\n    principal affairs of particular political significance without\r\n    consent of the Chief of the Security Police—not even during his\r\n    temporary absence. From my own experience I can furthermore\r\n    declare that the chief of Amt IV, Mueller, particularly was very\r\n    hesitant in signing documents concerning questions of general\r\n    nature and in some cases of greater importance, and that he put\r\n    aside events of such nature in most cases for the return of the\r\n    Chief of the Security Police, whereby often much time was lost.”\r\n    (_L-50_).\r\n\r\nSchellenberg, the Chief of Amt VI of the RSHA, has stated:\r\n\r\n    “I know of no limitation placed on Kaltenbrunner’s authority as\r\n    Chief of the Security Police and SD (RSHA). He promptly entered\r\n    upon the duties of the office and assumed direct charge of the\r\n    office and control over the Amts * * * He made it very clear in\r\n    his official relations with all of us who were his _Amt_ Chiefs\r\n    that he was the head of the office exercising full executive\r\n    powers and deciding all matters of policy. He permitted us to\r\n    issue directives within the organization in our own names\r\n    pursuant to fixed policies established by him, but all important\r\n    matters had to be submitted to him whether he signed them or we\r\n    signed them. He was constantly informed of all matters of\r\n    importance which went on in the entire organization. (_2939-PS_)\r\n\r\nDuring Kaltenbrunner’s term in office as Chief of the Security Police\r\nand SD, the following crimes were committed by the SIPO and SD pursuant\r\nto policy established by the RSHA or orders issued out of the RSHA for\r\nall of which he was responsible by virtue of his office.\r\n\r\n(1) _Mass murders of civilians of occupied countries by Einsatz Groups._\r\nA general discussion of this and the following twelve crimes of the\r\n_Gestapo_ and SD appears in Section 6 of Chapter XV.

On the occasion\r\nof one such visit in 1942, Kaltenbrunner personally observed the gas\r\nchamber in operation (_2753-PS_). After he became Chief of the Security\r\nPolice and SD, Kaltenbrunner visited Mauthausen concentration camp but\r\nwith less frequency (_L-51_). On one occasion he made an inspection of\r\nthe camp grounds with Himmler and had his photograph taken during the\r\ncourse of the inspection (_2641-PS_). After a visit to Mauthausen in\r\n1944 Kaltenbrunner reported to his _Amt_ Chiefs with pride that he had\r\nhelped to build up Mauthausen when he was Higher SS and Police Leader in\r\nAustria and that the camp was engaged in valuable armament work\r\n(_2990-PS_). Mauthausen concentration camp was classified by Heydrich in\r\nJanuary 1941 in category III, a camp for the most heavily accused\r\nprisoners and for asocial prisoners who were considered incapable of\r\nbeing reformed (_1063-A-PS_).\r\n\r\nThere were frequent conferences between the RSHA and executives of the\r\nSS _Wirtschaft_ and _Verwaltungshauptamt_ who had charge of the internal\r\nadministration of concentration camps. The affidavit of Rudolf Mildner\r\nstates with respect to these conferences:\r\n\r\n    “SS Obergruppenfuehrer Dr. Kaltenbrunner attended personally\r\n    conferences with SS Obergruppenfuehrer Pohl, Chief of the SS\r\n    _Wirtschaft_ and _Verwaltungshauptamt_ and Chief of the\r\n    concentration camps. Due to these conferences and through talks\r\n    with the Chief of Office Gruppenfuehrer Mueller of _Amt_ IV and\r\n    Gruppenfuehrer Nebe of _Amt_ V, the Chief of the Security Police\r\n    and SD, SS Obergruppenfuehrer Dr. Kaltenbrunner, must have known\r\n    the state of affairs in the concentration camps.” (_L-35_)\r\n\r\n(2) _With full knowledge of conditions in and the purpose of\r\nconcentration camps, Kaltenbrunner ordered or permitted to be ordered in\r\nhis name the commitment of persons to concentration camps._ All orders\r\nfor protective custody other than short-term confinements were issued in\r\nthe name of Kaltenbrunner as Chief of the Security Police and SD and\r\nbore the facsimile stamp of his signature (_2477-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe commandant of Buchenwald concentration camp in his affidavit states:\r\n\r\n    “With the exception of the mass delivery of prisoners from the\r\n    concentration camps of occupied territories, all prisoners were\r\n    sent to the concentration camp Buchenwald on orders of the\r\n    _Reichssicherheitschauptamt_, Berlin. These preventive arrest\r\n    orders (red blanks) were in most cases signed with the name\r\n    Kaltenbrunner. The few other preventive arrest orders were\r\n    signed with ‘Foerster.’” (_L-38_)\r\n\r\nOn 7 July 1943 an order for protective custody was issued by the Gestapo\r\n(_Amt_ IV C 2, RSHA) bearing the facsimile signature of Kaltenbrunner,\r\nto be sent in the form of a telegram to the Gestapo office in Koeslin in\r\nthe case of a woman whose offense was stated to be failure to work, work\r\nsabotage, and asocial conduct. She was ordered to be confined in the\r\nconcentration camp at Ravensbrueck (_2745-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn 19 January 1944 a warrant for protective custody was issued by the\r\nGestapo (_Amt_ IV C 2 of the RSHA) certified as signed by Kaltenbrunner,\r\nto a British subject, C. S. James, on the grounds that he had been\r\nproven guilty of activities to the detriment of the German Reich, and\r\nthat there was reason to expect that he would, if released, commit acts\r\nprejudicial to the Reich (_1574-PS_).\r\n\r\nOther instances of commitments to various concentration camps on orders,\r\nsigned by Kaltenbrunner, are contained in the dossiers of 25\r\nLuxembourgers committed to concentration camps by the _Einsatzkommando_\r\nof the Sipo and SD in Luxembourg during the year 1944. The concentration\r\ncamps to which the persons were committed included Dachau, Natzweiler,\r\nSachsenhausen, and Buchenwald. Among the grounds were: “strongly\r\nsuspected of working to the detriment of the Reich;” “spiteful\r\nstatements inimical to Germany as well as aspersions and threats against\r\npersons active in the National Socialist movement;” “strongly suspected\r\nof aiding desertion;” “as relative of a deserter expected to take\r\nadvantage of every occasion to harm the German Reich.” (_L-215_).\r\n\r\nFurther orders for commitments to concentration camps are contained in\r\nfile of 42 telegrams, all issued by the RSHA, _Amt_ IV A 6, Prague, to\r\nthe Gestapo Office at Darmstadt, and all signed by Kaltenbrunner, during\r\nthe period from 20 September 1944 to 2 February 1945. The concentration\r\ncamps to which people were sent included Sachsenhausen, Ravensbrueck,\r\nBuchenwald, Dachau, Bergen-Belsen, Flossenburg, and Theresienstadt.\r\nNationalities included Czech, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Corsican,\r\nLithuanian, Greek, and Jew. Grounds included “refusal to work;”\r\n“religious propaganda;” “sex relations with PWs;” “communist\r\nstatements;” “loafing on job;” “working against the Reich;” “spreading\r\nof rumors detrimental to morale;” “_Aktion Gitter_;” “breach of work\r\ncontracts;” “statements against Germany;” “assault of foreman;”\r\n“defeatist statements;” “theft and escape from jail.” (_2239-PS_).\r\n\r\n(3) _Kaltenbrunner authorized executions in concentration camps._ Adolf\r\nZutter, the adjutant of Mauthausen concentration camp, avers that, until\r\nthe assassination of Heydrich, orders for executions at Mauthausen were\r\nsigned by Heydrich or his substitute, and that after Kaltenbrunner\r\nbecame Chief of the Security Police and SD they were signed either by\r\nKaltenbrunner or by his substitute, Mueller. Zutter mentions a specific\r\ninstance in which Kaltenbrunner ordered the execution of a group of 12\r\nto 15 uniformed members of an American military mission (_L-51_).\r\n\r\n(4) _Kaltenbrunner had knowledge of the commitment of thousands of\r\nWarsaw Poles to concentration camps and refused to release them._ During\r\nthe suppression of the Warsaw uprising of 1944, about 50,000 to 60,000\r\ninhabitants of Warsaw were sent to concentration camps. As a result of\r\nentreaties by Hans Frank to Himmler the deportation was stopped. Frank\r\nand Buehler, his State Secretary, requested Kaltenbrunner to release the\r\npersons who had been committed. Kaltenbrunner refused to release them on\r\nthe grounds they were employed in making secret weapons for the Reich\r\nand declared that the number transported into concentration camps in the\r\nReich was small. Buehler verified the fact that the number of persons so\r\nplaced in concentration camps for forced labor was 50,000 to 69,999\r\n(_2476-PS_).\r\n\r\n(5) _Kaltenbrunner controlled the deportation of Poles, Jews, and other\r\nnon-Germans from Poland._ Otto Hofmann, former Chief of the SS Main\r\nOffice for Race and Settlement Matters, stated:\r\n\r\n    “The execution of all so-called resettlement actions, that is,\r\n    the sending away of Polish, Jewish, and people of non-German\r\n    blood, inhabitants of a territory in Poland destined for\r\n    Germanization was in the hands of the Chief of the RSHA,\r\n    Heydrich, and, since the end of 1942, Kaltenbrunner.” (_L-49_).\r\n\r\n(6) _Kaltenbrunner ordered the deportation of Jews from Denmark._ In\r\nSeptember 1943 Himmler ordered the Danish Jews arrested and shipped to\r\nStettin and from there to Theresienstadt concentration camp. Mildner,\r\nthe Chief of the Sipo and SD, telegraphed the RSHA to request that the\r\nJewish persecutions be stopped. In reply he received an order from\r\nHimmler through Kaltenbrunner to carry out the anti-Jewish action.\r\nShortly thereafter Mildner flew to Berlin to speak to Kaltenbrunner\r\npersonally about the matter. In Kaltenbrunner’s absence he spoke to\r\nMueller. After his return to Copenhagen, Mildner received a direct order\r\nfrom Himmler through Kaltenbrunner to carry out the anti-Jewish actions\r\nimmediately (_2375-PS_).\r\n\r\n(7) _Kaltenbrunner personally exercised punitive authority over foreign\r\nworkers._ By order of Kaltenbrunner Labor Reformatory Camps were\r\nestablished under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Security Police\r\n(_1063-B-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn addition to sending workers to Labor Reformatory Camps,\r\nKaltenbrunner, through orders for protective custody signed by him or by\r\nfacsimile of his signature, committed workers to concentration camps. On\r\n9 February 1945 a French citizen was sent to Buchenwald by order of\r\nKaltenbrunner for shirking work and insubordinate behavior. On 18 June\r\n1943 a Pole was sent to Natzweiler “to be used as a skilled worker” by\r\norder of Kaltenbrunner. On 2 December 1944 a citizen of the Netherlands\r\nwas taken into protective custody “for work sabotage” by order of\r\nKaltenbrunner. On 2 December 1944 a French citizen was taken into\r\nprotective custody for “work sabotage and insubmissive” (_2582-PS_;\r\n_2580-PS_).\r\n\r\n(8) _Kaltenbrunner personally attended to matters against Jews and\r\npolitical and concentration camp internees in the Protectorate._ A\r\nmemorandum found among Kaltenbrunner’s personal effects states in part:\r\n\r\n    “Radio message to Gruppenfuehrer Fegelein Hq. of the Fuehrer\r\n    through Sturmbannfuehrer Sansoni, Berlin.\r\n\r\n    “Please report to RF SS and to the Fuehrer that all arrangements\r\n    against Jews, political and concentration camp internees in the\r\n    Protectorate have been taken care of by me personally today”\r\n    (_2519-PS_).\r\n\r\n(9) _Kaltenbrunner personally ordered the Sipo and SD to encourage the\r\npopulace to lynch American and English flyers._ In 1944 at a conference\r\nof _Amt_ Chiefs Kaltenbrunner said:\r\n\r\n    “All offices of the SD and the security police are to be\r\n    informed that pogroms of the populace against English and\r\n    American terror-fliers were not to be interfered with; on the\r\n    contrary, this hostile mood is to be fostered” (_2990-PS_).\r\n\r\n(10) _Kaltenbrunner personally worked out the form of justification to\r\nbe submitted to cover up the execution of prisoners of war._ In\r\nconnection with the shooting of some 50 recaptured prisoners of war who\r\nhad escaped from a prisoner of war camp near Breslau, Kaltenbrunner\r\nworked out with Mueller and Nebe the false reasons which were to be\r\ngiven to the Red Cross, that is, that they had been killed by bomb\r\nattacks, or shot while escaping or resisting arrest (_2990-PS_).\r\n\r\n                            D. _CONCLUSION._\r\n\r\nKaltenbrunner was a life-long fanatical Nazi. He was the leader of the\r\nSS in Austria prior to the Anschluss and played a leading role in the\r\nbetrayal of his native country to the Nazi conspirators. As Higher SS\r\nand Police Leader in Austria after the Anschluss he supervised and had\r\nknowledge of the activities of the Gestapo and the SD in Austria. He had\r\nmuch to do with developing Mauthausen concentration camp and visited it\r\nfrequently. On at least one occasion he observed the gas chamber in\r\naction. With this knowledge and background he accepted in January 1943\r\nappointment as chief of the very agencies which sent such victims to\r\ntheir deaths. He held that office to the end, rising to high prominence\r\nin the conspiracy, receiving honors from Hitler and gaining Hitler’s\r\npersonal confidence.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ERNST KALTENBRUNNER\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 59\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

ALFRED ROSENBERG\r\n\r\n                A. _THE POLITICAL CAREER OF ROSENBERG._\r\n\r\nThe political career of Alfred Rosenberg embraced the entire history of\r\nNational Socialism and permeated nearly every phase of the conspiracy.\r\nIn order to obtain a full conception of his influence upon and\r\nparticipation in the conspiracy, it is necessary to review his political\r\nhistory and to consider each of his political activities in their\r\nrelation to the thread of the conspiracy, which stretches from the\r\ninception of the party in 1919 to the defeat of Germany in 1945.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that for Rosenberg the 30th of November 1918\r\nmarked the\r\n\r\n    “Beginning of political activities with a lecture about the\r\n    ‘Jewish Problem’”. (_2886-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn official German pamphlet entitled, “Dates in the History of the\r\nNSDAP”, discloses that Rosenberg was a member of the German Labor Party\r\n(afterwards the National Socialist German Workers Party) in January\r\n1919, and that Hitler joined forces with Rosenberg and his colleagues in\r\nOctober of the same year (_3557-PS_). Thus, Rosenberg was a member of\r\nthe National Socialist movement even before Hitler himself.\r\n\r\nAn extract from “_Das Deutsche Fuehrer Lexikon_”, 1934/35 (_3530-PS_)\r\ncompletes the biographical data on Rosenberg:\r\n\r\n    “From 1921 until the present, editor of the _Voelkischer\r\n    Beobachter_; editor of the ‘N.S. Monatshefte’; 1930, Reichstag\r\n    deputy and representative of the foreign policy of the movement;\r\n    since April 1933, leader of the foreign political office of the\r\n    NSDAP; then designated as Reichsleiter; January 1934, deputized\r\n    by the Fuehrer for the spiritual and philosophical education of\r\n    the NSDAP, the German labor front and all related organizations”\r\n    (_3530-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn July 1941 Rosenberg was appointed Reichsminister for the Occupied\r\nEastern Territories. (_2886-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _ROSENBERG’S PART, AS OFFICIAL NAZI IDEOLOGIST, IN PREPARING FOR THE\r\n         SEIZURE OF POWER AND THE LAUNCHING OF AGGRESSIVE WAR._\r\n\r\nRosenberg was the official National Socialist ideologist. Through the\r\nideological tenets which he expounded he exerted an influence upon the\r\nunification of German thought, a unification which was an essential part\r\nof the conspirator’s program for seizure of power and preparation for\r\naggressive war.\r\n\r\nRosenberg wrote extensively on, and actively participated in, virtually\r\nevery aspect of the National Socialist program. His first publication\r\nwas the “Nature, Basic Principles, and Aims of the NSDAP”, which\r\nappeared in 1922. Rosenberg spoke of this book in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    “During this time (that is, during the early phase of the party)\r\n    a short thesis was written, which nevertheless is significant in\r\n    the history of the NSDAP. It was always being asked what points\r\n    of program the NSDAP had and how they each were to be\r\n    interpreted. Therefore, I wrote the principal program and aims\r\n    of the NSDAP, and this writing made the first permanent\r\n    connection between Munich and local organizations being\r\n    organized and friends within the Reich.” (_3054-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus, the original draftsman of and spokesman for the party program was\r\nRosenberg.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to survey the entire ideological program advanced by\r\nRosenberg in his various writings and speeches, certain of his\r\nstatements may be considered as indicating the nature and scope of the\r\nideological program which he championed. There was not a single basic\r\ntenet of the Nazi philosophy which was not given authoritative\r\nexpression by Rosenberg.\r\n\r\n(1) _The theory of racism._ Rosenberg wrote the “Myth of the Twentieth\r\nCentury”, published in 1930. At page 479 of this work (_3553-PS_),\r\nRosenberg expressed the following views on the race question:\r\n\r\n    “The essence of the contemporary world revolution lies in the\r\n    awakening of the racial types, not in Europe alone but on the\r\n    whole planet. This awakening is the organic counter movement\r\n    against the last chaotic remnants of liberal economic\r\n    imperialism, whose object of exploitation out of desperation has\r\n    fallen into the snare of Bolshevik Marxism, in order to complete\r\n    what democracy had begun, the extirpation of the racial and\r\n    national consciousness.” (_3553-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) “_Lebensraum_.” Rosenberg expounded the “_Lebensraum_” idea, which\r\nwas utilized as the dynamic impulse behind Germany’s waging of\r\naggressive war. In his journal, the “National Socialist _Monatshefte_”\r\nfor May 1932, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    “The understanding that the German nation, if it is not to\r\n    perish in the truest sense of the word, needs ground and soil\r\n    for itself and its future generations, and the second sober\r\n    perception that this soil can no more be conquered in Africa,\r\n    but in Europe and first of all in the East—these organically\r\n    determine the German foreign policy for centuries.” (_2777-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Persecution of Christian Churches._ Rosenberg expressed his theory\r\nas to the place of religion in the National Socialist State in the “Myth\r\nof the Twentieth Century”, additional excerpts from which are cited in\r\n(_2891-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “We now realize that the central supreme values of the Roman and\r\n    the Protestant Churches, being a negative Christianity, do not\r\n    respond to our soul, that they hinder the organic powers of the\r\n    peoples determined by their Nordic race, that they must give way\r\n    to them, that they will have to be remodeled to conform to a\r\n    Germanic Christendom. Therein lies the meaning of the present\r\n    religious search.” (_2891-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the place of traditional Christianity, Rosenberg sought to implant\r\nthe neo-pagan myth of the blood. At page 114 in the “Myth of the\r\nTwentieth Century” (_2891-PS_) he stated:\r\n\r\n    “Today, a new faith is awakening—the Myth of the Blood, the\r\n    belief that the divine being of mankind generally is to be\r\n    defended with the blood. The faith embodied by the fullest\r\n    realization, that the Nordic blood constitutes that mystery\r\n    which has supplanted and overwhelmed the old sacraments.”\r\n\r\nRosenberg’s attitudes on religion were accepted as the only philosophy\r\ncompatible with National Socialism. In 1940 Bormann, in writing to\r\nRosenberg, made this statement:\r\n\r\n    “The churches cannot be conquered by a compromise between\r\n    National Socialism and Christian teachings, but only through a\r\n    new ideology whose coming you yourself have announced in your\r\n    writings.” (_098-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg actively participated in the program for elimination of church\r\ninfluence. Bormann frequently wrote Rosenberg in this regard, furnishing\r\nhim information as to proposed action to be instituted against the\r\nchurches and, where necessary, requesting that action be taken by\r\nRosenberg’s department. See _070-PS_ dealing with the abolition of\r\nreligious services in the schools; _072-PS_ dealing with the\r\nconfiscation of religious property; _064-PS_ dealing with the inadequacy\r\nof anti-religious material circulated to the soldiers; _089-PS_ dealing\r\nwith the curtailment of the publication of Protestant periodicals; and\r\n_122-PS_ dealing with the closing of theological faculties.\r\n\r\n(4) _Persecution of the Jews._ Rosenberg was particularly zealous in his\r\npursuit of the “Jewish Question”. On 28 March 1941, on the occasion of\r\nthe opening of the Institute for the Exploration of the Jewish Question,\r\nhe set the keynote for its activities and indicated the direction which\r\nthe exploration was to take. He spoke in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “For Germany the Jewish Question is only then solved when the\r\n    Last Jew has left the Greater German space.\r\n\r\n    “Since Germany with its blood and its nationalism has now broken\r\n    for always this Jewish dictatorship for all Europe and has seen\r\n    to it that Europe as a whole will become free from the Jewish\r\n    parasitism once more, we may, I believe, also say for all\r\n    Europeans: For Europe the Jewish question is only then solved\r\n    when the last Jew has left the European continent.” (_2889-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg had called an Anti-Jewish Congress in June 1944, but the\r\nCongress was cancelled due to military events. (_1752-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg did not overlook any opportunity to put these anti-Semitic\r\nbeliefs into practice. He recommended for instance that instead of\r\nexecuting 100 Frenchmen as retaliation for attempts on lives of members\r\nof the _Wehrmacht_, there be executed 100 Jewish bankers, lawyers, etc.\r\n(_001-PS_). The recommendation was made with the avowed purpose of\r\nawakening the anti-Jewish sentiment.\r\n\r\n(5) _Abolition of Versailles Treaty._ In the realm of foreign policy, in\r\naddition to demanding “_Lebensraum_,” Rosenberg called for elimination\r\nof the Treaty of Versailles, and cast aside any thought of revision of\r\nthat treaty. In his book, “Nature, Principles and Aims of the NSDAP”,\r\nRosenberg wrote:\r\n\r\n    “The National Socialists reject the popular phrase of the\r\n    ‘Revision of the Peace of Versailles’ as such a revision might\r\n    perhaps bring a few numerical reductions in the so-called\r\n    ‘obligations,’ but the entire German people would still be, just\r\n    as before, the slave of other nations.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “‘We demand equality for the German people with other nations,\r\n    the cancellation of the peace treaties of Versailles and St.\r\n    Germain.’” (_2433-PS_)\r\n\r\n(6) _Foreign Nazi Penetration._ Rosenberg conceived of the spread of\r\nNational Socialism throughout the world and, as will be subsequently\r\nshown, took an active part in promoting the infection of other nations\r\nwith his creed. In the “Nature, Principles and Aims of the NSDAP”, he\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “But National Socialism still believes that its principles and\r\n    ideology though in individually different suitable ways of fight\r\n    according to racial-national conditions—will be directives far\r\n    beyond the borders of Germany for the inevitable fights for\r\n    power in other countries of Europe and America. There too a\r\n    decision of ideas must take place, and the racial-nationalistic\r\n    fight against the ever similar loan-capitalistic and Marxist\r\n    internationalism must be taken up. National Socialism believes\r\n    that once the great world battle is concluded, after the defeat\r\n    of the present epoch, there will be a time when the swastika\r\n    will be woven into the different banners of the Germanic peoples\r\n    as the Aryan symbol of rejuvenation.” (_2433-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus, Rosenberg gave authoritative expression to the basic tenets upon\r\nwhich National Socialism was founded, and through the exploitation of\r\nwhich the conspiracy was crystallized in action.\r\n\r\n(7) _Ideological training and education._ Rosenberg’s value to the\r\nconspiratorial program found official recognition in his appointment in\r\n1934 as the Fuehrer’s Delegate for the Entire Spiritual and\r\nPhilosophical Education and Supervision of the NSDAP. His activities in\r\nthis capacity were many and varied. The National Socialist Year Book for\r\nthe year 1938, at page 180, describes as follows the functions of\r\nRosenberg’s office as the Fuehrer’s delegate:\r\n\r\n    “The sphere of activity of the Fuehrer’s Commissioner for all\r\n    spiritual and ideological instruction and education of the\r\n    movement, its organization, including the ‘Strength through\r\n    Joy’, extends to the detailed execution of all the educational\r\n    work of the Party and of the affiliated bodies. The office, set\r\n    up by _Reichsleiter_ Rosenberg, has the task of preparing the\r\n    ideological educational material, of carrying out the teaching\r\n    programme, and is responsible for the education of those\r\n    teachers suited to this educational and instructional work.”\r\n    (_3531-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs the Fuehrer’s delegate, Rosenberg thus supervised all ideological\r\neducation and training in the Party.\r\n\r\nIt was Rosenberg’s belief that upon the performance of his new functions\r\nas ideological delegate depended the future of National Socialism. An\r\nexcerpt from an article by Rosenberg appearing on page 9 of the March\r\n1934 issue of “The Educational Letter” states:\r\n\r\n    “The focus of all our educational work from now on is the\r\n    service for this ideology, and it depends on the result of these\r\n    efforts, whether National Socialism will be buried with our\r\n    fighting ancestors or whether, as we believe, it really\r\n    represents the beginning of a new era.” (_3532-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn his capacity as the Fuehrer’s Delegate for Spiritual and Ideological\r\nTraining, Rosenberg assisted in the preparation of the curriculum for\r\nthe Adolf Hitler schools. These schools selected the most suitable\r\ncandidates from the Hitler Jugend and trained them for leadership within\r\nthe Party. They were the elite schools of National Socialism. An excerpt\r\nfrom “Documents of German Politics” reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_Voelkischer Beobachter_, 19 January 1937.—‘As stated by Dr.\r\n    Ley, _Reichsorganisationsleiter_, on 23 November 1937 at\r\n    Ordensburg Sonthofen, these Adolf Hitler Schools, as the first\r\n    step of the principle of selecting a special elite, form an\r\n    important branch in the educational system of the National\r\n    Socialist training of future leaders [_Fuehrernachwuchs_]’\r\n\r\n    “_Voelkischer Beobachter_ dated 24 November 1937.—* * * The\r\n    curriculum has been laid down by _Reichsleiter_ Rosenberg,\r\n    together with the _Reichsorganisationsleiter_ and the Reich\r\n    Youth Leader.” (_3529-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg exercised further influence in the education of Party members\r\nthrough the establishment of community schools for all organizations of\r\nthe Party. The following statement is taken from the 1934 edition of\r\n“_Das Dritte Reich_”:\r\n\r\n    “We support the request of the Fuehrer’s Commissioner for the\r\n    supervision of the whole spiritual and ideological training and\r\n    instruction of the NSDAP, Party member Alfred Rosenberg, to\r\n    organize _community schools_ of all organizations of the NSDAP\r\n    twice a year, in order to show by this common effort the\r\n    ideological and political unity of the NSDAP and the\r\n    steadfastness of the National Socialist will.” (_3528-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg’s program was endorsed by Schirach as well as by Himmler, Ley,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nVirtually every phase of National Socialist training came under\r\nRosenberg’s influence, and unified ideological concepts were inculcated\r\nin every echelon of the party due to his influence. The 1936 edition of\r\n“_Das Dritte Reich_”, under the heading “Education in the Ordensburg”\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “Those Party members, selected for training in leadership in\r\n    accordance with such points of view (who must have completed\r\n    their labor service and their military service satisfactorily)\r\n    are to be taught in the Ordensburgen by the best teachers in\r\n    history and science of race, philosophy and culture, economics\r\n    and specialized training, etc. To determine the ideological\r\n    direction of this education, to choose suitable teachers and to\r\n    train them, is one of the tasks of the Senior School of the\r\n    Party [_Hohe Schule der Partei_] which is to be established in\r\n    the near future and will be placed under the direction of the\r\n    Reich Leader Party member Alfred Rosenberg in his capacity as\r\n    Delegate of the Fuehrer for the Supervision of the Entire\r\n    Spiritual and Ideological Teaching and Education of the NSDAP.”\r\n    (_3552-PS_)\r\n\r\n(8) _Plunder of art treasures._ In his capacity as the Fuehrer’s\r\ndelegate, Rosenberg established the Institute for the Exploration of the\r\nJewish Question, in Frankfort on Main. (This institute, commonly known\r\nas the “_Hohe Schule_”, has been referred to in the discussion of the\r\nPlunder of Art Treasures in Chapter XIV.) Into its library there flowed\r\nbooks, documents, and manuscripts which were looted from virtually every\r\ncountry of occupied Europe. As Ideological Delegate Rosenberg conducted\r\nthe fabulous art looting activities of the _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_,\r\nactivities which extended to France, Belgium, the Netherlands,\r\nLuxembourg, Norway, Denmark, the Occupied Eastern Territories, Hungary,\r\nand Greece. The extent of the plunder is indicated in document\r\n_1015-B-PS_ which contains a detailed account of the seizure of over\r\n21,000 valuable objects of art, and in document _L-188_ in which the\r\nlooting of the contents of over 71,000 Jewish homes is described.\r\n\r\nThe importance of Rosenberg’s activities as official ideologist of the\r\nNazi party was not overlooked. The Hart biography of Rosenberg,\r\nentitled, “The Man and His Work” (_3559-PS_), states that Rosenberg won\r\nthe German National prize in 1937. The creation of this prize was the\r\nNazis’ petulant reply to the award of the Nobel prize to Carlin\r\nAssietsky, an inmate of a German concentration camp. The citation which\r\naccompanied the award to Rosenberg read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Alfred Rosenberg has helped with his publications to lay the\r\n    scientific and intuitive foundation and to strengthen the\r\n    philosophy of the National Socialist in the most excellent way.\r\n    His indefatigable struggle to keep National Socialist philosophy\r\n    clean was especially meritorious. Only future times will be able\r\n    to fully estimate the depth of the influence of this man on the\r\n    philosophical foundation of the National Socialist Reich. The\r\n    National Socialist movement, and beyond that, the entire German\r\n    people, will be deeply gratified that the Fuehrer has\r\n    distinguished Alfred Rosenberg as one of his oldest and most\r\n    faithful fighting comrades by awarding him the German National\r\n    Prize.” (_3559-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe contribution which Rosenberg’s book, “The Myth of the Twentieth\r\nCentury,” made to Nazi ideological propaganda was appraised in the\r\nNovember 1942 edition of the official National Socialist book review\r\npublication, “_Bucher Kunde_”, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Next to the Fuehrer’s book it has contributed to a unique\r\n    extent to the rise and the spiritual and physical development of\r\n    this people. Twelve years after Alfred Rosenberg’s ‘Mythus’\r\n    first appeared, a million copies of the book have been published\r\n    and circulated.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It must therefore be stated that the phrases coined by Alfred\r\n    Rosenberg have passed into the consciousness of the whole\r\n    people, and it is just today that they are proving pillars of an\r\n    ideological building whose completion is the purpose of the\r\n    fight being waged not least today.” (_3554-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe significance of ideological training in promoting the aims of the\r\nconspiracy is emphasized in a brief statement which Hitler made to his\r\nsupreme commanders on 23 November 1939. On that occasion, Hitler said:\r\n\r\n    “The building up of our armed forces was only possible in\r\n    connection with the ideological education of the German people\r\n    by the Party.” (_789-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe contribution which Rosenberg made through formulation and\r\ndissemination of National Socialist ideology was fundamental to the\r\nconspiracy. As apostle of neo-paganism, exponent of the drive for\r\n“_Lebensraum_,” glorifier of the myth of nordic superiority, and as one\r\nof the oldest and most energetic Nazi proponents of anti-Semitism, he\r\ncontributed materially to unification of the German people behind the\r\nswastika. He provided the impetus and philosophy of National Socialism.\r\n\r\n C. _ROSENBERG’S ACTIVITIES ABROAD, THROUGH THE APA, IN PREPARATION FOR\r\n                            AGGRESSIVE WAR._\r\n\r\nRosenberg also actively contributed toward the preparation for\r\naggressive war through the international activities of the APA (The\r\nForeign Policy Office of the NSDAP). Rosenberg became a _Reichsleiter_,\r\nthe highest level of rank in the Leadership Corps, and was made chief of\r\nthe Foreign Political Office of the NSDAP in April 1933 (_3530-PS_). The\r\nOrganizational Manual of the NSDAP (_2319-PS_) describes the functions\r\nof the APA as including the influencing of public opinion abroad so as\r\nto convince foreign nations that Nazi Germany desires peace. The\r\nfollowing excerpt indicates the far-flung activities of the APA:\r\n\r\n    “* * * II. 1. The APA is divided into three main offices:\r\n\r\n    “A. Office for Foreign Referats with the Main Offices.\r\n\r\n     _a._ England and Far East\r\n     _b._ Near East\r\n     _c._ South East\r\n     _d._ North\r\n     _e._ Old Orient\r\n     _f._ Controls, personnel questions, etc.\r\n\r\n    “B. Office of the German Academic Exchange Service.\r\n\r\n    “C. Office of Foreign Commerce.\r\n\r\n    “2. Moreover, there is in the APA a main office for the press\r\n    service and an educational office.” (_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Press activities of the APA, designed to influence world opinion in\r\nsuch a manner as to conceal the conspirators’ true purposes and thus\r\nfacilitate the preparation for waging aggressive war, were conducted on\r\nan ambitious scale. “A Short Report on the Activities of the APA of the\r\nNSDAP” describes the press activities as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * _The Press_: The Press Division of the APA is comprised\r\n    of persons who together master all the languages that are in\r\n    use. Daily they examine approximately 300 newspapers and deliver\r\n    to the Fuehrer, the deputy Fuehrer, and all other interested\r\n    offices the condensations of the important trends of the entire\r\n    world press. I know that these press reports are highly praised\r\n    by all who constantly follow them. The Press Division\r\n    furthermore conducts an exact archives on the attitudes of the\r\n    most important papers of the world and an exact archives on the\r\n    most important journalists of the world. Many embarrassments\r\n    during conferences in Germany could have been avoided had one\r\n    consulted these archives (case of Leumas, Nurnberg, 1934; case\r\n    of Dorothy Thompson; and others). Further, the Press Division\r\n    was able to arrange a host of interviews as well as conducting a\r\n    great number of friendly foreign journalists to the various\r\n    official representatives of Germany.” (_003-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe nature and extent of the activities of the APA are amply disclosed\r\nin a “Report on the Activities of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the\r\nParty from 1933 to 1943,” signed by Rosenberg (_007-PS_). This report\r\ncontains a recital of widespread activities in foreign countries. These\r\nactivities range from the promotion of economic penetration, to\r\nfomentation of anti-Semitism; from cultural and political infiltration\r\nto the instigation of treason. Activities were carried on throughout the\r\nworld and extended to such widely separated points as the Middle East\r\nand Brazil. (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\n(1) _Activities in Hungary, Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg._ Much of\r\nthe APA’s achievements were brought about through the subtle\r\nexploitation of personal relationship. Activities in Hungary proceeded\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * _The first foreign state visit after the seizure of power\r\n    took place through the mediation of the Foreign Affairs Bureau._\r\n    Julius Gombos, who in former years had himself pursued\r\n    anti-Semitic and racial tendencies, had reached the Hungarian\r\n    Premier’s chair. The Bureau maintained a personal connection\r\n    with him.” (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe APA endeavored to strengthen the War Economy by shifting the source\r\nof food imports to the Balkans:\r\n\r\n    “Motivated by reasons of War Economy, the Bureau advocated _the\r\n    transfer of raw material purchases from overseas_ to the areas\r\n    accessible by overland traffic routes, i.e., primarily _in the\r\n    Balkans_, naturally insofar as practicable. At first little heed\r\n    was paid to the Bureau in these endeavors, but it later secured\r\n    the active support especially of the Food Estate [_Naeurstand_].\r\n    Through its cooperation, e.g., on the subject of fruit and\r\n    vegetable imports, a very substantial shift in the source of\r\n    imports was attained, particularly through the currently\r\n    initiated cooperation with Croatian and Hungarian cooperatives\r\n    as well as with commercial associations all over the Balkans.”\r\n    (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\nActivities in Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg were confined to\r\n“observation of existing conditions” and “to the establishment of\r\nrelations, especially of a commercial nature.” (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Activities in Iran, Afghanistan, and Iraq._ In Iran the APA\r\nachieved a high degree of economic penetration, in addition to promoting\r\ncultural relations:\r\n\r\n    “The Bureau’s initiative in developing, with the help of\r\n    commercial circles, entirely new methods for the economic\r\n    penetration of Iran found expression, in an extraordinarily\r\n    favorable way, in reciprocal trade relations.\r\n\r\n    “Naturally in Germany, too, this initiative at first encountered\r\n    a completely negative attitude and resistance on the part of the\r\n    competent state authorities, an attitude that had first to be\r\n    overcome.\r\n\r\n    “In the course of a few years the volume of trade with Iran was\r\n    multiplied five-fold, and in 1939 Iran’s trade turnover with\r\n    Germany had attained first place. Even Soviet Russia, the\r\n    competitor who had been biggest and most dreaded previously, had\r\n    been eliminated from the running. Concurrently with activation\r\n    of commercial relations, the Bureau had also intensified\r\n    cultural relations and had, in conjunction with growing\r\n    commercial influence and in closest collaboration with the\r\n    Iranian Government, created a series of cultural institutions\r\n    headed and directed by Germans.” (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg further reports on APA activities in other parts of the world:\r\n\r\n    “Afghanistan’s neutral position today is largely due to the\r\n    Bureau’s activity.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The _Arab question_, too, became part of the work of the\r\n    Bureau. In spite of England’s tutelage of _Iraq_ the Bureau\r\n    established a series of connections to a number of leading\r\n    personalities of the Arab world, smoothing the way for strong\r\n    bonds to Germany. In this connection, the growing influence of\r\n    the Reich in Iran and Afghanistan did not fail to have\r\n    repercussions in Arabia.” (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn view of the numerous “personal connections” maintained by the Bureau\r\nin many different countries, it is not difficult to surmise what\r\nRosenberg meant when he stated at the conclusion of his report:\r\n\r\n    “The Bureau has carried out the initiating of all politically\r\n    feasible projects. With the outbreak of war it [the APA] was\r\n    entitled to consider its task as terminated. The exploitation of\r\n    the many _personal_ connections in many lands can be resumed\r\n    under a different guise.\r\n\r\n                                   “(Signed)  Rosenberg” (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Activities in Rumania._ Annex Two of the report deals with\r\nactivities in Rumania. Here the APA’s intrigue was more insidious, its\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of a foreign nation more\r\npronounced. After describing the failure of what Rosenberg terms a\r\n“basically sound anti-Semitic tendency”, due to dynastic squabbles and\r\nparty fights, Rosenberg describes the APA’s influence in the unification\r\nof conflicting elements:\r\n\r\n    “What was lacking was the guiding leadership of a political\r\n    personality. After manifold groping trials the Bureau believed\r\n    to have found such a personality—the former Minister and poet,\r\n    Octavian Goga. It was not difficult to convince this poet,\r\n    pervaded by instinctive inspiration, that a Greater Rumania,\r\n    though it had to be created in opposition to Vienna, could be\r\n    maintained only together with Berlin. Nor was it difficult to\r\n    create in him the desire to link the fate of Rumania with the\r\n    future of the National-Socialist German Reich in good time. By\r\n    bringing continuing influence to bear, the Bureau succeeded in\r\n    inducing Octavian Goga as well as Professor Cuza to amalgamate\r\n    the parties under their leadership on an Anti-Semitic basis.\r\n    Thus they could carry on with united strength the struggle for\r\n    Rumania’s renascence internally, and her _Anschluss_ with\r\n    Germany externally. Through the Bureau’s initiative both\r\n    parties, which had heretofore been known by distinct names, were\r\n    merged as the National-Christian Party, under Goga’s leadership\r\n    and with Cuza as Honorary President.” (_007-PS, Annex II_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg’s man, Goga, was supported by two “splinter parties” which had\r\nnot joined the anti-Semitic trend of these two parties. Rosenberg has\r\nthis to say:\r\n\r\n    “_Through intermediaries_, the Bureau _maintained constant\r\n    contact_ with both tendencies, just as it constantly consulted\r\n    with Goga, through Staff Director [Stabsleiter] Schickendanz,\r\n    about tactics to be followed.” (_007-PS, Annex II_)\r\n\r\nGoga was appointed Prime Minister by the King in December 1937. The\r\ninfluence of Rosenberg’s ideology had achieved a major triumph, for he\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “_Thus a second government on racial and anti-Semitic\r\n    foundations had appeared in Europe, in a country in which such\r\n    an event had been considered completely impossible._” (_007-PS,\r\n    Annex II_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg’s intrigues made a significant contribution to Nazi\r\npreparations for aggressive war, and the benefit to Germany’s position\r\nin the Balkans was great. Rosenberg reports that upon Goga’s resignation\r\nhe left a personal heir in Marshal Antonescu, who was appointed by Goga\r\nas Minister of War against the wishes of the King. Of Antonescu\r\nRosenberg says:\r\n\r\n    “After Goga’s resignation, Antonescu still remained in the\r\n    king’s cabinet at Goga’s wish. He also maintained continued\r\n    relations with the Iron Guard. Thereby the possibility of\r\n    eliminating the king was at hand—and was exploited. Antonescu\r\n    today appears in practice as executor of the heritage bequested\r\n    to him by Goga, who had led him from political insignificance\r\n    into the political arena. Thereby a change to Germany’s liking\r\n    had become possible in Rumania.\r\n\r\n                                   “(Signed) Rosenberg.” (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that on 5 September 1940 Antonescu became President\r\nof the Rumanian Council of Ministers and immediately suspended the\r\nRumanian constitution. King Carol abdicated on the following day, and\r\nRumania existed as a German satellite throughout the war. Rosenberg’s\r\naims had been achieved.\r\n\r\nThe substantial contribution which Rosenberg had thus made to Germany’s\r\nstrategic plans for aggressive war is evident from a brief review of the\r\nmilitary action which followed in the wake of his political maneuvers.\r\nShortly after King Carol’s abdication Antonescu “invited” German troops\r\nto “protect” the Rumanian oil fields. When Hungary subscribed to the\r\nAxis pact a few weeks later, Germany acquired a continuous land bridge\r\nto the Black Sea, through Austria, Hungary, and Rumania. When Bulgaria\r\nsubscribed to the Pact in March 1941, a German thrust southward through\r\nYugoslavia and Greece became feasible, for with Hungary, Rumania, and\r\nBulgaria secure, the entire German eastern flank was safe from attack. A\r\nmonth later, Yugoslavia and Greece were invaded. Only when they were\r\novercome was Germany free to attack the Soviet Union. Seven weeks after\r\nthe fall of Crete, Germany launched her war on the U.S.S.R. Thus,\r\nRosenberg’s intrigue in Rumania provided a vital link in the chain of\r\nthe German strategy of aggression.\r\n\r\n(4) _Relations with Quisling in Norway._ Rosenberg also played a leading\r\nrole in the development of fifth-column activities in Norway. He\r\nfostered the development of close relations between Germany and\r\nQuisling, procured financial backing for Quisling’s activities, and\r\nbrought him into contact with Raeder and Hitler. Rosenberg kept the\r\nReich informed as to internal developments in Norway through his\r\ncontacts with Hagelin, Quisling’s deputy, and took an active part in the\r\ndevelopment of plans for a Quisling coup in Norway. The record is clear\r\nthat Rosenberg provided the inspiration and the means for the betrayal\r\nof Norway by Quisling and Hagelin—treason for which the Norwegian\r\nGovernment has tried, condemned, and executed them. (_007-PS_; _C-64_;\r\n_C-65_; _C-66_; _004-PS_; _957-PS_)\r\n\r\nD. _ROSENBERG’S PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND\r\n     CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN THE OCCUPIED EASTERN TERRITORIES._\r\n\r\nRosenberg participated in the conspiracy to commit war crimes and crimes\r\nagainst humanity in the areas of the Occupied East which he administered\r\nfor over three years. This area included the Baltic States, White\r\nRuthenia and the Ukraine, and the Eastern portion of Poland.\r\n\r\n(The mass murder and mistreatment of the Eastern peoples, and the\r\nspoliation of their territories is discussed in Chapter X on Forced\r\nLabor, Chapter XIII on Germanization and Spoliation, Chapter XI on\r\nConcentration Camps, Chapter XII on Persecution of the Jews, Section 5\r\nof Chapter XV on the SS, and Section 6 of Chapter XV on the Gestapo and\r\nSD.) Rosenberg bears personal responsibility for these crimes.\r\n\r\nRosenberg may contend that some of these crimes were committed against\r\nhis wishes. There is, indeed, some evidence that he protested on\r\noccasion, not out of humanitarian reasons, but on the ground of\r\npolitical expediency. Rosenberg may also attempt to place the blame for\r\nthese crimes on other agencies and other defendants. The documents\r\nprove, however, that he himself formulated the harsh policies in the\r\nexecution of which the crimes were committed; that the crimes were\r\ncommitted for the most part by persons and agencies within his\r\njurisdiction and control; that the other agencies which participated in\r\nthe commission of these crimes were invited by him to cooperate in the\r\nadministration of the East, although the brutal methods customarily\r\nemployed by them were common knowledge; and that his Ministry lent full\r\ncooperation to their activities despite the criminal methods that were\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n(1). _Activities as “Commissioner for the Central Control of Questions\r\nConnected with the East European Region.”_ Rosenberg was actively\r\nparticipating in the affairs of the East as early as 20 April 1941, two\r\nmonths prior to the German attack upon the Soviet Union. On that date he\r\nwas designated by Hitler as “Commissioner for the Central Control of\r\nQuestions connected with the East European Region” (_865-PS_). The\r\ninitial preparations undertaken by Rosenberg for fulfillment of his new\r\ntask indicate the extent to which he cooperated in promoting the\r\nmilitary plans for aggression. They also show that he understood his\r\ntask as requiring the assistance of a multitude of Reich agencies and\r\nthat he invited their cooperation.\r\n\r\nShortly after his appointment by Hitler, Rosenberg conducted a series of\r\nconferences with representatives of various Reich agencies (_1039-PS_).\r\nCooperation of the following agencies in the administration of the\r\nEastern Territories was contemplated and solicited by Rosenberg:\r\n\r\n    OKW\r\n    OKH\r\n    OKM\r\n    Ministry of Economy\r\n    Commissioner for the Four Year Plan\r\n    Ministry of the Interior\r\n    Reich Youth Leadership\r\n    German Labor Front\r\n    Ministry of Labor\r\n    The SS\r\n    and the SA—(as well as several others). (_1039-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese arrangements, it should be noted, were made by Rosenberg in his\r\ncapacity as Commissioner on Eastern Questions—before the attack on the\r\nSoviet Union, before Rosenberg was appointed Minister of the Occupied\r\nEast, and before there was any Occupied Eastern Territory for Germany to\r\nadminister.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _“Solution” of the Jewish Problem._ Emphasis must be placed on\r\nRosenberg’s basic attitudes regarding his new task, and the directives\r\nhe knew he would be expected to follow. On 29 April 1941 he stated:\r\n\r\n    “A general treatment is required for the Jewish problem for\r\n    which a temporary solution will have to be determined (forced\r\n    labor for the Jews, creation of Ghettos, etc.)” (_1024-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 8 May 1941, instructions were prepared for all Reich Commissars in\r\nthe Occupied Eastern Territories (_1030-PS_). The last paragraph of\r\nthese instructions reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “From the point of view of cultural policy, the German Reich is\r\n    in a position to promote and direct national culture and science\r\n    in many fields. It will be necessary that in some territories an\r\n    uprooting and resettlement of various racial stocks\r\n    [_Voelkerschaften_] will have to be effected.” (_1030-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn his “Instructions for a Reich Commissar in the Baltic Countries and\r\nWhite Russia” (officially referred to together as the “Ostland”),\r\nRosenberg directs that the Ostland be transformed into a part of the\r\nGreater German Reich by Germanizing racially possible elements,\r\ncolonizing Germanic races, and banishing undesirable elements.\r\n(_1029-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a speech delivered by Rosenberg on 20 June 1941 he stated that the\r\njob of feeding Germans was the top of Germany’s claim on the East; that\r\nthere was no obligation to feed also the Russian peoples; that this was\r\na harsh necessity bare of any feeling; that a very extensive evacuation\r\nwould be necessary; and that the future would hold many hard years in\r\nstore for the Russians. (_1058-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn 22 June 1941 the German armies invaded the U.S.S.R.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Deportation of Prisoners of War for Labor in the Reich._ On 4\r\nJuly 1941 a representative of the Rosenberg Bureau attended a conference\r\non the subject of mobilization of labor and utilization of Soviet\r\nprisoners of war. A memorandum of this conference (_1199-PS_) states\r\nthat among the participants were representatives of the Commissioner for\r\nthe Four-Year Plan, of the Reich Labor Ministry, of the Reich Food\r\nMinistry, and of the Rosenberg Bureau. The conference proceeded as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “After an introduction by Lt. Col. Dr. Krull, Lt. Col. Breyer of\r\n    the P.W. department explained that actually there was in effect\r\n    a prohibition by the Fuehrer against bringing Russian P.W.’s\r\n    into the Reich for mobilization of labor [_Arbeitseinsatz_]; but\r\n    that one might count on this prohibition being relaxed a\r\n    little.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The chairman summarized the results of the discussion as\r\n    indicating that all the interested bureaus unqualifiedly\r\n    advocated and supported the demand for utilization of P.W.’s\r\n    because of manpower needs [_Arbeitseinsatz_] in the Reich. The\r\n    War Economy and Armament office will approach the Commissioner\r\n    for the Four-Year Plan with a request for relaxation of the\r\n    restrictive regulations and express to the Chief of Operational\r\n    Staff of the Armed Forces its point of view, accordingly.”\r\n    (_1199-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Germanization._ On 16 July 1941, the day before Rosenberg’s\r\nappointment as Minister of the Occupied East, he attended a conference\r\nat the Fuehrer’s Headquarters. At that time Hitler stated that\r\n\r\n    “The Crimea has to be evacuated by all foreigners and to be\r\n    settled by Germans alone.” (_L-221_)\r\n\r\nHitler further stated that Germany’s objectives in the East were\r\nthree-fold, first, to dominate it; second, to administer it; third, to\r\nexploit it. (_L-221_)\r\n\r\nThus, the character of the administration contemplated for the Occupied\r\nEast was well established before Rosenberg took office as Minister of\r\nthe Occupied East. He knew of these plans and was in accord with them.\r\nPersecution of the Jews, forced labor of prisoners of war, Germanization\r\nand exploitation were basic points of policy at the time he assumed\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n(2) _Activities as Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories._ On 17\r\nJuly 1941 Hitler appointed Rosenberg as Reichsminister for the Occupied\r\nEastern Territories, territories which included nearly all the area\r\nseized by Germany from the U. S. S. R. (_1997-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Rosenberg’s complete control over, knowledge of, and\r\nresponsibility for all non-military German activities and policies in\r\nthe occupied Eastern Territories._ The organizational structure and\r\nchain of responsibility within the Ministry for the Occupied East\r\nemphasizes Rosenberg’s responsibility.\r\n\r\nA treatise entitled “The Organization of the Administration of the\r\nOccupied Eastern Territories” (_1056-PS_) is undated and unsigned, but\r\nfurther information regarding it may be obtained by reference to\r\ndocument _EC-347_, Goering’s “Green Folder.” Part II, subsection of\r\n_EC-347_ is entitled,\r\n\r\n    “Excerpts from the Directives of the Reich Minister for the\r\n    Occupied Eastern Territories for the Civilian Administration.\r\n    (Brown Folder, Pt. I, pp. 25-30).” (_EC-347_)\r\n\r\nThe two paragraphs which follow are identical to two paragraphs found in\r\ndocument _1056-PS_. Thus, _1056-PS_ is identified as being a\r\nreproduction of Part I of the Brown Folder which was mentioned in the\r\n“Green Folder,” and was issued by the Reich Minister for the Occupied\r\nEastern Territories.\r\n\r\nThe directives issued by the Rosenberg Ministry itself (_1056-PS_) prove\r\nthe extent of Rosenberg’s authority: he was the Supreme civilian\r\nauthority in the Eastern Territories. There was a continuous chain of\r\ncommand from Rosenberg down to regional administrative officials,\r\nextending even to the local prison warden (_1056-PS_). The relationship\r\nwhich existed between the Rosenberg Ministry and other German agencies\r\nvaried from full control by Rosenberg, to close cooperation with them\r\nmade mandatory by his directives and by Hitler’s orders. Finally, the\r\nvarious subdivisions of the Ministry, were required to submit\r\nperiod-reports of the situation within their jurisdiction—so that the\r\nnumerous reports of brutality which Rosenberg received were submitted to\r\nhim pursuant to his orders. (_1056-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe treatise on the organization of Rosenberg’s ministry states as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “The newly occupied Eastern Territories are subordinated to the\r\n    Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories. By\r\n    directions of the Fuehrer he establishes a civil administration\r\n    there upon withdrawal of the military administration. He heads\r\n    and supervises the entire administration of this area and\r\n    represents the sovereignty of the Reich in the occupied Eastern\r\n    Territories.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “To the Reich Ministry is assigned a deputy of the Reich Leader\r\n    SS and Chief of the German Police in the Reich Ministry of the\r\n    Interior.” (_1056-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of the Reich Commissars is described as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In the Reich Commissariats, Reich Commissars are responsible\r\n    for the entire civil administration under the supreme authority\r\n    of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories.\r\n    According to the instructions of the Reich Minister for the\r\n    Occupied Eastern Territories the Reich Commissar, as a\r\n    functionary of the Reich, heads and supervises, within his\r\n    precincts, the entire civil administration. Within the scope of\r\n    these instructions he acts on his own responsibility.\r\n\r\n    “Subordinate offices of the Reich Commissar are:\r\n\r\n    “General Commissariats,\r\n\r\n    “Main Commissariats,\r\n\r\n    “District Commissariats.” (_1056-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe SS was placed under Rosenberg’s jurisdiction and control:\r\n\r\n    “The Higher SS- and Police Leader is directly subordinated to\r\n    the Reich Commissar. However, the Chief of Staff has the general\r\n    right to secure information from him also. His official title\r\n    is:\r\n\r\n    ‘The Reich Commissar for the Eastern Territory The Higher\r\n    SS- and Police Leader.’\r\n\r\n    “Great stress is to be placed on close cooperation between him,\r\n    the Chief of Staff, and the other Main Department Heads of the\r\n    office of the Reich Commissar, particularly with the one for\r\n    Policies.” (_1056-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe scope of Rosenberg’s control over the SS in the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories is revealed in a decree signed by Rosenberg, dated 17 July\r\n1941, and found in the _Verordnungsblatt_ of the Reich Minister for the\r\nOccupied East, 1942 #2, pages 7 and 8. This decree provides for the\r\ncreation of summary courts-martial to punish crimes committed by\r\nnon-Germans in the East, as determined by the Reich Commissar. The\r\ncourts are to be presided over by a police officer or an SS leader, who\r\nhave authority to order the death sentence and confiscation of property,\r\nand whose decisions are not subject to appeal. The General Commissar is\r\ngiven the right to reject a summary Courts’ decision. Thus, the\r\ndetermination of the SS is subordinated to the authority of Rosenberg’s\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\nThe position of the General Commissar is defined as follows in the\r\norganizational treatise:\r\n\r\n    “The General Commissar forms the administrative office of\r\n    intermediate appeal. Within his jurisdiction he heads the\r\n    administration according to the general directives of the Reich\r\n    Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories and the\r\n    prescriptions of the Reich Commissar.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The SS- and _Police Leader_ assigned to the General Commissar\r\n    is directly subordinated to him; however, the Chief of Staff has\r\n    the general right of requiring information from him.”\r\n    (_1056-PS_)\r\n\r\nRegional Commissars are described as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Regional Commissar heads the entire administration of the\r\n    lower administrative office in the Circuit District\r\n    [_Kreisgebiet_] in accordance with the instructions of the\r\n    General Commissar and the superior offices * * *. The leader of\r\n    the police unit assigned to him is directly subordinated to\r\n    him.” (_1056-PS_)\r\n\r\nMain Commissars are described in these terms:\r\n\r\n    “Upon recommendation by the Reich Commissar the Reich Minister\r\n    for the Occupied Eastern Territories appoints Main Commissars\r\n    for Main Districts formed by the consolidation of several\r\n    Circuit Districts.” (_1056-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe order of superiority in the service among these various officials is\r\nstated as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories is the\r\n    service superior of the Reich Commissar and the officials and\r\n    the employees subordinate to them. The Reich Commissar is the\r\n    superior of all officials and employees of his office and of the\r\n    offices subordinate to him. The General Commissar is the\r\n    superior of the officials and employees of his office and of the\r\n    officials and employees of the offices of the Main and Regional\r\n    Commissars. The Main Commissar and the Regional Commissar are\r\n    the superior of the officials and employees of their offices.”\r\n    (_1056-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus, there is a continuous chain of command and of accountability from\r\nthe Reich Minister, Rosenberg, down through each subdivision of the\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Rosenberg had authority to legislate for the entire area,\r\nand the jurisdiction of his Ministry was exclusive, aside from that of\r\nthe military. The organizational treatise states:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Commissars, General Commissars, Main Commissars and\r\n    Regional Commissars (City Commissars) are—aside from the\r\n    military agencies—the only Reich authorities\r\n    [_Reichsbehoerden_] in the Occupied Eastern Territories. Other\r\n    Reich authorities may not be established alongside them. They\r\n    handle all questions of administration of the area which is\r\n    subordinate to their sovereignty and all affairs which concern\r\n    the organization and activity of the administration including\r\n    those of the Police in the supervision of the native\r\n    [_landeseigenen_] agencies and organizations, and of the\r\n    population.\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Minister governs the occupied Eastern Territories by\r\n    order of the Fuehrer. He can make the law for all the\r\n    territories.” (_1056-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe following passage shows that the economic exploitation of the\r\nterritory was undertaken in fullest cooperation with the Commissioner of\r\nthe Four-Year Plan:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer has entrusted Reich Marshal Hermann Goering, as\r\n    Commissioner for the Four Year Plan, with the supervision of the\r\n    tasks of the war economy in the Occupied Eastern Territories.\r\n    The economic inspectorates and economic commands are active\r\n    there as his representatives [_Organe_] [see Green Folio]. These\r\n    economic inspectorates and economic commands will be\r\n    substantially absorbed in the agencies of the civil\r\n    administration after the establishment of the civil\r\n    administration.” (_1056-PS_)\r\n\r\nCareful provision was made for channeling to Rosenberg complete and\r\naccurate information as to the situation throughout the territory\r\ngoverned by him:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich and General Commissars will determine the periods at\r\n    which the subordinate agencies are to report regularly about the\r\n    general situation without prejudice to the duty to provide\r\n    individual reports and special delivery reports (at first, at\r\n    short intervals which can be later lengthened). At first the\r\n    Reich Commissars will give the Reich Minister for the Occupied\r\n    Eastern Territories a comprehensive report on the situation in\r\n    brief form twice a month, on the first and fifteenth of each\r\n    month. The Reich Minister is to be given a report by the Reich\r\n    Commissar immediately about incidents of an especially important\r\n    nature. The General Commissars and Regional Commissars must\r\n    report directly to the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern\r\n    Territories by the quickest means particularly important\r\n    incidents, as, for example, widespread unrest, more important\r\n    acts of sabotage and strikes, great natural catastrophes and the\r\n    like, and at the same time report them to the next superior\r\n    agency.” (_1056-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Second Section of this organizational treatise, entitled “Working\r\ndirectives for the Civil Administration,” contains this statement:\r\n\r\n    “* * * the Hague Rules of Land Warfare which deal with the\r\n    administration of a country occupied by a foreign armed power\r\n    are not valid.” (_1056-PS_; _EC-347_)\r\n\r\nThe document continues as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The handling of cases of sabotage is the concern of the Senior\r\n    SS- and Police Leader, of the SS- and Police Leader and/or the\r\n    police leaders of the lower echelon. Insofar, however, as\r\n    collective measures against the population of a definite region\r\n    appear appropriate, the decision about them rests with the\r\n    competent Commissar on the proposal of the Police Leader. The\r\n    calling of the population for the tasks of guarding can be\r\n    ordered by the Regional Commissar.\r\n\r\n    “The assessment of fines of money or goods, as well as the\r\n    ordering of the seizure of hostages and the shooting of\r\n    inhabitants of the territory in which the acts of sabotage have\r\n    taken place, can only be by the General Commissar, insofar as\r\n    the Reich Commissar himself does not intervene.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The District Commissar is responsible for the supervision of\r\n    all prisons, insofar as the Reich Commissar does not decree\r\n    otherwise.” (_1056-PS_; _EC-347_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Rosenberg’s Use of His Authority and Power for Criminal\r\nPurposes._ The manner in which Rosenberg’s authority and power were\r\nwielded is illustrated in other sections of this volume, which show that\r\nin the Eastern Territories millions of Jews were exterminated; that\r\nmillions of slave laborers were pressed into service under indescribable\r\nconditions; that the populace was degraded, starved, beaten, and\r\nmurdered; and that the country was stripped of its resources. However,\r\nin order to illustrate the manner in which Rosenberg participated in the\r\ncriminal activities conducted within his jurisdiction, four examples may\r\nbe mentioned.\r\n\r\n    _1. Seizure of Jewish Property._ The first illustration is\r\n    contained in the decree signed by Lohse, Reichscommissar for the\r\n    Ostland, which is published in the _Verordnungsblatt_ of the\r\n    Reichscommissar for the Ostland, 1942, No. 38, pages 158 and\r\n    159. This decree provides for the seizure of the entire property\r\n    of the Jewish population in the Ostland, including the claims of\r\n    Jews against third parties. The seizure was made retroactive to\r\n    the day of the occupation of the territory by the German troops.\r\n    This sweeping decree was issued and published by Rosenberg’s\r\n    immediate subordinate, and it must be assumed that Rosenberg\r\n    knew of it and acquiesced in it. The power to enact such a\r\n    decree, as previously outlined, arose by virtue of delegation of\r\n    that power by Rosenberg to the Reichscommissar.\r\n\r\n    _2. Extermination of Jews._ The second illustration is the\r\n    report of the prison warden of Minsk that 516 German and Russian\r\n    Jews had been killed. The warden called attention to the fact\r\n    that valuable gold had been lost due to the failure to knock out\r\n    the tooth-fillings of the victims before they were done away\r\n    with (_R-135_).\r\n\r\n    _3. Deportations for Forced Labor._ The third illustration is a\r\n    letter which Rosenberg wrote to Sauckel on 21 December 1942 in\r\n    the following terms:\r\n\r\n        “I thank you very much for your report on the execution\r\n        of the great task given to you, and I am glad to hear\r\n        that in carrying out your mission you have always found\r\n        the necessary support, even on the part of the civilian\r\n        authorities in the occupied Eastern territories. For\r\n        myself and the officials under my command this\r\n        collaboration was and is self-evident, especially since\r\n        both you and I have, with regard to the solution of the\r\n        labor problem in the East, represented the same\r\n        view-points from the beginning.” (_018-PS_)\r\n\r\n    As late as 11 July 1944 the Rosenberg Ministry was actively\r\n    concerned with the continuation of the forced labor program in\r\n    spite of the retreat from the East. A letter from Alfred Meyer,\r\n    Rosenberg’s deputy, addressed to Sauckel, dated 11 July 1944\r\n    shows that this time it is Rosenberg’s Ministry that is urging\r\n    action:\r\n\r\n        “1. * * * The war employment command\r\n        [_Kriegseinsatzkommando_] formerly stationed in Minsk\r\n        must continue under all circumstances the calling in of\r\n        your white Ruthenian and Russian manpower for military\r\n        employment in the Reich. In addition, the command has\r\n        the mission to bring young boys of 10-14 years of age to\r\n        the Reich.” (_199-PS_)\r\n\r\n    _4. Economic Exploitation._ The final illustration of\r\n    Rosenberg’s criminal responsibility is contained in a secret\r\n    letter from Rosenberg to Bormann dated 17 October 1944\r\n    (_327-PS_). It furnishes a graphic account of Rosenberg’s\r\n    activities in the economic exploitation of the Occupied East.\r\n    The first paragraph reads:\r\n\r\n        “In order not to delay the liquidation of companies\r\n        under my supervision, I beg to point out that the\r\n        companies concerned are not private firms but business\r\n        enterprises of the Reich, so that also actions with\r\n        regard to them, just as with regard to government\r\n        offices, are reserved to the highest authorities of the\r\n        Reich. I supervise the following companies * * *.”\r\n        (_327-PS_)\r\n\r\n    There follows a list of nine companies—a trading company, an\r\n    agricultural development Company, a supply company, a\r\n    pharmaceutical company, and five banking concerns. The mission\r\n    of the trading company is stated to be:\r\n\r\n        “Collection of all agricultural products as well as\r\n        commercial marketing and transportation thereof.\r\n        (Delivery to armed forces and the Reich.)” (_327-PS_)\r\n\r\n    The letter continues as follows:\r\n\r\n        “During this period, the Z.O.

AS THE\r\n LEADING NAZI JURIST, HE FURTHERED THE REALIZATION OF THE CONSPIRATORS’\r\n                     PROGRAM IN THE FIELD OF LAW._\r\n\r\nFrank himself described his role in the Nazi struggle for power in the\r\nfollowing words in August 1942:\r\n\r\n    “I have since 1920 continually dedicated my work to the NSDAP. *\r\n    * * As National Socialist I was a participant in the events of\r\n    November 1923, for which I received the _Blutorden_. After the\r\n    resurrection of the movement in the year 1925, my real greater\r\n    activity in the movement began, which made me, first gradually,\r\n    later almost exclusively, the legal advisor of the Fuehrer and\r\n    of the Reich leadership of the NSDAP. I thus was the\r\n    representative of legal interests of the growing Third Reich in\r\n    a legal ideological as well as practical legal way. * * * The\r\n    culmination of this work I see in the big Leipzig Army Trial in\r\n    which I succeeded in having the Fuehrer admitted to the famous\r\n    oath of legality, a circumstance which gave the Movement the\r\n    legal grounds to expand generously. The Fuehrer indeed\r\n    recognized this achievement and in 1926 made me leader of the\r\n    National Socialist Lawyers League; in 1929 Reich Leader of the\r\n    Reich Legal Office of the NSDAP; in 1933 Bavarian Minister of\r\n    Justice; in the same year Reich Commissioner of Justice; in 1934\r\n    President of the Academy of German Law founded by me; in\r\n    December 1934 Reich Minister Without Portfolio; and in 1939 I\r\n    was finally appointed to Governor General for the occupied\r\n    Polish territories.\r\n\r\n    “So I was, am and will remain the representative jurist of the\r\n    struggle period of National Socialism. * * *\r\n\r\n    “I profess myself now, and always, as a National Socialist and a\r\n    faithful follower of the Fuehrer Adolf Hitler, whom I have now\r\n    served since 1919.” (_2233-X-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrank’s Diary, from which this quotation is taken, to which frequent\r\nreference is made in this section, is the official journal, kept at\r\nFrank’s direction, of his administration in the General Government. It\r\nconsists of 38 volumes in which are recorded the official texts of\r\nspeeches, transcripts of conferences, minutes of cabinet sessions, etc.\r\nThe volumes are divided into several concurrent series (_Tagebuch,\r\nAbteilungsleitersitzungen_ etc.) which cover the several aspects of the\r\nofficial business of the administration.\r\n\r\nAs the “representative jurist of the struggle period of National\r\nSocialism” and in the various juridical capacities listed in the\r\npreceding section, Frank was between 1933 and 1939 the most prominent\r\npolicy-maker in the field of German legal theory.\r\n\r\nIn 1934 Frank founded the Academy of German Law, of which he was\r\npresident until 1942. The statute defining the functions of the Academy\r\nconferred on it wide power to coordinate juridical policies:\r\n\r\n    “It is the task of the Academy for German Law to further the\r\n    rejuvenation of the Law in Germany. Closely connected with the\r\n    agencies competent for legislation, it shall further the\r\n    realization of the National Socialist Program in the realm of\r\n    Law. This task shall be carried out through well-fixed\r\n    scientific methods.\r\n\r\n    “The Academy’s task shall cover primarily:\r\n\r\n    “1. The composition, the initiation, judging and preparing of\r\n    drafts of law.\r\n\r\n    “2. The collaboration in rejuvenating and unifying the training\r\n    in jurisprudence and political science.\r\n\r\n    “3. The editing and supporting of scientific publications.\r\n\r\n    “4. The financial assistance for research and work in specific\r\n    fields of Law and Political Economy.\r\n\r\n    “5. The organization of scientific meetings and the organization\r\n    of courses.\r\n\r\n    “6. The cultivation of connections to similar institutions in\r\n    foreign countries”. (_1391-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhat Frank as policy-maker in the field of law conceived as his task he\r\nexplained in a radio address on 20 March 1934:\r\n\r\n    “The first task was that of establishing a unified German State.\r\n    It was an outstanding historical and juristic—political\r\n    accomplishment on the part of our Fuehrer that he reached boldly\r\n    into the development of history and thereby eliminated the\r\n    sovereignty of the various German states. . . .\r\n\r\n    “The second fundamental law of the Hitler Reich is racial\r\n    legislation. The National Socialists were the first ones in the\r\n    entire history of human law to elevate the concept of race to\r\n    the status of a legal term. The German nation, unified racially\r\n    and nationally, will in the future be legally protected against\r\n    any further disintegration of the German race stock. . . .\r\n\r\n    “The sixth fundamental law was the legal elimination of those\r\n    political organizations which within the state, during the\r\n    period of the reconstruction of the people and the Reich, were\r\n    once able to place their selfish aims ahead of the common good\r\n    of the nation. This elimination has taken place entirely\r\n    legally. It is not the coming to the fore of despotic tendencies\r\n    but it was the necessary legal consequence of a clear political\r\n    result, of the 14 years’ struggle of the NSDAP.\r\n\r\n    “In accordance with these unified legal aims in all spheres,\r\n    particular efforts have for months now been made as regards the\r\n    work of the great reform of the entire field of German law. * *\r\n    *” (_2536-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrank concluded his remarks by pointing out that the outward forms of\r\nlegality could be preserved in building the Nazi state:\r\n\r\n    “As a leader of the German Jurists I am convinced that together\r\n    with all strata of the German people, we shall be able to\r\n    construct the legal state of Adolf Hitler in every respect and\r\n    to such an extent that no one in the world will at any time be\r\n    able to attack this legal state as regards its laws”.\r\n    (_2536-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn his speech at the Congress of the Reich Group of University\r\nProfessors of the National Socialist Jurists’ League on 3 October 1936,\r\nFrank explained the necessity for excluding Jews from the legal field:\r\n\r\n    “* * * this topic embraces all that which in our opinion will\r\n    contribute to establishing National Socialism in the field of\r\n    jurisprudence, thus eliminating any alien racial spirit\r\n    therefrom. * * *\r\n\r\n    “We National Socialists have started with anti-Semitism in our\r\n    fight to free the German people, to re-establish a German Reich\r\n    and to build our entire German spiritual, cultural and social\r\n    life on the indestructible foundation of our race. We started a\r\n    gigantic battle in 1919 * * * It took all the self-confidence of\r\n    German manhood to withstand and to triumph—in this fight to\r\n    substitute the German spirit for Jewish corruption over the\r\n    concerted attacks of powerful world groups of which Jewry is a\r\n    representative.\r\n\r\n    “Particularly we National Socialist Jurists have a mission of\r\n    our own to accomplish in this battle. We construct German law on\r\n    the foundations of old and vital elements of the German people.\r\n    * * *\r\n\r\n    “It is so obvious that it hardly needs mentioning that any\r\n    participation whatsoever of the Jew in German law—be it in a\r\n    creative, interpretative, educational or critical capacity—is\r\n    impossible. The elimination of the Jews from German\r\n    jurisprudence is in no way due to hatred or envy but to the\r\n    understanding that the influence of the Jew on German life is\r\n    essentially a pernicious and harmful one and that in the\r\n    interests of the German people and to protect its future an\r\n    unequivocal boundary must be drawn between us and the Jews.”\r\n    (_2536-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs the leading Nazi jurist, Frank accepted and promoted the system of\r\nconcentration camps and of arrest without warrant. In an article on\r\n“Legislation and Judiciary in the Third Reich” published in the Journal\r\nof the Academy of German Law in 1936, Frank explained:\r\n\r\n    “To the world we are blamed again and again because of the\r\n    concentration camps. We are asked, ‘Why do you arrest without a\r\n    warrant of arrest?’ I say, put yourselves into the position of\r\n    our nation. Don’t forget that the very great and still untouched\r\n    world of Bolshevism cannot forget that we have made final\r\n    victory for them impossible in Europe, right here on German\r\n    soil.” (_2533-PS_)\r\n\r\nJust as the other conspirators mobilized the military, economic, and\r\ndiplomatic resources of Germany for war, Frank, in the field of legal\r\npolicy, geared the German juridical machine for a war of aggression,\r\nwhich, as he explained in 1942 to the NSDAP District _Standortsfuehrung_\r\nGalicia at a mass meeting in Lemberg, had for its purpose:\r\n\r\n    “* * * to expand the living space for our people in a natural\r\n    manner”. (_2233-S-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrank was proud of this accomplishment. In a speech before the Academy\r\nof German Law in November 1939, he stated:\r\n\r\n    “Today we are proud to have formulated our legal principles from\r\n    the very beginning in such a way that they need not be changed\r\n    in the case of war. For the rule, that right is that which is\r\n    useful to the nation, and wrong is that which harms it, which\r\n    stood at the beginning of our legal work, and which established\r\n    this collective term of nation as the only standard of value of\r\n    the law—this rule dominates also the law of these times.”\r\n    (_3445-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _THROUGH USE OF HIS OFFICE AS GOVERNOR GENERAL, FRANK PARTICIPATED IN\r\n THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN THE\r\n            TERRITORY OF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT OF POLAND._\r\n\r\nCertain of the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the\r\nNazi conspirators, and in particular by Frank in the General Government\r\nof Poland are discussed in Chapter X on the Slave Labor Program, Chapter\r\nXI on Concentration Camps, Chapter XII on Persecution of the Jews, and\r\nChapter XIII on Germanization and Spoliation. This section will attempt\r\nto trace Frank’s special responsibility, as Governor General, for the\r\npolicies underlying the crimes committed in the General Government\r\nduring the period of his administration.\r\n\r\nFrank was appointed Governor General of the Occupied Polish Territories\r\nby a Hitler decree dated 12 October 1939. The scope of his executive\r\npower was defined as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Section 1. The territories occupied by German troops shall be\r\n    subject to the authority of the Governor General of the occupied\r\n    Polish territories, except insofar as they are incorporated\r\n    within the German Reich.\r\n\r\n    “Section 2. (1) I appoint Reich Minister Dr. Frank as Governor\r\n    General of the occupied Polish territories. (2) As Deputy\r\n    Governor General I appoint Reich Minister Dr. Seyss-Inquart.\r\n\r\n    “Section 3. (1) The Governor General shall be directly\r\n    responsible to me. (2) All branches of the administration shall\r\n    be directed by the Governor General * * *.”(_2537-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction and functions of Frank in the General Government are\r\ndescribed by him in several passages of his diary. For example at a\r\nmeeting of Department Heads of the General Government on 8 March 1940 in\r\nthe _Bergakademie_, Frank clarified his status as follows:\r\n\r\n    “One thing is certain. The authority of General Government as\r\n    the representative of the Fuehrer and the will of the Reich in\r\n    this territory is certainly strong, and I have always emphasized\r\n    that I would not tolerate the misuse of this authority. I have\r\n    allowed this to be known anew at every office in Berlin,\r\n    especially after Herr Field Marshall Goering on 12.2.1940 from\r\n    Karin-hall had forbidden all Administrative Offices of the\r\n    Reich, including the Police and even the _Wehrmacht_, to\r\n    interfere in administrative matters of the General Government *\r\n    * *.\r\n\r\n    “There is no authority here in the General Government which is\r\n    higher as to rank, influence, and authority than that of the\r\n    Governor General. Even the _Wehrmacht_ has no governmental or\r\n    official functions of any kind in this connection; it has only\r\n    security functions and general military duties—it has no\r\n    political power whatsoever. The same applies here to the Police\r\n    and SS. There is here no state within a state but we are the\r\n    representatives of the Fuehrer and of the Reich. In final\r\n    conclusion, this applies also to the Party which has here no\r\n    far-reaching influence except for the fact that very old members\r\n    of the National Socialist Party and loyal veterans of the\r\n    Fuehrer take care of general matters.” (_2233-M-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt a conference of the District _Standartenfuehrer_ of the NSDAP in\r\nCracow on 18 March 1942, Frank explained the relationship between his\r\nadministration and Himmler:\r\n\r\n    “As you know I am a fanatic as to unity in administration. * * *\r\n    It is therefore clear that the Higher SS and Police Officer is\r\n    subordinated to me, that the Police is a component of the\r\n    government, that the SS and Police Officer in the district is\r\n    subordinated to the Governor, and that the _Kreis_ [district]\r\n    chief has the authority of command over the gendarmerie in his\r\n    _Kreis_ [district]. This the Reichsfuehrer SS has recognized; in\r\n    the written agreement all these points are mentioned word for\r\n    word and signed. It is also self-evident that we cannot set up a\r\n    closed shop here which can be treated in the traditional manner\r\n    of small states. It would, for instance, be ridiculous if we\r\n    would build up here a security policy of our own against our\r\n    Poles in the country, while knowing that the Polacks in West\r\n    Prussia, in Posen, in Wartheland and in Silesia have one and the\r\n    same movement of resistance. The Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of\r\n    the German Police thus must be able to carry out with the aid of\r\n    his agencies his police measures concerning the interests of the\r\n    Reich as a whole. This, however, will be done in such a way that\r\n    the measures to be adopted will first be submitted to me and\r\n    carried out only when I give my consent. In the General\r\n    Government, the Police is the Armed Forces. As a result of this,\r\n    the leader of the Police system will be called by me into the\r\n    government of the General Government; he is subordinate to me,\r\n    or to my deputy, as a State Secretary for the Security Systems.”\r\n    (_2233-R-PS_)\r\n\r\n D. _THE PROTOCOL UNDER WHICH THE PURPOSES OF FRANK’S ADMINISTRATION OF\r\n  THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT WERE DEFINED CONSTITUTES IN ITSELF A CRIMINAL\r\n                          PLAN OR CONSPIRACY._\r\n\r\nThe protocol of the conversation between Keitel and Hitler, which was\r\ndated 20 October 1939 and initialed by General Warlimont, regarding “The\r\nFuture Shape of Polish Relations with Germany” provided in part as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “(1) The Armed Forces will welcome it if they can dispose of\r\n    Administrative questions in Poland.\r\n\r\n    “On principle there cannot be two administrations.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “(3) It is not the task of the Administration to make Poland\r\n    into a model province or a model state of the German order or to\r\n    put her economically or financially on a sound basis.\r\n\r\n    “The Polish intelligentsia must be prevented from forming a\r\n    ruling class. The standard of living in the country is to remain\r\n    low; we only want to draw labor forces from there. Poles are\r\n    also to be used for the administration of the country. However\r\n    the forming of national political groups may not be allowed.\r\n\r\n    “(4) The administration has to work on its own responsibility\r\n    and must not be dependent on Berlin. We don’t want to do there\r\n    what we do in the Reich. The responsibility does not rest with\r\n    the Berlin Ministries since there is no German administrative\r\n    unit concerned.\r\n\r\n    “The accomplishment of this task will involve a hard racial\r\n    struggle [_Volkstumskampf_] which will not allow any legal\r\n    restrictions. The methods will be incompatible with the\r\n    principles otherwise adhered to by us.\r\n\r\n    “The Governor General is to give the Polish nation only bare\r\n    living conditions and is to maintain the basis for military\r\n    security.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “(6) * * * Any tendencies towards the consolidation of\r\n    conditions in Poland are to be suppressed.

The Pole must feel here that we are not building him a\r\n    legal state, but that for him there is only one duty, namely, to\r\n    work and to behave himself. It is clear that this leads\r\n    sometimes to difficulties, but you must, in your own interest,\r\n    see that all measures are ruthlessly carried out in order to\r\n    become master of the situation. You can rely on me absolutely in\r\n    this.” (_2233-O-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was the German purpose from the beginning to administer the General\r\nGovernment as colonial territory in total disregard of the duties\r\nimposed by International Law on an occupying power, and Frank’s\r\nadministrative policies were shaped in accordance with this policy. At\r\nthe first conference with Department Heads of the General Government on\r\n2 December 1939, Frank stated:\r\n\r\n    “Decisive in the administrative activities of the General\r\n    Government is the will of the Fuehrer that this area shall be\r\n    the first colonial territory of the German nation.”\r\n    (_2233-K-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe “hard racial struggle” which Keitel and Hitler agreed could be\r\nsolved only if attacked without “legal restrictions,” developed into the\r\nstruggle which had as its ultimate purpose the Germanization of the\r\nGeneral Government.\r\n\r\nFrank’s adherence to the conspirators’ Germanization policy was clearly\r\nexpressed by him at an official meeting of political leaders of the\r\nNSDAP in Cracow on 5 August 1942. Frank explained on that occasion:\r\n\r\n    “The situation in regard to Poland is unique insofar as on the\r\n    one hand—I speak quite openly—we must expand Germanism in such\r\n    a manner that the area of the General Government becomes pure\r\n    German colonized land at some decades to come; and, on the other\r\n    hand under the present war conditions we have to allow foreign\r\n    racial groups to perform here the work which must be carried out\r\n    in the service of Greater Germany.” (_2233-V-PS_)\r\n\r\nExpediency, and expediency only, tempered Frank’s treatment of the\r\nnonGerman population of the General Government in the “hard racial\r\nstruggle” he was charged with administering. The General Government was\r\ndestined to become “pure German colonized land”, the valley of the\r\nVistula to be as “German as the valley of the Rhine.” (_2233-H-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs for the Poles and Ukrainians, Frank’s attitude was clear. They were\r\nto be permitted to work for the German economy as long as the war\r\nemergency continued. Once the war was won, he told the District\r\n_Standortfuehrung_ and Political Leaders at a conference at Cracow on 14\r\nJanuary 1944:\r\n\r\n    “* * * then, for all I care, mincemeat [_Hackfleisch_] can be\r\n    made of the Poles and the Ukrainians and all the others who run\r\n    around here—it does not matter what happens.” (_2233-BB-PS_)\r\n\r\nE. _FRANK ADVOCATED AND ADMINISTERED A PROGRAM OF EXTERMINATING JEWS OF\r\n           POLISH NATIONALITY WITHIN THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT._\r\n\r\nFrank’s diary makes it clear that the complete annihilation of Jews, in\r\naccordance with the racial program of the Nazi conspirators, was one of\r\nthe objectives of his administration as Governor General. In the fall of\r\n1940 Frank urged German soldiers to reassure their families in Germany\r\nwith regard to the hardships of life in the General Government:\r\n\r\n    “In all these weeks, they [i.e., your families] will be thinking\r\n    of you, saying to themselves: My God, there he sits in Poland\r\n    where there are so many lice and Jews, perhaps he is hungry and\r\n    cold, perhaps he is afraid to write. * * * It would not be a bad\r\n    idea then to send our dear ones back home a picture, and tell\r\n    them: well now, there are not so many lice and Jews any more,\r\n    and conditions here in the Government General have changed and\r\n    improved somewhat already. Of course, I could not eliminate all\r\n    lice and Jews in only one year’s time (public amused). But in\r\n    the course of time, and above all, if you help me, this end will\r\n    be attained. After all, it is not necessary for us to accomplish\r\n    everything within a year and right away, for what would\r\n    otherwise be left for those who follow us to do?” (_2233-C-PS_).\r\n\r\nA year later at a Cabinet Session of 16 December 1941 Frank restated the\r\nofficial policy of his administration with respect to Jews:\r\n\r\n    “As far as the Jews are concerned, I want to tell you quite\r\n    frankly, that they must be done away with in one way or another.\r\n    The Fuehrer said once: should united Jewry again succeed in\r\n    provoking a world war, the blood of not only the nations which\r\n    have been forced into the war by them, will be shed, but the Jew\r\n    will have found his end in Europe * * *.\r\n\r\n    “Gentlemen, I must ask you to rid yourselves of all feeling of\r\n    pity. We must annihilate the Jews, wherever we find them and\r\n    wherever it is possible, in order to maintain here the structure\r\n    of the Reich as a whole. This will, naturally, be achieved by\r\n    other methods than those pointed out by Bureau Chief Dr. Hummel.\r\n    Nor can the judges of the Special Courts be made responsible for\r\n    it, because of the limitations of the framework of the legal\r\n    procedure. Such out-dated views cannot be applied to such\r\n    gigantic and unique events. We must find at any rate, a way\r\n    which leads to the goal, and my thoughts are working in that\r\n    direction.\r\n\r\n    “The Jews represent for us also extraordinarily malignant\r\n    gluttons. We have now approximately 2,500,000 of them in the\r\n    General Government, perhaps with the Jewish mixtures and\r\n    everything that goes with it, 3,500,000 Jews. We cannot shoot or\r\n    poison those 3,500,000 Jews, but we shall nevertheless be able\r\n    to take measures, which will lead, somehow, to their\r\n    annihilation, and this in connection with the gigantic measures\r\n    to be determined in discussions from the Reich. The General\r\n    Government must become free of Jews, the same as the Reich.\r\n    Where and how this is to be achieved is a matter for the offices\r\n    which we must appoint and create here. Their activities will be\r\n    brought to your attention in due course.” (_2233-D-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn earlier passage in the report of this session of the Cabinet explains\r\nthe references to Dr. Hummel. Hummel had complained that legal\r\nformalities were obstructing the process of liquidation:\r\n\r\n    “In Warsaw, in spite of the setting up of a third court chamber,\r\n    we have been able to decree only 45 death sentences, only 8 of\r\n    which have been carried out, since in each individual case, the\r\n    Pardon Commission [_Gnadenkommission_] in Cracow has to make the\r\n    final decision. A further 600 sentences were demanded and are\r\n    under consideration. An effective isolation of the ghetto is not\r\n    possible by way of the Special Court Procedure. The procedure to\r\n    be followed up to the liquidation takes too much time; it is\r\n    burdened with too many formalities and must be simplified.”\r\n    (_2233-Q-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrank himself ordered that every Jew seen outside the Ghetto should be\r\nexecuted:\r\n\r\n    “Severe measures must and will be adopted against Jews leaving\r\n    the Ghettos. Death sentences pending against Jews for this\r\n    reason must be carried out as quickly as possible. This order\r\n    according to which every Jew found outside the Ghetto is to be\r\n    executed, must be carried out without fail.” (_2233-Q-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhen ways and means of meeting the food deficit in the General\r\nGovernment created by the increase in quotas to be requisitioned for\r\nexport to Germany were discussed in August 1942, Frank approved a\r\nprogram which provided in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The feeding of a Jewish population, estimated heretofore at 1.5\r\n    million, drops off to an estimated total of 300,000 Jews, who\r\n    still work for German interests as craftsmen or otherwise. For\r\n    these the Jewish rations, including certain special allotments\r\n    which have proved necessary for the maintenance of working\r\n    capacity, will be retained. The other Jews, a total of 1.2\r\n    million, will no longer be provided with foodstuffs.”\r\n    (_2233-E-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrank’s concurrence was expressed in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    “That we sentence 1.2 million Jews to die of hunger should be\r\n    noted only marginally. It is a matter of course that should the\r\n    Jews not starve it would, we hope, result in speeding up\r\n    anti-Jewish measures.” (_2233-E-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt an official meeting of the political leaders of the NSDAP on 5 August\r\n1942, Frank made the following progress report:\r\n\r\n    “What a dirty people made up of Jews swaggered around here\r\n    before 1939! And where are the Jews today? You scarcely see\r\n    them. If you see them they are working.” (_2233-V-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn December 1941, Frank had pointed out that his administration could\r\nnot shoot or poison all the three and a half million Jews in the General\r\nGovernment. He had promised, however, that he would be able to devise\r\nmeasures which would lead to their annihilation. Two years later, at a\r\nspecial press conference in January 1944, he was able to report that his\r\nmission was almost accomplished.\r\n\r\n    “At the present time we have still in the General Government\r\n    perhaps 100,000 Jews.” (_2233-F-PS_)\r\n\r\nF. _FRANK IMPOSED UPON THE POPULATION OF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT A REIGN\r\n        OF TERROR, OPPRESSION, IMPOVERISHMENT, AND STARVATION._\r\n\r\nWhat had happened in the General Government in the first three and a\r\nhalf years of Frank’s administration was summarized by Frank in a report\r\nto Hitler on the situation in Poland, dated 19 June 1943:\r\n\r\n    “In the course of time, a series of measures or of consequences\r\n    of the German rule have led to a substantial _deterioration of\r\n    the attitude_ of the entire Polish people in the German\r\n    Government. These measures have affected either individual\r\n    professions or the entire population and frequently also—often\r\n    with crushing severity—the fate of individuals.\r\n\r\n    “Among these are in particular:\r\n\r\n    “1—The entirely insufficient nourishment of the population,\r\n    mainly of the working classes in the cities, whose majority is\r\n    working for German interests.\r\n\r\n    “Until the war of 1939, its food supplies, though not varied,\r\n    were sufficient and generally secure, due to the agrarian\r\n    surplus of the former Polish state and in spite of the\r\n    negligence on the part of their former political leadership.\r\n\r\n    “2—The confiscation of a great part of the Polish estates and\r\n    the expropriation without compensation and resettlement of\r\n    Polish peasants from manoeuvre areas and from German\r\n    settlements.\r\n\r\n    “3—Encroachments and confiscations in the industries, in\r\n    commerce and trade and in the field of private property.\r\n\r\n    “4—Mass arrests and mass shootings by the German police who\r\n    applied the system of collective responsibility.\r\n\r\n    “5—The rigorous methods of recruiting workers.\r\n\r\n    “6—The extensive paralyzation of cultural life.\r\n\r\n    “7—The closing of high schools, junior colleges, and\r\n    universities.\r\n\r\n    “8—The limitation, indeed the complete elimination of Polish\r\n    influence from all spheres of State administration.\r\n\r\n    “9—Curtailment of the influence of the Catholic Church,\r\n    limiting its extensive influence—an undoubtedly necessary\r\n    move—and, in addition, until quite recently, the closing and\r\n    confiscation of monasteries, schools and charitable\r\n    institutions.” (_437-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate how completely Frank as Governor General is\r\nidentified with the criminal policies whose execution is reported in the\r\nforegoing document, and the extent to which they were the official\r\npolicies of his administration, it is proposed to annotate several of\r\nthe items with passages from Frank’s own diary.\r\n\r\n(1) _Undernourishment of Polish population._ The extent of the\r\nundernourishment of the Polish population was reported to Frank in\r\nSeptember 1941 by _Obermedizinalrat_ Dr. Walbaum:\r\n\r\n    “_Obermedizinalrat_ Dr. Walbaum expresses his opinion of the\r\n    _health condition_ of the Polish population. Investigations\r\n    which were carried out by his department proved that the\r\n    majority of Poles eat only about 600 calories, whereas the\r\n    normal requirement for a human being is 2,200 calories. The\r\n    Polish population was enfeebled to such an extent that it would\r\n    fall an easy prey to _spotted fever_. The number of diseased\r\n    Poles amounted today already to 40%. During the last week alone\r\n    1000 new spotted fever cases have been officially recorded. * *\r\n    * If the food rations were to be diminished again, an enormous\r\n    increase of the number of illnesses could be predicted.”\r\n    (_2233-P-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was clear from this report that starvation was prevalent in the\r\nGeneral Government. Nevertheless, in August 1942, Frank approved a new\r\nplan which called for much larger contributions of foodstuffs to Germany\r\nat the expense of the nonGerman population of the General Government.\r\nMethods of meeting the new quotas out of the already grossly inadequate\r\nrations of the General Government, and the impact of the new quotas on\r\nthe economy of the country were discussed at a Cabinet meeting of the\r\nGeneral Government, on 18 August 1942 in terms which leave no doubt that\r\nnot only was the proposed requisition far beyond the resources of the\r\ncountry, but its impact was to be distributed on a discriminatory basis.\r\n\r\nFrank’s opening remarks at this meeting defined the scope of the problem\r\nand its solution:\r\n\r\n    “Before the German people are to experience starvation, the\r\n    occupied territories and their people shall be exposed to\r\n    starvation. In this moment therefore we here in the General\r\n    Government must also have the iron determination to help the\r\n    Great German people, our Fatherland. . . . The General\r\n    Government therefore must do the following: The General\r\n    Government has taken on the obligation to send 500,000 tons\r\n    bread grains to the Fatherland in addition to the foodstuffs\r\n    already being delivered for the relief of Germany or consumed\r\n    here by troops of the armed forces, Police or SS. If you compare\r\n    this with our contributions of last year you can see that this\r\n    means a six fold increase over that of last year’s contribution\r\n    of the General Government. The new demand will be fulfilled\r\n    exclusively at _the expense of the foreign population_. It must\r\n    be done cold-bloodedly and without pity; * * *” (_2233-E-PS_).\r\n\r\nPresident of the Main Department for Food and Agriculture Naumann\r\n(apparently an official of the General Government) then described how\r\nthe reduced quantity of food available for feeding the population of the\r\nGeneral Government should be distributed:\r\n\r\n    “The feeding of a _Jewish population_, estimated heretofore at\r\n    1.5 million, drops off to an estimated total of 300,000 Jews,\r\n    who still work for German interests as craftsmen or otherwise.\r\n    For these the Jewish rations, including certain special\r\n    allotments which have proved necessary for the maintenance of\r\n    working capacity, will be retained. The other Jews, a total of\r\n    1.2 million, will no longer be provided with foodstuffs.\r\n\r\n    “_Non-German normal consumers_ will receive, from 1 January 1943\r\n    to 1 March 1943, instead of 4.2 kg. bread per month, 2.8 kg;\r\n    from 1 March 1943 to 30 July 1943 the total bread ration for\r\n    these non-German normal consumers will be cancelled.\r\n\r\n    “_Those entitled to be supplied_ [_Versorgungsberechtigten_] are\r\n    composed as follows. We estimate that 3 million persons come\r\n    into consideration as war workers, the A- and B-card holders and\r\n    their kin, and that somewhat more than 3 million persons are\r\n    non-German normal consumers, who do not work directly or\r\n    indirectly in the interests of Germany. The war workers, A- and\r\n    B-card holders and their families, about 3 million persons, will\r\n    however continue to be supplied, up to the harvest of 1943, at\r\n    the prevailing rates.” (_2233-E-PS_)\r\n\r\nNaumann goes on to discuss the difficulties that may be encountered in\r\nthe process of requisition:\r\n\r\n    “_The securing of all depots and food processing plants_, as\r\n    well as their transport facilities must be assured, as otherwise\r\n    irreplaceable losses result which mean a further burdening of\r\n    the food budget. I have had maps made of all districts\r\n    [_Kreise_] on which the depots have all been drawn in. I request\r\n    that the necessary measures be taken on the part of the police\r\n    and these depots, which are in the eye of the hungering masses,\r\n    above all at times when the restrictions are carried out, should\r\n    be strictly guarded, so that the meager supplies which we have\r\n    until the new harvest should not be destroyed by sabotage or\r\n    arson. . . . Finally it must be determined at the beginning of\r\n    November whether the _martial law for the harvest period_, which\r\n    has been proclaimed up to 30 November, must be extended to 30\r\n    December. Martial law for the harvest period has been extended\r\n    to all products which are to be seized. The planned quota\r\n    increase and reduction of ration quantities must be kept secret\r\n    under all circumstances and may be published only at that time\r\n    which the Main Department for Food and Agriculture considers\r\n    proper. Should the reduction of ration quantities and the\r\n    increase of quotas become known earlier, extremely noticeable\r\n    disturbances in the seizure would take place. The mass of the\r\n    Polish population would then go to the land and would become a\r\n    supplementary competitor of our requisitioning agencies.”\r\n    (_2233-E-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrank’s concluding remarks summarized the position as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I must point out that some sectors of the administration will\r\n    feel this very keenly. In the first place the _police_ will feel\r\n    this, for it will have to deal, if I may say so, with an\r\n    increased activity of the black market and a neglect of food\r\n    customs. I will gladly give the police extraordinary powers so\r\n    that they can overcome these difficulties.\r\n\r\n    “The economy will feel it. The decrease of work rendered will\r\n    become felt in all sectors, branches and regions. I also assume\r\n    that our _transport system_ will feel it too. In view of the\r\n    worsening living conditions an extraordinary hardship will set\r\n    in for railroad workers and other categories; as the previous\r\n    quantities of food were already not enough. The monopolies will\r\n    feel it through a decrease of their incomes, as the amounts of\r\n    potatoes available for the production of vodka will be less.\r\n\r\n    “The _Germans_ in this area shall not feel it. We wish in spite\r\n    of this new plan to see to it that the supplies for Germans will\r\n    be maintained. Also the _Wehrmacht_ and other encamped units in\r\n    this area shall not feel it. We hope that it will be possible\r\n    for us to keep up the whole quotas here.\r\n\r\n    “To help in this necessity there is a corresponding measure,\r\n    namely that the supervision of persons traveling from the\r\n    General Government to the Reich, above all of military\r\n    personnel, in order to see whether they are _taking food out_ of\r\n    the General Government, should be suspended. This means that in\r\n    addition to all that which we must now extract from the land\r\n    economically, there must take place a complete removal of\r\n    control over that which is dragged out of the land by thousands\r\n    upon thousands—doubtless illegally and against our government\r\n    measures.” (_2233-E-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe extent of the General Government’s food contribution to the Reich,\r\nand its significance in terms of rations within Germany were described\r\nby Frank at a meeting of political leaders of the NSDAP in December 1942\r\nat Cracow:\r\n\r\n    “I will endeavor to get out of the reservoir of this territory\r\n    everything that is yet to be got out of it. When you consider\r\n    that it was possible for me to deliver to the Reich 600,000 tons\r\n    of bread grain, and in addition 180,000 tons to the Armed Forces\r\n    stationed here; further an abundance amounting to many thousands\r\n    of tons of other commodities such as seed, fats, vegetables,\r\n    besides the delivery to the Reich of 300 million eggs, etc.—you\r\n    can estimate the significance of the consignment from the\r\n    General Government of 600,000 tons of bread grain; you are\r\n    referred to the fact that the General Government by this\r\n    achievement alone covers the raising of the bread ration in the\r\n    Greater German Reich by two-thirds during the present rationing\r\n    period. This enormous achievement can rightfully be claimed by\r\n    us.” (_2233-Z-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Resettlement projects._ Although Himmler was given general\r\nauthority in connection with the conspirators’ program to resettle\r\nvarious districts in the conquered Eastern territories with racial\r\nGermans, projects relating to resettling districts in the General\r\nGovernment were submitted to and approved by Frank. On 4 August 1942,\r\nfor example, the plan to resettle Zamosc and Lublin was reported to him\r\nby State Secretary Krueger:\r\n\r\n“State Secretary Krueger then continues, saying that the Reichsfuehrer’s\r\nnext immediate plan until the end of the following year would be to\r\nsettle the following German racial groups in the two districts (Zamosc\r\nand Lublin): 1000 peasant settlements (1 settlement per family of about\r\n6) for Bosnian Germans; 1200 other kinds of settlements; 1000\r\nsettlements for Bessarabian Germans; 200 for Serbian Germans; 2000 for\r\nLeningrad Germans; 4000 for Baltic Germans; 500 for Wolhynia Germans;\r\nand 200 settlements for Flemish, Danish and Dutch Germans: in all 10,000\r\nsettlements for 50,000 persons” (_2233-T-PS_). Frank directed that:\r\n\r\n    “* * * the resettlement plan is to be discussed cooperatively by\r\n    the competent authorities and declared his willingness to\r\n    approve the final plan by the end of September after\r\n    satisfactory arrangements had been made concerning all the\r\n    questions appertaining thereto (in particular the guaranteeing\r\n    of peace and order) so that by the middle of November, as the\r\n    most favorable time, the resettlement can begin.” (_2233-T-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe way in which the resettlement at Zamosc was carried out was\r\ndescribed to Frank at a meeting at Warsaw on 25 January 1943 by State\r\nSecretary Krueger:\r\n\r\n    “When we settled about the first 4000 in Kreis Zamosc shortly\r\n    before Christmas I had an opportunity to speak to these people.\r\n    * * * It is understandable that in resettling this area . . . we\r\n    did not make friends of the Poles. * * * In colonizing this\r\n    territory with racial Germans, we are forced to chase out the\r\n    Poles. * * * We are removing those who constitute a burden in\r\n    this new colonization territory. Actually, they are the asocial\r\n    and inferior elements. They are being deported, first brought to\r\n    a concentration camp, and then sent as labor to the Reich. From\r\n    a Polish propaganda standpoint this entire first action has had\r\n    an unfavorable effect. For the Poles say: After the Jews have\r\n    been destroyed then they will employ the same methods to get the\r\n    Poles out of this territory and liquidate them just like the\r\n    Jews.” (_2233-AA-PS_)\r\n\r\nAlthough the illegality of this dispossession of Poles to make room for\r\nGerman settlers was clear, and although the fact that the Poles were not\r\nonly being dispossessed but taken off to concentration camps was drawn\r\nto Frank’s attention at this time, he merely directed that individual\r\ncases of resettlement should in future be discussed in the same manner\r\nas in the case of Zamosc. (_2233-AA-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Encroachments and confiscations in the industries and in the field\r\nof private property._\r\n\r\nFrank explained his policy in respect to Polish property to his\r\nDepartment Heads in the following terms in December 1939:\r\n\r\n    “Principally it can be said regarding the administration of the\r\n    General Government: This territory in its entirety is booty of\r\n    the German Reich, and it thus cannot be permitted that this\r\n    territory shall be exploited in its individual parts but that\r\n    the territory in its entirety shall be economically used and its\r\n    entire economic worth redound to the benefit of the German\r\n    people.” (_2233-K-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhatever encroachments there were on private property rights in the\r\nGeneral Government fell squarely within the policy which Frank in an\r\ninterview on 3 October 1939 stated he intended to administer as General\r\nGovernor:\r\n\r\n    “Poland can only be administered by utilizing the country\r\n    through means of ruthless exploitation, deportation of all\r\n    supplies, raw materials, machines, factory installations etc.\r\n    which are important for the German war economy. * * * [It was\r\n    Frank’s opinion] that the war would be a short one and that it\r\n    was most important now to make available as soon as possible raw\r\n    materials, machines and workers to the German industry, which\r\n    was short in all of these. Most important, however, in Frank’s\r\n    opinion, was the fact that by destroying Polish industry, its\r\n    subsequent reconstruction after the war would become more\r\n    difficult, if not impossible, so that Poland would be reduced to\r\n    its proper position as an agrarian country which would have to\r\n    depend upon Germany for importation of industrial products.”\r\n    (_EC-344-16 & 17_)\r\n\r\nThe basic decree under which property in the General Government was\r\nsequestered was promulgated by Frank on 24 January 1940. This decree\r\nauthorized sequestration in connection with the “performance of tasks\r\nserving the public interest,” the seizure of “abandoned property,” and\r\nthe liquidation of “antisocial or financially unremunerative property.”\r\nIt permitted the Higher S.S. and Police Chief to order sequestrations\r\n“with the object of increasing the striking power of the units of the\r\nuniformed police and armed S.S.” No legal recourse was granted for\r\nlosses arising from the enforcement of the decree, compensation being\r\nsolely in the discretion of an official of the General Government. It is\r\nclear that the undefined criteria of this decree empowered Nazi\r\nofficials in the General Government to engage in wholesale seizure of\r\nproperty. (_2540-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Principle of collective responsibility._ It was no part of Frank’s\r\npolicy in administering the General Government that reprisals should be\r\ncommensurate with the gravity of the offense. Frank was, on the\r\ncontrary, an advocate of drastic measures in dealing with the Polish\r\npeople. At a conference of Department Heads of the General Government on\r\n19 January 1940, he explained:\r\n\r\n    “My relationship with the Poles is like the relationship between\r\n    ant and plant louse. When I treat the Poles in a helpful way, so\r\n    to speak tickle them in a friendly manner, then I do it in the\r\n    expectation that their work performance redounds to my benefit.\r\n    This is not a political but a purely tactical-technical problem.\r\n    * * * In cases where in spite of all these measures the\r\n    performance does not increase, or where the slightest act gives\r\n    me occasion to step in, I would not even hesitate to take the\r\n    most draconic action.” (_2233-L-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent meeting of Department Heads on 8 March 1940 Frank became\r\neven more explicit:\r\n\r\n    “Whenever there is the least-attempt by the Poles to start\r\n    anything, an enormous campaign of destruction will follow. Then\r\n    I would not mind starting a regime of terror, or fear its\r\n    consequences.” (_2233-M-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt a conference of District Standartenfuehrer at Cracow on 18 March 1942\r\nFrank reiterated his policy:\r\n\r\n    “Incidentally, the struggle for the achievement of our aims will\r\n    be pursued cold bloodedly. You see how the state agencies work.\r\n    You see that we do not hesitate before anything, and stand whole\r\n    dozens of people up against the wall. This is necessary because\r\n    here simple consideration says that it cannot be our task at\r\n    this period when the best German blood is being sacrificed, to\r\n    show regard for the blood of another race. For out of this one\r\n    of the greatest dangers may arise. One already hears today in\r\n    Germany that prisoners-of-war, for instance with us in Bavaria\r\n    or in Thuringia, are administering large estates entirely\r\n    independently, while all the men in a village fit for service\r\n    are at the front. If this state of affairs continues then a\r\n    gradual retrogression of Germanism will show itself. One should\r\n    not underestimate this danger. Therefore, everything revealing\r\n    itself as a Polish power of leadership must be destroyed again\r\n    and again with ruthless energy. This does not have to be shouted\r\n    abroad, it will happen silently.” (_2233-R-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnd on 15 January 1944 Frank assured the political leaders of the NSDAP\r\nat Cracow:\r\n\r\n    “I have not been hesitant in declaring that when a German is\r\n    shot, up to 100 Poles shall be shot too.” (_2233-BB-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _Rigorous methods of recruiting workers._ Force, violence, and\r\neconomic duress were all advocated by Frank as means for recruiting\r\nlaborers for deportation to slave labor in Germany. Deportation of\r\nPolish laborers to Germany was an integral part of the program announced\r\nby Frank for his administration of the General Government (See\r\n_EC-344-16 & 17_), and as Governor General he authorized whatever degree\r\nof force was required for the execution of his program.\r\n\r\nVoluntary methods of recruitment soon proved inadequate. In the spring\r\nof 1940 the question of utilizing force came up, and the following\r\ndiscussion took place in the presence of Seyss-Inquart:\r\n\r\n    “The Governor-General stated that the fact that all means in\r\n    form of proclamations etc. did not bring success, leads to the\r\n    conclusion that the Poles out of malevolence, and guided by the\r\n    intention of harming Germany by not putting themselves at its\r\n    disposal, refuse to enlist for working duty. Therefore, he asks\r\n    Dr. Frauendorfer, if there are any other measures, not as yet\r\n    employed, to win the Poles on a voluntary basis.\r\n\r\n    “_Reichshauptamtsleiter_ Dr. Frauendorfer answered this question\r\n    negatively.\r\n\r\n    “The General Governor emphasized the fact that he now will be\r\n    asked to take a definite attitude toward this question.\r\n    Therefore the question will arise whether any form of _coercive\r\n    measures_ should now be employed.\r\n\r\n    “The question put by the General Governor to SS Lieutenant\r\n    General [_Obergruppenfuehrer_] Krueger: does he see\r\n    possibilities of calling Polish workers by coercive means, is\r\n    answered in the affirmative by SS Lieutenant General _Krueger_.”\r\n    (_2233-N-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt the same conference Frank declared that he was willing to agree to\r\nany practical measures, and decreed that unemployment compensation\r\nshould be discontinued on 1 May 1940 as a means of recruiting labor for\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n    “The General Governor is willing to agree to any practical\r\n    measure; however, he wishes to be informed personally about the\r\n    measures to be taken. One measure, which no doubt would be\r\n    successful, would be the _discontinuance of unemployment\r\n    compensation_ for unemployed workers and their _transfer to\r\n    public welfare_. Therefore, he decrees that, beginning _1 May_,\r\n    claim for unemployment compensation will cease to exist and only\r\n    public welfare may be granted. For the time being only men are\r\n    to report and above those men living in cities. There might be a\r\n    possibility of combining the moving of the 120,000 Poles from\r\n    the Warthe district with this measure.” (_2233-N-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn March 1940 Frank assured the authorities in Berlin that he was\r\nprepared to have villages surrounded and the people dragged forcibly\r\nout. He reported that, in the course of his negotiations in Berlin\r\nregarding the urgent demand for larger numbers of Polish farm workers,\r\nhe had stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * if it is demanded from him, [he] could naturally exercise\r\n    force in such a manner, that he has the police surround a\r\n    village and get the men and women in question out by force, and\r\n    then send them to Germany. But one can also work differently,\r\n    besides these police measures, by retaining the unemployment\r\n    compensation of these workers in question.” (_2233-B-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt a conference of Department Heads of the General Government on 10 May\r\n1940 Frank laid down the following principles for dealing with the\r\nproblem of conscription labor:\r\n\r\n    “Upon the demands from the Reich it has now been decreed that\r\n    compulsion may be exercised in view of the fact that sufficient\r\n    manpower was not voluntarily available for service inside the\r\n    German Reich. This compulsion means the possibility of arrest of\r\n    male and female Poles. . . . The arrest of young Poles when\r\n    leaving church services or the cinema would bring about an\r\n    ever-increasing nervousness of the Poles. Generally speaking, he\r\n    had no objection at all if the rubbish, capable of work yet\r\n    often loitering about, would be snatched from the streets. The\r\n    best method for this, however, would be the organization of a\r\n    raid, and it would be absolutely justifiable to stop a Pole in\r\n    the street and to question him what he was doing, where he was\r\n    working, etc.” (_2233-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrank utilized starvation as a method of recruitment. At a conference on\r\n20 November 1942 the following plan was agreed:\r\n\r\n    “Starting 1 February 1942 the food ration cards should not be\r\n    issued to the individual Pole or Ukrainian by the Nutrition\r\n    Office [_Ernaehrungsamt_], but to the establishments working for\r\n    the German interest. 2,000,000 people would thus be eliminated\r\n    from the non-German, normal ration-consuming contingent. Now, if\r\n    those ration cards are only distributed by the factories, part\r\n    of those people will naturally rush into the factories. Labor\r\n    could then be either procured for Germany from them or they\r\n    could be used for the most important work in the factories of\r\n    the General Government.” (_2233-Y-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 18 August 1942 Frank informed Sauckel that the General Government had\r\nalready supplied 800,000 laborers to Germany, and that a further 140,000\r\nwould be supplied by the end of the year. Regarding the quota for the\r\nnext year he promised:\r\n\r\n    “* * * you can, however, next year reckon upon a higher number\r\n    of workers from the General Government, for we shall employ the\r\n    Police to conscript them.” (_2233-W-PS_)\r\n\r\nSix months after Frank promised Sauckel to resort to police action to\r\nround up labor for deportation to Germany, the Chairman of the Ukrainian\r\nMain Committee reported to Frank that the program was being carried out\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “The wild and ruthless man-hunt carried on everywhere in towns\r\n    and country, in streets, squares, stations, even in churches, at\r\n    night in houses, has badly shaken the feeling of security of the\r\n    inhabitants. Everybody is exposed to the danger of being seized\r\n    anywhere and at any time by members of the police, suddenly and\r\n    unexpectedly, and being brought into an assembly camp. None of\r\n    his relatives knows what has happened to him, only weeks or\r\n    months later, one or the other gives news of his fate by a\r\n    postcard.” (_1526-PS_)\r\n\r\n(6) _Closing of schools._ The program outlined by Frank on 3 October\r\n1939 as the program he intended to administer as Governor General\r\nincluded:\r\n\r\n    “closing of all educational institutions, especially technical\r\n    schools and colleges in order to prevent the growth of the new\r\n    Polish intelligentsia.” (_EC-344-16 & 17_)\r\n\r\nThis decision was taken by Frank before it was determined what schools,\r\nif any, might be closed because of failure of instructors to refrain\r\nfrom reference to politics, or refusal to submit to inspection by the\r\noccupying authorities. Moreover, the policy was determined, as\r\nindicated, in furtherance of the purpose of preventing the rise of an\r\neducated class in Poland.\r\n\r\n(7) _Other crimes._ There were other grounds for uneasiness in Poland\r\nwhich Frank does not mention in his report to Hitler. He does not\r\nmention the Concentration Camps—perhaps because, as the “representative\r\njurist” of National Socialism, Frank had himself defended the system in\r\nGermany. As Governor General Frank is responsible for all concentration\r\ncamps within the boundaries of the General Government. As indicated\r\nabove, he knew and approved that Poles were taken to concentration camps\r\nin connection with the resettlement projects. He had certain\r\njurisdiction, as well, in relation to the notorious extermination camp\r\nAuschwitz, to which Poles from the General Government were committed by\r\nhis administration, although the camp itself lay outside the boundaries\r\nof the General Government. In February 1944, Ambassador Counsellor Dr.\r\nSchumberg suggested a possible amnesty of Poles who had been taken to\r\nAuschwitz for trivial offenses and kept for several months. The report\r\nof the conference continues:\r\n\r\n    “The Governor General will take under consideration an amnesty\r\n    probably for 1 May of this year. Nevertheless, one must not lose\r\n    sight of the fact that the German leadership of the General\r\n    Government must not now show any signs of weakness.”\r\n    (_2233-BB-PS_)\r\n\r\n                            G. _CONCLUSION._\r\n\r\nAs legal adviser of Hitler and the leadership corps of the NSDAP, Frank\r\npromoted the conspirators’ rise to power. In his various juridical\r\ncapacities, both in the NSDAP and in the German government, Frank\r\nadvocated and promoted the political monopoly of the NSDAP, the racial\r\nprogram of the conspirators, and the terror system of the concentration\r\ncamp and of arrest without warrant. His role in the common plan was to\r\nrealize “the National Socialist Program in the realm of law”, and to\r\ngive the outward form of legality to this program of terror, persecution\r\nand oppression, which had as its ultimate purpose mobilization for\r\naggressive war.\r\n\r\nAs a loyal adherent of Hitler and the NSDAP, Frank was appointed\r\nGovernor General in October 1939 of that area of Poland known as the\r\nGeneral Government, which became the testing ground for the\r\nconspirators’ program of “_Lebensraum_.” Frank had defined justice in\r\nthe field of German law as that which benefited the German nation. His\r\nfive year administration of the General Government illustrates the same\r\nprinciples applied in the field of International Law.\r\n\r\nFrank took the office of Governor General under a program which\r\nconstituted in itself a criminal plan or conspiracy, as Frank well knew\r\nand approved, to exploit the territory ruthlessly for the benefit of\r\nNazi Germany, to conscript its nationals for labor in Germany, to close\r\nits schools and colleges to prevent the rise of a Polish intelligentsia,\r\nand to administer the territory as a colonial possession of the Third\r\nReich in total disregard of the duties of an occupying power toward the\r\ninhabitants of occupied territory. Under Frank’s administration this\r\ncriminal plan was consummated. But the execution went even beyond the\r\nplan. Food contributions to Germany increased to the point where the\r\nbare subsistence reserved for the General Government under the plan was\r\nreduced to the level of mass starvation; a savage program of\r\nexterminating Jews was relentlessly executed; resettlement projects were\r\ncarried out with reckless disregard of the rights of the local\r\npopulation; the terror of the concentration camp followed in the wake of\r\nthe Nazi invaders.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that all of these crimes were committed in accordance\r\nwith the official policies established and advocated by Frank.\r\n\r\nThis summary of evidence has been compiled almost entirely from\r\nstatements by Frank himself, from the admissions found in his diaries,\r\nofficial reports, records of his conferences with his colleagues and\r\nsubordinates, and his speeches. It is therefore appropriate that a final\r\npassage from his diary should be quoted in conclusion. In January 1943,\r\nFrank told his colleagues in the General Government that their task\r\nwould grow more difficult. Hitler, he said, could only help them as a\r\nkind of “administrative pillbox”. They must depend on themselves.\r\n\r\n    “We are now duty bound to hold together [he continued] * * * We\r\n    must remember that we who are gathered together here figure on\r\n    Mr. Roosevelt’s list of war criminals. I have the honor of being\r\n    Number One. We have, so to speak, become accomplices in the\r\n    world historic sense.” (_2233-AA-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n     LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO HANS FRANK\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 60\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

WILHELM FRICK\r\n\r\n                     A. _FRICK’S POLITICAL CAREER._\r\n\r\nFrick’s important contribution to the Nazi conspiracy was in the field\r\nof government administration. He was the administrative brain who\r\norganized the German state for Nazism and who geared the machinery of\r\nthe state for aggressive war. It was Frick who transformed the plans and\r\nprograms of his fellow conspirators into political action. He was the\r\nmanager of the Nazi conspiracy. He was entrusted with broad discretion,\r\nexercised great power, and knew the criminal purpose of the acts he\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nThe conspiratorial activities of Frick cover a period of 25 years,\r\nbeginning as early as 1920 (_3086-PS_).\r\n\r\nA brief summary of Frick’s activities will show how extensive was his\r\ncontribution to the Nazi conspiracy. He took part in Hitler’s Munich\r\nBeer Hall Putsch of November 1923, and was sentenced for his\r\nparticipation. He helped Hitler become a German citizen. To maintain the\r\nNazi regime in the first 2 years of its existence and to achieve some of\r\nits most important immediate purposes, Frick signed 235 laws and decrees\r\nduring that period, most of which are published in the\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in German history a uniform police system for the\r\nwhole German Reich was created. Frick was its creator and its supreme\r\nhead. He appointed the Gestapo chief, Heinrich Himmler, Chief of the\r\nGerman Police. Frick was the highest controlling authority over\r\nconcentration camps. He personally inspected these camps. His Ministry\r\nof the Interior made the necessary legal arrangements for acquiring land\r\nfor the Auschwitz Concentration Camp. Through his Medical Division,\r\nFrick controlled the Nazi asylums and so-called medical institutions in\r\nwhich forced sterilizations and murders of thousands of Germans and of\r\nforeign laborers were carried out. The racial legislation, including the\r\nNurnberg Laws, was drafted by Frick and administered under his\r\njurisdiction. Frick introduced the Yellow Star as a sign of\r\nstigmatization of the Jews.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his active participation in the Nazi conspiracy, Frick\r\noccupied a number of important positions. Among his Nazi Party positions\r\nare the following: member of the Nazi Party from 1925 to 1945; Reich\r\nLeader of the Nazi Party from 1933 to 1945; floor leader of the Nazi\r\nParty in the Reichstag from 1928 to 1945. His governmental positions\r\nwere: chief of a division of the Munich Police Department from 1917 to\r\n10 November 1923, 2 days after Hitler’s Putsch; Nazi Minister of the\r\nInterior and of Education in the German State of Thuringia from January\r\n1930 to April 1931; Reichsministerof the Interior from 30 January 1933\r\nto 20 August 1943; member of the Reich Defense Council as General\r\nPlenipotentiary for the Administration of the Reich from 21 May 1935 to\r\n20 August 1943. On 20 August 1943, Frick was appointed Reich Protector\r\nof Bohemia and Moravia, and he held this last position until 1945.\r\n(_2978-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _FRICK’S PARTICIPATION IN PROMOTING THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS’ ACCESSION\r\n                               TO POWER._\r\n\r\nFrick has admitted that he was one of the men who helped Hitler to power\r\n(_3043-PS_).\r\n\r\n(1) _Frick’s activities in early days of conspiracy._ In the very\r\nbeginning of the Nazi Party and its conspiracy, Frick misused his\r\nvarious governmental positions in order to hold a “protecting hand over\r\nthe National-Socialist Party and Hitler.” This he stated solemnly in his\r\nspeech before the Munich People’s Court during the Putsch trial\r\n(_3119-PS_; see “The Hitler Trial Before the People’s Court in Munich”\r\n(_Der Hitler Prozess vor dem Volksgericht in Muenchen_), published by\r\nKnorr & Hirth, G.M.B.H., Muenchen, 1924.)\r\n\r\nWhen Hitler was arrested during those early revolutionary days, Frick\r\nused his position in the Munich Police Department to release him under\r\nhis own authority (_3124-PS_).\r\n\r\nFrick participated in the Nazi Beer Hall Putsch of 8-9 November 1923,\r\nand was tried with Hitler on a charge of complicity in treason. He was\r\nconvicted and received a suspended sentence of one year and three months\r\nin a fortress (_3132-PS_).\r\n\r\nHitler’s appreciation of Frick’s assistance during those years is\r\ndemonstrated by the fact that Hitler honored Frick by mentioning his\r\nname in _Mein Kampf_, the Nazi bible. Only two other defendants in this\r\nproceeding, Hess and Streicher, share that honor. In this reference\r\nHitler said of Frick:\r\n\r\n    “He [Munich Police President Poehner] and his coworker Dr. Frick\r\n    are in my estimation the only men in government positions, who\r\n    have the right to collaborate in the establishment of a Bavarian\r\n    Nation.” (_3125-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Frick’s activities as member of Reichstag._ Having been elected to\r\nthe Reichstag on 4 May 1924, Frick stated that it was his task not to\r\n“support, but to undermine the parliamentary system” (_2742-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn the Reichstag Frick immediately proposed those discriminatory\r\nmeasures against the Jews which were enacted after he and the other Nazi\r\nconspirators had come into power in 1933. On 25 August 1924 Frick\r\ndemanded in the Reichstag that all Jews be removed from public office\r\n(_3128-PS_). Two days later he returned with a motion calling for\r\n“special legislation for all members of the Jewish race” (_3119-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn 1930, a significant investigative report was prepared by the Prussian\r\nMinistry of the Interior (_2513-PS_). This official report analyzed the\r\ncriminal activities of Hitler, Frick, and other Nazis. It stated that\r\nFrick had to be regarded as the most influential leader of the NSDAP\r\nnext to Hitler. This document reported that at the 1927 Party Congress\r\nin Nurnberg, Frick said that the Nazi Party would first infiltrate into\r\nparliament and misuse its privileges, then abolish it and thus open the\r\nway for racial dictatorship. The document also reported that Frick\r\nstated in a speech in 1929 at Pyritz that this fateful struggle would\r\nfirst be taken up with the ballot, but that this could not continue\r\nindefinitely, for history had taught that in a battle “blood must be\r\nshed and iron broken.” As early as 1929, according to this same report,\r\nFrick announced that a Special Peoples’ Court would be created, in which\r\nthe enemies of the Nazi Party would be called to account for their\r\npolitical acts (_2513-PS_).\r\n\r\n(3) _Frick’s activities as Minister of Interior and Education in\r\nThuringia._ Frick’s prominent role in helping to bring the Nazis to\r\npower was recognized when on 23 January 1930 he was appointed Minister\r\nof the Interior and Education in the German State of Thuringia, the\r\nfirst ministerial appointment controlled by the National Socialists\r\n(_3119-PS_).\r\n\r\nIt was in this capacity that Frick began his manipulation to provide\r\nAdolf Hitler with German citizenship, an essential step toward the\r\nrealization of the Nazi conspiracy. It must be remembered that Hitler at\r\nthat time was not a German citizen and was regarded by the Prussian\r\npolice administration as an undesirable alien. This lack of German\r\ncitizenship was most damaging to the cause of the Nazi Party because, as\r\nan alien, Hitler could not become a candidate for the Reich Presidency\r\nin Germany.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Frick was unsuccessful when he tried to grant Hitler\r\nGerman citizenship by appointing Hitler as police officer in Thuringia,\r\nthus conferring German citizenship automatically. Later he succeeded\r\nwith a similar maneuver. This was expressly confirmed by Otto Meissner,\r\nformer State Secretary and Chief of Hitler’s Presidential Chancellery,\r\nin an affidavit which reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Frick also, in collaboration with Klagges, Minister of\r\n    Brunswick, succeeded in naturalizing Hitler as a German citizen\r\n    in 1932 by having him appointed a Brunswick government official\r\n    (Counsellor of Government). This was done in order to make it\r\n    possible for Hitler to run as a candidate for the office of\r\n    President of the Reich.” (_3564-PS_)\r\n\r\nDuring his tenure as State Minister in Thuringia, Frick again misused\r\nhis official authority in order to advance the Nazi conspiracy through\r\nmeasures designed to establish Nazi control over the police, and over\r\nthe administration and curriculum of universities and schools. Three of\r\nhis measures are specially noteworthy:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Appointment of the Nazi race theoretician, Dr. Guenther, as\r\nProfessor at the University of Jena, against the wishes of the faculty.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Compulsory introduction in the schools of Nazi prayers whose\r\nnationalistic, militaristic, and blasphemous character was such that\r\nthree out of five were declared unconstitutional by the German\r\nConstitutional Court on 11 July 1930.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Infiltration of Nazis in the Police, which twice provoked a\r\nrupture in the administrative relations between the State of Thuringia\r\nand the Reich Ministry of the Interior, and resulted in the withdrawal\r\nof the important police subsidy payment of the Reich to the State.\r\n(_3132-PS; 3128-PS_)\r\n\r\n C. _FRICK’S PARTICIPATION IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TOTALITARIAN CONTROL\r\n                             OVER GERMANY._\r\n\r\nFrick’s appointment as Reichsministerof the Interior in the first Hitler\r\nCabinet of 30 January 1933 gave him the task of “strengthening the power\r\nof the government and to secure the New Regime” (_3128-PS_).\r\n\r\n(1) _Powers of Frick as Minister of Interior._ To this task his Ministry\r\nwas perfectly suited. As Minister of the Interior Frick became\r\nresponsible for the realization of a large part of the conspirators’\r\nprogram, through both legislation and administration. His Ministry was\r\ncharged especially with the following tasks:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Internal Administration (State and local governments; State and\r\nLocal Civil Service).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Relations between Nazi Party and State.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Elections.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Citizenship.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Racial Law and Policy (Jewish Question, Eugenics), National\r\nHealth.\r\n\r\n(_f_) Armed Forces and Reich Defense (Conscription).\r\n\r\n(_g_) Establishment of the New Order in occupied and annexed\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n(_h_) Legislation, Constitutional Law (civil liberties).\r\n\r\n(_i_) Police Forces (including Gestapo, protective custody,\r\nconcentration camps). (_3303-PS_; _3475-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe names of the men who, according to (_3475-PS_), worked under Frick’s\r\nsupervision are significant. Among the subordinates of Frick were “Reich\r\nHealth Leader, Dr. Conti,” “Reich Fuehrer SS and Chief of the German\r\nPolice, Heinrich Himmler,” and “Reich Labor Service Leader, Konstantin\r\nHierl.” Frick was, therefore, supreme commander of three important\r\npillars of the Nazi state: The Nazi Public Health Service, the Police\r\nSystem, and the Labor Service.\r\n\r\nThe wide variety of the activities of Frick as Reich Minister of the\r\nInterior can be judged from the following catalogue of his functions: He\r\nhad final authority on constitutional questions, drafted legislation,\r\nhad jurisdiction over governmental administration and civil defense, and\r\nwas final arbiter of questions concerning race and citizenship. The\r\nManual for Administrative Officials also lists sections of his ministry\r\nconcerned with administrative problems for the occupied territories,\r\nincluding annexed territories, the New Order in the South East, the\r\nProtectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and the New Order in the East\r\n(_3475-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of the Interior also had considerable authority over the\r\ncivil service, including such matters as appointment, tenure, promotion,\r\nand discharge. The Manual for Administrative Officials (_3475-PS_)\r\nstates that Frick’s functions included supervision of the general law of\r\ncivil servants, civil servants’ policies, civil service aspirants,\r\neducation and training of civil servants and political and other\r\nofficials. Frick’s Ministry also had extensive jurisdiction over the\r\nGerman civil servants detailed to the administration of the occupied\r\ncountries. This fact was admitted by Wilhelm Stuckart, former Under\r\nSecretary of Frick’s Ministry of the Interior, who stated in an\r\ninterrogation:\r\n\r\n    “As far as I know, the officials for the new territories were\r\n    selected by the Personnel Office [of the Ministry of the\r\n    Interior] according to their qualifications, their physical\r\n    condition and maybe also their knowledge of the language.”\r\n    (_3570-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the full use of these broad powers, Frick made his essential\r\ncontribution to the advancement of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\n(2) _Nazi seizure of power of German States._ His first act after the\r\nConspirators’ accession to power was to install Nazi governments and\r\nadministrations in all German States where they were not already in\r\npower. The State governments which refused to hand over their\r\nconstitutional authority to the Nazi successors designated by Frick were\r\nremoved on Frick’s orders. This was the case in Bavaria, Hamburg,\r\nBremen, Luebeck, Hesse, Baden, Wuerttemberg, and Saxony.\r\n\r\nThe manner and purpose of this program was clearly stated in the book,\r\n“Dr. Frick and his Ministry,” which was published by his Under-Secretary\r\nWilhelm Pfundner for Frick’s 60th birthday in order to establish the\r\nfull scope of his contribution to the creation of the Nazis’\r\n“Thousand-Year Reich”:\r\n\r\n    “While Marxism in Prussia was crushed by the hard fist of the\r\n    Prussian Prime Minister, Hermann Goering, and a gigantic wave of\r\n    propaganda was initiated for the Reichstag elections of 5 March\r\n    1933, Dr. Frick prepared the complete seizure of power in all\r\n    states of the Reich. All at once the political opposition\r\n    disappeared. All at once the Main [River] line was eliminated.\r\n    From this time on only one will and one leadership reigned in\r\n    the German Reich.” (_3119-PS_; _3132-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Abolition of political opposition._ Frick then proceeded to destroy\r\nall opposition parties in order to establish the political monopoly of\r\nthe Nazi Party over Germany. Here again he acted by legislative fiat\r\nagainst all parties which did not dissolve voluntarily. Among the laws\r\nwhich he initiated for this purpose were the law of 26 May 1933\r\nconfiscating Communists’ property (_1396-PS_); the law of 14 July 1933\r\nconfiscating property inimical to nation and state (_1388-PS_); the law\r\nof 7 July 1933 voiding the mandates of all Social Democrat candidates\r\nelected to Reich state and local diets (_2058-PS_); and the law of 14\r\nJuly 1933 outlawing all political parties other than the Nazi Party\r\n(_1388-A-PS_; see _2403-PS_).\r\n\r\nFrick drafted and administered the laws which assured the control of the\r\nNazi Party over the State and “placed the government machinery * * * at\r\nthe disposal of the Party.” Chief among these enactments were the Law to\r\nSecure the Unity of Party and State, of 1 December 1933, which provided\r\nthat all government agencies should “lend legal and administrative aid\r\nto the Party agencies” (_1395-PS_), and the law of 1 August 1934\r\nconsolidating the positions of Chief of State and Leader of the Party\r\n(_2003-PS_; see _3119-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe success of this series of measures was accurately described by Frick\r\nhimself in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    “In National Socialist Germany, leadership is in the hands of an\r\n    organized community, the National Socialist Party; and as the\r\n    latter represents the will of the nation, the policy adopted by\r\n    it in harmony with the vital interests of the nation is, at the\r\n    same time, the policy adopted by the country * * *.” (_3258-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Consolidation of power in Reich Cabinet._ Frick’s next task was to\r\nconsolidate the executive and legislative control thus achieved. First\r\nhe drafted the law of 24 March 1933, which gave the Reich Cabinet the\r\npower to legislate by decree. This law marked the end of parliamentary\r\ngovernment in Germany (_2001-PS_).\r\n\r\nAs a further step in the same direction, Frick prepared a series of laws\r\nwhich destroyed all autonomous State and local government. Through these\r\nlaws, all governmental power in Germany was consolidated in the Reich\r\nCabinet. Administration of these laws was placed in the hands of Frick.\r\nThese enactments include the Temporary Law for the Coordination of the\r\nStates with the Reich, of 31 March 1933 (_2004-PS_); the Law for the\r\nCoordination of the States with the Reich, of 7 April 1933 (_2005-PS_);\r\nthe law of 30 January 1934 transferring the sovereignty of the states to\r\nthe Reich; the first ordinance under the law of 30 January 1934\r\nsubjecting state legislation to Reich approval, 2 February 1934; the\r\nsecond Reich Governor Law of 30 January 1935; the German Municipality\r\nAct of 30 January 1935 (_2008-PS_); and the law of 14 February 1934\r\nabolishing the Reichsrat. (see _3119-PS_; _2380-PS_).\r\n\r\nFrick drafted the laws which abolished the independence of the civil\r\nservice, including functionaries of the Reich and the States, judges,\r\nand university teachers. As Reichsminister of the Interior, he was\r\ncharged with the administration of these laws. Among these laws was the\r\nCivil Service Act of 7 April 1933, paragraphs 3 and 4 of which provided\r\nfor the elimination of civil servants on the basis of religious or\r\npolitical beliefs (_1397-PS_; see _3119-PS_).\r\n\r\nThis complete subjection of the civil servants to the Nazi-controlled\r\nMinistry of Interior was well illustrated by an order of Frick demanding\r\na report on civil servants who had failed to vote in the Reichstag\r\nelections of 29 March 1936 (_D-43_).\r\n\r\n(5) _Establishment of the Police State._ Having thus taken possession of\r\nthe entire government machinery, Frick organized a huge Reich police in\r\norder to maintain the conspirators’ power against all opposition.\r\n\r\nIt should be emphasized that before this time there was no unified Reich\r\npolice system; each individual German State had a police force of its\r\nown. Even then, Frick had complete control over the police forces,\r\nthrough the Reich Governor Act which subjected the State governments to\r\nthe authority of the Reich government, in the person of the Reich\r\nMinister of the Interior (_2005-PS_; _L-82_).\r\n\r\nThe decisive change-over to centralized totalitarianism was effected by\r\nthe Act of 17 June 1936 (RGBl, 1936, Part I, p. 487), which was signed\r\nby Frick and Hitler (_2073-PS_). Section 1 of this decree reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “For the unification of police duties in the Reich, a Chief of\r\n    German Police is instituted in the German Ministry of the\r\n    Interior, to whom is assigned the direction and conduct of all\r\n    police affairs.” (_2073-PS_)\r\n\r\nSection 2 shows that it was Frick and Hitler, the signers of the decree,\r\nwho appointed Himmler as Chief of the German Police. Paragraph 2,\r\nsection 2 of the decree states that Himmler was “subordinated\r\nindividually and directly to the Reich and Prussian Minister of the\r\nInterior” (_2073-PS_). In other words, Frick not only appointed Himmler\r\nbut himself became, pursuant to this decree, the supreme commander of\r\nthe Reich police system in his capacity as Reich and Prussian Minister\r\nof the Interior.\r\n\r\nThe official chart of the German police system (_1852-PS_; _see Chart\r\nNumber 16_) clearly shows the position of Reichsministerof the Interior\r\nFrick as the head of the entire German police system. This includes the\r\nnotorious RSHA, of which Kaltenbrunner became chief under Frick in\r\nJanuary 1943 (_3119-PS_).\r\n\r\nFrick used this newly created authority for the promotion of the Nazi\r\nconspiracy. By his decree of 12 February 1936 he established in detail\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Secret State Police (Gestapo), especially over\r\nthe concentration camps and in the field of political police information\r\n(_2108-PS_).\r\n\r\nBy his decree of 20 September 1936, published in the Ministerial Gazette\r\nof the Reich (_Ministerialblatt des Reichs-und Preussischen Ministerium\r\ndes Innern_), 1936, page 1343, (_2245-PS_), Frick reserved for himself\r\nthe authority to appoint inspectors of security police and ordered their\r\nclose cooperation with the Party and with the Army. Furthermore, in an\r\nordinance dated 18 March 1938 (RGBl, 1938, Part I, page 262) (_1437-PS_)\r\nconcerning the reunion of Austria with the Reich, Frick authorized\r\nHimmler to take security measures in Austria without regard to previous\r\nlegal limitations. Similarly, in his Decree of 11 November 1938 Frick\r\nordered that all authorities cooperate closely with the SD and RSHA\r\nunder Himmler (_1638-PS_).\r\n\r\nFrick’s direct control over Himmler’s Reich police can also be shown in\r\nnumerous other instances. It is necessary only to mention Himmler’s\r\norder of 26 June 1936 by which he authorized Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of\r\nthe SD, and Kurt Daluege, Chief of the regular police, to sign “By order\r\nof the Minister of the Interior” (_1551-PS_; _1680-PS_).\r\n\r\nAs a result, the Police and part of Himmler’s SS became in fact merged\r\nunder Frick’s jurisdiction. An order by Hitler dated 17 August 1938\r\nregulated the functions of the SS, which “have entered into close\r\nconnection with the duties of the German police” in the Ministry of\r\nInterior (_647-PS_; see _1637-PS_).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Frick gave direct orders to the State Gestapo offices. Thus\r\non 6 November 1934 Frick issued an order addressed, among others, to the\r\nPrussian Gestapo, prohibiting the publication of Protestant church\r\nannouncements (_1498-PS_), and also issued a secret circular addressed,\r\namong others, to the Prussian Gestapo, subjecting Catholic youth\r\norganizations to severe restrictions (_1482-PS_).\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to repeat the evidence concerning the criminal\r\nactivities of the German police, over which Frick had supreme authority.\r\nReference is made to Chapter XI on Concentration Camps, Chapter XII on\r\nPersecution of the Jews, Section 6, Chapter VII on Persecution of the\r\nChurch, and Chapter XV on the criminal organizations, such as the SA,\r\nSS, the Gestapo, and SD. Frick’s personal familiarity with these illegal\r\nactivities may be illustrated by two striking instances. The first\r\ninstance is contained in a synopsis of correspondence between the Reich\r\nMinistry of the Interior and its field offices from November 1942\r\nthrough August 1943, concerning the legal aspects of the confiscation of\r\nproperty by the SS for the enlargement of the concentration camp at\r\nAuschwitz (_1643-PS_). This document contains the minutes of a meeting\r\nheld on 17 and 18 December 1942 concerning the confiscation of this\r\nproperty. These minutes indicate that a further discussion was to be\r\nheld on this subject on 21 December 1942, between the representatives of\r\nthe Reichsminister of the Interior and the Reichsfuehrer SS. There is\r\nalso a summary of a teletype letter, 22 January 1943, from Dr. Hoffman,\r\nrepresenting the Reichsministerof the Interior, to the\r\n_Regierungspraesident_ in Kattowitz, a provincial administrator under\r\nthe direct jurisdiction of the Reichsministerof the Interior. The\r\nsummary begins significantly with the sentence:\r\n\r\n    “The territory of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp will be\r\n    changed into an independent estate.” (_1643-PS_)\r\n\r\nA second illustration of Frick’s personal interest in the activities of\r\nHimmler’s police and SS is the fact that in 1943 Frick visited the\r\nconcentration camp at Dachau, where he personally acquainted himself\r\nwith the forced malaria inoculation of healthy camp inmates and with\r\nother experiments on human beings carried out by Dr. Rascher. This is\r\nborne out by the affidavit of Dr. Franz Blaha, a former inmate of the\r\nconcentration camp at Dachau, who has stated that Frick made a special\r\ntour of inspection of the malaria and cooling experimental stations at\r\nDachau (_3249-PS_).\r\n\r\n(6) _Suppression and terrorization of opponents._ Having established\r\nthis powerful police organization under his command, Frick used it\r\nespecially in order to suppress all internal opposition. That this would\r\nbe his aim he had repeatedly announced even in the years before 1933,\r\nwhen he declared that he was ready to establish the power of the\r\nconspirators with terror and violence (_2513-PS_).\r\n\r\nAs early as 1932, Frick threatened his opponents in the Reichstag with\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n    “Don’t worry, when we are in power we shall put all of you guys\r\n    in concentration camps.” (_L-83_)\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this long-planned campaign of political terrorism, Frick\r\ndrafted and signed a series of decrees legalizing all those uses of the\r\npolitical police which he considered necessary in order to establish the\r\ndictatorial power of the conspirators within Germany.\r\n\r\nFive days after the accession of the conspirators to power Frick signed\r\nthe first law limiting the freedom of assembly and of the press in\r\nGermany. Then, on 28 February 1933, the day after the Reichstag fire,\r\ncivil rights in Germany were abolished altogether by decree signed by\r\nFrick (_1390-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe preamble of this decree, which was published on the morning after\r\nthe Reichstag fire, stated that the suspension of civil rights was\r\ndecreed as a defense measure against Communist acts of violence\r\nendangering the State. At the time of publication of this decree, the\r\nNazi government announced that a thorough investigation had proven that\r\nthe Communists had set fire to the Reichstag building. It is not\r\nnecessary here to go into the controversial question of who set fire to\r\nthe Reichstag, but it should be stressed that the official Nazi\r\nstatement that the Communists had set fire to the building, on which\r\nFrick’s law was predicated, was issued without any investigation. Proof\r\nof this fact is contained in an interrogation of Goering on 13 October\r\n1945, which contains the following passage:\r\n\r\n        “Q. How could you tell your press agent, one hour after the\r\n              Reichstag caught fire, that the Communists did it, without\r\n              investigation?\r\n         A. Did the public relations officer say that I said that?\r\n         Q. Yes. He said you said it.\r\n         A. It is possible when I came to the Reichstag, the Fuehrer and\r\n              his gentlemen were there. I was doubtful at the time but\r\n              it was their opinion that the Communists had started the\r\n              fire.\r\n         Q. But you were the highest law enforcement official in a\r\n              certain sense. Daluege was your subordinate. Looking back\r\n              at it now, and not in the excitement that was there once,\r\n              wasn’t it too early to say without any investigation that\r\n              the Communists had started the fire?\r\n         A. Yes, that is possible, but the Fuehrer wanted it this way.\r\n         Q. Why did the Fuehrer want to issue at once a statement that\r\n              the Communists had started the fire?\r\n         A. He was convinced of it.\r\n         Q. It is right when I say he was convinced without having any\r\n              evidence or any proof of that at this moment?\r\n         A. That is right, but you must take into account that at that\r\n              time the Communist activity was extremely strong, that our\r\n              new government as such was not very secure.” (_3593-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis Act of 28 February 1933 also constituted the basis for the\r\nestablishment of the concentration camps. Frick himself established in\r\ndetail the handling of so-called “protective custody” under which\r\ninmates were held in concentration camps (_779-PS_; _1723-PS_; _L-302_).\r\n\r\nFrick also signed two laws designed specifically to suppress all\r\ncriticism and opposition to the Government and the Nazi Party\r\n(_1652-PS_; _1393-PS_).\r\n\r\nFrick also signed the laws which brought about the suppression of\r\nindependent labor unions as a potential source of opposition inside\r\nGermany to the progress of the Nazi conspiracy (_405-PS_; _1861-PS_;\r\n_1770-PS_). Among these decrees was the law providing for the\r\nconfiscation of all labor union property in favor of the German Labor\r\nFront (_1403-PS_).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Frick and his subordinates took an active part in the\r\npersecution of the independent churches. An order of the Reichsminister\r\nof the Interior dated 6 November 1934 prohibited the publication of\r\nProtestant church announcements (_1498-PS_); likewise Frick issued a\r\ncircular letter to Reich officials imposing severe restrictions on\r\nCatholic youth organizations (_1482-PS_). Frick further on 5 May 1938\r\nwrote to the heads of government agencies proposing methods for\r\ninvalidating the concordat between Austria and the Holy See (_680-PS_).\r\nHis Ministry was also in correspondence with the SD from 1940-1942\r\nconcerning the confiscation of church property (_R-101-A, through\r\nR-101-D_).\r\n\r\n        D. _FRICK’S PROMOTION OF RACIAL PERSECUTION AND RACISM._\r\n\r\nFrick promoted the program of racial persecution and racism, involving\r\nthe wiping out of the Jews, and the killing of the allegedly insane and\r\nothers for whom the German war machine had no further use.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its many other responsibilities, the vast administrative\r\nempire of Frick controlled the enactment and administration of racial\r\nand eugenic legislation. The “Manual for German Administrative\r\nOfficials” (_3475-PS_) shows the following additional functions of\r\nFrick’s Ministry: Health Administration, Social Hygiene; Heredity and\r\nRacial Welfare; Reich Plenipotentiary for Sanitaria and Nursing Homes;\r\nBoard for the Examination of Physicians, Dentists and Pharmacists; and\r\nReich Committee for Public Hygiene. Accordingly, Frick was the\r\nadministrative guardian and protector of the German race.\r\n\r\n(1) _Persecution of Jews._ Frick took charge of the legislative and\r\nadministrative program through which the Nazi conspirators sought to\r\nwipe out the “non-Aryan” part of the German population. Here again he\r\ndrafted, signed, and administered the basic legislation. Among these\r\ndiscriminatory enactments were the following: the Reich Citizens Law of\r\n15 September 1935 depriving Jews of their citizenship rights\r\n(_1416-PS_); the law for the protection of German blood and honor, 15\r\nSeptember 1935, prohibiting mixed marriages (_2000-PS_); the first\r\nordinance under the Reich Citizens Law, 14 November 1935, depriving Jews\r\nof the right to vote (_1417-PS_); the Civil Service Act of 7 April 1933\r\nproviding for the elimination of non-Aryan government workers\r\n(_1397-PS_); the decree of 20 May 1938 introducing the Nurnberg laws in\r\nAustria; the decree of 31 May 1941 introducing the Nurnberg laws in the\r\nannexed eastern territories (_see 3119-PS_).\r\n\r\nExtending his program of persecution even to the religious practices of\r\nthe Jews, Frick signed the decree which outlawed ritual slaughtering.\r\n\r\nBut the activities of Frick’s Ministry were not restricted to the\r\ncommission of such crimes, camouflaged in the form of legislation. The\r\npolice field offices, subordinates to Frick, participated in the\r\norganization of such terroristic activities as the pogrom of 9 November\r\n1938. The pogrom was organized through a series of secret teletype\r\norders issued by Heydrich (_374-PS_; _3051-PS_). Afterward Heydrich\r\nreported on the loss of Jewish life and property resulting from the\r\npogrom (_3058-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe pogroms gave the Nazi conspirators occasion to proceed to the\r\ncomplete elimination of the Jews from economic life and the confiscation\r\nof most of their property (_1662-PS_; _1409-PS_).\r\n\r\nThree days after this pogrom of 9 November 1938 Frick, his\r\nundersecretary Stuckart, and his subordinates Heydrich and Daluege,\r\nparticipated in a conference on the Jewish question under the\r\nchairmanship of Goering. At this meeting various measures were discussed\r\nwhich the individual governmental departments should initiate against\r\nthe Jews. Goering’s concluding remark in that conference was:\r\n\r\n    “Also the Minister of the Interior and the Police will have to\r\n    think over what measures will have to be taken.” (_1816-PS_).\r\n\r\nIt was, accordingly, Frick’s duty to follow up by administrative action\r\nthe pogrom organized by Frick’s own subordinates.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Frick signed the Law of 23 July 1938 ordering a special\r\nregistration for all Jews, in order to establish the strictest possible\r\ncontrol over the Jewish population.\r\n\r\nAfter the outbreak of the war Heydrich issued an order in Frick’s name,\r\ncompelling all Jews to wear a yellow star in public (_2118-PS_).\r\n\r\nAmong the Ordinances which Frick issued under the Reich Citizen Law of\r\n15 September 1935, special mention should be made of the 11th Ordinance\r\nof 25 November 1941, which ordered the confiscation of the property of\r\nall deported or emigrated Jews; and the 13th Ordinance, under which the\r\nJews were deprived of all legal protection and completely handed over to\r\nthe jurisdiction of the police (_1422-PS_; _3085-PS_).\r\n\r\nStuckart, Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Interior, characterized\r\nthis legislation as the essential preparation for the “final solution of\r\nthe Jewish question” (_3131-PS_).\r\n\r\n(2) _Measures against “Inferior Racial Stock.”_ The Public Health\r\nService was administered as a division of Frick’s Ministry. One of its\r\nsubdivisions was devoted to race and heredity problems (_3123-PS_). In\r\nhis capacity as chief of this service Frick drafted the basic law\r\ncontrolling sterilization of persons afflicted with “hereditary\r\ndiseases” (_3067-PS_). Its administration was in the hands of his\r\nMinistry (_D-181_; _L-305_).\r\n\r\n   E. _FRICK’S PARTICIPATION IN THE PREPARATIONS FOR AGGRESSIVE WAR._\r\n\r\nFrick wholeheartedly supported the conspirators’ preparations for war.\r\nIt was his position that:\r\n\r\n    “Germany would observe her international undertakings only so\r\n    long as it suited Germany’s interests to do so.” (_2385-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrick, as Reich Minister of the Interior, was\r\n\r\n    “The ‘civilian’ defense minister and as such cooperated\r\n    prominently * * * in the important field of ‘defense\r\n    legislation’ and thereby in the development of * * * Germany’s\r\n    armed forces.” (_3119-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrick’s Ministry had a division entitled “Armed Forces and Reich\r\nDefense” (_3303-PS_).\r\n\r\n(1) _Rearmament and reinstitution of military service._ Frick took a\r\nleading part in Germany’s rearmament in violation of the Versailles\r\nTreaty. He drafted the basic laws on military sevice. These include the\r\nlaw of 16 March 1935 reintroducing universal military conscription\r\n(_1654-PS_); the decree of 6 March 1936 extending military and labor\r\nservice to German citizens abroad; the decree of 16 June 1938 extending\r\nthe military service law to Austria (_1660-PS_); and the decree of 30\r\nApril 1940 extending the Military Service Law to the incorporated\r\neastern territories (_see 3043-PS_; _1389-PS_; _388-PS, item 20_).\r\n\r\nFrick also supported the military training program of the SA, for the\r\nfinancing of which his Ministry of Interior was called upon to supply\r\nfunds (_1850-PS_).\r\n\r\nAdditional evidence that Frick contributed to Germany’s rearmament for\r\naggressive war is contained in a secret order, 25 July 1933, from the\r\nSupreme Command of the SA on the subject, “Publications of the SA.” This\r\norder states that several days before 25 July 1933 the Reich Ministry of\r\nthe Interior at the request of the Foreign Office gave strict\r\ninstructions to all Reich authorities that the most severe control was\r\nto be exercised over all publications which might give other countries\r\nan opportunity to construe German activities as infringements of the\r\nVersailles Treaty (_D-44_).\r\n\r\n(2) _Fifth column activities abroad._ In further preparation for the\r\naggressive wars planned by the conspirators, Frick used his power,\r\nprestige, and funds as Minister of the Interior in order to command\r\nsupport for the organization of a Fifth Column abroad among foreign\r\nnationals of German ancestry. In a circular of 24 February 1933 issued\r\nless than a month after the conspirators had taken over the government\r\nof Germany, Frick ordered all State governments to support, especially\r\nfinancially, the organization work of the League for Germandom Abroad\r\namong the\r\n\r\n    “30 million Germans in foreign countries [_Auslandsdeutschen._]\r\n    outside of the present contracted borders of the Reich [who] are\r\n    an integral part of the entire German people.” (_3258-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrick at a later date stated even more clearly the true purpose of this\r\nGerman Fifth Column he was helping to organize abroad. In his speech at\r\nthe twentieth annual meeting of the official German Foreign Institute\r\nheld in Stuttgart, on 11-15 August 1937, Frick stated that—\r\n\r\n    “the new Germany has recognized that its attention and devotion\r\n    to the welfare of the millions of Germans who have not the\r\n    fortune to owe political allegiance to Germany, but who are\r\n    condemned to live abroad, are not merely a matter of natural\r\n    sympathy and solidarity, but are in a higher degree dictated by\r\n    the strong political and economic interests of the Reich.”\r\n    (_3258-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Organization of civilian agencies for war._ Frick’s principal\r\ncontribution to the war preparations of the Nazi conspirators lay in his\r\nrole as General Plenipotentiary for the Administration of the Reich. He\r\noccupied this position as a member of the Reich Defense Council,\r\nbeginning on 21 May 1935 (_2978-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn this capacity, Frick had complete authority over\r\n\r\n    “the uniform direction of the nonmilitary administration with\r\n    the exception of the economic administrations.”\r\n\r\nHe was given control over the Ministries of Interior, Justice,\r\nEducation, Churches, and the Office for Spatial Planning, in order to\r\ndirect their entire planning activities in preparation of war\r\n(_2986-PS_; _2194-PS_). This was Frick’s responsibility during the more\r\nthan 4 years that elapsed before the actual launching of the\r\nconspirators’ first aggressive war.\r\n\r\nAs General Plenipotentiary for the Administration, Frick was a member of\r\nthe so-called Three-Man Committee, with Schacht, later Funk (Economy),\r\nand Keitel (OKW). This small group, which was empowered to legislate by\r\ndecree on all matters relating to war preparedness, represented during\r\nthese decisive years, from 1935 to 1939, a compact, powerful body in\r\nwhich could be concentrated the conspirators’ preparations for war\r\n(_2986-PS_; see also Section 3, chapter XV on the Reich Cabinet).\r\n\r\nIn a speech made on 7 March 1940 at the University of Freiburg, Frick\r\nadmitted the significant part he played in the preparations for war and\r\nas a member of the triumvirate created by the secret Reich Defense Law.\r\n\r\n    “* * * The organization of the nonmilitary national defense fits\r\n    organically into the entire structure of the National Socialist\r\n    government and administration. This state of affairs is not\r\n    exceptional, but a necessary and planned part of the National\r\n    Socialist order. Thus, the conversion of our administration and\r\n    economy to wartime conditions has been accomplished very quickly\r\n    and without any friction—avoiding the otherwise very dangerous\r\n    changes of the entire structure of the State.\r\n\r\n    “The planned preparation of the administration for the\r\n    possibility of a war has already been carried out during the\r\n    peace. For this purpose, the Fuehrer appointed a Plenipotentiary\r\n    General for the Reich Administration and a Plenipotentiary\r\n    General for the Economy. The Plenipotentiary General for the\r\n    Administration was placed in charge of the coordination of the\r\n    nonmilitary administrations, with the exception of the\r\n    Administration of Economics.” (_2608-PS_)\r\n\r\n   F. _FRICK’S PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES._\r\n\r\nFrick, as Minister of the Interior, was charged with the administrative\r\npolicy for all occupied and annexed territories. For this purpose, the\r\nMinistry contained a Division for Incorporated Territories, with\r\nSubdivisions entitled Reorganization in the South-East, the\r\nProtectorate, the East, and the West (_3475-PS_).\r\n\r\nWhen the Nazi conspirators embarked on their program of “bloodless”\r\nterritorial aggrandizement, Frick was in control of the incorporation\r\nand administration of these territories. Thus, it was Frick’s Ministry\r\nwhich introduced the German New Order and German law throughout the\r\nterritories of Europe occupied by the German Armed Forces. Frick\r\nexercised these powers in the Saar; in Austria (_2307-PS_; _3075-PS_);\r\nin the Sudetenland (_3076-PS_); in Bohemia and Moravia (_2119-PS_); in\r\nMemel; and in Danzig (_3077-PS_).\r\n\r\nWhen the conspirators started their aggressive Wars, Frick was\r\nspecifically charged with the organization and integration of the\r\nterritories illegally annexed by Germany. Among the territories over\r\nwhich Frick was given control were the Incorporated Eastern Territories,\r\nthe Gouvernment-General of Poland, Eupen, Malmedy, and Moresnot, and\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of this over-all administrative control:\r\n\r\n(1) Frick provided in detail for the administration of occupied Polish\r\nTerritory. It was Frick who was responsible for the installation of an\r\nSS Chief in the Territory in charge of the Police and the forced\r\nresettlement program (_3304-PS_).\r\n\r\n(2) Frick provided the administrative personnel for the government of\r\nthese occupied territories. Thus, he arranged for the selection and\r\nassignment of hundreds of occupation officials for Russia before the\r\ninvasion had even begun (_1039-PS_).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Wilhelm Stuckart, former Under-Secretary of the Interior\r\nunder Frick, has stated in an interrogation:\r\n\r\n    “As far as I knew, the officials for the new territories were\r\n    selected by the Personnel Office [of the Ministry of the\r\n    Interior] according to their qualifications, their physical\r\n    condition, and maybe also their knowledge of the language.”\r\n    (_3570-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) Frick had complete charge of the program of denationalization, under\r\nwhich certain groups of citizens in annexed territories were forced\r\nduring the progress of the war to abandon their original national\r\nallegiance and to accept German nationality. The decree of 4 March 1941\r\nestablished a German Racial Registry under which allied nationals of\r\nGerman stock were required to accept German nationality and to remove to\r\nGerman territory (_2917-PS_). Among the conquered territories in which\r\nthese activities of Frick were felt were Bohemia and Moravia, Upper\r\nCorinthia and Lower Styria, Eupen, Malmedy, and Moresnot, and the\r\nIncorporated Eastern Territories (see _3225-PS_).\r\n\r\nThese measures place upon Frick a full share of responsibility for the\r\nwar crimes committed by the conspiracy in the occupied and annexed\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n  G. _FRICK’S PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST\r\n                               HUMANITY._\r\n\r\nFrick actively participated in the execution of the conspirators’\r\nprogram of atrocities and Crimes against Humanity. Even without such\r\npersonal participation, however, Frick has admitted that he could\r\nproperly be charged with having for 12 years continued in the Reich\r\nCabinet, after he had realized the direction the conspiracy was taking\r\n(_3043-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe scope of Frick’s personal and direct responsibility for Nazi Crimes\r\nagainst Humanity is so broad that reference need be made only to a few\r\nof the most significant instances.\r\n\r\n(1) _Gestapo atrocities and concentration camps._ Frick, as\r\njurisdictional head of the German Police Administration, is responsible\r\nfor the crimes and atrocities perpetrated by the German police,\r\nespecially the Gestapo and SD, inside and outside of Germany. (See\r\n_1643-PS_; also Chapter XI on Concentration Camps.)\r\n\r\nAs already stated, Frick demonstrated particular interest in the\r\n“medical” experiments carried on in the concentration camps under the\r\npersonal direction of Himmler. Frick paid a personal visit to Germany’s\r\noldest concentration camp, Dachau, in 1943, for the purpose of\r\ninspecting the malaria station and Dr. Rascher’s Experimental Station\r\n(_3249-PS_). There he could personally acquaint himself with the forced\r\nsubjection of healthy camp inmates to malarial mosquitos and the\r\nair-pressure and freezing experiments on human beings carried on by Dr.\r\nRascher.\r\n\r\n(2) _Oppression of inhabitants of occupied territories._ As\r\nadministrative head of the occupied territories, Frick issued decrees\r\ndepriving the inhabitants of their rights and subjecting them to a cruel\r\nand discriminatory regime. Among these enactments were the decree of 4\r\nDecember 1941 establishing a special penal law for the Polish and Jewish\r\ninhabitants of the Gouvernment General (_R-96_), (_1249-PS_); the decree\r\nof 1 July 1943 depriving Jews of rights remaining to them under the\r\ndecree of 4 December 1941 (_1422-PS_); and the Himmler ordinance of 3\r\nJuly 1943 charging the Gestapo with the execution of the decree of 1\r\nJuly 1943 (published in Frick’s Ministry of Interior Gazette 1943, p.\r\n1085) (_3085-PS_).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the Decree on the Utilization of Eastern Workers, which\r\nrequired that they be paid salaries substantially below those fixed for\r\nGerman workers holding similar jobs, was signed in Frick’s name by his\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\n(3) _Systematic killing of insane, ill, aged, and incapacitated foreign\r\nslave laborers._ Frick’s greatest guilt perhaps rests on his\r\nresponsibility, as Reich Minister of the Interior, for the systematic\r\nkilling of the insane, the sick, and the aged, including those foreign\r\nforced laborers who were no longer able to work. These killings were\r\ncarried out in nursing homes, hospitals, and asylums. Frick, in his\r\ncapacity of Reichsminister of the Interior, had full jurisdiction over\r\nall these institutions (_3475-PS_).\r\n\r\nProof that the Reichministry of the Interior under Frick actually\r\nexercised this jurisdiction is to be found in a letter of 2 October 1940\r\n(_621-PS_) from the Chief of the Reich Chancellery, Dr. Lammers, to the\r\nReichsminister of Justice. The letter informed the Minister of Justice\r\nthat the Chief Prosecutors’ reports concerning the death of inmates of\r\nnursing homes had been transmitted to the Reichsminister of the Interior\r\nfor further action (_621-PS_). Through other correspondence Frick’s\r\nMinistry of the Interior was informed of the unexplained deaths of\r\ninsane persons (_1696-PS_; _1969-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe most striking example of the continued killings in these\r\ninstitutions, which were under Frick’s jurisdiction, is the famous\r\nHadamar case. Systematic killing started at the Hadamar nursing home as\r\nearly as 1939. At least as early as 1941 Frick was officially acquainted\r\nwith the fact that these killings had become public knowledge. Proof is\r\nfound in a letter from the Bishop of Limburg of 13 August 1941 to the\r\nReichsminister of Justice, copies of which were sent to the\r\nReichsminister of the Interior and the Reichsministerfor Church Affairs.\r\nThe letter reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * About 8 kilometers from Limburg, in the little town of\r\n    Hadamar, on a hill overlooking the town, there is an institution\r\n    which had formerly served various purposes and of late had been\r\n    used as a nursing home; this institution was renovated and\r\n    furnished as a place in which, by consensus of opinion, the\r\n    above-mentioned Euthenasia has been systematically practiced for\r\n    months—approximately since February 1941. The fact has become\r\n    known beyond the administrative district of Wiesbaden, because\r\n    death certificates from a Registry Hadamar-Moenchberg are sent\r\n    to the home communities. * * *\r\n\r\n    “Several times a week buses arrive in Hadamar with a\r\n    considerable number of such victims. School children of the\r\n    vicinity know this vehicle and say: ‘There comes the murder-box\r\n    again.’ After the arrival of the vehicle, the citizens of\r\n    Hadamar watch the smoke rise out of the chimney and are tortured\r\n    with the ever-present thought of the miserable victims,\r\n    especially when repulsive odors annoy them, depending on the\r\n    direction of the wind.\r\n\r\n    “The effect of the principles at work here are: Children call\r\n    each other names and say, ‘You’re crazy; you’ll be sent to the\r\n    baking oven in Hadamar.’ Those who do not want to marry, or find\r\n    no opportunity, say ‘Marry, never! Bring children into the world\r\n    so they can be put into the bottling machine!’ You hear old\r\n    folks say, ‘Don’t send me to a state hospital! After the\r\n    feeble-minded have been finished off, the next useless eaters\r\n    whose turn will come are the old people.’\r\n\r\n    “* * * The population cannot grasp that systematic actions are\r\n    carried out which in accordance with Par. 211 of the German\r\n    criminal code are punishable with death! * * *\r\n\r\n    “Officials of the Secret State Police, it is said, are trying to\r\n    suppress discussion of the Hadamar occurrences by means of\r\n    severe threats. In the interest of public peace, this may be\r\n    well intended. But the knowledge and the conviction and the\r\n    indignation of the population cannot be changed by it; the\r\n    conviction will be increased with the bitter realization that\r\n    discussion is prohibited with threats but that the actions\r\n    themselves are not prosecuted under penal law.\r\n\r\n    “_Facta loquuntur._\r\n\r\n    “I beg you most humbly, Herr Reich Minister, in the sense of the\r\n    report of the Episcopate of July 16 of this year, to prevent\r\n    further transgressions of the Fifth Commandment of God.\r\n\r\n                               “(Signed)  Dr. Hilfrich” (_615-PS_).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the killings in these institutions continued year after\r\nyear. This is shown by a certified copy of the charge, specifications,\r\nand findings of the U. S. Military Commission at Wiesbaden, against the\r\nindividuals who operated the Hadamar Sanitarium, where many Russians and\r\nPoles were done away with. In this particular proceeding, seven\r\ndefendants were charged with the murder in 1944 and 1945 of 400 persons\r\nof Polish and Russian nationality. Three of the defendants were\r\nsentenced to be hanged; the other four were sentenced to confinement at\r\nhard labor (_3592-PS_).\r\n\r\nBut the murdering in Hadamar was only part of a systematic program. The\r\nofficial report of the Czechoslovak War Crimes Commission, entitled\r\n“Detailed Statement on the Murdering of Ill and Aged People in Germany,”\r\nshows that Frick was one of the originators of the secret law of 1940,\r\nwhich authorized the killing of sick and aged persons and under which\r\nthe Hadamar “murder mill” was operated until 1945. The first 3\r\nparagraphs of that report read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. The murdering can be traced back to a secret law which was\r\n    released some time in the summer of 1940.\r\n\r\n    “2. Besides the Chief Physician of the Reich, Dr. L. Conti, the\r\n    Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler, the Reichsminister of the Interior Dr.\r\n    Frick, as well as other men, the following participated in the\r\n    introduction of this secret law * * *.\r\n\r\n    “3. As I have already stated, there were—after careful\r\n    calculation—at least 200,000 mainly mentally deficient,\r\n    imbeciles, besides neurological cases and medically unfit\r\n    people—these were not only incurable cases—and at least 75,000\r\n    aged people.” (_1556-PS_).\r\n\r\nThus, Frick bears full responsibility for the systematic killing of the\r\n“unproductive eaters,” for whom the Nazi war machine had no use.\r\n\r\n(4) _Oppression in Bohemia and Moravia._ The final phase of Frick’s\r\ncriminal activities began with his appointment as Protector in Bohemia\r\nand Moravia, on 20 August 1943 (_3086-PS_).\r\n\r\nHis authority was clearly defined in a Secret Decree issued on 29 August\r\n1943. That Decree provided that the Reich Protector was “the\r\nrepresentative of the Fuehrer in his capacity as Chief of State.” In\r\naddition to this over-all authority, Frick was given jurisdiction “to\r\nconfirm the members of the government of the Protectorate, to appoint,\r\ndismiss and retire the German civil servants in the Protectorate.” He\r\nwas given full power “to grant pardons and to quash proceedings in all\r\ncases except in cases before the Military and SS Police Courts”\r\n(_1366-PS_).\r\n\r\nThese broad powers establish the clear responsibility of Frick for the\r\ncrimes committed in the Protectorate under his administration during the\r\nlast 20 months of the War. As representative of the Fuehrer in the\r\nProtectorate, he covered these criminal acts with Hitler’s name and\r\nabsolute power.\r\n\r\nAs a single example of these crimes, reference may be made to Supplement\r\n6 to the official Czechoslovak Report on German Crimes Against\r\nCzechoslovakia:\r\n\r\n    “During the tenure of office of defendant Wilhelm Frick as Reich\r\n    Protector of Bohemia and Moravia from August 1943 until the\r\n    liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945, many thousands of\r\n    Czechoslovak Jews were transported from the Terezin ghetto in\r\n    Czechoslovakia to the concentration camp at Oswiecziem\r\n    (Auschwitz) in Poland and were there killed in the gas\r\n    chambers.” (_3589-PS_).\r\n\r\nFrick was also fully responsible for the multiple and notorious\r\nmiscarriages of justice by which the population of the Protectorate was\r\nsystematically persecuted and oppressed. His failure to correct these\r\nmiscarriages of justice through the exercise of his right to grant\r\npardons and to quash legal proceedings is tantamount to a confirmation\r\nof the cruel and illegal sentences imposed upon the inhabitants of the\r\nProtectorate (_1556-PS_; _3589-PS_).\r\n\r\nFrick’s specific responsibility on these counts must be added to the\r\nover-all responsibility which he bears because of the fact that he was\r\nin power as Reich Protector while such Crimes against Humanity were\r\ncommitted against the population of Bohemia and Moravia (_3443-PS_).\r\n\r\n                            H. _CONCLUSION._\r\n\r\nFrick, who joined the Nazi conspiracy at its early beginning, played\r\nwithin the conspiracy the role of expert administrator and coordinator\r\nof State and Party affairs. Misusing his governmental positions in the\r\npre-Hitler era, he gave aid and protection to the conspirators when they\r\nwere still weak. He supported them in their first attempt to come into\r\npower by force, expecting to gain high office from their success. He was\r\nthe first to carry their revolutionary program from the Beer Hall to the\r\nReichstag Rostrum. As their earliest important office-holder (in\r\nThuringia), he developed for the first time their totalitarian and\r\nterroristic methods of political and intellectual control.\r\n\r\nUpon the accession to power of the Nazi conspirators on 30 January 1933,\r\nFrick took over the vital Ministry of Interior. From this position he\r\ndirected the realization of the entire domestic program of the\r\nconspiracy. He took complete charge of the successive destruction of the\r\nparliamentary system, of autonomous State and local government, and of\r\nthe career civil service. He planned and executed the measures which\r\nsubjected the government itself to the domination of the Nazi Party. He\r\nthen proceeded to establish a huge Reich Police Force under Himmler,\r\nwhich became the instrument with which the Nazi conspirators terrorized\r\nand ultimately “liquidated” all opposition inside and outside Germany in\r\nconcentration and extermination camps.\r\n\r\nIn order to give the semblance of law to the criminal acts of the\r\nconspirators, Frick drafted legislation to withdraw constitutional\r\nprotection from the rights and liberties which they had determined to\r\nwipe out. He participated in the relentless and violent persecution of\r\nall persons and groups who were considered as actual or potential\r\nopponents of the conspirators’ plans. Among these were the churches, the\r\nfree trade unions, and especially the Jews.\r\n\r\nHaving secured absolute control over Germany for the conspirators, Frick\r\nproceeded to bring the German people and State into readiness for the\r\nwars of aggression planned by the conspirators. He established the\r\nsystem of military and labor service on which the _Wehrmacht_ was to\r\nrest. He took over the planning of Germany’s civilian wartime\r\nadministration, which was to back it up. In this capacity he organized\r\nand supervised the killing of the useless eaters, the insane, crippled,\r\naged, and such foreign forced laborers who were no longer able to work.\r\n\r\nAs the Nazi conspirators began to achieve their predatory aims, Frick\r\nwas active in the coordination of the administration of the territories\r\nand peoples which fell into Nazi hands. He presided over the annexation\r\nof territories and the denationalization of their inhabitants in\r\nviolation of the Hague Conventions. When the conspirators were ready to\r\nproceed to the realization of their ultimate goals, especially the\r\ncomplete enslavement and annihilation of conquered populations, Frick\r\ndevised the basic legislation for their disfranchisement and finally\r\ntook personal charge of one of the oppressed nations, Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nThus, Frick was one of the principal artisans of the conspiracy\r\nthroughout its course. His contribution to its progress was essential in\r\nall its phases, and decisive in many. He nurtured the conspiracy,\r\ndirected its followers, terrorized its opponents, and destroyed its\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\n                     I. _POSITIONS HELD BY FRICK._\r\n\r\n(1) Between 1932 and 1945 Frick held the following positions:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Member of the Nazi Party, 1925-1945 (_3127-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Reichsleiter_ (Member of the Party Directorate) in his capacity\r\nas _Fraktionsfuehrer_ (Floorleader) of NSDAP in the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Member of the Reichstag, 7 December 1924-1945.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Reich Minister of the Interior, 30 January 1933-20 August 1943\r\n(_2381-PS_; _3086-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_e_) Prussian Minister of the Interior, 1 May 1934-20 August 1943\r\n(_3132-PS_; _3086-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_f_) Reich Director of Elections, 30 January 1933-20 August 1943\r\n(_3123-PS_; _3086-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_g_) General Plenipotentiary for the Administration of the Reich, 21\r\nMay 1935-20 August 1943 (_2978-PS_; _3086-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_h_) Head of the Central Office for the Reunification of Austria and\r\nthe German Reich (_2307-PS_; _1060-PS_; _3123-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_i_) Director of the Central Office for the Incorporation of\r\nSudetenland, Memel, Danzig, the Eastern Incorporated Territories, Eupen,\r\nMalmedy, and Moresnot (_3076-PS_; _3077-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_j_) Director of the Central Office for the Protectorate of Bohemia,\r\nMoravia, the Government General, Lower Styria, Upper Carinthia, Norway,\r\nAlsace, Lorraine, and all other occupied territories (_2119-PS_;\r\n_3123-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_k_) Reich Protector for Bohemia and Moravia, 20 August 1943-1945\r\n(_3086-PS_).\r\n\r\n(2) Between 1917 and 1945, Wilhelm Frick held the additional following\r\npositions:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Chief of the Criminal (later the Political) Division of the Munich\r\nPolice Department, 1917-1923 (_2381-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Fraktionsfuehrer_ (Floorleader) of the NSDAP in the  Reichstag,\r\n1927-1945 (_2381-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) Minister of the Interior and of Education of the Free State of\r\nThuringia, 23 January 1930-1 April 1931 (_2381-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_d_) Member of the Reich Defense Council, 21 May 1935-20 August 1943\r\n(_2978-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_e_) Member of the Ministerial Council for the Defense of the Reich, 30\r\nAugust 1939-20 August 1943 (_2018-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_f_) Reich Minister without Portfolio, 20 August 1943-1945 (_3086-PS_).\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n    LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO WILHELM FRICK\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 60\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

JULIUS STREICHER\r\n\r\nThrough his words and his deeds Julius Streicher assumed for himself the\r\nunofficial title of “Jew-baiter Number One” of Nazi Germany. For the\r\ncourse of some twenty-five years, Streicher educated the German people\r\nin hatred and incited them to the persecution and to the extermination\r\nof the Jewish race. He was an accessory to murder, on a scale perhaps\r\nnever attained before.\r\n\r\n                 A. _STREICHER’S CAREER AND POSITIONS._\r\n\r\nStreicher was born in 1885. He became a school teacher in Nurnberg and\r\nformed a party of his own, which he called the German Socialist Party.\r\nThe chief policy of that party was anti-semitism. In 1922 he handed over\r\nhis party to Hitler, who wrote a glowing account of Streicher’s\r\ngenerosity in _Mein Kampf_ (_M-3_).\r\n\r\nThe appointments which Streicher held in the Party and state were few.\r\nFrom 1921 until 1945, he was a member of the Nazi Party. In 1925 he was\r\nappointed Gauleiter of Franconia, and he remained as such until about\r\nFebruary 1940. From the time that the Nazi government came into power in\r\n1933 until 1945 he was a member of the Reichstag. In addition to that,\r\nhe held the title of Obergruppenfuehrer in the SA (_2975-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe propaganda which Streicher carried out throughout those years was\r\nchiefly done through the medium of his newspapers. He was the editor and\r\npublisher of “_Der Stuermer_” from 1922 until 1933, and thereafter the\r\npublisher and owner of the paper. In 1933 he also founded and thereafter\r\npublished a daily newspaper called the “_Fraenkische Tageszeitung_.”\r\n\r\nIn addition, in later years he published several other papers, mostly\r\nlocal journals, from Nurnberg.\r\n\r\n B. _STREICHER’S PART IN THE REMOVAL OF OPPOSITION THROUGH ANTI-JEWISH\r\n                      PROPAGANDA AND INCITEMENT._\r\n\r\nThe course of Streicher’s incitement and propaganda may be traced more\r\nor less in chronological order by referring to short extracts from “_Der\r\nStuermer_.” The extracts which follow were selected at random. They were\r\nselected with a view to showing the various methods which Streicher\r\nemployed to incite the German people against the Jewish race, but his\r\nnewspapers are crowded with them, week after week, day after day. It is\r\nimpossible to pick up any copy without finding the same kind of\r\ninvective and incitement in the headlines and in the articles.\r\n\r\nIn a speech which Streicher made in 1922 in Nurnberg, after abusing the\r\nJews in the first paragraph, he went on to say:\r\n\r\n    “We know that Germany will be free when the Jew has been\r\n    excluded from the life of the German people.” (_M-11_).\r\n\r\nIn a speech in 1924 he stated:\r\n\r\n    “I beg you and particularly those of you who carry the cross\r\n    throughout the land to become somewhat more serious when I speak\r\n    of the enemy of the German people, namely, the Jew. Not out of\r\n    irresponsibility or for fun do I fight against the Jewish enemy,\r\n    but because I bear within me the knowledge that the whole\r\n    misfortune was brought to Germany by the Jews alone.\r\n\r\n    “I ask you once more, what is at stake today? The Jew seeks\r\n    domination not only among the German people but among all\r\n    peoples. The communists pave the way for him. Do you not know\r\n    that the God of the Old Testament orders the Jews to consume and\r\n    enslave the peoples of the earth?\r\n\r\n    “The government allows the Jew to do as he pleases. The people\r\n    expect action to be taken. You may think about Adolf Hitler as\r\n    you please, but one thing you must admit. He possessed the\r\n    courage to attempt to free the German people from the Jew by a\r\n    national revolution. That was action indeed.” (_M-12_).\r\n\r\nIn a speech in April 1925 Streicher declared:\r\n\r\n    “You must realize that the Jew wants our people to perish. That\r\n    is why you must join us and leave those who have brought you\r\n    nothing but war, inflation, and discord. For thousands of years\r\n    the Jew has been destroying the nations. Let us make a new\r\n    beginning today so that we can annihilate the Jews.” (_M-13_).\r\n\r\nThis appears to be the earliest expression of one of the conspirators’\r\nprimary objectives—the annihilation of the Jewish race. Fourteen years\r\nlater it became the official policy of the Nazi Government.\r\n\r\nIn April 1932 Streicher made the following statement:\r\n\r\n    “For 13 years I have fought against Jewry.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “We know that the Jew whether he is baptized as a Protestant or\r\n    as a Catholic, remains a Jew. Why cannot you realize, you\r\n    Protestant clergymen, you Catholic priests, you who have scales\r\n    before your eyes and serve the god of the Jews who is not the\r\n    God of Love but the God of Hate. Why do you not listen to\r\n    Christ, who said to the Jews, ‘You are children of the devil’.”\r\n    (_M-14_).\r\n\r\n(1) _The Anti-Jewish Boycott of 1933._\r\n\r\nWhen the Nazi Party came to power, they officially started their\r\ncampaign against the Jews by the boycott of 1 April 1933. The boycott\r\nwas agreed on and approved by the whole government, as appears from\r\nGoebbels’ diary (_2409-PS_).\r\n\r\nStreicher was appointed the chairman of the central committee for the\r\norganization of that boycott. He started his work on Wednesday, 29 March\r\n(_2156-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn that same day the central committee issued a proclamation announcing\r\nthat the boycott would start on Saturday at 10:00 AM sharp:\r\n\r\n    “Jewry will realize whom it has challenged.” (_M-7_).\r\n\r\nOn 30 March, two days before the boycott was due to start, an article\r\nwas published under the title, “Defeat the Enemy of the World!—by\r\nJulius Streicher, official leader of the central committee to combat the\r\nJewish atrocity and boycott campaign” (_2153-PS_). The article stated,\r\nin part:\r\n\r\n    “Jewry wanted this battle. It shall have it until it realizes\r\n    that the Germany of the brown battalions is not a country of\r\n    cowardice and surrender. Jewry will have to fight until we have\r\n    won victory.\r\n\r\n    “National Socialists! Defeat the enemy of the world. Even if the\r\n    world is full of devils, we shall succeed in the end.”\r\n    (_2153-PS_).\r\n\r\nAs head of the central committee for that boycott, Streicher outlined in\r\ndetail the organization of the boycott in orders which the committee\r\npublished on 31 March 1933 (_2154-PS_). The committee stressed that no\r\nviolence should be employed against the Jews during the boycott, but not\r\nfor humanitarian reasons. The order was issued because, if no violence\r\nwere employed, Jewish employers would have no grounds for discharging\r\ntheir employees without notice, and for refusing to pay them any wages.\r\nThe Jews were also reported, apparently, to be transferring businesses\r\nto German figureheads in order to alleviate the results of this\r\npersecution; accordingly the committee declared that any property so\r\ntransferred was to be considered as Jewish for the purpose of the\r\nboycott (_2154-PS_).\r\n\r\nIt is therefore clear that early in 1933 Streicher was taking a leading\r\npart, as appointed by the Government, in the persecution against the\r\nJews.\r\n\r\nFurther extracts from Streicher’s newspapers illustrate the form which\r\nhis propaganda developed as the years went on. An article in the New\r\nYear’s issue of a new paper founded and edited by Streicher—a\r\nsemimedical paper called “The People’s Health Through Blood and\r\nSoil”—is an example of the remarkable lengths to which he went in\r\npropagandizing against the Jews:\r\n\r\n    “It is established for all eternity; alien albumen is the sperm\r\n    of a man of alien race. The male sperm in cohabitation is\r\n    partially or completely absorbed by the female, and thus enters\r\n    her bloodstream. One single cohabitation of a Jew with an Aryan\r\n    woman is sufficient to poison her blood forever. Together with\r\n    the alien albumen she has absorbed the alien soul. Never again\r\n    will she be able to bear purely Aryan children, even when\r\n    married to an Aryan. They will all be bastards, with a dual soul\r\n    and a body of a mixed breed. Their children will also be\r\n    crossbreeds; that means, ugly people of unsteady character and\r\n    with a tendency to illnesses. Now we know why the Jew uses every\r\n    artifice of seduction in order to ravish German girls at as\r\n    early an age as possible; why the Jewish doctor rapes his\r\n    patients while they were under anaesthetic. He wants the German\r\n    girl and the German woman to absorb the alien sperm of the Jew.\r\n    She is never again to bear German children. But the blood\r\n    products of all animals right down to the bacteria like the\r\n    serum, lymph, extracts from internal organs etc., are all alien\r\n    albumen. They have a poisonous effect if directly introduced\r\n    into the blood stream either by vaccination or by injection. By\r\n    these products of sick animals the blood is ravished, the Aryan\r\n    is impregnated with an alien species. The author and abettor of\r\n    such action is the Jew. He has been aware of the secrets of the\r\n    race question for centuries, and therefore plans systematically\r\n    the annihilation of the nations which are superior to him.\r\n    Science and authorities are his instruments for the enforcing of\r\n    pseudo-science and the concealment of truth.” (_M-20_).\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1935, the following extract, entitled “The Chosen\r\nPeople of the Criminals,” appeared in “_Der Stuermer_”:\r\n\r\n    “* * * and all the same, or, let us say, just because of this,\r\n    the history book of the Jews, which is usually called the Holy\r\n    Scriptures, impresses us as a horrible criminal romance, which\r\n    makes the 150 penny-dreadfuls of the British Jew, Edgar Wallace,\r\n    go green with envy. This ‘holy’ book abounds in murder, incest,\r\n    fraud, theft, and indecency.” (_2697-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn a speech on 4 October 1935 (the month following the proclamation of\r\nthe Nurnberg Decrees) Streicher made a speech which is reported in the\r\n_Voelkischer Beobachter_ and is entitled in that newspaper “Safeguard of\r\nGerman Blood and German Honor.” The report in that article reads in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n    “Gauleiter Streicher speaks at a German Labor Front mass\r\n    demonstration for the Nurnberg laws.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “We have therefore, to unmask the Jew, and that is what I have\r\n    been doing for the past fifteen years.” (_M-34_).\r\n\r\nIn a leading article in “_Der Stuermer_” Streicher again emphasized the\r\npart which he himself had taken in this campaign:\r\n\r\n    “_The ‘Stuermer_’s’ 15 years of work of enlightenment has\r\n    already led an army of those who know—millions strong—to\r\n    National Socialism. The continued work of the ‘_Stuermer_’ will\r\n    help to ensure that every German down to the last man will, with\r\n    heart and hand, join the ranks of those whose aim it is to crush\r\n    the head of the serpent Pan-Juda beneath their heels. He who\r\n    helps to bring this about helps to eliminate the devil, and this\r\n    devil is the Jew.” (_M-6_).\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary length to which Streicher went in his propaganda is\r\nillustrated by the publication in “_Der Stuermer_” of a photograph of\r\nthe burning hull of the airship “Hindenburg,” which caught fire in June\r\n1937 in America. The caption beneath the picture includes the comment:\r\n\r\n    “The first radio picture from the United States of America shows\r\n    quite clearly that a Jew stands behind the explosion of our\r\n    airship Hindenburg. Nature has depicted clearly and quite\r\n    correctly that devil in human guise.”\r\n\r\nAlthough it is not clear from that photograph, the meaning of that\r\ncomment is apparently that the cloud of smoke in the air is in the shape\r\nof a Jewish face.\r\n\r\nIn a speech in September 1937 at the opening of the Wilhelm Gustloff\r\nbridge in Nurnberg, Streicher declared:\r\n\r\n    “The man who murdered Wilhelm Gustloff had to come from the\r\n    Jewish people, because the Jewish text books teach that every\r\n    Jew has the right to kill a non-Jew, and, indeed, that it is\r\n    pleasing to the Jewish God to kill as many non-Jews as possible.\r\n\r\n    “Look at the way the Jewish people have been following for\r\n    thousands of years past; everywhere murder, everywhere mass\r\n    murder. Neither must we forget that behind present-day wars\r\n    there stands the Jewish financier who pursues his aims and\r\n    interests. The Jew always lives on the blood of other nations;\r\n    he needs such murder and such victims. For us who know, the\r\n    murder of Wilhelm Gustloff is the same as ritual murder.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It is our duty to tell the children at school and the bigger\r\n    ones what this memorial means.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Jew no longer shows himself among us openly as he used to.\r\n    But it would be wrong to say that victory is ours. Full and\r\n    final victory will have been achieved only when the whole world\r\n    has been rid of Jews.” (_M-4_).\r\n\r\nExtracts from the correspondence columns of “_Der Stuermer_,” show\r\nanother method which Streicher employed in his propaganda (_M-26_;\r\n_M-27_; _M-28_). The correspondence columns of every issue are full of\r\npurported “letters” from Germans protesting that some German has been\r\nbuying shoes from a Jewish shop, etc., thus by printing these letters\r\nassisting in the general boycott of the Jews.\r\n\r\n(2) _“Ritual Murder” Propaganda._\r\n\r\nAnother form of propaganda employed by Streicher concerned the “Ritual\r\nMurder.” Sometime in 1934 “_Der Stuermer_” began publishing accounts of\r\nJewish ritual murder which horrified the whole world to such an extent\r\nthat even the Archbishop of Canterbury, together with people from every\r\ncountry in the world, protested that any government should allow such\r\nmatter to be published in their national newspapers.\r\n\r\nStreicher based his ritual murder propaganda on a medieval belief that\r\nduring their Eastertide celebrations the Jews were in the habit of\r\nmurdering Christian children. Streicher misrepresented this medieval\r\nbelief to make it appear that not only was this done in the Middle Ages,\r\nbut that the Jews are still doing it and still want to do it. A few\r\npassages from “_Der Stuermer_” together with descriptions of photographs\r\npublished therein will illustrate the type of propaganda that Streicher\r\nwas putting out concerning “ritual murder”:\r\n\r\n    “This the French front-line soldier should take with him to\r\n    France: The German people have taken a new lease of life. They\r\n    want peace, but if anyone tries to attack them, if anyone tries\r\n    to torture them again, if anyone tries to push them back into\r\n    the past, then the world would see another heroic epic; then\r\n    heaven will decide where righteousness lies—here, or where the\r\n    Jew has the whiphand and where he instigates massacres, one\r\n    could almost say the biggest ritual murders of all times. If the\r\n    German people are to be slaughtered according to the Jewish\r\n    rites, the whole world will be thus slaughtered at the same\r\n    time.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “As you have drummed morning and evening prayers into your\r\n    children’s heads, so now drum this into their heads, so that the\r\n    German people may gain the spiritual power to convince the rest\r\n    of the world which the Jews desire to lead against us.” (_M-2_).\r\n\r\nA photograph published in “_Der Stuermer_” in April 1937 purports to\r\nshow three Jews ritually murdering a girl by cutting her throat, with\r\nthe blood pouring out into a bucket on the ground. The caption\r\nunderneath that photograph is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Ritual murder at Polna. Ritual murder of Agnes Hruza by the\r\n    Jews Hilsner, Erdmann[_sic_], and Wassermann, taken from a\r\n    contemporary postcard.”\r\n\r\nAnother article in “_Der Stuermer_”, in April 1937, describes what is\r\nalleged to happen when ritual murder takes place, and the blood is mixed\r\nwith the bread and drunk by the Jews in their feast. During the feast\r\nthe head of the family is supposed to explain:\r\n\r\n    “May all gentiles perish—as the child whose blood is contained\r\n    in the bread and wine.” (_2699-PS_).\r\n\r\nAn article in “_Der Stuermer_” for July 1938 has these further remarks\r\nto make on “ritual murder”:\r\n\r\n    “Whoever had the occasion to be an eye-witness during the\r\n    slaughtering of animals or to see at least a truthful film on\r\n    the slaughtering will never forget this horrible experience. It\r\n    is atrocious. And unwillingly, he is reminded of the crimes\r\n    which the Jews have committed for centuries on men. He will be\r\n    reminded of the ritual murder. History points out hundreds of\r\n    cases in which non-Jewish children were tortured to death. They\r\n    also were given the same incision through the throat as is found\r\n    on slaughtered animals. They also were slowly bled to death\r\n    while fully conscious.” (_2700-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn special occasions, or when Streicher had some particular subject\r\nmatter to put before Germany, he was in the habit of issuing special\r\neditions of “_Der Stuermer_.” “Ritual murder” was such a special subject\r\nthat he issued one of these special editions dealing solely with it, in\r\nMay 1939. One of the photographs published in this issue shows a child\r\nhaving knives stuck into its side, from which blood is spurting; and\r\nbelow the pedestal on which the child stands are five presumably dead\r\nchildren bleeding on the ground. The caption beneath that picture reads\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “In the year 1476 the Jews in Regensburg murdered six boys. They\r\n    drew their blood and tortured them to death in an underground\r\n    vault which belongs to the Jew Josfel. The judges found the body\r\n    of the murdered boys; and blood stains are on an altar.”\r\n\r\nTwo other pictures are explained by their captions. One reads:\r\n\r\n    “For the Jewish New Year celebrations in 1913, World Jewry\r\n    published this picture. On the Jewish New Year and on the Day of\r\n    Atonement the Jews slaughtered a so-called ‘kapores’ cock; that\r\n    is to say, dead cock, whose blood and death is intended to\r\n    purify the Jews. In 1913 the ‘kapores’ cock had the head of the\r\n    Russian Czar Nicholas II. By publishing this postcard the Jews\r\n    intended to say that Nicholas II would be their next purifying\r\n    sacrifice. On the 6th of July 1918, the Czar was murdered by the\r\n    Jews Jurowsky and Goloschtschekin.”\r\n\r\nThe other picture shows the Jews holding a similar bird:\r\n\r\n    “* * * the ‘kapores’ cock which has the head of the Fuehrer. The\r\n    Hebrew script says that one day Jews will kill all Hitlerites.\r\n    Then the Jews will be delivered from all misfortunes, but in due\r\n    course the Jews will realize that they have reckoned without an\r\n    Adolf Hitler.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to reproductions of a number of previous articles on “ritual\r\nmurder” beneath a picture of Streicher, another picture bears the\r\ncaption:\r\n\r\n    “At the Passover Meal. The wine and Matzoh, unleavened bread,\r\n    contains non-Jewish blood. The Jew prays before the meal. He\r\n    prays for death to all non-Jews.”\r\n\r\nThe fifth page of this same issue reproduces some of the European and\r\nAmerican newspaper articles and letters protesting against this\r\npropaganda on “ritual murder.” Among these is the “_Stuermer_’s” answer\r\nto the letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury, written to the editor\r\nof the London _Times_ in protest (_M-10_).\r\n\r\nPage 6 contains another picture of a man having his throat cut; again\r\nthe usual spurt of blood falling into a basin on the floor, with the\r\nfollowing caption:\r\n\r\n    “The ritual murder of the boy Heinrich. In the year 1345 the\r\n    Jews in Munich slaughtered a non-Jewish boy. The martyr was\r\n    declared holy by the church.”\r\n\r\nOn page 8 appears another picture entitled:\r\n\r\n    “The Holy Gabriel. This boy was crucified and tortured to death\r\n    by the Jews in the year 1690. The blood was drawn off him.”\r\n\r\nPage 11 reproduces a piece of sculpture on the wall of the Wallfahrts\r\nChapel, representing the ritual murder of a boy named Werner. The\r\npicture shows the boy strung up by his feet and being murdered by two\r\nJews. Page 12 reproduces another picture taken from the same place. The\r\ncaption is:\r\n\r\n    “The embalmed body of Trient who was tortured to death by the\r\n    Jews.”\r\n\r\nPage 13 contains another picture; somebody else having a knife stuck\r\ninto him; more blood coming out into a basin. On page 14 are two\r\npictures. One is said to show the ritual murder of the boy Andreas. The\r\nother is the picture of a tombstone, and the caption reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The tombstone of Hilsner. This is the memorial to a Jewish\r\n    ritual murderer, Leopold Hilsner. He was found guilty of two\r\n    ritual murders and was condemned to death by hanging in two\r\n    trials. The emperor was bribed and pardoned him. Masaryk, the\r\n    friend of the Jews, liberated him from penal servitude in 1918.\r\n    On his tombstone lying Jewry calls this twofold murderer an\r\n    innocent victim.”\r\n\r\nThe next page produces yet another picture of a woman being murdered by\r\nhaving her throat cut in the same way. Page 17 produces a picture of the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury together with a picture of an old Jewish man,\r\nwith a caption reading:\r\n\r\n    “Dr. Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest dignitary\r\n    of the English Church, and his allies, a typical example of the\r\n    Jewish Race.”\r\n\r\nThe last page contains a picture of “Holy Simon, who was tortured to\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nThis issue of “_Der Stuermer_” is nothing but an incitement to the\r\npeople of Germany who read it, an incitement to murder. It is filled\r\nwith pictures of murder, murder alleged to be against the German people.\r\nIt is an encouragement, to all who read it to avenge themselves in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nIn January 1938 the persecution of the Jews became more and more\r\nsevere—another special issue of “_Der Stuermer_” was published. A\r\npassage from the leading article in that issue written by Streicher,\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The supreme aim and highest task of the state is\r\n    therefore to conserve people, blood, and race. But if this is\r\n    the supreme task, any crime against this law must be punished\r\n    with the supreme penalty. ‘_Der Stuermer_’ takes therefore the\r\n    view that there are only two punishments for the crime of\r\n    polluting the race:\r\n\r\n    “1. Penal servitude for life for attempted race pollution.\r\n\r\n    “2. Death for committing race pollution.” (_M-39_).\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the headlines on the articles contained in\r\nthat edition:\r\n\r\n    “Jewish race polluters at work.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Fifteen year old non-Jewess ravaged.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “A dangerous race polluter. He regards German women as fair game\r\n    for himself.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Jewish sanatorium. A Jewish institution for the cultivation\r\n    of race pollution.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Rape of a feeble-minded girl.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Jewish butler. He steals from his Jewish masters and\r\n    commits race pollution.” (_M-40_).\r\n\r\nAnother article appearing in “_Der Stuermer_,” written by Streicher’s\r\neditor, Karl Holz, states:\r\n\r\n    “The revenge will break loose one day and will exterminate Jewry\r\n    from the surface of the earth.” (_M-35_).\r\n\r\nAgain, in September 1938, “_Der Stuermer_” published an article\r\ndescribing the Jews as follows:\r\n\r\n    “A parasite, an enemy, an evil-doer, a disseminator of diseases\r\n    who must be destroyed in the interest of mankind.” (_M-36_).\r\n\r\nThis is no longer propaganda for the persecution of the Jews; this is\r\npropaganda for the extermination of Jews, and for the murder not of one\r\nJew but of all Jews (see _2698-PS_).\r\n\r\nA picture published in “_Der Stuermer_” in December 1938 shows a girl\r\nbeing strangled by a man whose hands are around her neck. The shadow of\r\nthe man’s face, which is shown against the background, has quite obvious\r\nJewish features. The caption under that picture is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Castration for Race Polluters. Only heavy penalties will\r\n    preserve our womenfolk from a tighter grip from ghastly Jewish\r\n    claws. The Jews are our misfortune.”\r\n\r\n(3) _The Anti-Jewish demonstrations of November 1938._\r\n\r\nWhile his anti-Jewish propaganda was becoming constantly fiercer,\r\nStreicher took a leading part in the organized demonstrations against\r\nthe Jews which took place on 9 and 10 November 1938. In the autumn of\r\nthat year, on the occasion of a meeting of press representatives in\r\nNurnberg, Streicher organized the breaking-up of the Nurnberg\r\nsynagogues. It was announced that Streicher personally would set the\r\ncrane in motion with which the Jewish symbols would be torn down from\r\nthe synagogues (_1724-PS_). The event was described as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * the synagogue is being demolished! Julius Streicher\r\n    himself inaugurates the work by a speech lasting more than an\r\n    hour and a half. By his order—so to speak as a prelude of the\r\n    demolition—the tremendous Star of David came off the cupola.”\r\n    (_2711-PS_).\r\n\r\nStreicher took active part in the November demonstrations of that year,\r\nparticularly in his _Gau_ of Franconia. The Nurnberg demonstrations were\r\nreported as follows in the “_Fraenkische Tageszeitung_,” which was\r\nStreicher’s paper, on 11 November:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In Nurnberg and Furth it resulted in demonstrations by\r\n    the crowd against the Jewish murders. These lasted until the\r\n    early hours of the morning. Far too long had one watched the\r\n    activities of the Jews in Germany.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “After midnight the excitement of the populace reached its peak\r\n    and a large crowd marched to the synagogues in Nurnberg and\r\n    Furth and burned these two Jewish buildings, where the murder of\r\n    Germans had been preached.\r\n\r\n    “The fire-brigades, which had been notified immediately, saw to\r\n    it that the fire was continued[_sic_] to the original outbreak.\r\n    The windows of the Jewish shopkeepers, who still had not given\r\n    up hope of selling their junk to the stupid Goims, were smashed.\r\n    Thanks to the disciplined behavior of the SA men and the police,\r\n    who had rushed to the scene, there was no plundering.” (_M-42_).\r\n\r\nOn 10 November, the day of the demonstrations, Streicher made a speech\r\nstating in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “From the cradle, the Jew is not being taught, like we are, such\r\n    texts as, ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,’ or ‘If you\r\n    are smitten on the left cheek, offer then your right one.’ No,\r\n    he is told: ‘With the non-Jew you can do whatever you like.’ He\r\n    is even taught that the slaughtering of a non-Jew is an act\r\n    pleasing to God. For 20 years we have been writing about this in\r\n    ‘_Der Stuermer_’; for 20 years we have been preaching it\r\n    throughout the world and we have made millions recognize the\r\n    truth.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Jew slaughtered in one night 75,000 people; when he\r\n    emigrated to Egypt he killed all the first-born, i.e. a whole\r\n    future generation of Egyptians. What would have happened if the\r\n    Jew had succeeded in driving the nations into war against us,\r\n    and if we had lost the war? The Jew protected by foreign\r\n    bayonets, would have fallen on us and would have slaughtered and\r\n    murdered us. Never forget what history has taught us.” (_M-41_)\r\n\r\nAfter the November 1938 demonstrations, irregularities occurred in the\r\nGau of Franconia in connection with the organized Aryanization of Jewish\r\nproperty. Aryanization of Jewish property was regulated by the Nazi\r\nState, which had decreed that the proceeds of the transfer of Jewish\r\nproperties to Aryans were to go to the State. In Streicher’s _Gau_ of\r\nFranconia, however, a good deal of the proceeds never found their way as\r\nfar as the State. As a result Goering set up a commission to investigate\r\nwhat had taken place. The report of that commission (_1757-PS_)\r\ndescribes what had been taking place in Streicher’s _Gau_:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Following upon the November demonstrations the Deputy\r\n    Gauleiter, Holz, took up the Jewish questions. His reasons can\r\n    be given here in detail on the basis of his statement of the\r\n    25th of March, 1939:\r\n\r\n    “The 9th and 10th of November 1938.\r\n\r\n    “In the night of the 9th and 10th November and on the 10th of\r\n    November 1938, events took place throughout Germany which I\r\n    [Holz] considered to be the signal for a completely different\r\n    treatment of the Jewish question in Germany. Synagogues and\r\n    Jewish schools were burnt down and Jewish property was smashed\r\n    both in shops and in private houses. Besides this, a large\r\n    number of particular Jews were taken to concentration camps by\r\n    the police. Toward midday we discussed these events in the\r\n    Gauleiter’s house. All of us were of the opinion that we now\r\n    faced a completely new state of affairs on the Jewish question.\r\n    By the great action against the Jews, carried out in the night\r\n    and morning of the 10th of November, all guiding principles and\r\n    all laws on the subject had been made illusory. We were of the\r\n    opinion (particularly myself) that we should now act on our own\r\n    initiative in this respect. I proposed to the Gauleiter that in\r\n    view of the great existing lack of housing, the best thing would\r\n    be to put the Jews into a kind of internment camp. Then the\r\n    houses would become free in a twinkling, and the housing\r\n    shortage would be relieved, at least in part. Besides that, we\r\n    would have the Jews under control and supervision. I added ‘The\r\n    same thing happened to our prisoners of war and war internees.’\r\n    The Gauleiter said that this suggestion was for the time being\r\n    impossible to carry out. Thereupon I made a new proposal to him.\r\n    I said that I considered it unthinkable that, after the Jews had\r\n    had their property smashed, they should continue to be able to\r\n    own houses and land. I proposed that these houses and this land\r\n    ought to be taken away from them, and declared myself ready to\r\n    carry through such an action. I declared that by the\r\n    Aryanization of Jewish land and houses a large sum could accrue\r\n    to the Gau out of the proceeds. I named some million of marks. I\r\n    stated that, in my opinion, this Aryanization could be carried\r\n    out as legally as the Aryanization of shops. The Gauleiter’s\r\n    answer was something to this effect: ‘If you think you can carry\r\n    this out, do so. The sum gained will then be used to build a Gau\r\n    school.’”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Aryanization was accomplished by the alienation of\r\n    properties, the surrender of claims, especially mortgage claims,\r\n    and reductions in buying price.\r\n\r\n    “The payment allowed the Jews was basically 10% of the nominal\r\n    value or nominal sum of the claim. As a justification for these\r\n    low prices, Holz claimed at the Berlin meeting of the 6th of\r\n    February 1939, that the Jews had mostly bought their property\r\n    during the inflation period for a tenth of its value. As has\r\n    been shown by investigating a large number of individual cases\r\n    selected at random, this claim is not true.” (_1757-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe second part of this report, which contains the findings of the\r\ncommission, reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Gauleiter Streicher likes to beat people with a riding\r\n    whip but only if he is in the company of several persons\r\n    assisting him. Usually the beatings are carried out with\r\n    sadistic brutality.\r\n\r\n    “The best known case is that of Steinruck, whom he beat bloodily\r\n    in the prison cell, together with Deputy Gauleiter Holz and SA\r\n    Brigadier General Koenig. After returning from this scene to the\r\n    _Deutscher Hof_ he said: ‘Now I am relieved. I needed that\r\n    again!’ Later he also stated several times that he needed\r\n    another Steinruck case in order to ‘relieve’ himself.\r\n\r\n    “In August 1938, he beat Editor Burker at the District House\r\n    together with District Office Leader Schoeller and his Adjutant\r\n    Koenig.\r\n\r\n    “On the 2nd of December 1938 he asked to have three youthful\r\n    criminals (15 to 17 years old) who had been arrested for robbery\r\n    brought to the room of the director of the Criminal Police\r\n    Office in Nurnberg-Furth. Streicher, who was accompanied by his\r\n    son, Lothar, had the youths brought in singly and question them\r\n    about their sex life and in particular, through clear and\r\n    detailed questioning, he laid stress on determining whether and\r\n    since when they masturbated. * * *\r\n\r\n    “* * * The last one of these three boys he beat with his riding\r\n    whip, with blows on the head and on the rest of the body.”\r\n    (_1757-PS_)\r\n\r\nA later passage shows the authority and power which Streicher held in\r\nhis Gau:\r\n\r\n    “According to reports of reliable witnesses Gauleiter Streicher\r\n    is in the habit of pointing out on the most varied occasions\r\n    that he alone gives orders in the district of Franconia. For\r\n    instance, at a meeting in the Colosseum in Nurnberg in 1935 he\r\n    said that nobody could remove him from office. In a meeting at\r\n    Herkules Hall, where he described how he had beaten Professor\r\n    Steinruck, he emphasized that he would not let himself be beaten\r\n    by anybody, not even by an Adolf Hitler.\r\n\r\n    “For, this also must be stated here, in Franconia the Gau acts\r\n    first and then orders the absolutely powerless authorities to\r\n    approve.” (_1757-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat report shows the kind of treatment and persecution which the Jews\r\nwere receiving in the Gau over which Streicher ruled. It further shows\r\nthe absolute authority with which Streicher acted in his district.\r\n\r\nAs a result either of that investigation or of some other matter,\r\nStreicher was relieved of his position as Gauleiter in February 1940,\r\nbut he did not cease from propaganda or from control of his newspaper.\r\nIn an article written in “_Der Stuermer_,” on 4 November 1943, Streicher\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n    “It is really the truth that the Jews, so to speak, have\r\n    disappeared from Europe and that the Jewish reservoir of the\r\n    East, from which the Jewish plague has for centuries beset the\r\n    peoples of Europe, has ceased to exist. However, the Fuehrer of\r\n    the German people at the beginning of the war prophesied what\r\n    has now come to pass.” (_1965-PS_).\r\n\r\nThat article, signed by Streicher, shows that he had knowledge of the\r\nJewish exterminations which were going on in the East. Streicher’s\r\narticle was written in November 1943. In April 1943 the Warsaw ghetto\r\nwas destroyed. Between April 1942 and April 1944 more than 1,700,000\r\nJews were killed in Auschwitz and Dachau. It seems clear from this\r\narticle that Streicher knew what was happening, perhaps not the details,\r\nbut the fact that Jews were being exterminated.\r\n\r\n(4) _Perversion of Youth._\r\n\r\nStreicher paid particular attention to the instruction and perversion of\r\nthe children and youth of Germany. He was not content with inciting the\r\nGerman population. He started to poison the minds of the children at\r\nschool at the earliest possible date. He continually emphasized the need\r\nfor teaching children anti-semitism. In a speech as early as June 1925\r\nStreicher said:\r\n\r\n    “I repeat, we demand the transformation of the school into a\r\n    national German institution of education. If we let German\r\n    children be taught by German teachers, then we shall have laid\r\n    the foundations for the national German school. This national\r\n    German school must teach racial doctrine.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “We demand, therefore, the introduction of racial doctrine into\r\n    the school.” (_M-30_)\r\n\r\nThe “_Fraenkische Tageszeitung_” of 19 March 1934 reports Streicher’s\r\naddress at a girls’ school at Preisslerstrasse:\r\n\r\n    “Then Julius Streicher spoke about his life and told them about\r\n    a girl who at one time went to his school and who fell for a Jew\r\n    and was finished for the rest of her life.” (_M-43_)\r\n\r\nEvery summer in Nurnberg a youth celebration was held. At this pagan\r\nrite the youth of Nurnberg were rallied, organized, and incited,\r\nencouraged by Streicher. Streicher’s speech to the Hitler Youth on the\r\n“Holy Mountain” near Nurnberg on 22 June 1935 contained the following\r\nstatements:\r\n\r\n    “Boys and girls, look back to a little more than 10 years ago. A\r\n    great war—the World War—had whirled over the peoples of the\r\n    earth and had left in the end a heap of ruins. Only one people\r\n    remained victorious in this dreadful war, a people of whom\r\n    Christ said its father is the devil. That people had ruined the\r\n    German nation in body and soul. Then Adolf Hitler, unknown to\r\n    anybody, arose from among the people and became the voice which\r\n    called to a holy war and battle. He cried to the people for\r\n    everybody to take courage again and to rise and get a helping\r\n    hand to take the devil from the German people, so that the human\r\n    race might be free again from these people that have wandered\r\n    about the world for centuries and millenia, marked with the sign\r\n    of Cain.\r\n\r\n    “Boys and girls, even if they say that the Jews were once the\r\n    chosen people, do not believe it, but believe us when we say\r\n    that the Jews are not a chosen people. Because it cannot be that\r\n    a chosen people should act among the peoples as the Jews do\r\n    today.” (_M-1_)\r\n\r\nA report of Streicher’s address to 2,000 children at Nurnberg at\r\nChristmas-time, 1936, states:\r\n\r\n    “‘Do you know who the Devil is,’ he asked his breathlessly\r\n    listening audience. ‘The Jew, the Jew,’ resounded from a\r\n    thousand children’s voices.” (_M-44_)\r\n\r\nStreicher was not content with writing and talking. He issued a book for\r\nteachers, written by one Fink and published from the “_Der Stuermer_”\r\noffices, called “The Jewish Question and School Instruction.” This book\r\nemphasizes the necessity of anti-semitic teaching in schools, and\r\nsuggests ways in which the subject can be introduced and handled. The\r\npreface, written by Streicher, reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The National Socialist state brought fundamental changes into\r\n    all spheres of life of the German people.\r\n\r\n    “It has also presented the German teacher with some new tasks.\r\n    The National Socialist state demands that its teachers instruct\r\n    German children in social questions. As far as the German people\r\n    is concerned the racial question is a Jewish question. Those who\r\n    want to teach the child all about the Jew must themselves have a\r\n    thorough knowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\n    “Those who take to heart all that has been written with such\r\n    feeling by Fritz Fink, who for many years has been greatly\r\n    concerned about the German people, will be grateful for the\r\n    creator of this outwardly insignificant publication.” (_M-46_).\r\n\r\n    The preface is signed by Julius Streicher, City of the Reich\r\n    Party Rallies, Nurnberg, in the year 1937.\r\n\r\nThe introduction to this book reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Racial and Jewish questions are the fundamental problems of the\r\n    National Socialist ideology. The solution of these problems will\r\n    secure the existence of National Socialism and with this the\r\n    existence of our nation for all time. The enormous significance\r\n    of the racial question is recognized almost without exception\r\n    today by all the German people. In order to attain this\r\n    recognition our people had to travel through a long road of\r\n    suffering.\r\n\r\n    “No one should be allowed to grow up in the midst of our people\r\n    without this knowledge of the monstrous character and\r\n    dangerousness of the Jew.” (_M-46_).\r\n\r\nA later passage in the book contains this statement:\r\n\r\n    “One who has reached this stage of understanding will inevitably\r\n    remain an enemy of the Jews all his life and will instill this\r\n    hatred into his own children.” (_M-46_).\r\n\r\n“_Der Stuermer_” also published some children’s books. Although\r\nStreicher himself did not write the books, they were published from his\r\npublishing business, and they are on the same line of everything else\r\npublished and issued from that business. Among these books was one\r\nentitled “Don’t trust the Fox in the green meadow nor the Jew on his\r\noath.” It is a picture book for children. The pictures all depict Jews\r\nin an offensive light. And opposite each picture there is a little\r\nstory. For instance, opposite one picture, which portrays an\r\nunpleasant-looking Jewish butcher cutting up meat, there appears the\r\nfollowing comment:\r\n\r\n    “The Jewish butcher: he sells half refuse instead of meat. A\r\n    piece of meat lies on the floor; the cat claws another. This\r\n    doesn’t worry the Jew butcher since the meat increases in\r\n    weight. Besides one mustn’t forget he won’t have to eat it\r\n    himself.” (_M-32_).\r\n\r\nThe story opposite another picture reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Jesus Christ says ‘The Jew is a murderer through and through’.\r\n    And when Christ had to die the Lord didn’t know any other people\r\n    who would have tortured Him to death so he chose the Jews. That\r\n    is why the Jews pride themselves on being the chosen people.”\r\n    (_M-32_).\r\n\r\nOther pictures in this book portray: a girl being led away by an\r\nevil-appearing Jew; Streicher smiling benignly at a children’s party,\r\ngreeting the little children; children looking at copies of “_Der\r\nStuermer_” posted on a wall; Jewish children being taken away from an\r\nAryan school by an unpleasant-looking father, with all the Aryan\r\nchildren shouting and dancing and enjoying the fun very much (_M-32_).\r\n\r\nAnother book, called “The Poisonous Fungus,” is very similar in\r\ncharacter and appearance, and likewise calculated to poison the minds of\r\nreaders. One of the pictures in this book shows a girl sitting in a\r\nJewish doctor’s waiting room. The story that goes with this picture is\r\nnot a very pleasant story, but it is only by adverting to these matters\r\nthat it becomes possible to believe the kind of education which German\r\nchildren received from Streicher. The story reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Inge sits in the reception room of the Jew doctor. She has to\r\n    wait a long time. She looks through the journals which are on\r\n    the table. But she is much too nervous to read even a few\r\n    sentences. Again and again she remembers the talk with her\r\n    mother. And again and again her mind reflects on the warnings of\r\n    her leader of the League of German Girls: ‘A German must not\r\n    consult a Jew doctor. And particularly not a German girl. Many a\r\n    girl that went to a Jew doctor to be cured, found disease and\r\n    disgrace!’\r\n\r\n    “When Inge had entered the waiting room, she experienced an\r\n    extraordinary incident. From the doctor’s consulting room she\r\n    could hear the sound of crying. She heard the voice of a young\r\n    girl: ‘Doctor, doctor, leave me alone!’\r\n\r\n    “Then she heard the scornful laughing of a man. And then, all of\r\n    a sudden, it became absolutely silent. Inge had listened\r\n    breathlessly.\r\n\r\n    “‘What may be the meaning of all this?’ she asked herself and\r\n    her heart was pounding. And again she thought of the warning of\r\n    her leader in the League of German Girls.\r\n\r\n    “Inge was already waiting for an hour. Again she takes the\r\n    journals in an endeavor to read. Then the door opens. Inge looks\r\n    up. The Jew appears. She screams. In terror she drops the paper.\r\n    Horrified she jumps up. Her eyes stare into the face of the\r\n    Jewish doctor. And this face is the face of the devil. In the\r\n    middle of this devil’s face is a huge crooked nose. Behind the\r\n    spectacles two criminal eyes. And the thick lips are grinning, a\r\n    grinning that expresses: ‘Now I got you at last, you little\r\n    German girl!’\r\n\r\n    “And then the Jew approaches her. His fleshy fingers stretch out\r\n    after her. But now Inge has composed herself. Before the Jew can\r\n    grab hold of her, she smacks the fat face of the Jew doctor with\r\n    her hand. One jump to the door. Breathlessly Inge runs down the\r\n    stairs. Breathlessly she escapes the Jew house.” (_1778-PS_).\r\n\r\nAnother photograph shows youthful admirers standing around looking at\r\nStreicher’s picture, with the following commentary:\r\n\r\n    “‘Without a solution of the Jewish question there will be no\r\n    salvation for mankind.’ That is what he shouted to us. All of us\r\n    could understand him. And when, at the end, he shouted ‘_Sieg\r\n    Heil_’ for the Fuehrer, we all acclaimed him with tremendous\r\n    enthusiasm. For two hours Streicher spoke at that occasion. To\r\n    us it appeared to have been but a few minutes.” (_1778-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe effect of all this propaganda is evident from the columns of “_Der\r\nStuermer_” itself. In April 1936 there was published a letter, which is\r\ntypical of many others that appear in other copies from children of all\r\nages. The third paragraph of this letter, signed by the boys and girls\r\nof the National Socialist Youth Hostel at Grossmuellen, reads:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Today we saw a play on how the devil persuades the Jew to\r\n    shoot a conscientious National Socialist. In the course of the\r\n    play the Jew did it too. We all heard the shot. We would have\r\n    all liked to jump up and arrest the Jew. But then the policeman\r\n    came and after a short struggle took the Jew along. You can\r\n    imagine, dear _Stuermer_, that we heartily cheered the\r\n    policeman. In the whole play not one name was mentioned, but we\r\n    all knew that this play represented the murder by the Jew\r\n    Frankfurter. We were very sick when we went to bed that night.\r\n    None felt like talking to the others. This play made it clear to\r\n    us how the Jew sets to work.” (_M-25_).\r\n\r\nC. _STREICHER’S USE OF HIS AUTHORITY AS GAULEITER IN THE SERVICE OF THE\r\n                              CONSPIRACY._\r\n\r\nStreicher’s authority as a Gauleiter was extensive. The Organization\r\nBook of the NSDAP for 1938 describes the duties and authority of\r\nGauleiters as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Gauleiter bears over-all responsibility for the Fuehrer for\r\n    the sector of sovereignty entrusted to him. The rights, duties\r\n    and jurisdiction of the Gauleiter result primarily from the\r\n    mission assigned by the Fuehrer and, apart from that, from\r\n    detailed direction.” (_1814-PS_).\r\n\r\nStreicher’s association with the Fuehrer and other Nazi conspirators may\r\nalso be seen from the newspapers. On the occasion of Streicher’s 50th\r\nbirthday, Hitler paid a visit to Nurnberg to congratulate him. The\r\naccount of that meeting is published in the “_Voelkischer Beobachter_”\r\nof 13 February 1934 as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Adolf Hitler spoke to his old comrades in battle and to his\r\n    followers in words which went straight to their hearts. By way\r\n    of introduction he remarked that it was a special pleasure to be\r\n    present for a short while in Nurnberg, the town of the National\r\n    Socialist community which had been steeled in battle, at this\r\n    day of honor of Julius Streicher, and to be within the circle of\r\n    the standard bearers of the National Socialist idea during many\r\n    years.\r\n\r\n    “Just as they, all of them, had during the years of oppression\r\n    unshakeably believed in the victory of the movement, so his\r\n    friend and comrade in the battle, Streicher, had stood\r\n    faithfully at his side at all times. It had been this\r\n    unshakeable belief that had moved mountains.\r\n\r\n    “For Streicher it would surely be a solemn thought, that this\r\n    50th anniversary meant not only the halfway point of a century,\r\n    but also of a thousand years of German history to him. He had in\r\n    Streicher a companion of whom he could say that here in Nurnberg\r\n    was a man who would never waver for a single second and who\r\n    would unflinchingly stand behind him in every situation.”\r\n    (_M-8_).\r\n\r\nA letter from Himmler, published in “_Der Stuermer_” of April 1937,\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n    “If in future years the history of the reawakening of the German\r\n    people is written, and if already the next generation will be\r\n    unable to understand that the German people was once friendly to\r\n    the Jews, it will be stated that Julius Streicher and his weekly\r\n    paper ‘_Der Stuermer_’ have contributed a great deal towards the\r\n    enlightenment regarding the enemy of humanity.    “(Signed) For\r\n    the Reichsfuehrer SS, Himmler.” (_M-22_).\r\n\r\nFinally, a letter from von Schirach, the Reich Youth Leader, published\r\nin “_Der Stuermer_” of January 1938, had this to say:\r\n\r\n    “It is the historical merit of ‘_Der Stuermer_’ to have\r\n    enlightened the broad masses of our people in a popular way as\r\n    to the Jewish world danger. ‘_Der Stuermer_’ is right in\r\n    refusing to fulfill its task in the tone of the aesthetic\r\n    drawing room. Jewry has shown no regard for the German people.\r\n    We have, therefore, no cause to be considerate and to spare our\r\n    worst enemy. What we fail to do today our youngsters of tomorrow\r\n    will have to suffer for bitterly.” (_M-45_).\r\n\r\n                            D. _CONCLUSION._\r\n\r\nIt may be that Streicher is less directly involved in the physical\r\ncommission of the crimes against Jews than some of his coconspirators.\r\nThe submission of the Prosecution is that his crime is no less worse for\r\nthat reason. No government in the world, before the Nazis came to power,\r\ncould have embarked upon and put into effect a policy of mass Jewish\r\nextermination in the way in which they did, without having a people who\r\nwould back them and support them, and without having a large number of\r\npeople who were prepared to carry out the murder themselves. (See\r\nChapter XII on Persecution of the Jews.)\r\n\r\nIt was to the task of educating and poisoning the people with hate, and\r\nof producing murderers, that Streicher set himself. For 25 years he\r\ncontinued unrelentingly the perversion of the people and youth of\r\nGermany. He went on and on, as he saw the results of his work bearing\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nIn the early days he was preaching persecution. As persecution took\r\nplace he preached extermination and annihilation and, as millions of\r\nJews were exterminated and annihilated, in the Ghettos of the East, he\r\ncried out for more and more.\r\n\r\nThe crime of Streicher is that he made these crimes possible, which they\r\nwould never have been had it not been for him and for those like him.\r\nWithout Streicher and his propaganda, the Kaltenbrunners, the Himmlers,\r\nthe General Stroops would have had nobody to do their orders.\r\n\r\nIn its extent Streicher’s crime is probably greater and more\r\nfar-reaching than that of any of the other defendants. The misery which\r\nthey caused ceased with their capture. The effects of this man’s crime,\r\nof the poison that he has put into the minds of millions of young boys\r\nand girls goes on, for he concentrated upon the youth and childhood of\r\nGermany. He leaves behind him a legacy of almost a whole people poisoned\r\nwith hate, sadism, and murder, and perverted by him. That people remain\r\na problem and perhaps a menace to the rest of civilization for\r\ngenerations to come.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n  LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO JULIUS STREICHER\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 66\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

WALTER FUNK\r\n\r\n   A. _FUNK ACTIVELY PROMOTED THE CONSPIRATORS’ ACCESSION TO POWER._\r\n\r\nA recital of Funk’s positions and activities is set forth in a statement\r\nmade by him (_3533-PS_). Although Funk signed this statement, he\r\ninserted several reservations and denials with respect to certain\r\npositions and activities. Funk’s submissions in this connection, which\r\nare indicated in his statement (_3533-PS_) should be evaluated in the\r\nlight of the statements set forth in the collection of relevant excerpts\r\nfrom German publications (_3563-PS_).\r\n\r\nAn examination of these excerpts will reveal that the German\r\npublications directly contradict every contention which Funk has made\r\nwith respect to his holding the positions and carrying on the activities\r\nlisted in his statement (_3533-PS_). For example, in his comment\r\nconcerning item (_b_) of his statement Funk denies that he was Hitler’s\r\nPersonal Economic Adviser during the 1930’s. On the other hand, there\r\nare four German publications, each of which states unequivocally that\r\nFunk _was_ Hitler’s Personal Economic Adviser (_3563-PS_).\r\n\r\nAs is indicated by these documents, Funk, soon after he joined the Nazi\r\nParty in 1931, began to hold important positions in the Party and soon\r\nqualified as one of the Nazi inner circle. Thus, he promptly became not\r\nonly Hitler’s Personal Economic Adviser, but also Chief of the Economic\r\nDivision of the Central Nazi Party Directorate and Chairman of the\r\nParty’s Committee on Economic Policy (_3533-PS_). In these capacities,\r\nhe advanced the Party’s drive for mass support by drafting its economic\r\nslogans. In 1932, for example, he wrote a pamphlet entitled “Economic\r\nReconstruction Program of the NSDAP”, which, after its approval by\r\nHitler, became the Party’s official pronouncement on economic matters\r\n(_3505-PS_).\r\n\r\nFunk also served as the liaison man between the Nazi Party and the large\r\nindustrialists, from whom he obtained financial and political support on\r\nHitler’s behalf (_3505-PS_; _2828-PS_). Thus, for example, he was\r\npresent at the meeting of approximately 25 leading industrialists held\r\nin Berlin on 20 February 1933 (_2828-PS_). In the course of this\r\nmeeting, which was arranged by Goering and attended by Funk, among\r\nothers, and which was designed to obtain the industrialists’ financial\r\nand political support for the Nazi program, Hitler and Goering announced\r\nsome of the fundamental Nazi objectives: the destruction of the\r\nparliamentary system in Germany; the crushing of all internal opposition\r\nby force, the restoration of the power of the _Wehrmacht_. In addition,\r\nHitler indicated that force was to be used in solving problems with\r\nother nations (_D-203_). The financial and political support for the\r\nNazis which Funk secured from industry promoted the campaign of force\r\nand terror by which the Nazis seized and consolidated their control of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe importance of Funk’s general contribution to the conspirators’\r\naccession to power has been described in a book published by the Central\r\nPublishing House of the Nazi Party:\r\n\r\n    “No less important than Funk’s accomplishments in the\r\n    programmatic field in the years 1931 and 1932 was his activity\r\n    of that time as the Fuehrer’s liaison man to the leading men of\r\n    the German economy in industry, trade, commerce and finance. On\r\n    the basis of his past work, his personal relations to the German\r\n    economic leaders were broad and extensive. He was now able to\r\n    enlist them in the service of Adolf Hitler, and not only to\r\n    answer their questions authoritatively, but to convince them and\r\n    win their backing for the Party. At that time, that was terribly\r\n    important work. Every success achieved meant a moral, political,\r\n    and economic strengthening of the fighting force of the Party\r\n    and contributed toward destroying the prejudice that National\r\n    Socialism is merely a party of class hatred and class struggle.”\r\n    (_3505-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter he had helped Hitler become Chancellor, Funk, as Reich Press\r\nChief, participated in the early cabinet meetings, in the course of\r\nwhich the conspirators determined upon the means by which they would\r\nsecure the passage of the Enabling Act and destroy parliamentary\r\ngovernment in Germany (_2962-PS_; _2963-PS_). This law destroyed civil\r\nliberties in Germany and marked the conspirators’ seizure of political\r\ncontrol over Germany.\r\n\r\n  B. _FUNK, BY VIRTUE OF HIS ACTIVITIES IN THE MINISTRY OF PROPAGANDA,\r\nACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE CONSPIRATORS’ CONTROL\r\n                             OVER GERMANY._\r\n\r\nThe Nazis created a vast propaganda machine which they used to proclaim\r\nthe doctrine of the master race, to inveigh against the Jews, to impose\r\nthe leadership principle upon the German people, to glorify war as a\r\nnoble activity, to create the social cohesion necessary for war, and to\r\nweaken the capacity and willingness of their intended victims to resist\r\naggression. (See Section 9 of Chapter VII on Propaganda, Censorship and\r\nSupervision of Cultural Activities.)\r\n\r\nThe operation of this propaganda machine was principally the\r\nresponsibility of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.\r\nFunk played a significant role in the operations of that Ministry and in\r\nrelated agencies of the Nazi State. On 30 January 1933, the day on which\r\nHitler became Reich Chancellor, Funk was appointed Press Chief of the\r\nReich Government. In that capacity, and even after the establishment of\r\nthe Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, he reported\r\nregularly to Hitler and President von Hindenburg (_3505-PS_; _3501-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn 13 March 1933, the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and\r\nPropaganda was established with Goebbels as its Chief and Funk as its\r\nunder-Secretary (_2029-PS_; _Voelkischer Beobachter_ 15 March 1933, p.\r\n2. (South German Edition)). In an interview with a reporter from the\r\n_Voelkischer Beobachter_ on 30 March 1933, Funk made clear the\r\nimportance which propaganda was to have in the Nazi State. He stated:\r\n\r\n    “Propaganda is the most modern instrument of power and fighting\r\n    weapon of state policy. The establishing of the Propaganda\r\n    Ministry is vital, for the national political policy of the new\r\n    State Leadership is to be the general good of the whole people.\r\n    Therefore, the total political, artistic, cultural and spiritual\r\n    life of the nation, must be brought on to one level and directed\r\n    from one central point.” (Voelkischer Beobachter, South German\r\n    Edition, 31 March 1933).\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this purpose, the Ministry of Enlightenment and\r\nPropaganda was organized so as to reach and control every medium of\r\nexpression within Germany. In the language of the decree defining the\r\nduties of the Minister of Propaganda, he was to have\r\n\r\n    “* * * jurisdiction over the whole field of spiritual\r\n    indoctrination of the nation, of propagandizing the State, of\r\n    cultural and economic propaganda, of enlightenment of the public\r\n    at home and abroad; furthermore, he is in charge of all\r\n    institutions serving these purposes.” (_2030-PS_).\r\n\r\nUnder this decree, the Ministry controlled propaganda abroad, propaganda\r\nwithin Germany, the press, music, the theater, films, art, literature,\r\nradio and all related institutions.\r\n\r\nFunk discharged important responsibilities in the Ministry. As\r\nUndersecretary, he was Goebbels’ chief aide. In this capacity he appears\r\nto have been the primary organizer of the machine from which flowed Nazi\r\npropaganda. This is made clear by the following excerpt from an\r\naffidavit dated 19 December 1945, and signed by Max Amann, who held the\r\nposition of Reich Leader of the Press and President of the Reich Press\r\nChamber.\r\n\r\n    “* * * In carrying out my duties and responsibilities, I became\r\n    familiar with the operations and the organization of the Reich\r\n    Ministry of Propaganda and Enlightenment.\r\n\r\n    “Walther Funk was the practical Minister of the Ministry of\r\n    Propaganda and Enlightenment and managed the Ministry. Funk was\r\n    the soul of the Ministry, and without him Goebbels could not\r\n    have built it up. Goebbels once stated to me that Funk was his\r\n    ‘most effective man.’ Funk exercised comprehensive control over\r\n    all the media of expression in Germany: over the press, the\r\n    theater, radio and music. As Press Chief of the Reich Government\r\n    and subsequently as Under Secretary of the Ministry, Funk held\r\n    daily meetings with the Fuehrer and a daily press conference in\r\n    the course of which he issued the directives governing the\r\n    materials to be published by the German press”. (_3501-PS_).\r\n\r\nA note for the files prepared by one Sigismund, an SS Scharfuehrer, also\r\nstresses the important role which Funk played in The Ministry of\r\nPropaganda (_3566-PS_). That note records a discussion between Sigismund\r\nand one Weinbrenner, an official of the Ministry of Propaganda, about\r\nthe selection of a General Manager for the German Radio. The note\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “Weinbrenner made the following statement: * * * it is almost\r\n    impossible to determine whom the Minister would name General\r\n    Manager, since Dr. Goebbels reaches most of the important\r\n    decisions only by agreement with Under Secretary Funk.”\r\n    (_3566-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn addition to his position as Undersecretary, Funk had many other\r\nimportant responsibilities in subordinate offices of the Ministry for\r\nPropaganda (_3533-PS_). In 1933, for example, he was appointed Vice\r\nPresident of the Reich Chamber of Culture, whose President was Goebbels\r\n(_3533-PS_; _Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1933, I, p. 798).\r\n\r\nFunk’s position as Vice President of the Reich Chamber of Culture was\r\nrelated to his position as Undersecretary of the Ministry, since the\r\nChamber of Culture and the seven subordinate chambers were by law\r\nsubject to the control of the Ministry of Propaganda (_2082-PS_). This\r\ncontrol was insured in practice by placing officers of the Ministry of\r\nPropaganda in the highest positions of the Chambers. Thus, for example,\r\nGoebbels was its President and Funk its Vice President. By virtue of his\r\ndual position, Funk directly promoted two fundamental and related Nazi\r\npolicies: (1) the regimentation of all creative activities in the\r\ninterest of Nazi political and military objectives; (2) the elimination\r\nof Jews and dissidents from the so-called cultural professions.\r\n\r\nThe mechanics by which these policies were carried out have been\r\ndescribed in Section 9 of Chapter VII on Propaganda, Censorship and\r\nSupervision of Cultural Activities. That description will be\r\nsupplemented here only by reference to the second decree for the\r\nExecution of the Law of Reich Chamber of Culture, dated 9 November 1933\r\n(_2872-PS_). This decree, which was signed by Funk, representing\r\nGoebbels, fixed the effective date for the entire scheme for the\r\ndomination and purging of the cultural professions.\r\n\r\nThe control of the Ministry of Propaganda was based in part on the\r\nrequirement that persons engaged in so-called “cultural activities”\r\nbelong to the appropriate Chamber (_1933 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 797).\r\nDecrees were then passed which prescribed standards of admission to\r\nthese Chambers, which automatically excluded Jews. For example, in the\r\nfield of journalism, “only persons who were of Aryan descent and not\r\nmarried to a person of non-Aryan descent” were permitted to be so-called\r\n_Schriftleiter_, that is, to perform any work relating to the contents\r\nof a newspaper or a political magazine (_2083-PS_).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, newspaper publishers had to submit proof tracing their Aryan\r\ndescent (and that of their spouses) as far back as the year 1800 (Decree\r\n24 April 1935, issued by the President of the Reich Press Chamber,\r\nArticle 1, 3 and Article II, 1(f) and 2, reprinted in Karl Friedrich\r\nSchrieber in “_Das Recht der Reichskulturkammer_”, vol. 2, 1935, pp.\r\n109-112; Decrees 15 April and 22 May 1936 issued by the President of\r\nReich Press Chamber reprinted in Karl Friedrich Schrieber “_Das Recht\r\nder Reichskulturkammer_”, vol. 4, 1936, pp. 101-102, 120-122; see also:\r\nDecree 17 September 1934 reprinted in Karl Friedrich Schrieber’s “_Das\r\nRecht der Reichskulturkammer_”, vol. 2, 1935, p. 79).\r\n\r\nIn view of Funk’s official positions and the policies which he advanced,\r\nit is natural that Nazi writers have stressed his contribution to the\r\nperversion of German culture. Thus Oestreich’s biography of Funk states:\r\n\r\n    “Besides, Funk had a special duty from his Ministry received the\r\n    task to take care of the cultural life. In this position he\r\n    organized quietly a tremendous concern which represented an\r\n    investment of many hundreds of millions. In close co-operation\r\n    with the Reich Leader of the Press, Max Amann, the economic\r\n    fundamentals of the German press were reconstructed according to\r\n    the political necessities. The same took place in the film\r\n    industry and in other cultural fields.” (_3505-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of “the economic fundamentals of the German press * *\r\n* and other cultural fields” was a biographer’s euphemism for the\r\nelimination of Jews and dissidents from the field of literature, music,\r\ntheater, journalism, broadcasting, and the arts.\r\n\r\nThe completeness with which the policy of cultural extermination was\r\ncarried out is made clear by a pamphlet entitled “The Reich Ministry for\r\nPublic Enlightenment and Propaganda”, by Georg Wilhelm Mueller, an\r\nofficial of the Ministry of Propaganda, which was published by the\r\nGerman Academy for Politics as part of a series on the organization of\r\nthe Nazi Government. That pamphlet states:\r\n\r\n    “The Department Special Cultural Tasks (a department within the\r\n    Ministry of Propaganda) serves mainly the purpose to remove the\r\n    Jews from cultural professions. It reviews the political\r\n    attitude of all artistic or cultural workers and cultural\r\n    economic enterprises that are members of the seven individual\r\n    chambers of the Reich Chamber of Culture (except the Reich\r\n    Chamber of the Press), it has to supervise the removal of Jews\r\n    in the entire field of the seven individual chambers and settles\r\n    as highest authority all complaints and appeals of cultural\r\n    workers whose membership was rejected by the Chamber because of\r\n    lack of proof of Aryan descent. At the same time, it is the task\r\n    of this department to supervise the activities of non-Aryans in\r\n    the intellectual and entire cultural field, therefore, also the\r\n    supervision of the only Jewish organization in the cultural\r\n    field in the entire Reich territory, that is, the ‘Jewish\r\n    _Kulturbund_’ (Jewish Cultural Association).\r\n\r\n    “In this way this department also cooperates with all other\r\n    professional departments of the Ministry or the Chambers by\r\n    consulting the local officials of the party, the State police\r\n    offices, etc., and when supervising the Jewish ‘cultural work’\r\n    with the political police.\r\n\r\n    “It is mainly the merit of this department—to 1937 a department\r\n    in the Managing Office of the Reich Chamber of Culture—that the\r\n    purge of the entire German cultural life from Jewish or other\r\n    non-German influences was completely accomplished according to\r\n    the assignments of the Minister.” (_Das Reichsministerium fuer\r\n    Volksaufklaerung und Propaganda_ (Reich Ministry of Public\r\n    Enlightenment and Propaganda) pp. 30-31).\r\n\r\nFunk contributed to the achievement of the Nazi propaganda program in\r\nother capacities. Thus, in 1933, Goebbels appointed him Chairman of the\r\nBoard of Directors of the Reich Broadcasting Company (_3505-PS_). That\r\ncompany was the coordinating authority for all German radio broadcasting\r\nand supervised all German radio stations, with a view to insuring that\r\nradio serve the political purposes of the Nazi State (_Das Deutsche\r\nFuehrerlexikon_, 1934-1935, p. 139; _3505-PS_). Moreover, in 1933, Funk\r\nwas also appointed Vice-president of the _Filmkreditbank_. The\r\n_Filmkreditbank_ was a government-controlled financing corporation which\r\ninfluenced film production in the interests of the Nazi program by\r\ngranting financial assistance in connection with only those films deemed\r\ndesirable from the Nazi point of view (Seager, “_Der Film im\r\nNationalsocialistischen Staat_” (“The Film in the National-Socialist\r\nState”), in Frank: “_Nationalsozialistisches Handbuch fuer Recht und\r\nGesetzgebung_” (“National Socialist Handbook for Law and Legislation”),\r\n1935, 2nd edition, p. 512). It is clear from the foregoing that Funk was\r\nfrom 1933 until the end of 1937 a versatile and key figure in the\r\npropaganda field. His activities ranged from daily conferences with the\r\nFuehrer and the organization of a new large Ministry vital to the Nazi\r\nprogram, to depriving the most humble Jewish artist of his power to earn\r\na livelihood. Funk appears to have been what Goebbels said he was:\r\nGoebbels’ “most effective man” (_3501-PS_).\r\n\r\nC. _FUNK, AS MINISTER OF ECONOMICS, CONTINUED TO ADVANCE THE CONSPIRACY\r\n  TO PERSECUTE THE JEWS BY ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN THE PLANNING AND\r\n  EXECUTION OF THE MEASURES WHICH ELIMINATED THE JEWS FROM THE GERMAN\r\n                               ECONOMY._\r\n\r\nThe systematic anti-Jewish program of the Nazi conspirators is discussed\r\nin Chapter XII. The evidence discussed below shows that Funk, by virtue\r\nof his activities as Minister of Economics, is responsible for the\r\nplanning and execution of the program to exclude the Jews from the\r\nGerman economy.\r\n\r\nThe first record of Funk’s anti-Jewish activities as Minister of\r\nEconomics consists of a series of decrees which he signed and which were\r\ndesigned to exclude the Jews from various occupations, such as real\r\nestate business, auctioneering, etc. Reference will be made to only a\r\nfew of these decrees (Decree amending trade code of 6 July 1938, (_1938\r\nReichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 832); decree concerning occupation of\r\nauctioneers, 12 February 1938, _1938 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 202.\r\nMoreover, on 14 June 1938, Funk signed a decree providing for the\r\nregistration of “Jewish enterprises” (_1938 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p.\r\n627)). This decree was part of a system of economic persecution which\r\nobliterated Jewish ownership in all commercial, financial and industrial\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, the death of von Rath in Paris was exploited by the Nazis as a\r\npretext for intensifying the persecution of the Jews. Their new\r\nanti-Jewish policy called for the complete elimination of Jews from the\r\neconomic life of Germany. Funk took a significant part in both the\r\nformulation and execution of this policy.\r\n\r\nThus, he was present at the meeting of 12 November 1938, where, with\r\nGoering as the leading spirit, the basis for a more drastic policy\r\nagainst the Jews was established (_1816-PS_). Goering described the\r\nmeeting as a decisive one, and demanded “that the Jewish question be\r\nnow, once and for all, coordinated and solved, one way or another.”\r\n(_1816-PS_). Funk came to the meeting with a draft law which he had\r\nprepared, and which he submitted with the following explanation:\r\n\r\n    “I have prepared a law elaborating that, effective 1 January\r\n    1939, Jews shall be prohibited to operate retail stores and\r\n    wholesale establishments, as well as independent artisan shops.\r\n    They shall further be prohibited from keeping employees or\r\n    offering any ready products on the market. Wherever a Jewish\r\n    shop is operated, the police shall shut it down. From 1 January\r\n    1939, a Jew can no longer be employed as an enterpriser, as\r\n    stipulated in the law for the Organization of National Labor\r\n    from 20 January 1934. If a Jew holds a leading position in an\r\n    establishment without being the enterpriser, his contract may be\r\n    declared void within 6 weeks by the enterpriser. With the\r\n    expiration of the contract, all claims of the employee,\r\n    including all claims to maintenance become obliterated. That is\r\n    always very disagreeable and a great danger. A Jew cannot be a\r\n    member of a corporation; Jewish members of corporations shall\r\n    have to be retired by 31 December 1938. A special authorization\r\n    is unnecessary. The competent Ministers of the Reich are being\r\n    authorized to issue the provision necessary for the execution of\r\n    this law.” (_1816-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe substance of Funk’s draft law promptly found its way into the\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_. On 12 November 1938, Goering signed a decree\r\nentitled “For the Elimination of Jews from the German Economic Life”\r\n(_1662-PS_).\r\n\r\nAn examination of the provisions of the decree will reveal how well it\r\ndeserved its title. Thus, Jews were forbidden to operate retail stores\r\nor mail order houses, or to engage independently in any handicraft, to\r\noffer goods or services at markets, or to take orders therefor (Section\r\nI): or to be “leaders” of any industrial enterprise. That decree also\r\nprovided that any Jew in an executive position of an industrial\r\nenterprise was subject to notice of dismissal (Section 2), and that Jews\r\nshould be excluded from membership in cooperative organizations (Section\r\n3). Funk was expressly authorized in Section 4 of the decree to issue\r\nthe regulations necessary for implementing its provisions (_1662-PS_).\r\n\r\nFunk was also authorized to issue the regulations in connection with\r\nanother anti-Jewish decree, also issued on 12 November 1938. This decree\r\nprovided that all damage done to Jewish enterprises and apartments\r\nduring the riots of 8, 9, and 10 November, was to be repaired by the\r\nJewish owners out of their own pockets, and that claims by German Jews\r\nagainst insurance companies were to be confiscated in favor of the\r\nGerman Government (_1938 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 1581).\r\n\r\nSoon after the passage of the decree of 12 November, Funk, in a speech\r\nwhich he delivered on the Jewish question, made it clear that the\r\nprogram of economic persecution was a part of the larger program of\r\nextermination and boasted of the fact that the new program insured the\r\ncomplete elimination of the Jews from the German economy. In the course\r\nof this speech, Funk stated:\r\n\r\n    “The state and the economy constitute a unity. They must be\r\n    directed according to the same principles. The best proof\r\n    thereof has been rendered by the most recent development of the\r\n    Jewish problem in Germany. One cannot exclude the Jews from the\r\n    political life, but let them live and work in the economic\r\n    sphere. The fact that the last violent explosion of the disgust\r\n    of the German people, because of a criminal Jewish attack\r\n    against the German people, took place at a time when we were\r\n    standing just before the termination of the economic measures\r\n    for the elimination of the Jews from the German economy—this\r\n    fact is a result of the other fact that in the last years we had\r\n    not handled this problem sufficiently early and consistently. In\r\n    any event, the basis of a complete elimination of the Jews also\r\n    from the economy had already been laid by the decrees of the\r\n    Commissioner for the Four Year Plan, General Field Marshal\r\n    Goering, who was the first to undertake the solution of this\r\n    problem. In the meantime, by means of Aryanization, performed\r\n    under governmental supervision, the Jews had already been\r\n    excluded completely from the stock exchanges and the banks and\r\n    almost completely from the large businesses and all important\r\n    industrial enterprises. According to estimates, of the net\r\n    property of approximately 7 billion marks, determined pursuant\r\n    to the decree for the registration of Jewish property, 2 billion\r\n    marks have already been transferred into German possession.”\r\n    (_3545-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn 3 December 1938, Funk again advanced the policy of economic\r\nextermination by signing a decree which carried out the promise of the\r\nmore severe anti-Jewish policy implied in his above speech (_1409-PS_).\r\nThis decree imposed additional and drastic economic disabilities upon\r\nJews and subjected their property to confiscation and forced\r\nliquidation. It provided that: owners of Jewish enterprises could be\r\nordered to sell or liquidate their enterprises (Section 1); trustees\r\ncould be appointed for such enterprises, with the expenses of\r\ntrusteeship borne by the owner of the enterprise (Section 2); Jews could\r\nbe ordered to sell their property (real estate, etc.) (Section 6); Jews\r\nwere prohibited from acquiring any real estate (Section 7); governmental\r\nconsent was required for any disposition of real estate (Section 8);\r\nJews were forced to deposit all stocks, mining shares, bonds, and other\r\nsecurities with specially designated banks, and accounts had to be\r\nmarked “Jewish” (Section 11); Jews were forbidden to acquire, to give as\r\nsecurity, or to sell objects made of gold, platinum, or silver, precious\r\nstones, or pearls, etc. (Section 14); and Jews could be required to make\r\ncertain payments to the Reich before receiving the consent necessary for\r\nthe transfer of their property (Section 15). (_1409-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn addition, many other decrees aiming at the economic ruin of the Jews\r\nwere promulgated over the signature of the Minister of Economics. For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n    Decree, 23 November 1938, _1938 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 1642,\r\n    signed by Brinkmann acting for Funk and containing detailed\r\n    rules for the liquidation of Jewish retail stores, etc.;\r\n\r\n    Decree, 14 December 1938, _1938 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 1902,\r\n    also signed by Brinkmann acting for Funk, and providing detailed\r\n    rules for the elimination of Jews from industrial enterprises;\r\n\r\n    Decree, 8 May 1939, _1939 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 895, signed\r\n    by Dr. Landfried acting for Funk, excluding Jews from the\r\n    occupation of travel agents;\r\n\r\n    Decree, 4 May 1940, _1940 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 730, also\r\n    signed by Dr. Landfried acting for Funk, concerning registration\r\n    of transfers of Jewish property;\r\n\r\n    Decree, 14 November 1940, _1940 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 1520,\r\n    also signed by Dr. Landfried acting for Funk, establishing a\r\n    procedure for setting aside financial arrangements which Jews,\r\n    discharged from executive positions of industrial enterprises\r\n    prior to 12 November 1938, had made with their companies.\r\n\r\n    Extending certain of the above-described decrees to Austria,\r\n    see, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    Decree, 22 August 1942, _1942 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 537,\r\n    signed by von Hanneken, acting for Funk;\r\n\r\n    Decree, 4 December 1940, _1940 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 1564,\r\n    signed by Dr. Landfried acting for Funk.\r\n\r\nFunk had important responsibilities, not only in the formulation of\r\nanti-Jewish policy and in the drafting of anti-Jewish legislation, but\r\nalso in the administration of the conspirators’ anti-Jewish measures.\r\nFunk was the person to whom appeals were made concerning action taken by\r\nsubordinate officials in the administration of the anti-Jewish economic\r\nprogram. In fact, he was the paramount authority in this field; his\r\ndecisions were final and conclusive. For example, he had the final voice\r\nin the administrative hierarchy set up for deciding whether an\r\nenterprise was a Jewish enterprise within the meaning of the decree\r\nrequiring the registration of such enterprises (Decree of 14 June 1938,\r\nsection 9, _1938 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 628; see also decree of 3\r\nDecember 1938, section 19, _1938 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 1711; decree,\r\n14 November 1940, _1940 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 1520).\r\n\r\nNazi publications have recognized the significant contribution made by\r\nFunk to the anti-Jewish program. Thus Hans Quecke, an official of the\r\nGerman Ministry of Economics, in describing the work of the Ministry\r\nduring Funk’s incumbency, stated:\r\n\r\n    “A task of special political significance and economic\r\n    importance arose as an absolute necessity out of the National\r\n    Socialist conception of state and economy, namely, _the\r\n    eradication of Jewish influence from the economy_. In this\r\n    connection, a wealth of legislative and administrative work,\r\n    though temporary, was created for the Ministry. The steps of the\r\n    work were as follows: definitions of the term ‘Jewish\r\n    enterprise’, registration of Jewish property, securing the\r\n    ‘deployment’ of such property in accordance with the interests\r\n    of the German economy, exclusion of Jewish employees from\r\n    executive positions, and, finally, re-examination of steps taken\r\n    in the de-Judaization of enterprises with a view to ordering\r\n    payments to the Reich for the unjust profits secured in the\r\n    process of de-Judaization. That task can now be considered as\r\n    practically completed in the field of the industrial economy.”\r\n    (Building of the Third Reich (_Das Dritte Reich in Aufbau_) Vol.\r\n    5, pp. 318-319 (1941)).\r\n\r\nMoreover, Funk himself, in the course of administering this program,\r\nemphasized the importance of his new role. For example, on 6 February\r\n1939, he issued a circular in connection with the administration of the\r\ndecree of 3 December 1938 which, as indicated, he himself signed. In\r\nthat circular, which was published in the Ministerial Gazette of the\r\nReich and Prussian Ministry of the Interior (“_Ministerialblatt des\r\nReichs—und Preussischen Ministeriums des Innern_”), for 1939, No. 7, p.\r\n265, Funk stressed (at p. 265) “the great political and economic\r\nimportance” of the anti-Jewish program and stated with respect to the\r\nbroad powers conferred by the decree of 3 December 1938, that:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The extent and speed with which they [the powers] will be\r\n    utilized, is dependent upon _my_ orders, to be given under the\r\n    general direction of Goering.”\r\n\r\nIn the same circular (at p. 265) Funk also emphasized the importance of\r\nthe laws for de-Judaization, stating:\r\n\r\n    “The execution of the laws for the economic de-Judaization will,\r\n    for a time, impose extraordinary burdens upon the administrative\r\n    organization. However, it is expected that the officers charged\r\n    with the execution, in view of the great political and economic\r\n    importance of the tasks assigned to them, will bend all their\r\n    efforts to assure a most rapid, efficient, and in every way\r\n    faultless execution of the de-Judaization.”\r\n\r\nFunk, in an interrogation dated 22 October 1945, admitted and deplored\r\nhis responsibility for the economic persecution of the Jews:\r\n\r\n    “Q. All the decrees excluding the Jews from industry were yours,\r\n    were they not?\r\n\r\n    “A. * * * So far as my participation in this Jewish affair is\r\n    concerned, that was my responsibility and I have regretted it\r\n    later on that I ever did participate. The Party had always\r\n    brought pressure to bear on me previously to make me agree to\r\n    the confiscation of Jewish property, and I had refused\r\n    repeatedly. But later on, when the anti-Jewish measures and the\r\n    force used against the Jews came into force, something legal had\r\n    to be done to prevent the looting and confiscation of all Jewish\r\n    property.\r\n\r\n    “Q. You know that the looting and all that was done at the\r\n    instigation of the Party, don’t you?\r\n\r\n    “(_Here witness weeps_)\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes, most certainly. That is when I should have left in\r\n    1938, of that I am guilty, I am guilty. I admit that I am a\r\n    guilty party here.” (_3544-PS_)\r\n\r\n   D. _FUNK WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONSPIRATORS’ PLANS FOR AGGRESSION,\r\n ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN MOBILIZING THE GERMAN ECONOMY FOR AGGRESSIVE\r\n  WAR: HE ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THE WAGING OF AGGRESSIVE WARS AND WAS A\r\nMEMBER OF WAR PLANNING AGENCIES WHICH WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICIES AND\r\n                   ACTS CONTRARY TO THE LAWS OF WAR._\r\n\r\nFunk was vested with, and carried out, major responsibilities in\r\nconnection with the planning and execution of the Nazi program of\r\neconomic mobilization for aggression. Thus, in 1938 he succeeded Schacht\r\nas Minister of Economics (_3533-PS_).\r\n\r\nImmediately before Funk actually took over the Reich Ministry of\r\nEconomics there was a major reorganization of its functions, which\r\nintegrated the Ministry with the Four Year Plan as the Supreme Command\r\nof the German military economy. The reorganization was accomplished by\r\nGoering, in his capacity as Commissar for the Four Year Plan, by a\r\ndecree dated 4 February, 1938 (“The Four Year Plan” (_Der\r\nVierjahresplan_) official monthly bulletin, issued by Goering, Vol. II,\r\n1938, p. 105). Under this decree, the jurisdiction of the Economics\r\nMinistry was defined as covering the following fields of Germany’s\r\neconomy: German raw and working materials, mining, iron industry, power\r\nindustry, handicrafts, finance and credit, foreign trade, devisen, and\r\nexports. As a result of this decree, sectors of the German economy which\r\nwere strategic in the organization of war and armaments economy were\r\nplaced under the immediate control of Funk.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Reich Office for Economic Development, charged by the\r\ndecree, with “research, planning and execution of the Four Year Plan”,\r\nwas incorporated into the Reich Ministry of Economics. Similarly, the\r\nReich Office for Soil Research and the Office of the Reich Commissar for\r\nthe exploitation of Scrap Materials were made subject to that Ministry.\r\nThus, it is clear that the reorganization decree concentrated\r\nsignificant responsibilities in the hands of Funk and thereby made him\r\none of the chief agents of economic mobilization during a decisive\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Funk was, by a secret law, expressly charged with the task\r\nof mobilizing the German economy for war. On 4 September 1938, while the\r\nconspirators were engaged in intensive planning for aggression against\r\nCzechoslovakia, Hitler signed a revision of the so-called Reich Defense\r\nLaw (_2194-PS_). This law conferred upon Funk substantially the same\r\nauthority which had been vested in Schacht by the Reich Defense Law of\r\n21 May 1935 (_2261-PS_). The law of 4 September 1938 provided in part:\r\n\r\n    “It is the task of the GBW [Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics]\r\n    to put all economic forces into the service of the Reich\r\n    defense, and to safeguard economically the life of the German\r\n    nation. To him are subordinate: the Reich Minister of Economics,\r\n    the Reich Minister of Nutrition and Agriculture, the Reich\r\n    Minister of Work, the Reich Chief of Forestry, the Reich\r\n    Commissar for Price Control. He is furthermore responsible for\r\n    directing the financing of the Reich defense within the realm of\r\n    the Reich Finance Ministry and the Reich Bank.\r\n\r\n    “The GBW must carry out the demands of the OKW which are of\r\n    considerable importance for the armed forces; and he must insure\r\n    the economic conditions for the production of the armament\r\n    industry directed immediately by the OKW according to its\r\n    demands. If the demands of the armed forces cannot be brought\r\n    into accord with the affairs of economy, then the Fuehrer and\r\n    Reich Chancellor decides.\r\n\r\n    “The GBW has the right within his sphere to issue laws with the\r\n    consent of the OKW and GBV which differ from the existing laws.”\r\n    (_2194-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe law of 4 September 1938, which at the specific direction of Hitler\r\nwas not made public, was signed by Hitler and by Funk, among others, as\r\n“Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics” (_2194-PS_).\r\n\r\nFunk, in a speech which he delivered on 14 October 1939, explained how\r\nhe, as Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics, had, for a year and a half\r\nprior to the launching of the aggression against Poland, advanced\r\nGermany’s economic preparation for war. He stated:\r\n\r\n    “Although all the economic and financial departments were\r\n    harnessed in the tasks and work of the Four Year Plan under the\r\n    leadership of _Generalfeldmarschall_ Goering, the war economic\r\n    preparation of Germany has also been advanced in secret in\r\n    another sector for well over a year, namely, by means of the\r\n    formation of a national guiding apparatus for the special war\r\n    economic tasks, which had to be mastered at that moment, when\r\n    the condition of war became a fact. For this work as well all\r\n    economic departments were combined into one administrative\r\n    authority, namely under the General Plenipotentiary for Economy,\r\n    to which position the Fuehrer appointed me one and a half years\r\n    ago.” (_3324-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn his dual capacity of Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics and Minister\r\nof Economics, Funk naturally was advised of the requirements which the\r\nconspirators’ program of aggression imposed on the economy. Thus, during\r\na conference in the Reich Aviation Ministry on 14 October 1938 under the\r\nchairmanship of Goering, Goering referred to Hitler’s orders for an\r\nabnormal increase of armament, particularly weapons for attack, and\r\ndirected the Ministry of Economics to submit suggestions on how to\r\nfinance this rearmament by increasing exports. The report of Goering’s\r\nremarks states in part:\r\n\r\n    “General Field Marshal Goering opened the session by declaring\r\n    that he intended to give directives about the work for the next\r\n    months. Everybody knows from the press what the world situation\r\n    looks like and therefore the Fuehrer has issued an order to him\r\n    to carry out a gigantic program compared to which previous\r\n    achievements are insignificant. There are difficulties in the\r\n    way which he will overcome with utmost energy and ruthlessness.\r\n\r\n    “The amount of foreign exchange has completely dwindled on\r\n    account of the preparation for the Czech Enterprise and this\r\n    makes it necessary that it should be strongly increased\r\n    immediately. Furthermore, the foreign credits have been greatly\r\n    overdrawn and thus the strongest export activity—stronger than\r\n    up to now—is in the foreground. For the next weeks an increased\r\n    export was first priority in order to improve the foreign\r\n    exchange situation. The Reich Ministry for Economy should make a\r\n    plan about raising the export activity by pushing aside the\r\n    current difficulties which prevent export.\r\n\r\n    “These gains made through the export are to be used for\r\n    increased armament. The armament should not be curtailed by the\r\n    export activity. He received the order from the Fuehrer to\r\n    increase the armament to an abnormal extent, the air force\r\n    having first priority. Within the shortest time the air force is\r\n    to be increased five fold, also the navy should get armed more\r\n    rapidly and the army should procure large amounts of offensive\r\n    weapons at a faster rate, particularly heavy artillery pieces\r\n    and heavy tanks. Along with this manufactured armaments must go;\r\n    especially fuel, powder and explosives are moved into the\r\n    foreground. It should be coupled with the accelerated\r\n    construction of highways, canals, and particularly of the\r\n    railroads.” (_1301-PS_).\r\n\r\nGoering’s words were the words of one already at war. And the emphasis\r\non quintupling the Air Force and accelerating weapon manufacture for\r\nattack, were the words of a man waging aggressive war.\r\n\r\nFunk actively participated in the planning of wartime financial measures\r\n(_1301-PS_). This was natural since Funk, after 1938, occupied three\r\npositions crucial to finance: Minister of Economics, President of the\r\nReichsbank (to which he was appointed in January 1939), and Chief\r\nPlenipotentiary for Economics. Funk’s role in war financing is\r\nillustrated by a letter, dated 1 June 1939, from the Chief\r\nPlenipotentiary for Economics (Funk), signed on his behalf by Dr. Posse\r\n(_3562-PS_). This letter found in the captured files of the Reich\r\nMinistry of Economics, transmitted the minutes of a meeting concerning\r\nthe financing of the war. This meeting had been held under the\r\nchairmanship of Dr. Landfried, Funk’s Undersecretary in the Reich\r\nMinistry of Economics. The document bears a marginal note in the bottom\r\nleft hand corner, dated 5 June, stating that the document was “to be\r\nshown to the Minister” [i.e., Funk]. Only eight copies were made of the\r\nMinutes, which were marked “Top Secret”. Four of these copies were sent\r\nto officials directly subordinate to Funk (two in the Reich Ministry of\r\nEconomics, one in the Reichsbank, and one in the Office of the Chief\r\nPlenipotentiary for Economics). During the course of the meeting, which\r\nwas attended by twelve officials, five of whom were directly responsible\r\nto Funk in his various capacities, the conferees discussed a memorandum\r\nregarding war finance which had been prepared by the Chief\r\nPlenipotentiary for Economics on May 9, 1939. The minutes of this\r\nmeeting state:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Then a report was made of the contents of the ‘Notes on\r\n    the Question of Internal Financing of War’, of 9 May of this\r\n    year (appendix to GBW 8/2179/39 Top Secret), in which the\r\n    figures given to me by the Reichs Minister of Finance are also\r\n    discussed. It was pointed out that the General Plenipotentiary\r\n    for the Economy is primarily interested to introduce into the\r\n    legislation for war finance, the idea of financing war\r\n    expenditures by anticipating future revenues, to be expected\r\n    after the war. * * *\r\n\r\n    “Undersecretary Newman, first, submitted for discussion the\r\n    question whether the production would be able to meet to the\r\n    assumed extent, the demands of the Army, especially if the\r\n    demands of the Army, as stated in the above report, would\r\n    increase to approximately 14 billions in the first three months\r\n    of war. He stated that, if the production potential of the\r\n    present Reich territory is taken as a basis, he doubts the\r\n    possibility of such a production increase.” (_3562-PS_).\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the meeting one of the representatives of the High\r\nCommand stated:\r\n\r\n    “The demands of the Army would probably be higher in the first\r\n    three months of war than during the further course of the war.”\r\n    (_3562-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn the files of the Reich Ministry of Economics there was also found,\r\nattached to the above letter and minutes, a Top Secret memorandum\r\nentitled “Notes Concerning Financing of War.” That memorandum reveals\r\nthe plans to use the resources of countries to be occupied in the\r\ninterest of the Nazi war machine. It states:\r\n\r\n    “* * * First, as concerns the scope of the total production, it\r\n    is clear that the economic power of the Protectorate and of\r\n    other territories, possibly to be acquired, must of course be\r\n    completely exhausted for the purposes of the conduct of the war.\r\n    It is, however, just as clear that these territories cannot\r\n    obtain any compensation from the economy of Greater Germany for\r\n    the products which they will have to give us during the war,\r\n    because their power must be used fully for the war and for\r\n    supplying the civilian home population.” (_3562-PS_).\r\n\r\nIt is plain that Funk exercised comprehensive authority over large areas\r\nof the German economy whose proper organization and direction were\r\ncritical to effective war preparation. The once powerful German military\r\nmachine, which rested on the foundation of thorough economic\r\npreparation, reflected the contribution which Funk had made to Nazi\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nImmediately before this machine was directed against Poland, the final\r\npreparatory steps were taken, and the previous appointment of Funk as\r\nChief Plenipotentiary for Economics was made public. Thus on 27 August\r\n1939, Funk, in this capacity, issued two decrees, one introducing\r\ngeneral rationing of consumers’ goods, the other setting up regional\r\neconomic authorities (_1939 Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, pp. 1495 and 1498).\r\n\r\nFinally, on 30 August 1939, Hitler, Goering, and Lammers signed a decree\r\nestablishing the Ministerial Council for Reich Defense, composed of\r\nGoering, Funk, and Hess, among others, to act as a War Cabinet (_1939\r\nReichsgesetzblatt_, I, p. 1532).\r\n\r\nFunk mobilized the German economy for war with full knowledge of the\r\nplans for military aggression. An irresistible inference of such\r\nknowledge arises from the combination of several factors: from Funk’s\r\nlong and intimate association with the Nazi inner circle; from the very\r\nnature of his official functions; from the war-dominated setting of Nazi\r\nGermany; from the fact that force and the threat of force had become the\r\nopen and primary instruments of Nazi policy; and finally from the fact\r\nthat at the same time that Funk was making economic preparations,\r\nspecific plans for aggression—later to be carried out—were being\r\nformulated, plans which could only be effective if they were\r\nsynchronized with the complementary economic measures.\r\n\r\nThe inference of Funk’s knowledge and intent is reinforced beyond\r\nquestion by considering, in the light of the factors described above,\r\nthe more specific evidence of Funk’s knowledge of aggressive plans.\r\nThus, Funk, at the very beginnings of the Nazi Government, had stated\r\nthat the absorption of Austria by Germany was a political and economic\r\nnecessity, and that it would be achieved by whatever means were\r\nnecessary (_1760-PS_).\r\n\r\nGoering had issued instructions to the Ministry of Economics—in the\r\nlanguage of a man waging aggressive war (_1301-PS_). Moreover, Funk and\r\nhis subordinates in May 1939 were making detailed plans for financing\r\nthe war, that is, a particular war, the war against Poland (_3562-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn connection with Funk’s economic planning for aggression, reference\r\nshould be made to other evidence of the preparatory work which Funk\r\ncarried on prior to the aggression against Poland. Shortly before the\r\nattack on Poland, in a letter to Hitler dated 25 August 1939, Funk\r\nexpressed his gratification for his role in the “tremendous events” of\r\nthese days, and his thanks for Hitler’s approval of his economic war\r\nmeasures. He concluded by giving Hitler his pledge in that hour\r\n(_699-PS_). The text of the letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Reich Minister Walther Funk.\r\n\r\n                                      Berlin W. 8, August 25, 1939.\r\n                                             Unter Den Linden 13.\r\n\r\n    “My Fuehrer:\r\n\r\n    “For the congratulations which you transmitted to me on my\r\n    birthday, in such extremely friendly and kind fashion, I want to\r\n    thank you from the depths of my heart. How happy and how\r\n    grateful we must be to you to be favored to experience these\r\n    colossal and world-moving times, and that we can contribute to\r\n    the tremendous events of these days.\r\n\r\n    “General-Field-Marshal Goering informed me, that last night\r\n    you—my Fuehrer—have approved in principle the measures\r\n    prepared by me for financing the war, for setting up the wage\r\n    and price systems and for carrying out the plan for an emergency\r\n    contribution [_Notopfer_]. This news has made me deeply happy. I\r\n    hereby most obediently report to you that I have succeeded,\r\n    through the provisions made already during the last month, to\r\n    make the German Reichsbank internally so strong and so safe\r\n    against attack from without that even the most serious\r\n    disturbances of the international currency and credit systems\r\n    would be absolutely unable to affect us.\r\n\r\n    “In the meantime I have in a wholly inconspicuous manner\r\n    converted into gold all assets of the Reichsbank and of the\r\n    German economy abroad on which we could possibly lay hands. With\r\n    the proposals worked out by me regarding a ruthless choking of\r\n    any unessential consumption and any public expenditure and\r\n    project not necessary for war we will be able to meet all\r\n    financial and economic demands without any serious\r\n    reverberations.\r\n\r\n    “In my capacity as General Plenipotentiary for Economics,\r\n    appointed by you, my Fuehrer, I have regarded it as my duty to\r\n    give you this report and this pledge in this hour.\r\n\r\n                                               “Heil, my Fuehrer\r\n                             “(signed) Walther Funk”. (_699-PS_).\r\n\r\nFunk both personally and through duly designated representatives also\r\nparticipated in the planning which preceded the aggression against the\r\nUSSR. Thus, in April 1941, Rosenberg, after he had been appointed deputy\r\nfor centralized treatment of problems concerning the Eastern\r\nTerritories, discussed with Funk the economic problems which would be\r\nraised when the plans for aggression in the East were carried out\r\n(_1039-PS_). At that time Funk appointed Dr. Schlotterer as his deputy\r\nto work with Rosenberg in connection with the exploitation of the\r\nEastern Territories. Funk’s deputy met with Rosenberg almost daily.\r\n\r\n E. _FUNK WAS A MEMBER OF WAR-PLANNING AGENCIES WHICH WERE RESPONSIBLE\r\n          FOR POLICIES AND ACTS CONTRARY TO THE LAWS OF WAR._\r\n\r\nAfter the launching of the Nazi aggression against Poland, Funk, in his\r\ncapacities as Minister of Economics, President of the Reichsbank, and\r\nChief Plenipotentiary for Economics, and as a member of the Central\r\nPlanning Board (to which he was appointed in September 1943), actively\r\nparticipated in the waging of aggressive war on the economic front.\r\nMoreover, by virtue of his membership in the Central Planning Board,\r\nwhich formulated and directed the execution of the program for the\r\nenslavement, exploitation, and degradation of millions of foreign\r\nworkers, Funk shares special responsibility for the Nazi Slave Labor\r\nProgram. (See Chapter X on the Slave Labor Program. This special aspect\r\nof Funk’s responsibility was left for development by the French\r\nprosecuting staff.)\r\n\r\n                            F. _CONCLUSION._\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Funk was a central figure in the Nazi conspiracy and\r\nthat, as a member of the Nazi inner circle, he helped formulate, was\r\naware of, and promoted the realization of, the conspirators’ program. He\r\nknew, moreover, that this program envisaged the use of terror and force\r\nwithin and if necessary outside of Germany, and that it contemplated the\r\nuse of criminal means. Funk, by promoting the conspirators’ accession to\r\npower and the realization of their program, signified his approval of\r\nsuch crimes.\r\n\r\nThe evidence has also established that, after the Nazi seizure of power,\r\nFunk promoted the achievement of the conspirators’ program by virtue of\r\nhis activities in the Ministry of Propaganda, activities which fomented\r\nand carried out the persecution of Jews and dissidents; which\r\npsychologically mobilized the German people for aggressive war; and\r\nwhich reduced the willingness and capacity of the conspirators’ intended\r\nvictims to resist aggression. Funk also participated, as Minister of\r\nEconomics, in the formulation and execution of the policy for the\r\ncomplete elimination of the Jews from the German economy.\r\n\r\nAs Minister of Economics, President of the Reichsbank, and Chief\r\nPlenipotentiary for Economics, Funk mobilized the German economy for\r\naggressive war, with full knowledge of the conspirators’ plans for\r\naggression. Moreover, in these capacities, and as a member of the\r\nMinisterial Council for the Defense and the Central Planning Board, he\r\nalso actively participated in the waging of aggressive wars. Finally, by\r\nvirtue of his membership in the Central Planning Board, which formulated\r\nand directed the execution of the program for the enslavement,\r\nexploitation, and degradation of millions of foreign workers, he bears a\r\nspecial responsibility for the war crimes committed in the execution of\r\nthat program.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n     LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO WALTER FUNK\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 62\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

HJALMAR SCHACHT\r\n\r\nThe prosecution concedes, at the outset, that although Schacht believed\r\nthat the Jews of Germany should be stripped of their rights as citizens,\r\nhe was not in complete sympathy with that aspect of the Nazi Party’s\r\nprogram which involved the wholesale extermination of the Jews, and that\r\nhe was, for that reason, attacked from time to time by the more extreme\r\nelements of the Nazi Party. It further concedes that Schacht, on\r\noccasion, gave aid and comfort to individual Jews who sought to escape\r\nthe indignities generally inflicted upon Jews in Nazi Germany. Schacht’s\r\nattitude towards the Jews is exemplified by his speech at the German\r\nEastern Fair, Koenigsberg, on 18 August 1935, wherein he said:\r\n\r\n    “The Jew must realize that their influence is gone for all\r\n    times. We desire to keep our people and our culture pure and\r\n    distinctive, just as the Jews have always demanded this of\r\n    themselves since the time of the prophet Ezra. But the solution\r\n    of these problems must be brought about under state leadership,\r\n    and cannot be left to unregulated individual actions, which mean\r\n    a disturbing influence on the national\r\n\r\nThe foregoing concessions should render it unnecessary for Schacht to\r\nproduce evidence upon these matters.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution’s case against Schacht is that he planned and prepared\r\nfor wars of aggression and wars in violation of international treaties,\r\nagreements and assurances, and that he knowingly and wilfully\r\nparticipated in the Nazi common plan or conspiracy to plan, prepare,\r\ninitiate, and wage such wars. The evidence establishes that Schacht\r\nactively supported Hitler’s accession to power; that he was the chief\r\narchitect of the financial plans and devices which made possible the\r\nhuge program of rearmament in Germany; that he played a dominant role in\r\nthe economic planning of, and preparation for, wars of aggression; and\r\nthat he contributed his efforts willingly and with full knowledge of the\r\nfact that the leader of the conspiracy, Adolf Hitler, was determined\r\nupon attaining his objectives by launching aggressive wars.\r\n\r\n            A. _CHRONOLOGY OF SCHACHT’S OFFICIAL POSITIONS._\r\n\r\nThe chronology of Schacht’s official positions is as follows:\r\n\r\n    (1) Schacht was recalled by Hitler to the Presidency of the\r\n    Reichsbank on 17 March 1933 (_3021-PS_).\r\n\r\n    (2) Schacht was appointed acting Minister of Economics by Hitler\r\n    in August 1934 (_3021-PS_).\r\n\r\n    (3) By secret decree, Schacht was appointed General\r\n    Plenipotentiary for the War Economy in May 1935 (_2261-PS_).\r\n\r\n    (4) Schacht was awarded honorary membership in the Nazi Party\r\n    and the Golden Swastika on 30 January 1937, “the highest honor\r\n    the Third Reich has to offer” (_EC-500_).\r\n\r\n    (5) Schacht was re-appointed for one year as President of the\r\n    Reichsbank on 16 March 1937 (_3021-PS_).\r\n\r\n    (6) Schacht resigned as Minister of Economics and General\r\n    Plenipotentiary for the War Economy in November 1937 (_3021-PS_;\r\n    _EC-494_).\r\n\r\n    (7) Hitler appointed Schacht Minister Without Portfolio at the\r\n    same time (_3021-PS_).\r\n\r\n    (8) Schacht was re-appointed for a four year term as President\r\n    of the Reichsbank on 9 March 1938 (_3021-PS_).\r\n\r\n    (9) Schacht was dismissed as President of the Reichsbank on 20\r\n    January 1939. In connection therewith, Hitler expressed his deep\r\n    gratitude for Schacht’s past services and his gratification that\r\n    Schacht would remain to serve him as Minister Without Portfolio\r\n    (_EC-397_).\r\n\r\n    (10) Schacht remained as Minister Without Portfolio until\r\n    January 1943, when he was dismissed by Hitler. During the period\r\n    from the time of his dismissal as President of the Reichsbank\r\n    until the end of 1942, he continued to receive the full salary\r\n    he had been paid as the President of the Reichsbank, and\r\n    thereafter received a pension from the Reichsbank. As Minister\r\n    Without Portfolio, he received a large salary from the Nazi\r\n    Government and other emoluments of the office (_3724-PS_).\r\n\r\n B. _PRIOR TO 1933, SCHACHT ACCEPTED THE NAZI PROGRAM AND HELPED HITLER\r\n                               TO POWER._\r\n\r\nSchacht met Goering for the first time in December 1930, and Hitler\r\nearly in January 1931, at Goering’s house. He thought that Hitler was\r\n“full of will and spirit” and a man “with whom one could cooperate”.\r\nThereafter, he actively supported Hitler’s accession to power\r\n(_3725-PS_; _3729-PS_).\r\n\r\nSchacht’s belief in the Nazi program and his undivided loyalty to Hitler\r\nare revealed in his letter to Hitler dated 29 August 1932, wherein he\r\npledged continued support to Hitler after the latter’s poor showing in\r\nthe July 1932 elections and proferred advice concerning electioneering\r\ntactics. The letter includes the following statements, _inter alia_:\r\n\r\n    “But what you could perhaps do with in these days is a word of\r\n    most sincere sympathy. Your movement is carried internally by so\r\n    strong a truth and necessity that victory in one form or another\r\n    cannot elude you for long. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Wherever my work may take me in the near future even if you\r\n    should see me one day within the fortress—you can always count\r\n    on me as your reliable assistant.” (_EC-457_).\r\n\r\nSubsequently, on 12 November 1932, he again wrote to Hitler,\r\ncongratulating him upon his firm attitude and stating:\r\n\r\n    “I have no doubt that the present development of things can only\r\n    lead to your becoming chancellor. * * * I am quite confident\r\n    that the present system is certainly doomed to disintegration.”\r\n    (_EC-456_).\r\n\r\nThe fact that Schacht was in complete accord with Hitler’s program is\r\nfurther shown by the following entry of 21 November 1932, in Goebbels’\r\ndiary:\r\n\r\n    “In a conversation with Dr. Schacht, I assured myself that he\r\n    absolutely represents our point of view. He is one of the few\r\n    who accepts the Fuehrer’s position entirely.” (_2409-PS_).\r\n\r\nSchacht has himself confirmed the correctness of Goebbels’ statement\r\n(_3729-PS_).\r\n\r\nBut Schacht’s contribution to Hitler before his accession to power did\r\nnot consist merely of comforting him, giving advice, and expressing\r\nagreement with the Nazi program. He was an active participant in\r\nHitler’s vigorous campaign to take over the German state. Thus, he\r\nopenly lent the prestige of his name, which was widely known in banking,\r\nfinancial, and business circles, to Hitler’s cause (_3729-PS_). He\r\nactively undertook to induce business leaders to support Hitler. In his\r\nletter to Hitler of 12 November 1932, he wrote that:\r\n\r\n    “It seems as if our attempt to collect a number of signatures\r\n    from business circles for this purpose (your becoming\r\n    Chancellor) was not altogether in vain * * *.” (_EC-456_)\r\n\r\nHe organized the financial means for the decisive March 1933 election,\r\nat a meeting of Hitler with a group of German industrialists in Berlin.\r\nAt this meeting, Hitler bluntly announced his plans to destroy the\r\nparliamentary system in Germany, to crush all internal opposition by\r\nforce, to restore the power of the Wehrmacht, and to gain his objectives\r\noutside of Germany by the use of force. On this occasion, Schacht\r\ncollected a campaign fund of several million Marks for Hitler’s use\r\n(_D-203_; _EC-439_).\r\n\r\nIn an eulogy of Schacht on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, the\r\n_Voelkischer Beobachter_, Hitler’s official organ, aptly described\r\nSchacht’s activity in the period before the 1933 election as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In this critical period, Schacht never failed to point at Adolf\r\n    Hitler as the only possible leader of the Reich.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The name of Dr. Schacht will remain linked with the transition\r\n    of the German economy to the new National Socialist methods”\r\n    (_EC-499_).\r\n\r\n   C. _SCHACHT PLAYED A DOMINANT ROLE IN THE CONSPIRATORS’ PROGRAM OF\r\n       REARMAMENT AND ECONOMIC PLANNING AND PREPARATION FOR WAR._\r\n\r\nGermany was virtually prostrate in the early part of 1933; she was faced\r\nwith dwindling revenues from taxation and seemingly unable to raise\r\nmoney either through external or internal loans. Hitler entrusted to\r\nSchacht the task of wringing from the depressed German economy the\r\ntremendous material requirements of armed aggression, and endowed him\r\nwith vast powers over every sector of German industry, commerce, and\r\nfinance to carry out that task. Some of the devices which Schacht\r\nemployed to fulfill his mission will now be examined.\r\n\r\nSchacht’s program, as hereinafter outlined, was, by his own admissions,\r\ndedicated to the accomplishment of Hitler’s armament program. In a\r\nmemorandum to Hitler dated 3 May 1935 concerning the financing of\r\narmament, Schacht wrote:\r\n\r\n    “The following comments are based on the assumption that the\r\n    accomplishment of the armament program in regard to speed and\r\n    extent, is _the_ task of German policy, and that therefore\r\n    everything else must be subordinated to this aim, although the\r\n    reaching of this main goal must not be imperiled by neglecting\r\n    other questions. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * all expenditures which are not urgently needed in other\r\n    matters, must stop and the entire, in itself small, financial\r\n    power of Germany must be concentrated toward the one goal: to\r\n    arm.” (_1168-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn a letter to General Thomas dated 29 December 1937, Schacht stated:\r\n\r\n    “I have always considered a rearmament of the German people as\r\n    _conditio sine qua non_ of the establishment of a new German\r\n    nation.” (_EC-257_).\r\n\r\nSchacht’s vast achievements in furtherance of the conspirators’ program\r\nmay conveniently be considered under four headings: (a) armament\r\nfinancing; (b) the “New Plan”; (c) control of production; and (d) plans\r\nand preparations for economic controls during war.\r\n\r\n(1) _Armament Financing._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Mefo bills._ The financing of the conspirators’ huge rearmament\r\nprogram presented a twofold problem to Schacht. First, was the need of\r\nobtaining funds over and above the amount which could be obtained\r\nthrough taxation and public loans. Second, was the conspirators’ desire,\r\nin the early stages of rearmament, to conceal the extent of their\r\nfeverish armament activities. Schacht’s answer to the problem was the\r\n“mefo” bills, a scheme which he devised for the exclusive use of\r\narmament financing (_EC-436_).\r\n\r\nTransactions in “mefo” bills worked as follows: “mefo” bills were drawn\r\nby armament contractors and accepted by a limited liability company\r\ncalled the _Metallurgische Forschungsgesellschaft_, m.b.H.(MEFO). This\r\ncompany was merely a dummy organization; it had a nominal capital of\r\nonly one million Reichsmarks. “Mefo” bills ran for six months, but\r\nprovision was made for extensions running consecutively for three months\r\neach. The drawer could present his “mefo” bills to any German bank for\r\ndiscount at any time, and these banks, in turn, could rediscount the\r\nbills at the Reichsbank at any time within the last three months of\r\ntheir earliest maturity. The amount of “mefo” bills outstanding was a\r\nguarded state secret (_EC-436_). The “mefo” bill system continued to be\r\nused until 1 April 1938, when 12 billion Reichsmarks of “mefo” bills\r\nwere outstanding (_EC-436_). This method of financing enabled the Reich\r\nto obtain credit from the Reichsbank which, under existing statutes, it\r\ncould not directly have obtained. Direct lending to the Government by\r\nthe Reichsbank had been limited by statute to 100 million Reichsmarks\r\n(_Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1924, II, p. 241). Schacht has conceded that his\r\n“mefo” bill device “enabled the Reichsbank to lend by a subterfuge to\r\nthe Government what it normally or legally could not do” (_3728-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn a speech delivered on 29 November 1938, Schacht glowingly described\r\nthe credit policy of the Reichsbank of which he was the author as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “It is possible that no bank of issue in peacetimes carried on\r\n    such a daring credit policy at the Reichsbank since the seizure\r\n    of power by National Socialism. With the aid of this credit\r\n    policy, however, Germany created an armament second to none, and\r\n    this armament in turn made possible the results of our policy.”\r\n    (_EC-611_).\r\n\r\nThe “daring credit policy,” which made possible the creation of “an\r\narmament second to none,” obviously embraced the “mefo” bill financing\r\nwhich he had contrived.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Use of funds of opponents of Nazi regime._ In his efforts to draw\r\nupon every possible source of funds for the conspirators’ rearmament\r\nprogram, Schacht even used the blocked funds of foreigners’ deposits in\r\nthe Reichsbank. In his memorandum to Hitler of 3 May 1935, Schacht\r\nboasted:\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsbank invested the major part of Reichsbank accounts\r\n    owned by foreigners, and which were accessible to the\r\n    Reichsbank, in armament drafts. Our armaments are, therefore,\r\n    being financed partially with the assets of our political\r\n    opponents.” (_1168-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Taxation and long term indebtedness._ “Mefo” bills and the funds\r\nof political opponents of the conspirators were, of course, not the only\r\nsources from which Schacht drew to finance the armament program. Funds\r\nfor rearmament were likewise derived from taxation and an increase in\r\npublic debt—channels through which part of national income is\r\nordinarily diverted to public authorities. But what distinguished the\r\nconspirators’ program of public indebtedness was the fact that the\r\nGerman capital market was completely harnessed to the expanding needs of\r\nthe Nazi war machine. By a series of controls, they reduced to the\r\nminimum consistent with their rearmament program, all private issues\r\nwhich might have competed with Government issues for the limited funds\r\nin the capital market. Thus, the capital market was, in effect,\r\npre-empted for Government issues (_EC-497_; _EC-611_).\r\n\r\nDuring the period from 31 December 1932 to 30 June 1938, the funded debt\r\nof the Reich rose from 10.4 billion Marks to 19 billion Marks\r\n(_EC-419_).\r\n\r\nThis large increase in funded debt was dedicated “as far as possible” to\r\n“the financing of armament and the Four-Year Plan” (_EC-611_).\r\n\r\n(2) _The New Plan._ The conspirators’ grandiose armament plans obviously\r\nrequired huge quantities of raw materials. Schacht was a proponent of\r\nthe view that as much of the requisite raw materials as possible should\r\nbe produced within Germany. At the same time, however, he recognized\r\nthat large imports of raw materials were indispensable to the success of\r\nthe conspirators’ gigantic armament program. To that end, he fashioned\r\nan intricate system of controls and devices which he called the “New\r\nPlan” (_Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1934, I, pp. 816, 829, 864;\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1935, I, p. 105).\r\n\r\nThere were three main features of the “New Plan” as devised by Schacht:\r\n(1) restriction of the demand for such foreign exchange as would be used\r\nfor purposes unrelated to the conspirators’ rearmament program; (2)\r\nincrease of the supply of foreign exchange, as a means of paying for\r\nessential imports which could not otherwise be acquired; and (3)\r\nclearing agreements and other devices obviating the need for foreign\r\nexchange. Under the “New Plan”, economic transactions between Germany\r\nand the outside world were no longer governed by the autonomous price\r\nmechanism; they were determined by a number of Government agencies whose\r\nprimary aim was to satisfy the needs of the conspirators’ military\r\neconomy (_EC-437_).\r\n\r\nSchacht accomplished the negative task of restricting the demand for\r\nforeign exchange\r\n\r\n    “by various measures suspending the service on Germany’s foreign\r\n    indebtedness, by freezing other claims of foreigners on Germany,\r\n    by a stringent system of export controls and by eliminating\r\n    foreign travel and other unessential foreign expenditures.”\r\n    (_EC-437_).\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the available supply of foreign exchange\r\n\r\n    “Schacht repeatedly requisitioned all existing foreign exchange\r\n    reserves of German residents, required all foreign exchange\r\n    arising out of current exports and other transactions to be sold\r\n    to the Reichsbank, and by developing new export markets. Exports\r\n    were encouraged by direct subsidies and by accepting partial\r\n    payment in German foreign bonds or in restricted Marks which\r\n    could be acquired by foreign importers at a substantial\r\n    discount.” (_EC-437_).\r\n\r\nA vast network of organizations was erected to effectuate these various\r\nmeasures. Suffice it for the present purposes to mention merely one of\r\nthese organizations: the supervisory agencies (_Ueberwachungsstellen_).\r\nThese agencies, which were under Schacht’s control as Minister of\r\nEconomics, decided whether given imports and exports were desirable;\r\nwhether the quantities, prices, credit terms, and countries involved\r\nwere satisfactory; and, in short, whether any particular transaction\r\nadvanced the conspirators’ armament program. The overriding military\r\npurpose of the series of controls instituted under the “New Plan” is\r\nplainly shown in Schacht’s letter of 5 August 1937 to Goering, wherein\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The very necessity of bringing our armament up to a\r\n    certain level as rapidly as possible must place in the\r\n    foreground the idea of as large returns as possible in foreign\r\n    exchange and therewith the greatest possible assurance of raw\r\n    material supplies, through exporting.” (_EC-497_)\r\n\r\nThere remains for consideration that aspect of the “New Plan” which\r\ninvolved extensive use of clearing agreements and other arrangements\r\nmade by Schacht to obtain materials from abroad without the expenditure\r\nof foreign exchange. The principle of the clearing system is as follows:\r\nThe importer makes a deposit of the purchase price in his own currency\r\nat the national clearing agency of his country, which places the same\r\namount to the credit of the clearing agency of the exporting country.\r\nThe latter institution then pays the exporter in his own currency. Thus,\r\nif trade between two countries is unequal, the clearing agency of one\r\nacquires a claim against the agency of the other. That claim, however,\r\nis satisfied only when a shift in the balance of trade gives rise to an\r\noffsetting claim.\r\n\r\nThis device was used by Schacht as a means of exploiting Germany’s\r\nposition as Europe’s largest consumer in order to acquire essential raw\r\nmaterials from countries which, because of the world wide economic\r\ndepression, were dependent upon the German market as an outlet for their\r\nsurplus products. Speaking of his system of obtaining materials abroad\r\nwithout the use of foreign exchange, Schacht has stated:\r\n\r\n    “It has been shown that, in contrast to everything which\r\n    classical national economy has hitherto taught, not the producer\r\n    but the consumer is the ruling factor in economic life. And this\r\n    thesis is somewhat connected with general social and political\r\n    observations, because it establishes the fact that the number of\r\n    consumers is considerably larger than the number of producers, a\r\n    fact which exercises a not inconsiderable social and political\r\n    pressure.” (_EC-611_)\r\n\r\nSchacht’s clearing agreements were particularly effective in\r\nSoutheastern Europe, where agricultural exports had been considerably\r\ncurtailed by competition from the more extensive and efficient overseas\r\nagriculture. The success of Schacht’s ruthless use of Germany’s\r\nbargaining position is indicated by the fact that by August 1937, there\r\nhad been imported into Germany approximately one half billion\r\nReichsmarks of goods in excess of the amount delivered under the\r\nclearing arrangements. In his letter to Goering dated 5 August 1937,\r\nSchacht stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * in clearing transactions with countries furnishing raw\r\n    materials and food products we have bought in excess of the\r\n    goods we were able to deliver to these countries (namely,\r\n    Southeastern Europe and Turkey) roughly one half billion RM * *\r\n    *.” (_EC-497_)\r\n\r\nThus, through this device, Schacht was able to extract huge loans from\r\nforeign countries which Germany could not have obtained through ordinary\r\nchannels. The device as developed by Schacht was subsequently used\r\nduring the war as a means of systematically exploiting the occupied\r\ncountries of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the clearing agreements, Schacht devised the system which\r\ncame to be known as the “aski” accounts. This scheme likewise obviated\r\nthe need for free currency (i.e. Reichsmarks freely convertible into\r\nforeign currency at the official rate—U. S. dollars, pounds sterling,\r\netc). The system worked as follows: The German foreign exchange control\r\nadministration would authorize imports of goods in specified quantities\r\nand categories on the condition that the foreign sellers agreed to\r\naccept payment in the form of Mark credits to accounts of a special type\r\nheld in German banks. These accounts were called “aski”, an abbreviation\r\nof _Auslander Sonderkonten fuer Inlandszahlungen_ (foreigners’ special\r\naccounts for inland payments). The so-called “aski” Marks in such an\r\naccount could be used to purchase German goods only for export to the\r\ncountry of the holder of the account; they could not be converted into\r\nforeign currency at the official rates of exchange. Each group of “aski”\r\naccounts formed a separate “island of exchange” in which the German\r\nauthorities, under Schacht’s leadership, could apply their control as\r\nthe country’s bargaining position in each case seemed to warrant.\r\n\r\nSchacht’s ingenious devices were eminently successful. They admirably\r\nserved the conspirators’ need of obtaining materials which were\r\nnecessary to create and maintain their war machine. On this point,\r\nSchacht has stated:\r\n\r\n    “The success of the New Plan can be proved by means of a few\r\n    figures. Calculated according to quantity, the import of\r\n    finished products was throttled by 63 percent between 1934 and\r\n    1937. On the other hand, the import of ores was increased by 132\r\n    percent, of petroleum by 116, of grain by 102 and of rubber by\r\n    71 percent.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “These figures show how much the New Plan contributed to the\r\n    execution of the armament program as well as to the securing of\r\n    our food.” (_EC-611_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Production Control._ As an additional means of assuring that the\r\nconspirators’ military needs would be met, Schacht adopted a host of\r\ncontrols over the productive mechanism of Germany, extending, _inter\r\nalia_, to the allocation of raw materials, regulation of productive\r\ncapacity, use of abundant or synthetic substitutes in place of declining\r\nstocks of urgently needed materials, and the erection of new capacity\r\nfor the production of essential commodities. The structure of regulation\r\nwas built up out of thousands of decrees in which governmental agencies\r\nunder Schacht’s control issued permits, prohibitions, and instructions.\r\nThese decrees were the outgrowth of carefully laid plans of the Ministry\r\nof Economics, of which Schacht was the head, concerning “economic\r\npreparation for the conduct of war”, and in accordance with its view\r\nthat “genuine positive economic mobilization” demanded that “exact\r\ninstructions for every individual commercial undertaking are laid down\r\nby a central authority” (_EC-128_).\r\n\r\nThe plan to allocate raw materials was carried out through myriad\r\n“orders to produce” specifying that certain commodities must or must not\r\nbe produced; “orders to process or use” prescribing the type and\r\nquantity of raw material which could or could not be used in the\r\nproduction of a given commodity; orders specifying that scarce raw\r\nmaterials could be used only as admixtures with more plentiful but\r\ninferior products; and other like measures. The precise details of these\r\norders are unimportant for present purposes. Their significance lies in\r\nthe fact that they were governed by a central purpose: preparation for\r\nwar. In the above mentioned secret report issued in September 1934 by\r\nthe Ministry of Economics it was said:\r\n\r\n    “Rules are to be initiated for the allotment of scarce raw\r\n    materials etc.; and their use and processing for other than war,\r\n    or otherwise absolutely vital, goods is prohibited.” (_EC-128_)\r\n\r\nThe military aspects of Schacht’s plans to increase the production of\r\nscarce raw materials within Germany, and thereby reduce Germany’s\r\ndependence upon foreign countries for materials needed in the rearmament\r\nprogram, are likewise revealed in the aforementioned report of the\r\nMinistry of Economics of September 1934:\r\n\r\n    “The investigations initiated by the Raw Materials Commission\r\n    and the measures introduced for enlarging our raw materials\r\n    basis through home production as well as for furthering the\r\n    production of substitute materials will directly benefit war\r\n    economy preparations.” (_EC-128_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Plans and Preparations for Economic Controls During War._ Pursuant\r\nto the unpublished Reich Defense Law secretly enacted on 21 May 1935,\r\nSchacht was appointed General Plenipotentiary for War Economy by Hitler.\r\nUnder this law, Schacht was placed in complete charge of economic\r\nplanning and preparation for war in peacetime, except for the direct\r\nproduction of armaments which was entrusted to the Ministry of War; and\r\nupon the outbreak of war, Schacht was to be the virtual economic\r\ndictator of Germany. His task was “to put all economic forces in the\r\nservice of carrying on the war and to secure the life of the German\r\npeople economically”. In order to facilitate his task, the Ministers of\r\nEconomy, Food and Agriculture, Labor, and Forestry were subordinated to\r\nhim, and he was authorized “within his realm of responsibility, to issue\r\nlegal regulations which may deviate from existing regulations”. The\r\nnecessity for absolute secrecy was stressed (_2261-PS_).\r\n\r\nSchacht appointed Wohlthat as his deputy General Plenipotentiary for War\r\nEconomy and organized a staff to carry out his directives. Schacht has\r\nadmitted that he must accept full responsibility for the actions of\r\nthese subordinates (_3729-PS_).\r\n\r\nBefore his resignation in late 1937, Schacht had worked out in amazing\r\ndetail his plans and preparations for the German economy in the\r\nforthcoming war. Recognizing that wartime controls, to be effective,\r\nmust be based on adequate information, Schacht had directed the\r\ncompletion of comprehensive surveys of 180,000 industrial plants in\r\nGermany and had compiled statistics concerning\r\n\r\n    “* * * the composition of the labor force as to sex, age, and\r\n    training, the consumption of raw and auxiliary material, fuels,\r\n    power, the productive capacity, the domestic and foreign trade\r\n    as well as the supply of material and products in the beginning\r\n    and at the end of the year.” (_EC-258_)\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the statistical data thus collected, plans had been\r\nformulated by the end of 1937 wherein\r\n\r\n    “* * * the needs of the Armed Forces and the civilian minimum\r\n    needs in wartime are compared with the covering thereof by\r\n    supplies and production.” (_EC-258_)\r\n\r\nThe supervisory boards, which were briefly described above in connection\r\nwith the import and export controls, were charged with “preparing their\r\norders for the regulation of war contracts and fees”, and were\r\ninstructed to coordinate with various Reich manpower authorities to\r\nsecure “their indispensable personnel” (_EC-258_).\r\n\r\nSpecial measures were taken under Schacht’s direction, to maintain\r\n“mobilization stocks” of coal and to assure their distribution in\r\naccordance with the wartime needs of armament factories and large\r\nconsumers. Large “gasoline storage places” were constructed for use of\r\nthe Wehrmacht and “gasoline stations and gasoline stores” were\r\ndesignated “for the first equipment of the troops in case of\r\nmobilization”. Careful plans were also made for the allocation of power\r\nduring war, and practice manoeuvers were held in order to determine\r\n“what measures have to be taken in case places of power generation\r\nshould be eliminated” (_EC-258_).\r\n\r\nEvacuation plans for the removal of war materials, agricultural\r\nproducts, skilled workers, and animals from military zones were worked\r\nout by the Office of the Plenipotentiary for War Economy with\r\ncharacteristic thoroughness. Thus, “the supplies and skilled workers in\r\nthe evacuation zones” were “registered, earmarked for transportation\r\ninto certain salvage areas and registered with the _Wehrkreiskommandos_\r\nby the field offices of evacuation and salvaging plans” (_EC-258_).\r\n\r\nDetailed plans for a system of rationing to become effective immediately\r\nupon mobilization had already been made by the end of 1937:\r\n\r\n    “The 80 million ration cards necessary for this purpose have\r\n    already been printed and deposited with the Landrats, Chief\r\n    Mayors, and corresponding authorities. The further distribution\r\n    of the ration cards to the individual households is prepared by\r\n    these authorities to take place within 24 hours after\r\n    mobilization has been ordered.” (_EC-258_).\r\n\r\nTrusted persons whose reliability had been attested to by the Secret\r\nState Police were installed in important enterprises and charged with\r\nthe execution of “measures which guarantee the maintenance of production\r\nof their enterprises in the event of mobilization”. Their functions\r\nlikewise extended, among other matters, to applying “for exemptions from\r\nmilitary service” of “employees who are indispensable to their\r\nenterprise”, and seeking immunity from requisition by the Wehrmacht of\r\nall motor trucks which were needed in the enterprises to which they were\r\nassigned (_EC-258_).\r\n\r\nPursuant to directives issued by Schacht as Plenipotentiary, labor\r\nauthorities of the Government ascertained “the available amount of\r\nmanpower, the wartime requirements of manpower and measures for the\r\ncovering of the wartime needs”. The wartime needs were to be met in part\r\n“by using reserve manpower (manpower theretofore used in non-essential\r\nenterprises, women, etc.)”, and by making “every change of working place\r\nand every hiring of workers dependent upon the consent of the Labor\r\nOffice” (_EC-258_).\r\n\r\nThe foregoing measures, it should be noted, are merely representative;\r\nthey are not exhaustive. But enough appears to make it abundantly clear\r\nthat Schacht’s contribution, by any standard was an extraordinarily\r\nimportant one. Enough appears, moreover, to give particular emphasis to\r\nthe following observations of the Honorable George S. Messersmith,\r\nUnited States Consul General in Berlin from 1930 to 1934:\r\n\r\n    “It was his [Schacht’s] financial ability that enabled the Nazi\r\n    regime in the early days to find the financial basis for the\r\n    tremendous armament program and which made it possible to carry\r\n    it through. If it had not been for his efforts, and this is not\r\n    a personal observation of mine only but I believe was shared and\r\n    is shared by every observer at the time, the Nazi regime would\r\n    have been unable to maintain itself in power and to establish\r\n    its control over Germany, much less to create the enormous war\r\n    machine which was necessary for its objectives in Europe and\r\n    later throughout the world.\r\n\r\n    “The increased industrial activity in Germany incident to\r\n    rearmament made great imports of raw materials necessary while\r\n    at the same time exports were decreasing. Yet by Schacht’s\r\n    resourcefulness, his complete financial ruthlessness, and his\r\n    absolute cynicism, Schacht was able to maintain and to establish\r\n    the situation for the Nazis. Unquestionably without this\r\n    complete lending of his capacities to the Nazi Government and\r\n    all of its ambitions, it would have been impossible for Hitler\r\n    and the Nazis to develop an Armed Force sufficient to permit\r\n    Germany to launch an aggressive war.” (_EC-451_).\r\n\r\n D. _SCHACHT PARTICIPATED IN THE NAZI CONSPIRACY PURPOSELY, WILLINGLY,\r\n          AND WITH KNOWLEDGE OF ITS ILLEGAL AIMS AND METHODS._\r\n\r\n(1) _He was a faithful adherent of Hitler._ It has already been\r\ndemonstrated that even before Hitler’s accession to power, Schacht\r\naligned himself with Hitler and accepted his program. Schacht’s\r\nutterances after Hitler had entrenched himself in power clearly show\r\nthat he remained a faithful servant of Hitler despite the series of\r\noutrages committed under Hitler’s direction.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the Leipzig Fair on 4 March 1935, Schacht said:\r\n\r\n    “My so-called foreign friends don’t render any services to me or\r\n    the cause, which they don’t want anyway, of course, but not even\r\n    to themselves, if they try to construe a contrast between me and\r\n    the allegedly impossible economic theories of National Socialism\r\n    and represent me as a sort of guardian of economic reason. I\r\n    assure you that all that I am doing and saying enjoys the\r\n    absolute approval of the Fuehrer and that I would never do or\r\n    say anything that does not have his approval. Not I but the\r\n    Fuehrer is the guardian of economic reason.” (_EC-503_)\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the unveiling of Hitler’s bust in the vestibule of\r\nthe Reichsbank on 31 July 1935, Schacht said:\r\n\r\n    “Germany stays and falls with the success of the policy of\r\n    Hitler.” (_EC-415_)\r\n\r\nAt a ceremony in connection with the creation of the Economic Chamber\r\nfor Pomerania in Stettin on 19 January 1936, Schacht denied that there\r\nwas any disagreement between Hitler and his collaborators, and went on\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n    “In Germany there is fortunately only one policy and one\r\n    economic policy, namely that of Adolf Hitler; to work with him\r\n    and for his goals is the highest satisfaction for every member\r\n    of the people’s community.” (_EC-502_)\r\n\r\nIn May 1936, Schacht was attacked by some of the more radical elements\r\nof the Nazi Party because he had rejected their “partially irrational\r\nideas” concerning armament financing. In repelling these attacks,\r\nSchacht emphasized at a secret meeting of the Ministers on 12 May 1936,\r\nthat his program of financing armaments had meant “the commitment of the\r\nlast reserve from the very beginning”; and he announced that despite the\r\nattacks, he would continue to work because he\r\n\r\n    “* * * stands with unswerving loyalty to the Fuehrer, because he\r\n    fully recognizes the basic idea of National Socialism and\r\n    because at the end, the disturbances, compared to the great\r\n    task, can be considered irrelevant.” (_1301-PS_).\r\n\r\nSo far as appears, Schacht did not become a member of the Nazi Party\r\nuntil January 1937. Franz Reuter, whose biography of Schacht was\r\nofficially published in Germany in 1937, has stated that Schacht’s\r\nbecoming a regular Party member was only a question of secondary\r\nimportance, and even part of a carefully planned policy, for,\r\n\r\n    “By not doing so—at least until the final assertion, and\r\n    victory of the Party—he [Schacht] was able to assist it [the\r\n    Party] much better than he would have been able to do had he\r\n    become an official Party member.” (_EC-460_)\r\n\r\nOn 30 January 1937, Hitler bestowed the Golden Party Badge upon Schacht,\r\nin recognition of his “special services to Party and State.” Schacht\r\naccepted this hallmark of approval by the Fuehrer with effusive thanks\r\nand a pledge of continued support. In his speech of acceptance, Schacht\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “The presentation of the Golden Badge of the Movement is the\r\n    highest honor the Third Reich has to offer. In honoring me as\r\n    the head of the Reichsbank and the Reich and Prussian Ministry\r\n    of Economics, it honors at the same time the two agencies which\r\n    I am directing as well as the work of all those officials,\r\n    employees and workers functioning in these two agencies.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I thank all my colleagues among the ranks of officials,\r\n    employees, and workers for their faithfulness in the performance\r\n    of their work, and appeal to all of them further to devote, with\r\n    all their hearts, their entire strength to the Fuehrer and the\r\n    Reich. The German future lies in the hands of our Fuehrer.”\r\n    (_EC-500_)\r\n\r\nThe depths of adulation were reached in a speech which Schacht delivered\r\non the occasion of Hitler’s 48th birthday in April 1937. Schacht spoke\r\nas one of Hitler’s “closest collaborators,” who had seen at first hand\r\nthe difficulties which beset the Fuehrer in the relentless march toward\r\nhis goals. In his speech, Schacht stated:\r\n\r\n    “With the limitless passion of a burning heart and the\r\n    infallible instinct of the born statesman, Adolf Hitler has won\r\n    for himself the soul of the German people in a battle fought for\r\n    14 years with unswerving consequence.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Only the closest collaborators of the Fuehrer know how\r\n    difficult is the burden of this responsibility; how sorrowful\r\n    are the hours during which decisions must be made which bear\r\n    upon the well being and the fate of all of Germany.” (EC-501)\r\n\r\nIn November 1938, at a time Schacht now asserts he was plotting against\r\nHitler, he stated in a speech:\r\n\r\n    “Instead of a weak and vacillating Government, a single,\r\n    purposeful, energetic personality is ruling today. That is the\r\n    great miracle which has actually happened in Germany and which\r\n    has had its effects in all fields of life and not least in that\r\n    of economy and finance. There is no German financial miracle.\r\n    There is only the miracle of the reawakening of German national\r\n    consciousness and German discipline, and we owe this miracle to\r\n    our Fuehrer Adolf Hitler.” (_EC-611_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Schacht favored the acquisition of additional territory for\r\nGermany—peacefully if possible, but by aggressive war, if necessary._\r\nSchacht had long been a German nationalist and expansionist. As early as\r\n1927, he spoke against the Versailles Treaty:\r\n\r\n    “The Versailles Dictate cannot be an eternal document, because\r\n    not only its economic, but also its spiritual and moral premises\r\n    are wrong.” (_EC-415_)\r\n\r\nHe strongly favored the acquisition by Germany of both colonial\r\nterritory and contiguous territory in Europe. At the Paris conference on\r\n16 April 1929, he said:\r\n\r\n    “Germany can generally only pay if the Corridor and Upper\r\n    Silesia will be handed back to Germany from Polish possession,\r\n    and if besides somewhere on the earth colonial territory will be\r\n    made available to Germany.” (_3726-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a speech in Danzig in June 1935, Schacht ascribed the economic\r\ndifficulties which confronted Danzig to “historical errors of the\r\ngreatest extent which were beyond the control of the German people”. He\r\nsought to comfort his listeners with the assurance that\r\n\r\n    “We Germans in the Reich today are looking with fullest\r\n    confidence upon our comrades in the Danzig Free State, and\r\n    maintain our people’s fellowship with the interests, wishes and\r\n    hopes of this territory which has unfortunately been separated\r\n    from us.” (_EC-498_)\r\n\r\nIn January 1936, Schacht again publicly spoke against the Versailles\r\nTreaty, and impliedly threatened war unless its terms were revised in\r\nGermany’s favor. At that time, he stated:\r\n\r\n    “But the memory of war weighs undiminished upon the people’s\r\n    minds. That is because deeper than material wounds, moral wounds\r\n    are smarting, inflicted by the so-called peace treaties.\r\n    Material loss can be made up through renewed labor, but the\r\n    moral wrong which has been inflicted upon the conquered peoples,\r\n    in the peace dictates, leaves a burning scar on the people’s\r\n    conscience. The spirit of the Versailles has perpetuated the\r\n    fury of war, and there will not be a true peace, progress or\r\n    reconstruction until the world desists from this spirit. The\r\n    German people will not tire of pronouncing this warning.”\r\n    (_EC-415_)\r\n\r\nLater in the same year, Schacht again publicly advocated “_Lebensraum_”\r\nfor the German people in terms not unlike those employed by Hitler. In\r\nhis speech at Frankfurt on 9 December 1936, Schacht said:\r\n\r\n    “Germany has too little living space for her population. She has\r\n    made every effort, and certainly greater efforts than any other\r\n    nation, to extract from her own existing small space, whatever\r\n    is necessary for the securing of her livelihood. However, in\r\n    spite of all these efforts the space does not suffice.”\r\n    (_EC-415_)\r\n\r\nSchacht had hoped, it is believed, that his desire for additional space\r\nfor Germany would be realized without resort to war. In Austria, for\r\nexample, he had authorized 200,000 Marks a month to be set aside for the\r\nNational Socialists in Austria, hoping thereby to facilitate the\r\nabsorption of Austria into Germany without war. But if Germany’s\r\nneighbors would not accede to the conspirators’ demands for additional\r\nspace, Schacht was willing to go to war to fulfill those demands.\r\n\r\nThus, on 23 September 1935, Schacht told S. R. Fuller, Jr. at the\r\nAmerican Embassy in Berlin:\r\n\r\n    “Colonies are necessary to Germany. We shall get them through\r\n    negotiation if possible; but if not, we shall take them.”\r\n    (_EC-450_)\r\n\r\nIn January 1937, Schacht, in a conversation with Ambassador Davies,\r\nimpliedly threatened a breach of the peace unless Germany’s demands for\r\ncolonies were met. The conversation is related as follows in a report\r\nunder date of 20 January 1937, by Ambassador Davies to the Secretary of\r\nState:\r\n\r\n    “He [Schacht] stated the following: that the present condition\r\n    of the Germany people was intolerable, desperate and\r\n    unendurable; that he had been authorized by his Government to\r\n    submit proposals to France and England which would (1) guarantee\r\n    European peace; (2) secure present European international\r\n    boundaries; (3) reduce armaments; (4) establish a new form of a\r\n    workable League of Nations; (5) abolish sanctions with new\r\n    machinery for joint administration; all based upon a colonial\r\n    cession that would provide for Germany an outlet for population,\r\n    source for food stuffs, fats and raw material. * * *” (_L-111_)\r\n\r\nThe inference was clear: without a colonial cession, peace could not be\r\nguaranteed. Equally clear was the inference that it would be Germany in\r\nits search for “_Lebensraum_” that would disturb the peace.\r\n\r\nOn 21 December 1937, Schacht indicated to Ambassador Dodd that he\r\ndesired the annexation of neighboring countries, without war if\r\npossible, but with war, if necessary. The pertinent portion of\r\nAmbassador Dodd’s notes on this conversation are as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Schacht meant what the Army chiefs of 1914 meant when they\r\n    invaded Belgium, expecting to conquer France in six weeks; i.e.,\r\n    domination and annexation of neighboring little countries,\r\n    especially north and east. Much as he dislikes Hitler’s\r\n    dictatorship, he, as most other eminent Germans, wishes\r\n    annexation—without war if possible, with war, if the United\r\n    States will keep hands off.” (_EC-461_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Schacht knew of Hitler’s plans to wage aggressive war and wilfully\r\nprovided the means whereby such a war might successfully be waged._\r\nWhether or not Schacht personally favored war, it is clear that he at\r\nleast knew that Hitler planned military aggression and that he was\r\nproviding Hitler with the instrument by which those plans could be\r\nexecuted. Even before Hitler’s accession to power, Schacht knew from a\r\nreading of _Mein Kampf_ that Hitler was bent upon expansion to the East\r\nby force of arms (_3727-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn the course of his frequent contacts with Mr. Messersmith, United\r\nStates Consul General in Berlin from 1930 to 1934, Schacht emphasized\r\nthat the “Nazis were inevitably going to plunge Europe into war”\r\n(_EC-451_).\r\n\r\nIn September of 1934, Ambassador Dodd recorded in his diary a\r\nconversation with Sir Eric Phipps at the British Embassy in Berlin,\r\nwherein he stated that “Schacht had acknowledged to me the war purposes\r\nof the Nazi Party” (_EC-461_).\r\n\r\nSchacht has admitted that in the course of his numerous talks with\r\nHitler from 1933 to 1937, he formed the impression that “in order to\r\nmake his hold on the Government secure, the Fuehrer felt that he must\r\npresent the German people with a military victory” (_EC-458_).\r\n\r\nThese admissions by Schacht are fortified by other evidence which shows\r\nthat Schacht knew that Hitler planned military aggression. After his\r\nappointment as Minister of Economics, Schacht became a permanent member\r\nof the secret Reich Defense Council. The function of that Council, as\r\nshown in other connections, was secretly to mobilize all of the human\r\nand material resources of Germany for war (_EC-177_).\r\n\r\nShortly after his appointment as the Plenipotentiary General for the War\r\nEconomy in May 1935, Schacht was entrusted by the Reich Defense Council\r\nwith the “preparation of economic mobilization” in connection with the\r\nproposed re-occupation of the Rhineland. Schacht and those officials who\r\nwere charged with the purely military aspects of the re-occupation were\r\nenjoined to proceed with the utmost secrecy because of assurances given\r\nby Hitler to the French that no military action was contemplated in the\r\nde-militarized zone of the Rhineland (_EC-405_).\r\n\r\nAt the 11th meeting of the Reich Defense Council, on 6 December 1935,\r\nwhich was attended by a number of representatives from Schacht’s office\r\nof Plenipotentiary of the War Economy, Keitel pointed out that\r\n\r\n    “According to the will of the Fuehrer, the economic leadership\r\n    puts the increase of our armed might knowingly ahead of other\r\n    requirements of the state. It is the task of all members of the\r\n    Reich Defense Council to utilize the national property, made\r\n    available, primarily for this purpose and economically in the\r\n    framework of the entire situation, and request only such funds\r\n    and raw materials which serve absolutely and exclusively the\r\n    Reich Defense. * * *”\r\n\r\nThe singleness of purpose with which Schacht and the other conspirators\r\nwere gearing the German economy for war is strikingly shown by the Top\r\nSecret minutes of the meeting of ministers dated 30 May 1936. This, it\r\nwill be recalled, was little more than 10 weeks after German troops had\r\noccupied the Rhineland. At this meeting, Schacht pointed out that “it\r\nmust be attempted to produce those raw materials within Germany which\r\nare economically favorable; for other raw materials ready reserves for\r\nthe case of mobilization”; and also that “certain raw materials for war\r\nmust be stocked.” Continuing the discussion, Goering emphasized that\r\n“all measures are to be considered from the standpoint of an assured\r\nwaging of war.” Thereafter, Schacht advocated the introduction of price\r\nsupervision and agreed that first priority should be given to the\r\n“specially urgent petroleum question” (_1301-PS_).\r\n\r\nBy Top Secret letter dated 31 August 1936, Schacht was advised by\r\nGeneral von Blomberg that Hitler had ordered that “the setting up of all\r\nair force units has to be completed on 1 April 1937”. This accelerated\r\nprogram entailed the expenditure of large additional funds which Schacht\r\nand the Minister of Finance were called upon to supply. The sense of\r\nurgency with which Hitler pressed the completion of the German air force\r\npatently signified that the waging of war was a certainty (_1301-PS_).\r\n\r\nShortly after the receipt of this letter, and on 4 September 1936,\r\nSchacht attended a secret cabinet meeting where Goering stated:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer and Reichskanzler has given a memorandum to the\r\n    Col. General and the Reich War Minister which represents a\r\n    general instruction for the execution thereof.\r\n\r\n    “It starts from the basic thought that the showdown with Russia\r\n    is inevitable.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Colonel General reads the memorandum of the Fuehrer.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “If war should break out tomorrow we would be forced to take\r\n    measures from which we might possibly still shy away at the\r\n    present moment. They are, therefore, to be taken.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “All measures have to be taken just as if we were actually in\r\n    the stage of imminent danger of war.” (_EC-416_).\r\n\r\nThere was no room for surmise in these utterances; Hitler was definitely\r\nand irrevocably committed to waging aggressive war. If Schacht ever had\r\nany doubts concerning Hitler’s firm resolve to carry out the program of\r\naggressive war outlined in _Mein Kampf_; if, contrary to his statements\r\nto Mr. Messersmith and Ambassador Dodd, Schacht actually doubted in 1934\r\nthat the Nazis, whom he was faithfully serving, would inevitably plunge\r\nEurope into war; and if, despite the pressing sense of immediacy that\r\nhad pervaded the Nazi war economy from the very outset, he had\r\nentertained lingering doubts concerning Hitler’s plans for armed\r\naggression, all such doubts must have been removed by the clear and\r\nunequivocal pronouncements in the above-mentioned eventful meetings of\r\n1936 in which he participated.\r\n\r\nYet, despite his knowledge of Hitler’s plans to wage aggressive war,\r\ndespite the fact that he had grave technical doubts about the ability of\r\nthe Reichsbank to finance further armaments through additional short\r\nterm credits, and despite the fact that some directors of the Reichsbank\r\nhad opposed further “mefo” financing, Schacht pledged another 3 billion\r\nReichsmarks by the “mefo” bill method for further financing of armaments\r\nin March 1937 (_EC-438_).\r\n\r\nThe Hossbach notes, dated 10 November 1937, on the important conference\r\nof 5 November 1937 in the _Reichskanzlei_, reveal a further\r\ncrystallization of Hitler’s program of absorption and conquest in Europe\r\n(_386-PS_). Definite plans were laid for the early acquisition of\r\nAustria and Czechoslovakia, and for their exploitation in preparation\r\nfor further military operations. So far as appears, Schacht was not\r\npresent at this particular meeting. But his awareness of what occurred\r\nat the meeting is shown by the fact that he told Ambassador Bullitt on\r\n23 November 1937, that\r\n\r\n    “Hitler was determined to have Austria eventually attached to\r\n    Germany and to obtain at least autonomy for the Germans of\r\n    Bohemia. At the present moment he was not vitally concerned\r\n    about the Polish Corridor, and in his [Schacht’s] opinion it\r\n    might be possible to maintain the Corridor provided Danzig were\r\n    permitted to join East Prussia, and provided some sort of a\r\n    bridge could be built across the Corridor uniting Danzig and\r\n    East Prussia with Germany.” (_L-151_).\r\n\r\nAlthough Schacht apparently sought to convey the impression to\r\nAmbassador Bullitt that he desired to stay Hitler’s hand but was\r\npowerless to do so, it is clear that he was actually in complete\r\nsympathy with Hitler’s objectives. Despite the mounting tension which\r\nfollowed his conversation with Ambassador Bullitt, Schacht remained as\r\nPresident of the Reichsbank, and in that capacity established, in\r\nadvance of the invasion of Austria, the rate of exchange between Marks\r\nand Austrian Schillings which was to prevail after the absorption of\r\nAustria (_EC-421_).\r\n\r\nMoreover, under his direction, the Austrian National Bank was merged\r\ninto the Reichsbank (_Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1938, I, 254). His speech of\r\n21 March 1938, to the employees of the former Austrian National Bank on\r\nthe occasion of its obliteration as an independent institution, betrayed\r\nhis true feelings. After inveighing against “the dictates of Versailles\r\nand St. Germain”, Schacht stated:\r\n\r\n    “Thank God, these things could after all not hinder the great\r\n    German people on their way, for Adolf Hitler has created a\r\n    communion of German will and German thought, he bolstered it up\r\n    with the newly strengthened Wehrmacht and he then finally gave\r\n    the external form to the inner union between Germany and\r\n    Austria.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “One person says he would have done it maybe in one way, but the\r\n    remarkable thing is that they did not do it (hilarity), that IT\r\n    WAS ONLY DONE BY OUR ADOLF HITLER (Long continued applause) and\r\n    if there is still something left to be improved, then those\r\n    grumblers should try to bring about those improvements from the\r\n    German Reich and within the German community, but not to disturb\r\n    it from without. (Lively agreement)”.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I ask you to raise your hands and to repeat after me:\r\n\r\n    I swear that: I will be faithful, and obedient to the Fuehrer of\r\n    the German Reich and the German people, Adolf Hitler, and will\r\n    perform my duties conscientiously and selflessly. (The audience\r\n    takes the pledge with uplifted hands).\r\n\r\n    You have taken this pledge. A scoundrel he who breaks it. To our\r\n    Fuehrer a triple ‘Sieg heil’.” (_EC-297-A_)\r\n\r\nSchacht was likewise enthusiastic about the acquisition of the\r\nSudetenland, and filled with pride over the contribution his credit\r\npolicy as head of the Reichsbank had made thereto (_EC-611_).\r\n\r\nIn January 1939, when Hitler was ruthlessly exploiting his successes in\r\nAustria and the Sudetenland in preparation for his next aggressive move,\r\nSchacht again referred, with pride, to the fact that the _Wehrmacht_\r\nwhich he had helped create by his ingenious and risky methods had made\r\npossible Hitler’s successes. Thus, he said:\r\n\r\n    “From the beginning the Reichsbank has been aware of the fact\r\n    that a successful foreign policy can be attained only by the\r\n    reconstruction of the German armed forces. It [the Reichsbank]\r\n    therefore assumed to a very great extent the responsibility to\r\n    _finance_ the rearmament in spite of the inherent dangers to the\r\n    currency. The justification thereof was the necessity—which\r\n    pushed all other considerations into the background—to carry\r\n    through the armament at once, out of nothing and furthermore\r\n    under camouflage, which made a respect-commanding foreign policy\r\n    possible.” (_EC-369_)\r\n\r\nThe foregoing proof establishes, it seems clear, that Schacht knew of\r\nHitler’s plans for aggressive war, and wilfully created the means\r\nwhereby those plans could be executed. But apart from this direct proof,\r\nit is submitted that to a man in Schacht’s position, the events of the\r\nperiod clearly bespoke Hitler’s intentions. Schacht was a key figure in\r\nthe Nazi Government during the period of the Nazi agitation in Austria,\r\nthe introduction of conscription, the march into the Rhineland, the\r\nconquest of Austria, and the acquisition of the Sudetenland by a show of\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, the Reich debt trebled under the stress of mounting\r\narmaments (_EC-419_), and all the resources of Germany were being\r\nstrained to the very limit for armament. It was a period in which the\r\nburning European foreign policy issue was the satisfaction of Germany’s\r\nrepeated demands for additional territory. Hitler, committed to a policy\r\nof expansion, was laying the greatest stress upon utmost speed in\r\npreparation for war.\r\n\r\nCertainly in this setting, Schacht did not proceed in ignorance of the\r\nfact that he was assisting Hitler and Nazi Germany along the road\r\ntowards armed aggression.\r\n\r\n    E. _SCHACHT’S LOSS OF POWER DID NOT IMPLY DISAGREEMENT WITH THE\r\n               CONSPIRATORS’ PROGRAM OF AGGRESSIVE WAR._\r\n\r\n(1) _His resignation as Minister of Economics and General\r\nPlenipotentiary for War Economy._ In November 1937, Schacht resigned his\r\noffices as Minister of Economics and General Plenipotentiary for War\r\nEconomy. At the same time, he accepted appointment as Minister without\r\nPortfolio, and continued as President of the Reichsbank. It is submitted\r\nthat the evidence shows that Schacht’s resignations were merely the\r\noutgrowth of a clash between two power-seeking individuals, Goering and\r\nSchacht, over _methods_ of creating a war economy and over who should\r\nhave final authority to direct the completion of the task. So far as\r\nappears, Schacht was in full accord with the other conspirators upon the\r\n_desirability_ of providing Hitler with the means by which he eventually\r\ncould carry out his planned aggressions.\r\n\r\nThe basic differences between Schacht and Goering date from a period\r\nshortly after Goering became head of the Four-Year Plan Office. The\r\nlatter office was created by Hitler in September 1936, and in connection\r\ntherewith, Goering was “given far reaching powers to issue directives to\r\nall the highest offices of the State and Party”. Goering conceived of\r\nhis function as head of the Four-Year Plan Office “within four years to\r\nput the entire economy in a state of readiness for war” (_EC-408_).\r\n\r\nSchacht was in agreement with the “aim and idea” of the Four-Year Plan.\r\nHe promised Goering his complete support and cooperation, and urged that\r\nGoering draw upon Schacht’s long experience in economic affairs. Thus,\r\nin Schacht’s letter of 5 August 1937, to Goering, he said:\r\n\r\n    “The aim and the idea of the Four Year Plan were and remain\r\n    entirely correct and necessary! It stands, essentially, for the\r\n    application of increased energy to the efforts already\r\n    undertaken by my ministry since 1934 with the results shown in\r\n    the above statistics. As you will remember, I welcomed it when\r\n    your energy, my dear Prime Minister, was recruited by the\r\n    Fuehrer for these tasks, and from the very beginning I gave you\r\n    my most loyal support and cooperation, with the particular plea\r\n    that I be given a hearing from time to time, since I believed\r\n    that my more than thirty years of experience in economic life,\r\n    half of them in public service, could be of value to you.”\r\n    (_EC-497_)\r\n\r\nGoering, however, failed to avail himself of Schacht’s offer of his\r\nservices. “I can only regret,” said Schacht in the aforementioned\r\nletter, “that you have made so little use of my offer” (_EC-497_).\r\nInstead, Goering began to encroach upon powers which had been delegated\r\nto Schacht, and they became embroiled in a bitter jurisdictional\r\nconflict. On 26 November 1936, Goering issued a directive regarding raw\r\nand synthetic material production, whereby he undertook to assume\r\ncontrol over large economic areas previously within Schacht’s province\r\n(_EC-243_).\r\n\r\nSchacht did not supinely accept Goering’s intrusions upon his powers.\r\nGoering’s directive was countered by an abrupt order from Schacht to all\r\nsupervisory offices to accept orders from him alone (_EC-376_).\r\n\r\nThe conflict reached such dimensions that it threatened to retard the\r\npace of the conspirators’ armament program. The military sided with\r\nSchacht, who had provided the means for their rapid rearmament. They\r\nsubmitted proposals which would have assured to Schacht as\r\nPlenipotentiary General for the War Economy the responsibility for\r\n“unified preparation of the war economy as heretofore” (_EC-408_;\r\n_EC-420_).\r\n\r\nIn January 1937, the German Military Weekly Gazette published an article\r\nwarmly praising Schacht’s achievements in rearmament. The timing of the\r\narticle indicates that it was a further attempt by the military to tip\r\nthe scales in Schacht’s favor. The article stated:\r\n\r\n    “The German Defense Force commemorates Dr. Schacht today as one\r\n    of the men who have done imperishable things for it and its\r\n    development in accordance with directions from the Fuehrer and\r\n    Reich Chancellor. The Defense Force owes it to Schacht’s skill\r\n    and great ability that, in defiance of all currency\r\n    difficulties, it, according to plan, has been able to grow up to\r\n    its present strength from an army of 100,000 men.” (_EC-383_)\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, Schacht attempted to force a showdown with Goering\r\nby temporarily refusing to act in his capacity as Plenipotentiary.\r\nSchacht plainly was using his prime importance in the conspirators’\r\nprogram of economic planning and preparation for war as a lever. In a\r\nletter to Hitler dated 22 February 1937, General von Blomberg, the\r\nMinister of War, suggested a settlement of the jurisdictional fight\r\nunder which Schacht would fully retain his powers as General\r\nPlenipotentiary of War Economy, and concluded by stating:\r\n\r\n    “If you, my Fuehrer, agree with my view regarding these\r\n    jurisdictional questions, it may be possible to induce\r\n    Reichsbank President Dr. Schacht, whose cooperation as\r\n    Plenipotentiary for preparation of war is of great significance,\r\n    to resume his former activity.” (_EC-244_)\r\n\r\nAs a further demonstration of the community of interest between Schacht\r\nand the top German military authorities, Schacht attended the secret\r\n“War Economy” games at Godesberg in the latter part of May 1937. The\r\npurpose of the games was to demonstrate “how the action of the soldiers\r\nin total war is influenced by economy and how on the other hand, economy\r\nis completely dependent on military operations”. Schacht’s attendance\r\nwas acclaimed at the games as\r\n\r\n    “renewed proof that you are willing to facilitate for us\r\n    soldiers the difficult war-economic preparations and to\r\n    strengthen the harmonious cooperation with your offices.”\r\n    (_EC-174_).\r\n\r\nIn June 1937, Keitel implored Hitler to accelerate a final agreement\r\nbetween Schacht and Goering. Speaking of arrangements concerning\r\ncooperation of these two key figures, Keitel said:\r\n\r\n    “I know that a necessary practical basis for it [the arrangement\r\n    for cooperation between Schacht and Goering] has already been\r\n    found, and only a formal agreement is needed in order to carry\r\n    on the common work.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * to waste time in our situation would be the greatest\r\n    reproach that history could make upon us.\r\n\r\n    “May I beg, therefore, once more that the arrangement mentioned\r\n    be expedited, and that I be notified accordingly.” (_EC-248_)\r\n\r\nFinally, on 7 July 1937, Schacht and Goering signed an agreement of\r\nreconciliation in Berlin, wherein it was said that the tasks of Goering\r\nand Schacht “are being solved in closest mutual cooperation,” and that\r\n“no doubt exists about the fact that the Commissioner General for War\r\nEconomy has the position of a supreme authority of the Reich”\r\n(_EC-384_).\r\n\r\nSchacht resumed his duties as General Plenipotentiary with renewed\r\nvigor. On the day following his formal agreement with Goering, he wrote\r\nto General von Blomberg on “Measures for the preparation of the conduct\r\nof war,” pledging continued cooperation in their mutual endeavors:\r\n\r\n    “* * * by the direction of the supreme authority for the conduct\r\n    of war, the coordination of the conduct of war will be assured\r\n    in its execution through mutual agreement between you and me,\r\n    which I look upon as a matter of course in the Central Authority\r\n    and without which I cannot envisage any conduct of war. The\r\n    direction of the economy by the plenipotentiary would in that\r\n    event never ‘take place entirely independent from the rest of\r\n    the war mechanism’ but would be aimed at the accomplishment of\r\n    the political war purpose with the mustering of all economic\r\n    forces. I am entirely willing, therefore, to participate in this\r\n    way in the preparation of the forthcoming order giving effect to\r\n    the Reich Defense Act [_Reichsverteidigungsgesetz_].” (_EC-252_)\r\n\r\nHowever, Schacht and Goering were soon again in disagreement. After a\r\nsharp exchange of letters in which each sought to justify his particular\r\neconomic program as the best means of making possible the attainment of\r\nHitler’s objectives (_EC-497_; _EC-493_), Schacht suggested to Goering\r\nin a curt letter dated 26 August 1937, that he (Goering) assume sole\r\ncharge of economic policies. In this letter, Schacht rationalized his\r\nprecipitate action as follows:\r\n\r\n    “To me it does not seem to be of decisive importance to raise\r\n    questions of competence and initiative, but it is of decisive\r\n    importance that the Fuehrer’s economic policy should be carried\r\n    out in a coherent manner, and with the least amount of\r\n    friction.” (_EC-283_)\r\n\r\nDespite the uncompromising tenor of the latter communication, Schacht\r\nwas still amenable to an arrangement with Goering which would have\r\npermitted him a measure of autonomy in economic planning and preparation\r\nfor war. On 1 November 1937, he attended a conference with Goering\r\n\r\n    “* * * which led in an entirely friendly manner to the working\r\n    out of a series of proposals, which * * * Goering promised to\r\n    have presented to me [Schacht] in writing on the following day *\r\n    * * so that, after having reached an agreement we could present\r\n    a mutually approved text to you, my Fuehrer.” (_EC-495_)\r\n\r\nBut the written agreement was not forthcoming as Goering had promised,\r\nand Schacht repeated his request to be relieved from the Ministry of\r\nEconomics, “in the interest of a uniform government management”\r\n(_EC-495_). Hitler finally accepted Schacht’s resignation as Minister of\r\nEconomics on 26 November 1937, simultaneously appointing him Minister\r\nWithout Portfolio. Schacht’s resignation was also extended to his\r\nposition as Plenipotentiary for War Economy (_EC-494_).\r\n\r\nIn subsequent interrogations, both Schacht and Goering have confirmed\r\nthe fact that Schacht’s withdrawal was simply the result of a losing\r\nstruggle with Goering to retain personal power (_3730-PS_; _3728-PS_).\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to indicate that Schacht’s withdrawal from the Ministry\r\nof Economics and the Office of Plenipotentiary for War Economy in any\r\nsense represented a break with Hitler on the ground of contemplated\r\nmilitary aggression. He consented to retain his position as President of\r\nthe Reichsbank, where he remained undisputed master, and accepted the\r\npost of Minister of[without] Portfolio, in order to be Hitler’s\r\n“personal adviser.” In the letter accepting Schacht’s resignation as\r\nMinister of Economics, Hitler said:\r\n\r\n    “If I accede to your wish it is with the expression of deepest\r\n    gratitude for your so excellent achievements and in the happy\r\n    consciousness that, as President of the Reichsbank Directorium,\r\n    you will make available for the German people and me for many\r\n    years more your outstanding knowledge and ability and your\r\n    untiring working strength. Delighted at the fact that in the\r\n    future, also, you are willing to be my personal adviser, I\r\n    appoint you as of today a Reich Minister.” (_L-104_).\r\n\r\nAs President of the Reichsbank, Schacht continued to carry out Hitler’s\r\npolicies. As previously shown, he participated in the planning of the\r\ninvasion of Austria by fixing the conversion rate of the Austrian\r\nSchilling in advance of the invasion; and under his direction, the\r\nAustrian National Bank was merged into the Reichsbank. He publicly\r\napproved the absorption of Austria and the acquisition of the\r\nSudetenland. He continued to finance armaments by “mefo” bill credits\r\nuntil April 1938, and thereafter, until his resignation in January 1939,\r\nauthorized an increase of approximately 2.6 billion Reichsmarks in bank\r\nnotes in order to discount commercial paper which was used in connection\r\nwith the armament program. (_EC-438_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Schacht’s dismissal from the Presidency of the Reichsbank._ Schacht\r\nwas dismissed from the Presidency of the Reichsbank in January 1939. The\r\nevidence indicates that Schacht engineered his dismissal in order to\r\nescape personal responsibility for what he believed to be an impending\r\nfinancial crisis; he was not dismissed because of disagreement with the\r\nultimate objectives of the conspiracy or common plan.\r\n\r\nSchacht had always feared an inflation in Germany. As early as May 1936,\r\nhe emphatically stated that he would “never be party to an inflation”\r\n(_1301-PS_). In January 1939, Schacht was convinced that ruinous\r\ninflation was, in fact, imminent (_EC-369_). There was, it appears,\r\nample basis for his fear. The Finance Minister, von Krosigk, had already\r\nrecognized the situation in September 1938, and had written to Hitler\r\nwarning that\r\n\r\n    “* * * we are steering towards a serious financial crisis, the\r\n    forebodings of which have led already abroad to detailed\r\n    discussions of this weak side in our economic preparations and\r\n    to an apprehensive loss of confidence domestically.” (_EC-419_)\r\n\r\nSchacht was not only afraid of a financial crisis; he was even more\r\nfearful that he personally would be held responsible for it and his\r\nprestige would suffer a crushing blow. One of his associates at the\r\nReichsbank has stated:\r\n\r\n    “When Schacht saw that the risky situation which he had\r\n    sponsored was becoming insoluble, he was more and more anxious\r\n    to get out. This desire to get out of a bad situation was for a\r\n    long time the ‘leitmotif’ of Schacht’s conversations with the\r\n    directors of the bank.” (_EC-438_)\r\n\r\nIn the end, Schacht deliberately stimulated his dismissal from the\r\nPresidency of the Reichsbank by arbitrarily refusing an end-of-the-month\r\nloan in a relatively small amount to the Reich, contrary to well\r\nestablished practice (_3730-PS_; _3731-PS_).\r\n\r\nDespite differences of opinion concerning the limits to which the German\r\neconomy might be pushed without plunging the country into inflation,\r\nSchacht continued to enjoy Hitler’s confidence. In his letter to Schacht\r\ndated 19 January 1939, Hitler stated:\r\n\r\n    “On the occasion of your recall from Office as President of the\r\n    Reichsbank Directory, I take the opportunity to express to you\r\n    my most sincere and warmest gratitude for the services which you\r\n    rendered repeatedly to Germany and to me personally in this\r\n    capacity during long and difficult years. Your name, above all,\r\n    will always be connected with the first epoch of the national\r\n    rearmament. I am happy to be able to avail myself of your\r\n    services for the solution of new tasks in your position as Reich\r\n    Minister.” (_EC-397_).\r\n\r\nOn his side, Schacht evidenced his abiding faith in Hitler and his\r\ncontinued agreement with his aggressive policies, by remaining as\r\nMinister without Portfolio until January 1943. As such he received a\r\nlarge salary from the Nazi Government and enjoyed the emoluments of\r\npublic office (_3724-PS_).\r\n\r\n(3) _Conclusion._ Schacht’s assistance in the earlier phase of the\r\nconspiracy was an important factor in enabling the conspirators to seize\r\nthe German state and thus pave the way for their later crimes. His work\r\nwas indispensable to the rearmament of Germany and to the economic\r\nplanning and preparation required to launch the German wars of\r\naggression. As long as he remained in power, he worked as eagerly for\r\nthe preparation of aggressive war as any of his co-conspirators. He\r\npersonally was favorably disposed towards aggression, if “Lebensraum”\r\nfor Germany could not otherwise be attained. He knew that Hitler\r\nintended to and would break the peace, and with this knowledge, he\r\nwillingly and purposely contributed his efforts. His withdrawal from\r\nthree of his four posts reflected no moral feeling against the use of\r\naggressive warfare as an instrument of national policy; he withdrew for\r\nreasons wholly unrelated to Hitler’s program of illegal aggression. By\r\nthe time of his withdrawal from these three positions, he had already\r\nprovided his co-conspirators with the physical means and economic\r\nplanning necessary to launch and maintain their wars of aggression; and\r\nhe continued in his lucrative fourth position (Minister without\r\nPortfolio) until January 1943—until, in short, it became doubtful\r\nwhether the conspirators could maintain the successes which they had\r\ngained in the wars they had illegally launched and were waging.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n   LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO HJALMAR SCHACHT\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 63\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

GUSTAV KRUPP von BOHLEN und HALBACH[1]\r\n\r\n   A. _IN FURTHERANCE OF THE NAZI CONSPIRACY, KRUPP CIRCUMVENTED THE\r\n RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES ON THE REARMAMENT OF\r\n GERMANY. AS THE RESPONSIBLE HEAD OF THE HUGE ARMAMENTS CONCERN, FRIED.\r\n KRUPP A.G., HE CONCEALED ITS ARMAMENT ACTIVITY IN ORDER TO DECEIVE THE\r\n  ALLIED GOVERNMENTS. HE WAS, THEREFORE, IN A POSITION TO PROMOTE THE\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE CONSPIRACY BY THE RAPID PRODUCTION OF MUNITIONS OF WAR\r\n      ON A HUGE SCALE AFTER THE CONSPIRATORS’ ACCESSION TO POWER._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] Since the name of Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach was severed\r\nfrom the Nurnberg trial which commenced on 20 November 1945, the trial\r\nbrief outlining the case against Krupp, which was prepared before his\r\nseverance, was not presented to the Tribunal. Despite his personal\r\nabsence from the prisoners’ dock, however, Krupp remained technically\r\nstill under indictment and liable to prosecution in subsequent\r\nproceedings. Moreover, Krupp was still regarded by the prosecution as a\r\nmember of the Nazi conspiracy. The following summary of evidence,\r\nadapted from the trial brief, is included here in order to show the role\r\nplayed by Krupp as co-conspirator.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn an article entitled “Manager and Armament Worker” written for the 1\r\nMarch 1942 issue of the Krupp magazine, Krupp stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * I knew German history well, and out of my experiences in\r\n    the rest of the world I believed to know the German kind;\r\n    therefore I never doubted that, although for the time being all\r\n    indications were against it, one day a change would come. How, I\r\n    never knew or asked, but I believed in it. But with this\r\n    knowledge—and today I may speak about these things and for the\r\n    first time I am doing this extensively and publicly—with this,\r\n    as responsible head of the Krupp works, consequences of the\r\n    greatest importance had to be taken. If Germany should ever be\r\n    reborn, if it should shake off the chains of Versailles one day,\r\n    the Krupp concern had to be prepared again. * * *”\r\n\r\n    “* * * I wanted and had to maintain Krupp, in spite of all\r\n    opposition, as an armament plant for the later future, even if\r\n    in camouflaged form. I could only speak in the smallest, most\r\n    intimate circles about the real reasons which made me undertake\r\n    the changeover of the plants for certain lines of production for\r\n    I had to expect that many people would not understand me. * * *”\r\n\r\n    “Without arousing any commotion, the necessary measures and\r\n    preparations were undertaken. Thus to the surprise of many\r\n    people Krupp began to manufacture goods which really appeared to\r\n    be far distant from the former work of an armament plant. Even\r\n    the Allied snooping commissions were duped. Padlocks, milk cans,\r\n    cash registers, track repair machines, trash carts and similar\r\n    ‘small junk’ appeared really unsuspicious and even locomotives\r\n    and automobiles made an entirely ‘civilian’ impression.\r\n\r\n    “After the accession to power of Adolf Hitler I had the\r\n    satisfaction of being able to report to the Fuehrer that Krupps\r\n    stood ready, after a short warming-up period, to begin the\r\n    rearmament of the German people without any gaps of\r\n    experience,—the blood of the comrades of KAR. Saturday 1923 had\r\n    not been shed in vain. Since that time I was often permitted to\r\n    accompany the Fuehrer through the old and new workshops and to\r\n    experience how the workers of Krupp cheered him in gratitude. In\r\n    the years after 1933 we worked with an incredible intensity and\r\n    when the war did break out the speed and results were again\r\n    increased. We are all proud of having thus contributed to the\r\n    heretofore magnificent successes of our army.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I have always considered it to be an honour as well as an\r\n    obligation to be the head of an arms factory and I know that the\r\n    employees of Krupp share these feelings. Thanks to the\r\n    educational work of the National Socialist Government this is\r\n    the case all over Germany. I know that the things I have said\r\n    here about the armament worker in particular hold true for every\r\n    German worker. With these men and women who work for the cause\r\n    with all their hearts, with cool heads and skilled hands we will\r\n    master every fate.” (_D-94_; see _D-64_).\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum of a conference held on 9 December 1942, concerning the\r\nproposed publication of a book dealing with Krupp’s armament activities,\r\nVon Bulow, confidential secretary to Krupp, wrote:\r\n\r\n    “For the period of transition from 1919 up to rearmament, A. K.\r\n    [Krupp] had undertaken various tasks in order to keep up the\r\n    Company’s activity in the field of artillery, in the sense of\r\n    observing activities in that field in the rest of the world\r\n    (relation: BOFORS) and then also for the production of artillery\r\n    material, within and to a certain extent also beyond, the\r\n    limitation established by the peace dictate.” (_D-249_).\r\n\r\n     B. _AFTER THE CONSPIRATORS’ ACCESSION TO POWER, KRUPP LENT HIS\r\nINFLUENCE, PRESTIGE, AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF THEIR\r\n                    CONTROL OVER THE GERMAN STATE._\r\n\r\n(1) With knowledge of the aims and purposes of the Nazi conspiracy, he\r\nsought to reorganize the Reich Association of German Industry, of which\r\nhe was Chairman, so as to bring it into line with the aims of the\r\nconspirators and to make it an effective instrument for the execution of\r\ntheir policies.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Upon the invitation of Goering (_D-201_), Krupp attended a meeting\r\nin Berlin on 20 February 1933, during which Hitler, in a speech to a\r\nselect group of industrialists, announced the conspirators’ aims to\r\nseize totalitarian control over Germany, to destroy the parliamentary\r\nsystem, to crush all opposition by force, and to restore the power of\r\nthe _Wehrmacht_. In the course of this speech, Hitler stated:\r\n\r\n    “Private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of\r\n    Democracy; it is conceivable only if the people have a sound\r\n    idea of authority and personality. * * * Life always tears up\r\n    humanity. It is therefore the noblest task of a Leader to find\r\n    ideals that are stronger than the factors that pull the people\r\n    apart. I recognized even while in the hospital that one had to\r\n    search for new ideas conducive to reconstruction. I found them\r\n    in Nationalism, in the value of personality, in the denial of\r\n    reconciliation between nations, in the strength and power of\r\n    individual personality. * * * If one rejects pacifism, one must\r\n    put a new idea in its place immediately. Everything must be\r\n    pushed aside, must be replaced by something better.”\r\n\r\n    “* * * We must not forget that all the benefits of culture must\r\n    be introduced more or less with an iron fist, just as once upon\r\n    a time the farmers were forced to plant potatoes. For all this,\r\n    however, courage, and iron will and perseverance are essential.”\r\n\r\n    “* * * With the very same courage with which we go to work to\r\n    make up for what had been sinned during the last 14 years, we\r\n    have withstood all attempts to move us off the right way. We\r\n    have turned down the favour (benevolence) of the Catholic Centre\r\n    Party [_Zentrum_] to tolerate us. Hugemberg has too small a\r\n    movement. He has only considerably slowed down our development.\r\n    We must first gain complete power if we want to crush the other\r\n    side completely. While still gaining power one should not start\r\n    the struggle against the opponent. Only when one knows that one\r\n    has reached the pinnacle of power, that there is no further\r\n    possible upward development, shall one strike. * * *”\r\n\r\n    “Now we stand before the last election. Regardless of the\r\n    outcome there will be no retreat, even if the coming election\r\n    does not bring about a decision. One way or another, if the\r\n    election does not decide, the decision must be brought about\r\n    even by other means. I have intervened in order to give the\r\n    people once more the chance to decide their fate by themselves.\r\n    This determination is a strong asset for whatever must possibly\r\n    happen later. Does the election bring no result, well, Germany\r\n    won’t go to ruin. Today, as never before, everyone is under the\r\n    obligation to pledge himself to success. The necessity to make\r\n    sacrifices has never been greater than now. For Economy I have\r\n    the one wish that it go parallel with the internal structure to\r\n    meet a calm future. The question of restoration of the Wehrmacht\r\n    will not be decided at Geneva, but in Germany, when we have\r\n    gained internal strength through internal peace. * * * There are\r\n    only two possibilities, either to crowd back the opponent on\r\n    constitutional grounds, and for this purpose once more this\r\n    election or a struggle will be conducted with other weapons,\r\n    which may demand greater sacrifices. I would like to see them\r\n    avoided. I hope the German people thus recognize the greatness\r\n    of the hour. It shall decide over the next 10 or probably even\r\n    100 years. It will become a turning point in German history, to\r\n    which I pledge myself with glowing energy.” (_D-203_).\r\n\r\nAt this same meeting, Goering declared that the impending election of 5\r\nMarch 1933 would certainly be the last one for the next 10 years, and\r\nprobably even for the next 100 years (_D-203_).\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum dated 22 February 1933 describing this meeting, Krupp\r\nwrote that he had expressed to Hitler the gratitude of approximately 25\r\nindustrialists present for the clear expression of his views and\r\nemphasized, on behalf of all present, that it was time to clarify the\r\npolitical situation in Germany (_D-204_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) On 25 April 1933, Krupp, as Chairman of the Reich Association of\r\nGerman Industry (_Reichsverbandes der Deutschen Industrie_) submitted to\r\nHitler his plan for the reorganization of German industry and in\r\nconnection therewith, undertook to bring the Association into line with\r\nthe aims of the conspirators and to make it an effective instrument for\r\nthe execution of their policies.\r\n\r\n    _1._ In the letter of transmittal, Krupp stated that his plan of\r\n    reorganization was characterized by the desire to coordinate\r\n    “economic measures and political necessity, adopting the\r\n    Fuehrer’s conception of the New German State” (_D-157_).\r\n\r\n    _2._ In the plan of reorganization itself Krupp stated:\r\n\r\n        “The turn of political events is in line with the wishes\r\n        which I myself and the Board of Directors have cherished\r\n        for a long time. I am convinced that, under the threat\r\n        of the impoverishment of our people, the machinery of\r\n        government must be simplified to the utmost. For the\r\n        same reason I did not fail to recognize a long time ago\r\n        the necessity of rationalizing our economic system.\r\n\r\n        “Convinced that the opportunity of the hour must not be\r\n        missed to obtain the best for our economic system, I am\r\n        employing the authority bestowed upon me by the\r\n        Presiding Council to carry out a double task:—\r\n\r\n        1. In the negotiations with the Reichschancellor and his\r\n        representatives I shall make it my goal to coordinate,\r\n        in the field of organization of industrial associations,\r\n        the economically reasonable with the politically\r\n        necessary.\r\n\r\n        2. In reorganizing the Reich Association of German\r\n        Industry I shall be guided by the idea of bringing the\r\n        new organization into agreement with the political aims\r\n        of the Reich Government and at the same time to make it\r\n        so rational and forceful that it can be an effective\r\n        instrument of industrial enterprise, according to the\r\n        relative importance of the industry.” (_D-157_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) In a speech delivered on 18 October 1933, on the occasion of the\r\nfirst meeting of the Committee for Industrial and Social policy of the\r\nReich Association of German Industry, Krupp reaffirmed his aim to bring\r\nthe Association into complete accord with the political goals of the\r\nNazi government and stated, _inter alia_:\r\n\r\n    “* * * To have united the purposes of an entire Nation, is the\r\n    great historical achievement of the man in whose strong hands\r\n    our President has placed the fate of our people. When\r\n    Reichschancellor and Fuehrer Adolf Hitler called the General\r\n    Council of Economy together for the first time on the 20th of\r\n    September, I had the honor to thank him for the confidence which\r\n    he had put in the men of the practical business world by calling\r\n    them to the General Council. I pledged to him unrestrained\r\n    support in his Government in its exceedingly difficult task from\r\n    all branches and organizations of Economy.\r\n\r\n    “I may repeat now what I said then: ‘The unshakable faith of our\r\n    Reichschancellor and Fuehrer in the future of our people gives\r\n    also to the men of business the courage and the strength to put\r\n    everything in the reconstruction of a healthy National Economy\r\n    in a strong National State under National Socialist leadership’.\r\n\r\n    “You, too, gentlemen, if I am certain of your confidence, are\r\n    bound to this pledge. It holds in itself, for all of us, the\r\n    deeply felt obligation to be the guarantors for the\r\n    unconditional execution of the Fuehrer’s will in all links and\r\n    branches of Industry. May the spirit of devotion to duty which\r\n    inspires us always dominate this Committee’s conferences!\r\n\r\n    “I ask you, gentlemen, to rise and to join me in the toast: To\r\n    the venerable President of the German Reich, General\r\n    Fieldmarshal Von Hindenburg and the German People’s Chancellor\r\n    and Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler: ‘_Sieg Heil_’.” (_D-353_).\r\n\r\n(2) Krupp organized, sponsored, and made substantial financial\r\ncontributions to the Hitler Fund (_Hitler Spende_), with knowledge that\r\nthe funds were to be used to further the objectives of the SA and SS.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In a letter to Schacht dated 30 May 1933, Krupp wrote:\r\n\r\n    “As Dr. Hoettgen and I had the opportunity of mentioning to you\r\n    yesterday, it is proposed to initiate a collection in the most\r\n    far-reaching circles of German industry, including agriculture\r\n    and the banking world, which is to be put at the disposal of the\r\n    Fuehrer of the NSDAP in the name of ‘The Hitler Fund’, which\r\n    would replace collections in many cases separately organized of\r\n    the various NSDAP organizations and the Stahlhelm. It has been\r\n    decided to appoint a management council for this central\r\n    collection; I have accepted the chairmanship of the management\r\n    council at the unanimous request of the principal federations,\r\n    inspired by the wish to collaborate with my full strength in\r\n    this task which is to be a symbol of gratitude to the Fuehrer of\r\n    the nation.” (_D-151_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) A circular written by Hess in August 1933, which was found among\r\nKrupp’s files, specifically states that one of the purposes of the\r\nHitler Fund is “to put at the disposal of the Reich leadership the funds\r\nrequired for the unified execution of the tasks which fall to the lot of\r\nthe SA, SS, ST, HJ, political organizations etc.” (_D-151_).\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated 15 August 1934, from Lutze, Chief of Staff of the SA,\r\nwhich was found among Krupp’s papers, authority was granted, with the\r\napproval of the Deputy Fuehrer, to Gauleiter Terboven to use a special\r\npart of the year’s Hitler Fund in the interest of the SA in the Ruhr\r\ndistrict (_D-368_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) From the inception of the Hitler Fund until the collapse of\r\nGermany, the Fried. Krupp Cast Steel Works in Essen (main company in the\r\nKrupp organization) alone contributed 4,738,446 marks to that fund\r\n(_D-325_; the above figure is the total amount shown on the chart, not\r\nhere reproduced[2]). This assistance to the Hitler Fund was supplemented\r\nby large contributions made by the other Krupp companies.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[2] This and subsequent similar charts have been omitted from this\r\npublication because of their length and complexity, and the relative\r\nunimportance of the issue for which they have been cited.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(3) Krupp, both privately and through the Krupp firm, made substantial\r\ncontributions to the Nazi Party and affiliated organizations.\r\n\r\n(_a_) For contributions by Fried. Krupp Cast Steel Works in Essen, see\r\n_D-325_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In June 1935, Krupp contributed 100,000 marks to the Nazi Party\r\nout of his personal account (_D-332_; _D-373_).\r\n\r\n(4) In numerous public addresses, Krupp supported the measures adopted\r\nby the conspirators in the execution of their program.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In a speech urging every German to approve Germany’s withdrawal\r\nfrom the disarmament conference and the League of Nations, Krupp said:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Just as the 5th of March brought about the change from\r\n    chaos to order, from disgrace to honor in domestic policy so, on\r\n    November 12, the unanimous “Yes” of the German people concerning\r\n    the foreign policy of the Reich Government, shall and must give\r\n    ample proof to the entire world that every citizen who is worthy\r\n    of the German name, stands unconditionally behind the Reich\r\n    Government as led by the Reich Chancellor, and its foreign\r\n    policy which is dictated by the commandment of self-respect.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * When the radio broadcasts the results of the People’s\r\n    Election on the evening of November 12, the entire world must\r\n    know that: Germany stands in the camp of Adolf Hitler.”\r\n    (_D-393_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) In a speech delivered on 26 January 1934, Krupp expressed approval\r\nof the leadership principle in industrial relations, under which the\r\nentrepreneur became the leader and the workers became his followers. In\r\nthe course of this speech he said:\r\n\r\n    “National-Socialism has liberated the German worker from the\r\n    clutches of a doctrine which was basically hostile both for\r\n    employer and employee. Adolf Hitler has returned the worker to\r\n    his nation; he has made of him a disciplined soldier of labor\r\n    and therefore our comrade. When, on the other hand, the new\r\n    State awards to the enterpriser the role of leader in economy\r\n    and labor, then we know that: Leadership has obligation!\r\n\r\n    “The enterpriser and his leading officers are the trustees for\r\n    the material welfare of our people.” (_D-392_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) In a speech delivered on 10 August 1934, in connection with the\r\nplebiscite to approve Hitler’s dual appointment as president and\r\nchancellor after Hindenburg’s death, Krupp said:\r\n\r\n    “Let us all follow him now also, our Leader, our Reich—and\r\n    People’s Chancellor.\r\n\r\n    “In an exceptionally short time he has eliminated the quarrel\r\n    between parties, has guaranteed unity to the Reich and has\r\n    assured to every German pride to work, has brought the\r\n    opportunity for work to the near future. On 19 August all our\r\n    votes borne of deep trust and proven confidence shall go to the\r\n    man acclaimed by those hearts of many thousands and millions who\r\n    cannot, because of their age, go to the polls but who daily join\r\n    us, who are permitted to vote, in the Cry:\r\n\r\n                                          Heil Hitler!” (_D-386_).\r\n\r\n(_d_) In a speech dated 27 October 1935, Krupp stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Our thoughts fly therefore by themselves in this festive\r\n    hour of our plant community, to the man whom we thank for the\r\n    resurrection of our Nation: Adolf Hitler, the patron of German\r\n    labour and German art. Unanimously we will confess and pledge\r\n    ourselves to stand behind the Fuehrer and his movement today and\r\n    forever and thereby to be of service to the idea of eternal\r\n    Germany.” (_D-385_)\r\n\r\n(_e_) In a speech dated 1 May 1936, after the Nazis had reoccupied and\r\nfortified the Rhineland, Krupp stated:\r\n\r\n    “No greater recognition, no greater incentive to further common\r\n    work accomplishment could have been given us than was done\r\n    through the visit of our Fuehrer on March 27th of this year to\r\n    our works and through his addresses from here. * * *”\r\n\r\n    “Never has a statesman fought for the soul of his people and for\r\n    its well-being with such faith, such ardor, such endurance.

We shall be thankful to fate that we\r\n    were and are permitted to be eye and action witnesses of the\r\n    great turning point in our German history, and we shall thank\r\n    especially the divine destiny that it has presented us with a\r\n    man like Adolf Hitler. Let us then combine all that which moves\r\n    our hearts upon mention of this name into the cry: Our people\r\n    and fatherland and its great Fuehrer Adolf Hitler\r\n\r\n                                         _Sieg Heil!_” (_D-291_).\r\n\r\n     C. _UNDER KRUPP’S DIRECTION, THE KRUPP FIRM, BY DEVELOPING NEW\r\n   INSTRUMENTS OF WAR AND PRODUCING HUGE QUANTITIES OF WAR MATERIALS,\r\n   FURTHERED THE CONSPIRATORS’ PROGRAM TO CREATE A POWERFUL MILITARY\r\n                              POTENTIAL._\r\n\r\n(1) In a speech prepared in January 1944, for delivery at the University\r\nof Berlin, Krupp stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * I don’t see why this thought still flutters in many a\r\n    head occasionally—that the production of war materials should\r\n    be a sinister trade! No: war material is life-saving for one’s\r\n    own people and whoever works and performs in these spheres can\r\n    be proud of it; here enterprise as a whole finds its highest\r\n    justification of existence. This justification—I may inject\r\n    this here—crystallized especially during that time of the\r\n    ‘Interregnum’, between 1919 and 1933, when Germany was\r\n    lying-down disarmed. * * * It is the one great merit of the\r\n    entire German war economy that it did not remain idle during\r\n    those bad years, even though its activity could not be brought\r\n    to light for obvious reasons. Through years of secret work,\r\n    scientific and basic ground work was laid, in order to be ready\r\n    again to work the German Armed Forces at the appointed hour,\r\n    without loss of time or experience.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Only through this secret activity of German enterprise,\r\n    together with the experience gained meanwhile through production\r\n    of peace time goods was it possible after 1933, to fall into\r\n    step with the new tasks arrived at restoring Germany’s military\r\n    power, (only through all that) could the entirely new and\r\n    various problems, brought up by the Fuehrer’s Four Year’s Plan\r\n    for German enterprise, be mastered. * * *” (_D-317_)\r\n\r\n(2) Krupp played a leading role in the design and production of new\r\nweapons for the German armed forces.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In a memorandum concerning a conference held at the Federal\r\nMinistry for National Defense in Vienna on 25 September 1936, Pfirsch, a\r\nKrupp official, wrote:\r\n\r\n    “* * * in spite of the obstacles put in our way by the Treaty of\r\n    Versailles, we had never been inactive throughout the postwar\r\n    period, but had drawn upon the experience of the war in the\r\n    creation of new types, and that we had won the prizes for almost\r\n    every type in the competitions organized by our War Ministry for\r\n    the construction of new artillery weapons, so much so that the\r\n    guns introduced into the German Army of to-day, such as the 8.8\r\n    cm. anti-aircraft, the 10.5 cm. field gun, the heavy field\r\n    howitzer and beyond them the larger calibres have been made\r\n    according to our pattern.” (_D-152_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) In a memorandum dated 21 February 1944, Woelfert, a department\r\nchief in the Krupp concern, wrote:\r\n\r\n    “First a few facts about the development of tanks by Krupp. We\r\n    are manufacturing tanks since 1928, which means before\r\n    rearmament. We started studying on heavy tractors. Krupp built\r\n    the first mass production tank, the Panzer I, which is also\r\n    known as LaS. It was shown in public in 1935, the year when\r\n    rearmament started, and made a great impression. We also\r\n    originated the Panzer IV, or better the BW, which was especially\r\n    at the beginning of the war one of the prime factors in our\r\n    rapid advances into enemy country, so that today we are fighting\r\n    on the Atlantic coast, in the South, and east and not on German\r\n    soil. Even today we use the BW-base for many self-propelled\r\n    guns, assault-guns, anti-aircraft guns etc.” (_D-96_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) In a letter to Hitler dated 24 July 1942, Krupp wrote:\r\n\r\n    “My Fuehrer!\r\n\r\n    “The big weapon, whose manufacturing is to be thanked to your\r\n    command, has now proved its effectiveness. * * *”\r\n\r\n    “True to an example set by Alfred Krupp in 1870, my wife and\r\n    myself ask the favour that the Krupp works refrain from charging\r\n    for this first finished product.\r\n\r\n    “To express my thanks to you, my Fuehrer, for the confidence\r\n    shown in our plants and in us personally by entrusting such an\r\n    order with us, is a pleasant duty for my wife and myself.\r\n\r\n                                         _Sieg Heil!_” (_D-375_).\r\n\r\n(_d_) Krupp likewise made significant contributions to the production of\r\nNavy weapons and U-Boats (_D-88_; _D-287_).\r\n\r\n(3) The rapid and progressive expansion in armament production by Krupp\r\nafter the conspirators’ accession to power is plainly shown by a chart\r\nprepared by Krupp officials concerning the production of war materials\r\nat the _Krupp Gustahlfabrik_ in Essen (only one of the many companies in\r\nthe Krupp organization). This chart shows that the production of war\r\nmaterials at that particular factory during the fiscal year, 1 October\r\n1933 to 30 September 1934, was more than twice that of any previous year\r\nsince 1929; that such production during the fiscal year, 1 October 1934\r\nto 30 September 1935, was almost twice as great as the previous year;\r\nand that production of war materials continued thereafter at an\r\naccelerated rate with the result that during the fiscal year, 1 October\r\n1938 to 30 September 1939, it was more than 10 times as great as it was\r\nduring the period 1 October 1932 to 30 September 1933 (Chart entitled\r\n“Fried. Krupp Gustahlfabrik Essen, Turnover in War Material,” not\r\nreproduced here). It should be noted that this chart shows only direct\r\nsales by the Essen factory of war materials to the German Armed Forces\r\nOrdnance Supply Department and sales to foreign countries of war\r\nmaterials easily recognizable as such. It does not cover indirect sales,\r\nviz: the sale of products to other concerns which, in turn, used them to\r\nproduce materials of war. (The chart entitled “Fried. Krupp and Branch\r\nEstablishments, Inland Turnover,” not here reproduced, shows figures\r\nwhich include “indirect” sales of war materials by certain Krupp\r\ncompanies.)\r\n\r\nD. _KRUPP GOVERNED THE EXPORTS OF HIS FIRM IN THE LIGHT OF THE MILITARY\r\n REQUIREMENTS OF THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS AND THE ACCEPTED AND DISCHARGED\r\n    IMPORTANT ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES IN FURTHERANCE OF THE\r\n        CONSPIRATORS’ PROGRAM OF ECONOMIC MOBILIZATION FOR WAR._\r\n\r\n(1) In a “strictly confidential” memorandum dated 25 March 1941, the\r\nfollowing was reported:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The liberation of the Reich from the shackles of\r\n    Versailles enabled Krupp to recommence the export of armaments.\r\n    The German Government had, in fact, pressed for the matter.\r\n    Military-political and Military-economic reasons were the cause.\r\n    Krupp desired to come into the closest contact with the armament\r\n    exports, so as to further the development of arms * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * By using all the forces at his [Krupp’s] disposal and\r\n    regardless of effort, costs and risk, considerable export\r\n    contracts were secured, which served to obtain foreign currency\r\n    or raw materials, and were, at the same time, politically\r\n    desirable. * * *” (_D-191_)\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum dated 23 June 1937, concerning a Bulgarian order for\r\narmour plating which was discussed with German Army representatives,\r\nReiff, a Krupp official, wrote:\r\n\r\n    “Major Olbrich showed himself aware quite evidently of the\r\n    deeper reasons existing why Germany was anxious that this order\r\n    should be booked. * * *” (_D-154_)\r\n\r\n(2) At the request of the Inspector of War Production, Krupp became a\r\nLeader of War Production in 1937, and was charged with the\r\nresponsibility of preparing and carrying out the mobilization of the\r\narmament industry and of directing it in time of war.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In a “strictly confidential” letter dated 21 January 1937, the\r\nInspector of War Production wrote to Krupp:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Minister for War and the Supreme Commander of the\r\n    Armed Forces has ordered that a Corps of Economic Leaders of War\r\n    Production be recruited with immediate effect.\r\n\r\n    “The Economic Leaders of War Production in collaboration with\r\n    the Armed Forces, are to be responsible for the preparing and\r\n    carrying out of the mobilization of the armament industry and\r\n    for directing it in time of war.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “A selected small circle of these persons is to act in an\r\n    advisory capacity to the Armed Forces in all important economic\r\n    questions both during peace and war.\r\n\r\n    “Subject to your approval, I intend to propose to the Reich\r\n    Minister for War that you should be nominated as Economic Leader\r\n    for War Production.” (_D-62_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) In connection with his acceptance of the position of Leader of War\r\nProduction, Krupp submitted a “secret” document entitled, “Declaration\r\nof Political Attitude,” dated 6 February 1937, in which he stated:\r\n\r\n    “I herewith declare that I stand by the National Socialist\r\n    conception of the State without reserve and that I have not been\r\n    active in any way against the interests of the people.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I am aware that should I say or do anything which constitutes\r\n    an attack against the National Socialist conception of the\r\n    State, I must expect, in addition to legal proceedings, my\r\n    dismissal from the post of Economic Leader of War Production.”\r\n    (_D-63_).\r\n\r\n   E. _KRUPP SUPPORTED THE CONSPIRATORS’ PROPAGANDA PROGRAM; LENT HIS\r\n ORGANIZATION TO THE DISSEMINATION OF NAZI PROPAGANDA ABROAD; AND USED\r\n  HIS EMPLOYEES IN ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES IN FURTHERANCE OF THE AIMS AND\r\n                   PURPOSES OF THE NAZI CONSPIRACY._\r\n\r\n(1) In April 1933, Krupp contributed 20,000 marks to Rosenberg for the\r\npurpose of counteracting anti-Nazi propaganda abroad. In a letter to\r\nKrupp dated 26 April 1933, Rosenberg said:\r\n\r\n    “Once more my most cordial thanks for not having shunned the\r\n    inconvenience of the journey in order to participate at\r\n    yesterday’s intimate conference.

With\r\n    the present lively activity of the ‘Secret Service’ it must be\r\n    avoided, not only in the interest of our Firm but also in the\r\n    interest of Germany as a whole, that our agents in neutral\r\n    foreign countries would come through improper handling to the\r\n    attention of the ‘Secret Service’ and economically ruined by it\r\n    within a short time.\r\n\r\n    “* * * If additional distributions of propaganda literature were\r\n    desired, a propaganda-leaflet should be sent to us, and after\r\n    examining it, we would advise the official Bureau what quantity\r\n    of such printed matter could be mailed abroad through us, at our\r\n    expense, as heretofore.” (_D-206_)\r\n\r\n(3) In a memorandum dated 14 October 1937, concerning a visit by Menzel\r\nof the Intelligence Office of the Combined Services Ministry,\r\nSonnenberg, a Krupp official, wrote:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Menzel asked for intelligence on foreign armaments (but\r\n    not including matters published in newspapers) received by Krupp\r\n    from their agents abroad and through other channels to be passed\r\n    on to Combined Services Intelligence [Abwehrabteilung des RKM.].\r\n    * * *”\r\n\r\n    “On our part we undertook to supply information to the Combined\r\n    Ministry [RKM] as required.” (_D-167_)\r\n\r\nThe results of a later visit by Menzel, in the company of _Kapitaen zur\r\nSee_ Globig, of the Information Department, Naval Armaments Branch, are\r\nreported in a memorandum dated 25 June 1939 by Dr. Conn, a Krupp\r\nofficial. In the course of this memorandum, which is entitled\r\n“Intelligence and Information,” Dr. Conn stated:\r\n\r\n    “1. _Kapitaen zur See_ Globig whom I had known for a long time,\r\n    spoke to me quite frankly and openly. It is therefore impossible\r\n    to embody parts of our discussion in this report.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Similarly to Kapitaen zur See Globig he [Menzel] stressed the\r\n    point that in view of the progressive disappearance of public\r\n    and easily accessible sources of information, the information\r\n    obtained through our representatives abroad was of increasing\r\n    value. This method of obtaining intelligence would have to be\r\n    followed up much more drastically than in the past.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “His [Menzel’s] third point was a request to utilize foreign\r\n    visitors for obtaining intelligence.

Menzel explained that Intelligence was only a collating\r\n    centre and that they were merely passing on information, the\r\n    value of which they were unable to judge by themselves, to the\r\n    departments concerned; any information for us would therefore\r\n    have to come from those departments only. Exceptions were only\r\n    made in the case of intelligence of universal importance such as\r\n    e.g. the long range gun [_Ferngeschuetz_] some time ago.”\r\n\r\n    “This remark is important concerning the way in which we should\r\n    present our information at Berlin. The departments receiving the\r\n    information through Intelligence, must be able to see that it\r\n    originates from Krupp, so that they might feel themselves under\r\n    obligation to let us have some information in return.” (_D-167_)\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum marked “secret,” relating to foreign anti-aircraft guns,\r\nSonnenberg wrote on 8 May 1939:\r\n\r\n    “I have gained the impression that from no other side do the\r\n    respective Army departments get such far reaching support in\r\n    their investigation of foreign armaments as from Fr.

We\r\n    are still under the lasting impression of the mighty happenings\r\n    of the last four weeks; so are those of us who until a short\r\n    time ago were forced to wait impatiently for these developments\r\n    outside our State frontiers. To the fulfillment of century-old\r\n    dreams consciously arrived at, to the fulfillment of the\r\n    life-long wish of Adolf Hitler—thanks to his faith, thanks to\r\n    his determination, thanks to his heart, to him, our Fuehrer, a\r\n    threefold, deeply thankful,\r\n\r\n                                         _Sieg Heil_.” (_D-391_).\r\n\r\n(2) In a speech dated 7 April 1938, Krupp, in urging all Germans in the\r\nimpending election of 10 April to approve Hitler’s invasion of Austria,\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “Three more days separate us from the day of the Plebiscite to\r\n    which our Fuehrer calls us, from the Plebiscite concerning\r\n    Greater Germany, at the same time a Plebiscite in which the\r\n    proof of faith in our Fuehrer concerns every individual’s\r\n    conscience.\r\n\r\n    “Full with thanks for what Adolf Hitler has bestowed and secured\r\n    for the German people in little more than five years’ leadership\r\n    through internal and external peace he is worthy of the deepest\r\n    felt ‘Yes’ from everyone of us!\r\n\r\n    “To him, our Fuehrer and Chancellor a threefold\r\n\r\n                                          _Sieg Heil!_” (_D-387_)\r\n\r\n(3) In a speech delivered on 13 October 1938, on the occasion of\r\nHitler’s visit to the Krupp works after the Nazi occupation of the\r\nSudetenland, Krupp said:\r\n\r\n    “My Fuehrer,\r\n\r\n    “To be able to greet you at the Krupp Works, in our home, in the\r\n    name of my wife and my own, as well as in the name of those\r\n    close to me and also in that of the greater plant family, so\r\n    shortly after the world-shaking events of the last weeks, is a\r\n    great honour and a heart-felt joy to me.\r\n\r\n    “Perhaps no plant and no home can feel more deeply and more\r\n    gratefully than ours the changes in the last decades; none can\r\n    be more proudly conscious to be allowed to participate in the\r\n    mighty tasks set by you.\r\n\r\n    “Before us stands now the basic and undeniable world-encircling\r\n    success, in its total extent perhaps not fully grasped, which\r\n    your faith and strong will, your nerves and your initiative have\r\n    achieved.\r\n\r\n    “May no German ever forget how deeply gratitude therefore put us\r\n    under obligation, how proud we may be to be recognized once more\r\n    in the world as a free, equal, great German People.\r\n\r\n    “With the thanks of my family, of our plants, of our entire Ruhr\r\n    District filled with the urge to work, I must express united\r\n    gratitude, springing from a full warm heart, from the Sudeten\r\n    District which is now a part of the German Reich.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_Heil_ to Thee, my Fuehrer.” (_D-304_)\r\n\r\n(4) Shortly after the conspirators launched their aggression against\r\nPoland, Krupp stated to the workers in his plant:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer has made his decision, not lightheartedly but in\r\n    the consciousness of responsibility to his people, to the entire\r\n    future of the German Nation—we have all heard that in his\r\n    Reichstag speech last Friday.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “A hard struggle, perhaps hardly appreciated to its fullest\r\n    extent, lies before us. The entire German Nation must face this\r\n    test of fire in unshakable unity, young or old, man or woman,\r\n    everyone must and will do his duty at his post, do more than\r\n    just what his duty demands and devote his entire strength to the\r\n    task assigned to him. Therefore let us also, as Krupp Members,\r\n    remain determined. May God protect our Fuehrer and our people!”\r\n    (_D-363_)\r\n\r\n(5) In a speech dated 6 May 1941, commemorating the successes of the\r\nNazi aggression in the West, Krupp stated:\r\n\r\n    “The one who, like myself, had the chance to visit and\r\n    thoroughly inspect during the last weeks the fields where our\r\n    superb troops made the breakthrough in the West—\r\n\r\n    “who could hear on that occasion the roar of our Airforce\r\n    against England—\r\n\r\n    “who witnessed how our U-boats and speedboats distinguished\r\n    themselves against the remains of England’s sea-might—\r\n\r\n    “such a person is bound to be thankfully proud to be able to\r\n    contribute through his labours to assure to our fighters the\r\n    weapons which they need for their battle—\r\n\r\n    “such a person is and remains devotedly and respectfully\r\n    conscious that the nicest machines, the most effective\r\n    instruments mean little, no, nothing, without the complete\r\n    unselfish and trusting share of the individual, whose trust is\r\n    assured through his knowledge of, and his faith in, the genius\r\n    of his Fuehrer, who embodies the worth of the German people,\r\n    their honour and might. To him, our Fuehrer, we direct also in\r\n    this hour in the Spring month of May our thoughts, renew our\r\n    solemn oath, present our heartiest wishes and give thanks to\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n                            “Adolf Hitler—_Sieg Heil!_” (_D-390_)\r\n\r\n  G. _KRUPP AS HEAD OF THE KRUPP CONCERN, IN FURTHERANCE OF THE COMMON\r\n PLAN TO EXPLOIT THE PEOPLE OF OCCUPIED COUNTRIES AND PRISONERS OF WAR,\r\n WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPELLING PERSONS FORCIBLY DEPORTED FROM OCCUPIED\r\n COUNTRIES AND PRISONERS OF WAR TO WORK AGAINST THEIR WILL AND WITHOUT\r\n THEIR CONSENT IN THE MANUFACTURE OF ARMS AND MUNITIONS. THESE ACTS AND\r\n PRACTICES WERE CONTRARY TO ARTICLES 6 AND 52 OF THE HAGUE REGULATIONS,\r\n 1907, TO ARTICLE 31 OF THE PRISONERS OF WAR CONVENTION (GENEVA 1929),\r\n   THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF WAR, AND TO ARTICLES 6(b) AND 6(c) OF THE\r\n                               CHARTER._\r\n\r\n(1) Charts marked “secret” have been found which show the number and\r\nnationalities of prisoners of war and foreign workers employed in each\r\nof the workshops in the Fried. Krupp Cast Steel Works at Essen, for the\r\nperiod from December 1940 to 1 February 1945. These charts, when read in\r\nconjunction with an affidavit by a Krupp official concerning the\r\nmaterials produced in the various Essen workshops, reveal that French\r\nand Russian prisoners of war and slave laborers from virtually every\r\ncountry occupied by Germany were used in the production of arms and\r\nmunitions. Thus, they were compelled to work in departments engaged in\r\nthe construction of turrets for tanks and carriages for heavy Army and\r\nNavy guns; the assembling of marine gun turrets, 10.5 cm. marine guns,\r\nand 15 cm. torpedo-boat guns; the manufacture of crankshafts for S-boats\r\nand aeroplanes, etc. (Charts and affidavit relating to production in the\r\nworkshops of Fried. Krupp Cast Steel Works by prisoners of war and\r\nforeign workers, not here reproduced.) Affidavits of workers in the\r\nKrupp workshops afford added proof that prisoners of war and foreign\r\nlaborers were used by Krupp in the manufacture of arms and munitions\r\n(see _D-253_, _D-265_, _D-279_).\r\n\r\n(2) The prisoners of war and foreign workers at the Krupp factories did\r\nnot voluntarily engage in the manufacture of arms and munitions; they\r\nwere forced to do so. This fact is clearly shown by the following:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Workers were brought to Essen from Poland and Russia in grossly\r\novercrowded, unheated, and unsanitary cattle cars and upon debarking,\r\nwere beaten, kicked, and otherwise inhumanely treated. An employee of\r\nthe Reich Railway at Essen has described these conditions as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In the middle of 1941 the first workers arrived from\r\n    Poland, Galicia and Polish Ukraine. They came to Essen in goods\r\n    wagons in which potatoes, building materials and also cattle\r\n    have been transported; they were brought to perform work at\r\n    Krupp. The cars were jammed full with people. * * * The people\r\n    were squashed closely together and they had no room for free\r\n    movement. The Krupp overseers laid special value on the speed\r\n    the slave workers got in and out of the train. * * * the people\r\n    were beaten and kicked and generally maltreated in a brutal\r\n    manner. * * * I could see with my own eyes that sick people who\r\n    could scarcely walk * * * were taken to work. One could see that\r\n    it was sometimes difficult for them to move themselves. The same\r\n    can be said for the Eastern workers and PWs who came to Essen in\r\n    the middle of 1942.” (_D-321_; _D-367_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Foreign workers were compelled to go to work under guard and were\r\nclosely watched. In a memorandum dated 7 April 1942, entitled\r\n“employment of foreign workers”, from the Ignitor workshop of the Krupp\r\nEssen plant, it is stated:\r\n\r\n    “In the course of last week, due to the fact that the foreign\r\n    workers, especially Poles, could not be relied upon to appear at\r\n    work, there was an extraordinary decrease in production; loss of\r\n    money and fines did not obtain the desired results.\r\n\r\n    “Especially during short (bank) holidays we were not able to\r\n    find a responsible person in the camp Seumannstrasse, to whom we\r\n    could have referred. We ourselves are short of guards to fetch\r\n    the Poles from their camp, and to guard them overnight.”\r\n    (_D-270_; re compulsion exerted by guards in marching foreign\r\n    workers to work, see also _D-253_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) After working hours, foreign workers were confined in camps under\r\nbarbed wire enclosures and were carefully guarded. Dr. Jaeger, senior\r\ncamp doctor in Krupp’s workers’ camps, has stated in an affidavit:\r\n\r\n    “The eastern workers and Poles who laboured in the Krupp works\r\n    at Essen were kept at camps at Seumannstrasse, Spenlestrasse,\r\n    Grieperstrasse, Heegstrasse, Germaniastrasse,\r\n    Kapitan-Lehmannstrasse, Dechenschule, and Kramerplatz. * * * All\r\n    these camps were surrounded by barbed wire and were closely\r\n    guarded.” (_D-288_)\r\n\r\nH. _CONTRARY TO ARTICLES 4, 6, 7, AND 46 OF THE HAGUE REGULATIONS, 1907,\r\n ARTICLES 2 AND 3 OF THE PRISONERS OF WAR CONVENTION (GENEVA 1929), THE\r\n  LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF WAR, AND ARTICLES 6(b) AND 6(c) OF THE CHARTER,\r\n    KRUPP, AS HEAD OF THE KRUPP CONCERN, WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DENYING\r\n  ADEQUATE FOOD, SHELTER, CLOTHING, AND MEDICAL CARE AND ATTENTION TO\r\nPRISONERS OF WAR AND WORKERS FORCIBLY DEPORTED FROM OCCUPIED COUNTRIES,\r\n FOR FORCING THEM TO WORK UNDER INHUMANE CONDITIONS, AND FOR TORTURING\r\n               THEM AND SUBJECTING THEM TO INDIGNITIES._\r\n\r\n(1) The prisoners of war and foreign laborers at the Krupp works were\r\nundernourished and forced to work on a virtual starvation diet.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In a memorandum upon Krupp stationery to Mr. Hupe, Director of the\r\nKrupp locomotive factory in Essen, dated 14 March 1942 and entitled\r\n“Employment of Russians”, it was said:\r\n\r\n    “During the last few days we have established that the food for\r\n    the Russians employed here is so miserable, that the people are\r\n    getting weaker from day to day.\r\n\r\n    “Investigations showed that single Russians are not able to\r\n    place a piece of metal for turning into position for instance,\r\n    because of lack of physical strength. The same conditions exist\r\n    at all places of work where Russians are employed.” (_D-316_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) In a memorandum dated 18 March 1942, the following was reported\r\nfrom the Krupp armoured car repair shop:\r\n\r\n    “I got the food this evening after Mr. Balz telephoned, but I\r\n    had quite a struggle with the people responsible in the camp\r\n    before I got anything at all. They always told me that the\r\n    people had already received the day’s rations and there wasn’t\r\n    any more. What the gentlemen understand under a day’s ration is\r\n    a complete puzzle to me. The food as a whole was a puzzle too,\r\n    because they ladled me out the thinnest of any already watery\r\n    soup. It was literally water with a handful of turnips and it\r\n    looked as if it were washing up water.\r\n\r\n    “Please tell Mr. Balz again definitely so that the matter is\r\n    finally cleared up, that it cannot continue having people perish\r\n    here at work.” (_D-310_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) In a memorandum dated 20 March 1942 to Mr. Ihn, one of the Krupp\r\nDirectors, Dinkelacker, a Krupp official, wrote:\r\n\r\n    “The Deputy Works Manager Mr. Mustin, who also employs a number\r\n    of such Russian workers and who is quite satisfied with their\r\n    performance, went to the camp in Kramerplatz on my inducement\r\n    and had a talk with Mr. Welberg, the Camp Commandant. Mr. Hassel\r\n    from the Works Police who was present at the time, butted in and\r\n    declared that one should not believe what the people said. Also\r\n    that one was dealing with Bolsheviks and they ought to have\r\n    beatings substituted for food.” (_D-318_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) In a memorandum dated 26 March 1942, to Mr. Hupe concerning the\r\nuse of Russian prisoners of war and civilian workers, it was reported:\r\n\r\n    “The reason why the Russians are not capable of production is,\r\n    in my opinion, that the food which they are given will never\r\n    give them the strength for working which you hope for. The food\r\n    one day, for instance, consisted of a watery soup with cabbage\r\n    leaves and a few pieces of turnip. The punctual appearance of\r\n    the food leaves a good deal to be desired too.” (_D-297_)\r\n\r\n(_e_) In a memorandum dated 8 December 1942, Haller, a Krupp official,\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    “The complaints from our foreign workers about insufficient food\r\n    have increased lately. * * *”\r\n\r\n    “We experienced a very forcible confirmation of these complaints\r\n    the other day when we drew the food for the Eastern workers from\r\n    the kitchen in Kramerplatz. On 5.12.42 the midday meal contained\r\n    unpeeled, whole potatoes which were not even properly cooked; on\r\n    7.12.42, there was soup on which cabbage leaves floated, the\r\n    sight of which made me feel sick.” (_D-366_)\r\n\r\n(_f_) Dr. Jaeger, senior camp doctor in the Krupps’ workers’ camps, has\r\nstated under oath that not only did the plan for food distribution to\r\nforeign workers call for a very small quantity of meat every week, but\r\nalso that they received only contaminated meats rejected by the health\r\nauthorities, such as horse or tuberculin infested meat (_D-288_).\r\n\r\n(2) The prisoners of war and foreign workers at the Krupp factories were\r\nforced to live in grossly overcrowded hutted camps and otherwise were\r\ndenied adequate shelter.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In a sworn statement, Dr. Jaeger, senior camp doctor of the Krupp\r\nworkers’ camps, has stated with respect to the Krupp camps at which the\r\neastern workers and Poles were kept:\r\n\r\n    “Conditions in all these camps were extremely bad. The camps\r\n    were greatly overcrowded. In some camps there were over twice as\r\n    many people in a barrack as health conditions permitted.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Sanitary conditions were exceedingly bad. At Kramerplatz, where\r\n    approximately 1,200 eastern workers were crowded into the rooms\r\n    of an old school, the sanitary conditions were atrocious in the\r\n    extreme. Only 10 children’s toilets were available for the 1,200\r\n    inhabitants. At Dechenschule, 15 children’s toilets were\r\n    available for the 400-500 eastern workers. Excretion\r\n    contaminated the entire floors of these lavatories. There were\r\n    also very few facilities for washing.” (_D-288_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) Statistics upon the Krupp camps compiled by Krupp officials in\r\n1942 for the Essen health authorities show that in the Krupp\r\nSeumannstrasse camp 1784 beds were compressed into a surface area of\r\n7844 square meters; in the Krupp Bottroperstrasse camp 874 beds were\r\ncrowded into a surface area of 3585 square meters; and that in other\r\nKrupp camps the congestion was even greater (_D-143_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) In a memorandum dated 12 June 1944, Dr. Stinnesbeck, a doctor\r\nretained by the Krupp works, reported, with respect to the Krupp\r\nprisoner of war camp at Noggerathstrasse that:\r\n\r\n    “315 prisoners are still accommodated in the camp. 170 of these\r\n    are no longer in barracks but in the tunnel in Grunerstrasse\r\n    under the Essen-Mulheim railway line. This tunnel is damp and is\r\n    not suitable for continued accommodation of human beings. The\r\n    rest of the prisoners are accommodated in 10 different factories\r\n    in Krupps works.” (_D-335_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) In a special medical report marked “strictly confidential”, dated\r\n2 September 1944, concerning the same prisoner of war camp, Dr. Jaeger\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    “The P. O. W. camp in the Noggerathstrasse is in a frightful\r\n    condition. The people live in ash bins, dog kennels, old baking\r\n    ovens and in self-made huts.” (_D-339_).\r\n\r\n(3) The prisoners of war and foreign workers at the Krupp factories were\r\ndenied adequate clothing.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Dr. Jaeger, senior camp doctor in Krupps’ workers’ camps, has\r\nstated under oath:\r\n\r\n    “The clothing of the eastern workers was likewise completely\r\n    inadequate. They worked and slept in the same clothing in which\r\n    they had arrived from the east. Virtually all of them had no\r\n    overcoats and were compelled, therefore, to use their blankets\r\n    as coats in cold and rainy weather. In view of the shortage of\r\n    shoes, many workers were forced to go to work in their bare\r\n    feet, even in the winter. Wooden shoes were given to some of the\r\n    workers, but their quality was such as to give the workers sore\r\n    feet. Many workers preferred to go to work in their bare feet\r\n    rather than endure the suffering caused by the wooden shoes.\r\n    Apart from the wooden shoes, no clothing of any kind was issued\r\n    to the workers until the latter part of 1943, when a single blue\r\n    work suit was issued to some of them. To my knowledge, this\r\n    represented the sole issue of clothing to the workers from the\r\n    time of their arrival until the American forces entered Essen.”\r\n    (_D-288_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) In a memorandum to Mr. Ihn, a Krupp director, dated 20 October\r\n1942, Dr. Wiehle, head of the Krupp hospital in Essen, wrote:\r\n\r\n    “It has already been pointed out several times at conferences\r\n    that the clothing for Eastern workers, men and women, is not\r\n    sufficient. With regard to the cold weather, the camp physician\r\n    today called our attention to the fact that the number of colds\r\n    is going up because of the question of insufficient clothing.\r\n\r\n    “Many of the men and women still have to go barefooted. They\r\n    have no underwear and it often happens that people who wear foot\r\n    bandages because of injuries walk barefooted on these bandages.”\r\n    (_D-271_; see also _D-355_, _D-312_)\r\n\r\n(4) Prisoners of war and foreign laborers at the Krupp works were denied\r\nadequate medical care and treatment, and as a consequence, suffered\r\nseverely from a multitude of diseases and ailments.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In the above mentioned affidavit, Dr. Jaeger has stated:\r\n\r\n    “The percentage of eastern workers who were ill was twice as\r\n    great as among the Germans. Tuberculosis was particularly\r\n    widespread among the eastern workers. The T.B. rate among them\r\n    was 4 times the normal rate (2% eastern workers, .5% Germans).\r\n    At Dechenschule approximately 2½% of the workers suffered from\r\n    open T.B. These were all active T.B. cases. The Tartars and\r\n    Kirghiz suffered most; as soon as they were overcome by this\r\n    disease they collapsed like flies. The cause was bad housing,\r\n    the poor quality and insufficient quantity of food, overwork,\r\n    and insufficient rest.\r\n\r\n    “These workers were likewise afflicted with spotted fever. Lice,\r\n    the carrier of this disease, together with countless fleas, bugs\r\n    and other vermin, tortured the inhabitants of these camps. As a\r\n    result of the filthy conditions of the camps nearly all eastern\r\n    workers were afflicted with skin disease. The shortage of food\r\n    also caused many cases of Hunger-Odem, Nephritis and\r\n    Shighakruse.\r\n\r\n    “It was the general rule that workers were compelled to go to\r\n    work unless a camp doctor had prescribed that they were unfit\r\n    for work. At Seumannstrasse, Grieperstrasse, Germaniastrasse,\r\n    Kapitan-Lehmannstrasse, and Dechenschule, there was no daily\r\n    sick call. At these camps, the doctors did not appear for two or\r\n    three days. As a consequence, workers were forced to go to work\r\n    despite illnesses.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “At the end of 1943, or the beginning of 1944,—I am not\r\n    completely sure of the exact date—I obtained permission for the\r\n    first time to visit the prisoner of war camps. My inspection\r\n    revealed that conditions at these camps were even worse than\r\n    those I had found at the camps of the eastern workers in 1942.\r\n    Medical supplies at such camps were virtually non-existent. In\r\n    an effort to cure this intolerable situation, I contacted the\r\n    _Wehrmacht_ authorities whose duty it was to provide medical\r\n    care for the prisoners of war. My persistent efforts came to\r\n    nothing. After visiting and pressing them over a period of two\r\n    weeks, I was given a total of 100 aspirin tablets for over 3,000\r\n    prisoners of war.” (_D-288_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) In a memorandum dated 7 May 1943, prepared at the Krupp hospital,\r\nentitled “Deaths of Eastern Workers,” report was made of the death of 54\r\n“eastern workers.” Of this number, 38 died of tuberculosis, 2 of\r\nundernourishment, and 2 of intestinal disease. (_D-283_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) In his “strictly confidential” report concerning the prisoner of\r\nwar camp at Noggerathstrasse, Dr. Jaeger reported:\r\n\r\n    “The food is barely sufficient. Krupp is responsible for housing\r\n    and feeding. The supply of medicine and bandages is so extremely\r\n    bad that proper medical treatment was not possible in many\r\n    cases. This fact is detrimental to the P. W. camp. It is\r\n    astonishing that the number of sick is not higher than it is and\r\n    it moves between 9 and 10 percent.” (_D-339_; also _D-313_).\r\n\r\n(_d_) In a special medical report dated 28 July 1944, Dr. Jaeger wrote:\r\n\r\n    “The sick barrack in Camp Rabenhorst is in such bad condition,\r\n    one cannot speak of a sick barrack anymore. The rain leaks\r\n    through in every corner. The housing of the ill is therefore\r\n    impossible. The necessary labour for production is in danger\r\n    because those persons who are ill cannot recover. * * *”\r\n    (_D-338_)\r\n\r\n(5) Russian juveniles were compelled to work at the Krupp factories, and\r\nprisoners of war and foreign workers were generally forced to work long\r\nhours, to and beyond the point of exhaustion.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In a memorandum marked “secret”, dated 14 August 1942, Reiff, a\r\nKrupp official, wrote:\r\n\r\n    “* * * I am under the impression that the better Russian workers\r\n    are first of all chosen for the works in Central and Eastern\r\n    Germany. We really get the bad remainders only. Just now 600\r\n    Russians, consisting of 450 women and 150 juveniles, 14 years of\r\n    age, arrived.” (_D-348_; similar proof is contained in _D-281_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) In a memorandum from the Chief of the Krupp Camp Catering\r\nDepartment, it is stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * It is to be considered that foreigners must work 12 hours\r\n    on principle out of which, 1 hour counts as a break and\r\n    consequently will not be paid.” (_D-233_; for evidence\r\n    concerning complete exhaustion of foreign workers and prisoners\r\n    of war, see _D-313_).\r\n\r\n(6) The prisoners of war and foreign laborers used at the Krupp works\r\nwere beaten, tortured, and subjected to inhuman indignities.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In a sworn statement, Heinrich Buschhauer has stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * I admit that I hit Russians. The Russians were very\r\n    willing and attentive. The clothing of the Russians was very bad\r\n    and torn. Their feet were wrapped in rags. The appearance of the\r\n    people was bad, they were thin and pale. Their cheeks had fallen\r\n    in completely. In spite of this, I was forced to ill-treat the\r\n    people on the orders of works manager Theile. I have boxed the\r\n    people’s ears and beaten them with a ¾ rubber tube and a wooden\r\n    stick. * * * The more energetic I went against these people, the\r\n    more the Works Manager liked it. I * * * had to drive and beat\r\n    the Russians in order to get increased production from them. At\r\n    times, I had up to two thousand foreigners under me. The\r\n    Russians could not possibly work more than they did, because the\r\n    food was too bad and too little. The Works management, however,\r\n    wanted to get still higher performance from them. It often\r\n    happened that the Russians, so utterly weakened, collapsed. * *\r\n    *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The conditions which I have described above continued the whole\r\n    of the years I was in the boiler making department. On 20th\r\n    February 1943, I was transferred from the boiler making shop to\r\n    Nidia.” (_D-305_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Walter Thoene, a Krupp employee, likewise admitted in a sworn\r\nstatement that he constantly beat foreign workers. He stated:\r\n\r\n    “I admit that I punched and beat Hungarian Jewesses who I had to\r\n    supervise in No. 3 Steel Moulding Shop. I did not do this of my\r\n    own free will but was ordered to do so by my works manager Reif,\r\n    who was a Party Member like I was. Almost every day this\r\n    unscrupulous man held me to it in no mistakable manner to\r\n    driving on these Jewesses and getting better performances from\r\n    them. He also always emphasized that I should not be trivial in\r\n    the choice of means, and if necessary, hit them like hitting a\r\n    piece of cold iron. As soon as I saw that these women were\r\n    standing near the ovens, I had to drive them back to their\r\n    work.” (_D-355_)\r\n\r\nComparable admission were made by August Kleinschmidt, another Krupp\r\nemployee. (_D-306_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) Dr. Apolinary Gotowicki, a doctor in the Polish Army, who was\r\ntaken a prisoner of war and in that capacity attended some Russian,\r\nPolish and French prisoners of war at the Krupp factories, has stated\r\nunder oath:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Every day, at least 10 people were brought to me whose\r\n    bodies were covered with bruises on account of the continual\r\n    beatings with rubber tubes, steel switches or sticks. The people\r\n    were often writhing with agony and it was impossible for me to\r\n    give them even a little medical aid. * * * I could notice people\r\n    daily who on account of hunger or ill-treatment, were slowly\r\n    dying. Dead people often lay for 2 or 3 days on the pailliases\r\n    until their bodies stank so badly that fellow prisoners took\r\n    them outside and buried them somewhere. * * * I have seen with\r\n    my own eyes the prisoners coming back from Krupps and how they\r\n    collapsed on the march and had to be wheeled back on barrows or\r\n    carried by their comrades. * * * The work which they had to\r\n    perform was very heavy and dangerous and many cases happened\r\n    where people had cut their fingers, hands or legs. These\r\n    accidents were very serious and the people came to me and asked\r\n    me for medical help. But it wasn’t even possible for me to keep\r\n    them from work for a day or two, although I had been to the\r\n    Krupp directorate and asked for permission to do so. At the end\r\n    of 1941, 2 people died daily and in 1942 the deaths increased to\r\n    3-4 per day.” (_D-313_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) A particular form of torture which was inflicted upon Russian\r\nworkers was a steel cabinet specially manufactured by Krupp, into which\r\nworkers were thrown after beatings. The cabinets are shown in\r\nphotographs attached to a sworn statement wherein it is stated:\r\n\r\n    “Photograph ‘A’ shows an iron cupboard which was specially\r\n    manufactured by the Firm of Krupp to torture Russian civilian\r\n    workers to such an extent that it is impossible to describe. Men\r\n    and women were often locked in one compartment of the cupboard,\r\n    in which a man could scarcely stand, for long periods. The\r\n    measurements of this compartment are height 1.52 meters, breadth\r\n    and depth 40 to 50 cm. each. In fact, people were often kicked\r\n    and pressed into one compartment in pairs. At the top of the\r\n    cupboard, there were sieve-like air holes through which cold\r\n    water was poured on the unfortunate victims during the ice-cold\r\n    winter.” (_D-382_; for further evidence of constant beatings of\r\n    foreign workers, see _D-253_, _D-312_, _D-354_, and _D-267_).\r\n\r\n(_e_) Records found in the Krupp files plainly indicate that the\r\npractice of beating and torturing prisoners of war and foreign workers\r\nwas deliberately prescribed by Krupp officials. Steel switches which\r\nwere used to beat the workers were distributed pursuant to the\r\ninstructions of Kupke, head of the Krupp camps for foreign workers\r\n(_D-230_). In a memorandum dated 19 March 1942, from the Krupp Works\r\nCatering Department, it was said:\r\n\r\n    “* * * With regards to the times ahead it seems desirable to us,\r\n    to draw attention to the authorities concerned, with the\r\n    necessary pressure, to the fact that only severest treatment of\r\n    the French prisoners of war will ensure that they maintain their\r\n    performance even with the present food position, which is the\r\n    same for German workers.” (_D-278_).\r\n\r\nAs previously shown, Hassel, an official in the Krupp works police,\r\nstated that the Russians “ought to have beatings substituted for food”\r\n(_D-318_).\r\n\r\n(7) The Krupp companies specifically requested and actively sought out\r\nthe employment of prisoners of war and foreign laborers.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In a memorandum dated 13 July 1942 by Weinhold, a Krupp official,\r\ncomplaint was registered over the fact that “the foreign laborers are\r\nonly available two to three months after they have been asked for by\r\nus.” (_D-281_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) In a letter to the Krupp firm dated 27 August 1942, Colonel\r\nZimmerman of the _Oberkommando des Heeres_, said:\r\n\r\n    “According to our estimate, there ought to be enough workers in\r\n    your ignitor workshops to reach the demanded production figure.\r\n    This especially, as the 105 Russians, demanded by your firm at\r\n    the Conference of the special committee M 111 on the 24.4.42,\r\n    were assigned to your works at the beginning of June re-letter\r\n    from Wa J Ru (Mun. 2). * * *\r\n\r\n    “Unfortunately, I found out at the sitting of the special\r\n    committee M 111 on the 26.8.42 that the firm of Krupp asks for\r\n    another 55 workers, including 25 skilled labourers, without\r\n    having a corresponding raise in the production figures. I cannot\r\n    judge from here, what the reasons for this are.” (_D-345_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) In a memorandum dated 21 December 1942 concerning the possibility\r\nof the Krupp works obtaining additional conscripted French workers, Dr.\r\nLehmann, a Krupp official, stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * We discussed how far it would be possible for complete\r\n    shifts of workers conscripted from French factories to be\r\n    transferred to Essen. We are to collaborate as far as\r\n    practicable in the splitting up of our requirements amongst\r\n    individual military government offices and military police\r\n    posts. So far as possible one of our representatives is to\r\n    assist in the selection from amongst the conscripts.” (_D-196_;\r\n    see also _D-280_)\r\n\r\n(8) Concentration camp laborers, who were brought to the Krupp works at\r\nthe request of Krupp officials, were subjected to persecution,\r\ndegradation, despoilment, and torture in a manner similar to that of\r\nprisoners of war and slave laborers.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Mr. Ihn, a director of the Krupp firm, has stated in a signed but\r\nunsworn statement, that the Krupp firm first asked for concentration\r\ncamp labor on 22 September 1942, and that the first group of them\r\narrived “in the summer or autumn of 1944” (_D-274_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) The fact that concentration camp labor was requested by the Krupp\r\nworks; that such persons were to be confined behind barbed wire\r\nenclosures; and that they were to be closely guarded by SS personnel is\r\nfurther shown in a memorandum entitled “Visit of the Director of\r\nDistribution of Workers of the Weimar-Buchenwald Concentration Camp; SS\r\nHauptsturmfuehrer Schwarz on 26-7-44”, written by Trockel, a Krupp\r\nofficial. In the course of this memorandum, Trockel stated:\r\n\r\n    “Herr Schwarz came on behalf of his Commandant SS\r\n    Standartenfuehrer Pister to talk over with us, the question of\r\n    employment of K1 detainees. He pointed out that the employment\r\n    of men could not be reckoned with for a considerable period. Our\r\n    last request was for 700 women.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “As not less than 500 women would be assigned, we agreed that\r\n    the figure should remain at 500 women in order that the\r\n    assignment should not be endangered. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * The main things are the erection of a barbed wire fence\r\n    in front of the hall which allows a small exit and the erection\r\n    of a small barracks for the Commander of the guard and his duty\r\n    office and for the German female guard personnel. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The SS are providing a guard consisting of guard commander and\r\n    10 men. For 520 women we have to name approx. 45 German women\r\n    who will be sworn in to the SS, given 3 weeks training in the\r\n    women’s camp at Ravensbrueck and then given full official\r\n    supervision duties by the SS. * * *” (_D-238_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) Dr. Jaeger, senior camp doctor in the Krupp camps, has described\r\nconditions at the camp which the Krupp works maintained for\r\nconcentration camp labor as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Camp Humboldtstrasse had been inhabited by Italian prisoners of\r\n    war. After it had been destroyed by an air raid, the Italians\r\n    were removed and 600 Jewish females from Buchenwald\r\n    Concentration Camp were brought in to work at the Krupp\r\n    factories. Upon my first visit at Camp Humboldtstrasse, I found\r\n    these females suffering from open festering wounds and other\r\n    diseases.\r\n\r\n    “I was the first doctor they had seen for at least a fortnight.\r\n    There was no doctor in attendance at the camp. There were no\r\n    medical supplies in the camp. They had no shoes and went about\r\n    in their bare feet. The sole clothing of each consisted of a\r\n    sack with holes for their arms and head. Their hair was shorn.\r\n    The camp was surrounded by barbed wire and closely guarded by SS\r\n    guards.\r\n\r\n    “The amount of food in the camp was extremely meagre and of very\r\n    poor quality. The houses in which they lived consisted of the\r\n    ruins of former barracks and they afforded no shelter against\r\n    rain and other weather conditions. I reported to my superiors\r\n    that the guards lived and slept outside their barracks as one\r\n    could not enter them without being attacked by 10, 20 and up to\r\n    30 fleas. One camp doctor employed by me refused to enter the\r\n    camp again after he had been bitten very badly. I visited this\r\n    camp with a Mr. Grono on two occasions and both times we left\r\n    the camp badly bitten. We had great difficulty in getting rid of\r\n    the fleas and insects which had attacked us. As a result of this\r\n    attack by insects of this camp, I got large boils on my arms and\r\n    the rest of my body. I asked my superiors at the Krupp works to\r\n    undertake the necessary steps to delouse the camp so as to put\r\n    an end to this unbearable, vermin-infested condition. Despite\r\n    this report, I did not find any improvement in sanitary\r\n    conditions at the camp on my second visit a fortnight later.”\r\n    (_D-288_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) The conditions under which the concentration camp workers existed\r\nat the Krupp camps and factories and the indignities and barbarities to\r\nwhich they were subjected are vividly described in affidavits by such\r\nworkers (_D-256_; _D-277_; _D-272_). In general, the affidavits disclose\r\nthat these concentration camp laborers slept on bare floors of damp,\r\nwindowless and lightless cellars; that they had no water for drinking or\r\ncleansing purposes; that they were compelled to do work far beyond their\r\nstrength; that they were mercilessly beaten; that they were given one\r\nwretched meal a day, consisting of a dirty watery soup with a thin slice\r\nof black bread; and that many of them died from starvation, tuberculosis\r\nand overexertion. A chart entitled “Fried. Krupp _Berthawerk,\r\nMarkstaedt_ Breslau, Number of Occupied Foreigners, Prisoners of War and\r\nConcentration Camp Inmates” shows the use of concentration camp labor at\r\nthat factory, as well as at the above-mentioned Krupp company in Essen\r\n(_D-298_).\r\n\r\n(9) Charts prepared by Krupp officials show that in September 1943, the\r\nKrupp concerns employed 39,245 foreign workers and 11,224 prisoners of\r\nwar, and that the number mounted steadily until September 1944, when\r\n54,990 foreign workers and 18,902 prisoners of war were used (Chart\r\nentitled “Foreigners and Prisoners of War of the Krupp Concern”; chart\r\nentitled “Cast Steel Works, Number of Prisoners of War and Foreigners”,\r\nnot here reproduced.) The majority of the foreign laborers consisted of\r\nRussians, French, Poles, and Dutch.\r\n\r\n I. _AS REWARD FOR HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS’ PROGRAM,\r\n   KRUPP REAPED LARGE PROFITS, WAS PERMITTED TO EXPAND HIS INDUSTRIAL\r\n EMPIRE, AND RECEIVED HIGH HONORS AND SPECIAL PRIVILEGES FROM THE NAZI\r\n                              GOVERNMENT._\r\n\r\n(1) Although the Krupp companies operated at a substantial loss in the\r\nyears immediately preceding Hitler’s accession to power, the huge orders\r\nfrom the Nazi state enabled them to derive vast profits thereafter. In\r\nthe fiscal year 1 October 1934 to 30 September 1935, the net profits of\r\nFried. Krupp and subsidiaries, after the deduction of taxes, gifts and\r\nreserves recognized by the tax authorities, amounted to 57,216,392\r\nmarks. In the fiscal year 1937 to 1938 these net profits rose to\r\n97,071,632 marks, and in the fiscal year 1941 they amounted to\r\n111,555,216 marks (Chart entitled “Income and Loss of the Fried. Krupp\r\nCombine”; Graph entitled “Profits or Losses of Fried. Krupp and\r\nSubsidiaries as Reported to Tax Authorities,” not here reproduced.)\r\n\r\n(2) Krupp was permitted, with the approval and at times connivance of\r\nNazi officials, to extend in great measure his participation in other\r\ncompanies, both within and without Germany.\r\n\r\n(_a_) On 1 October 1933 the participations of Fried. Krupp in other\r\nconcerns had a book value of 75,962,000 marks. By 30 September 1942 the\r\nbook value of the participations had grown to 132,944,000 marks. On 1\r\nOctober 1942 the participation account was revalued and carried at a new\r\nfigure of 187,924,621 marks. In the following year new acquisitions were\r\nmade in the amount of 50,224,707 marks, so that the book value of the\r\nparticipations as of 1 October 1943 was 237,316,093 marks. Even this\r\nfigure contains many going concerns in occupied countries which were\r\narbitrarily assigned a book value of only 1 mark. Leaving out of account\r\nthe revaluation of 1 October 1942, the participation account as of 1\r\nOctober 1943 would have been 182,952,000 marks. The increment in the\r\nparticipation account is shown in a chart entitled, “Fried. Krupp\r\nParticipations” (_D-341_). The expansion of the Krupp concern under the\r\nNazi regime is likewise revealed by a comparison of charts showing the\r\ncompanies in the Krupp concern as of 30 September 1935 and 31 January\r\n1944.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Complete records of all acquisitions by Krupp have not been\r\nobtained because, according to Krupp officials, many records were lost\r\nor destroyed in air raids. Enough appears, however, to indicate that the\r\nKrupp firm did in fact call upon the Nazi authorities to facilitate or\r\nmake possible the acquisition of property interests in occupied\r\ncountries. Thus, when Mr. Erhard, the French custodian of Jewish\r\nproperty in France, resisted Krupp’s attempts to acquire a lease of a\r\nplant at Liancourt, France, the Krupp concern enlisted the support of\r\nthe Army to gain its objective. Under threat of replacement by a German\r\nofficial, the French custodian of Jewish property acceded to Krupp’s\r\ndemands. In a memorandum dated 29 July 1942, found in the Krupp files,\r\nit is stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * M. Erhard delayed the negotiations to such an extent that\r\n    finally the appropriate military authorities in Paris urged a\r\n    settlement. This authority declared that if Mr. Erhard could not\r\n    make up his mind to sell, at least he would have to give a three\r\n    years’ lease to Krupp.\r\n\r\n    “The custodianship would be taken away from Mr. Erhard and a\r\n    German Commissar would be appointed unless the lease were\r\n    granted in a very short time.” (_D-526_).\r\n\r\n(3) In recognition of his services to the Nazi State, Krupp was awarded\r\nthe “Shield of the Eagle of the German Reich” with the inscription “To\r\nthe German leader of Industry” (_D-66_).\r\n\r\n(4) Because of his unique service to the military power of the Nazi\r\nState, Krupp was authorized by special decree of Hitler to transform\r\nFried. Krupp A.G. into a private family concern in order to perpetuate\r\ncontrol of the firm by a single member of the Krupp family.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In a letter dated 11 November 1942 to Bormann, Krupp stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * You have asked me to make proposals to you which would\r\n    secure the future of the unified existence of the Krupp works\r\n    more than this is feasible today. * * * On considering this\r\n    question we have ascertained that under the present laws the\r\n    principal solution of the question cannot be carried out. We had\r\n    to find an entirely new way, therefore, which, just as the law\r\n    regarding heritage of agricultural property, creates entirely\r\n    new legislation.” (_D-99_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) In reply to the above letter, Bormann wrote to Krupp that:\r\n\r\n    “I have reported the contents of your letters of the 11/11 to\r\n    the Fuehrer today. He instructed me to inform you that he would\r\n    be readily prepared to arrange for any possible safeguarding for\r\n    the continued existence of the works as a family enterprise; it\r\n    would be the simplest to issue a ‘_Lex Krupp_’ to start with.”\r\n    (_D-101_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) Krupp’s recognition of the unusual character of his proposal is\r\nindicated in his letter of 24 February 1943 to Lammers, wherein he said:\r\n\r\n    “Without doubt, the matter, which is without precedent in\r\n    economic life, will have to be discussed with the Reichs\r\n    Minister of Justice and the Reichs Minister of Finance also. * *\r\n    *” (_D-106_).\r\n\r\n(_d_) On 12 November 1943 Hitler signed the decree making possible the\r\npreservation of the Krupp firm as a family enterprise in recognition of\r\nthe fact that\r\n\r\n    “for 132 years the firm of Fried. Krupp, as a family enterprise\r\n    has achieved outstanding and unique merits for the armed\r\n    strength of the German people.” (_D-120_)\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated 16 November 1943, Lammers wrote to Krupp:\r\n\r\n    “On 12 November the Fuehrer signed the decree regarding the\r\n    family enterprise of the firm Fried. Krupp. * * * May I express\r\n    my heartiest congratulations to you, your wife and the firm\r\n    Fried. Krupp on the great honor which has been conferred on the\r\n    merits of the firm Fried. Krupp with this recognition by the\r\n    Fuehrer.” (_D-124_).\r\n\r\n(_e_) As the final step in the proceeding, Hitler approved “the statute\r\nof the family enterprise Fried. Krupp” which gave effect to his decree\r\nof 12 November 1943 (_D-131_).\r\n\r\n(_f_) In a letter of gratitude to Hitler dated 29 December 1943, Krupp\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * By this, you have made a wish come true, which my wife\r\n    and I had had for years, and thus relieved our hearts of great\r\n    worry over the future of the Krupp works.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “My wife and I, as well as the whole family, are deeply grateful\r\n    to you for this proof of your confidence. * * *”\r\n\r\n    “Our special thanks go to you, Mein Fuehrer, also for the great\r\n    honour and recognition which you have awarded, in the\r\n    introduction to your decree, to 130 years of the work of Krupps,\r\n    the work of Krupps done by many generations of faithful\r\n    followers, and steered and directed by 4 generations of the\r\n    family Krupp.” (_D-135_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n  LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO GUSTAV KRUPP VON\r\n                           BOHLEN UND HALBACH\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 64\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

KARL DOENITZ\r\n\r\n                    A. _NAVAL AND POLITICAL CAREER._\r\n\r\nAfter his appointment in 1935 as commander of the Weddigen U-boat\r\nflotilla—the first flotilla to be formed after the World War in\r\n1918—Doenitz, who thus became in effect commander of U-boats, rose\r\nsteadily in rank as the U-boat arm expanded until he became an admiral.\r\nOn 30 January 1943 he was appointed Grand Admiral and succeeded Raeder\r\nas Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, retaining his command of the\r\nU-boat arm. Then, on 1 May 1945, he succeeded Hitler as leader of\r\nGermany (_2887-PS_).\r\n\r\nDoenitz was awarded the following decorations: On 18 September 1939 he\r\nreceived the Cluster of the Iron Cross, first class, for the U-boat\r\nsuccesses in the Baltic during the Polish campaign. This award was\r\nfollowed on 21 April 1940 by the high award of the Knight’s Cross to the\r\nIron Cross, while on 7 April 1943 he received personally from Hitler the\r\nOak Leaf to the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross, as the 223rd\r\nrecipient.\r\n\r\nDoenitz’s services in building up the German Navy, and in particular the\r\noffensive U-boat arm for the coming war, were outstanding. An extract\r\nfrom the official publication “_Das Archiv_” on the occasion of\r\nDoenitz’s promotion to vice-admiral, dated 27 September 1940, reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In four years of untiring and in the fullest sense of the\r\n    word uninterrupted work of training, he [Doenitz] succeeds in\r\n    developing the young U-boat arm, personnel, and material till it\r\n    is a weapon of a striking power unexpected even by the experts.\r\n    More than three million gross tons of sunken enemy shipping in\r\n    only one year achieved with only few boats speak better than\r\n    words of the services of this man.” (_D-436_)\r\n\r\nAn extract from the diary for the German Navy, 1944 edition (_1463-PS_)\r\nemphasizes Doenitz’s contribution. It describes in detail Doenitz’s work\r\nin building up the U-boat arm; his ceaseless work in training night and\r\nday to close the gap of seventeen years, during which no training had\r\ntaken place; his responsibility for new improvements and for devising\r\nthe “pack” tactics which were later to become famous. His position is\r\nsummarized further as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In spite of the fact that his duties took on unmeasurable\r\n    proportions since the beginning of the huge U-boat construction\r\n    program, the chief was what he always was and always will be,\r\n    leader and inspiration to all the forces under him. * * * In\r\n    spite of all his duties, he never lost touch with his men and he\r\n    showed a masterly understanding in adjusting himself to the\r\n    changing fortunes of war.” (_1463-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was not only, however, his ability as a naval officer which won\r\nDoenitz these high honors: his promotion to succeed Raeder as\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Navy; the personal position he acquired as one\r\nof Hitler’s principal advisers; and finally, earlier candidates such as\r\nGoering having betrayed Hitler’s trust or finding the position less\r\nattractive than they had anticipated, the doubtful honour of becoming\r\nHitler’s successor. These he owed, to his fanatical adherence to Hitler\r\nand to the Party, to his belief in the Nazi ideology with which he\r\nsought to indoctrinate the Navy and the German people, and to his\r\n“masterly understanding in adjusting himself to the changing fortunes of\r\nwar” (_1463-PS_), which may be regarded as synonymous with a capacity\r\nfor utter ruthlessness.\r\n\r\n  B. _INDOCTRINATION OF NAVAL PERSONNEL WITH NAZI POLITICAL IDEOLOGY._\r\n\r\nDoenitz’s attitude to the Nazi Party and its creed is shown by his\r\npublic utterances. In a speech—subsequently circulated by Doenitz as a\r\nTop Secret document for senior officers only and by the hand of officers\r\nonly—at a meeting of commanders of the Navy in Weimar on 17 December\r\n1943, Doenitz stated (_D-443_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * I am a firm adherent of the idea of ideological\r\n    education. For what is it in the main? Doing his duty is a\r\n    matter of course for the soldier. But the whole importance, the\r\n    whole weight of duty done, are only present when the heart and\r\n    spiritual conviction have a voice in the matter. The result of\r\n    duty done is then quite different to what it would be if I only\r\n    carried out my task literally, obediently, and faithfully. It is\r\n    therefore necessary for the soldier to support the execution of\r\n    his duty with all his mental, all his spiritual energy, and for\r\n    this his conviction, his ideology are indispensable. It is\r\n    therefore necessary for us to train the soldier uniformly,\r\n    comprehensively, that he may be adjusted ideologically to our\r\n    Germany. Every dualism, every dissension in this connection, or\r\n    every divergence, or unpreparedness, imply a weakness in all\r\n    circumstances. He in whom this grows and thrives in unison is\r\n    superior to the other. Then indeed the whole importance, the\r\n    whole weight of his conviction comes into play. It is also\r\n    nonsense to say that the soldier or the officer must have no\r\n    politics. The soldier embodies the state in which he lives; he\r\n    is the representative, the articulate exponent of this state. He\r\n    must therefore stand with his whole weight behind this state.\r\n\r\n    “We must travel this road from our deepest conviction. The\r\n    Russian travels along it. We can only maintain ourselves in this\r\n    war if we take part in it with holy zeal, with all our\r\n    fanaticism.\r\n\r\n    “Not I alone can do this, but it can only be done with the aid\r\n    of the man who holds the production of Europe in his hand, with\r\n    Minister Speer. My ambition is to have as many warships for the\r\n    Navy as possible so as to be able to fight and to strike. It\r\n    does not matter to me who builds them.” (_D-443_)\r\n\r\nIn a speech on the same subject by Doenitz as Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nNavy to the Commanders in Chief on 15 February 1944, he had this to say:\r\n\r\n    “From the very start the whole of the officer corps must be so\r\n    indoctrinated that it feels itself co-responsible for the\r\n    National Socialist State in its entirety. The officer is the\r\n    exponent of the state; the idle chatter that the officer is\r\n    non-political is sheer nonsense.” (_D-640_)\r\n\r\nDoenitz’s position was made unmistakably clear in a speech which he made\r\nto the German Navy and the German people on Heroes’ Day, 12 March 1944:\r\n\r\n    “German men and women!\r\n\r\n    “* * * What would have become of our country today, if the\r\n    Fuehrer had not united us under National-Socialism! Split into\r\n    parties, beset with the spreading poison of Jewry and vulnerable\r\n    to it, and lacking, as a defense, our present uncompromising\r\n    world outlook, we would long since have succumbed to the burdens\r\n    of this war and been subject to the merciless destruction of our\r\n    adversaries. * * *” (_2878-PS_) A speech by Doenitz to the Navy\r\n    on 21 July 1944 shows his fanaticism:\r\n\r\n    “Men of the Navy! Holy wrath and unlimited anger fill our hearts\r\n    because of the criminal attempt which was intended to have cost\r\n    the life of our beloved Fuehrer. Providence wished it\r\n    otherwise—watched over and protected our Fuehrer, and did not\r\n    abandon our German fatherland in the fight for its destiny.”\r\n    (_2878-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnd then he goes on to deal with the fate which should be meted out to\r\nthe traitors.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of the German military salute and the adoption of the Nazi\r\nsalute in the German forces was due to Doenitz along with Goering and\r\nKeitel (_2878-PS_).\r\n\r\nWhen Adolf Hitler was reported dead, Doenitz spoke over the German radio\r\nannouncing the Fuehrer’s death and his own succession. The German\r\nannouncer made this statement:\r\n\r\n    “It has been reported from the Fuehrer’s Headquarters that our\r\n    Fuehrer Adolf Hitler has died this afternoon in his battle\r\n    headquarters at the Reichschancellery fighting to the last\r\n    breath for Germany against Bolshevism.\r\n\r\n    “On the 30th April the Fuehrer nominated Grand Admiral Doenitz\r\n    to be his successor. The Grand Admiral and Fuehrer’s successor\r\n    will speak to the German nation.” (_D-444_)\r\n\r\nWhereupon Doenitz spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n    “German men and women, soldiers of the German Armed Forces. Our\r\n    Fuehrer Adolf Hitler is dead. The German people bow in deepest\r\n    sorrow and respect. Early he had recognized the terrible danger\r\n    of Bolshevism and had dedicated his life to the fight against\r\n    it. His fight having ended, he died a hero’s death in the\r\n    capital of the German Reich, after having led an unmistakably\r\n    straight and steady life.” (_D-444_)\r\n\r\nDoenitz proceeded to issue an order of the day, to the same effect\r\n(_D-444_).\r\n\r\n    C. _PARTICIPATION IN PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF AGGRESSIVE WARS._\r\n\r\nApart from his services in building up the U-boat arm, there is ample\r\nevidence that Doenitz, as Officer Commanding U-boats, took part in the\r\nplanning and execution of the aggressive wars against Poland, Norway,\r\nand Denmark.\r\n\r\n(1) _Poland._ The distribution list on a memorandum by Raeder, dated 16\r\nMay 1939, shows that the sixth copy went to the _Fuehrer der\r\nUnterseeboote_, who was Doenitz. This document was a directive for the\r\ninvasion of Poland (_Fall Weiss_) (_C-126_). Another memorandum from\r\nRaeder’s headquarters, dated 2 August 1939, is addressed to the fleet,\r\nand The Flag Officer, U-boats—this is, Doenitz (_C-126_). This was\r\nmerely a covering letter on operational directions for the precautionary\r\nemployment of U-boats in the Atlantic in the event that the intention to\r\ncarry out _Fall Weiss_ remained unchanged. The second sentence is\r\nsignificant:\r\n\r\n    “Flag Officer, U-boats, is handing in his operational orders to\r\n    SKL [_Seekriegsleitung_, the German Admiralty] by 12 August. A\r\n    decision on the sailings of U-boats for the Atlantic will\r\n    probably be made at the middle of August.” (_C-126_)\r\n\r\nDoenitz proceeded to give operational instructions to his U-boats for\r\nthe operation _Fall Weiss_. These instructions, signed by him, are not\r\ndated, but it is clear from the subject matter that the date must have\r\nbeen before 16 July 1939 (_C-172_). These operational instructions gave\r\neffect to Raeder’s directive (_C-126_).\r\n\r\n(2) _Norway and Denmark._ An extract from the War Diary of the Naval War\r\nStaff of the German Admiralty, dated 3 October 1939, records the fact\r\nthat the Chief of the Naval War Staff has called for views on the\r\npossibility of taking operational bases in Norway (_C-122_). It states\r\nDoenitz’s views as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Flag Officer U-boats already considers such harbors\r\n    extremely useful as equipment—and supply—bases for Atlantic\r\n    U-boats to call at temporarily.” (_C-122_)\r\n\r\nA communication from Doenitz as Flag Officer U-boats, addressed to the\r\nSupreme Command of the Navy (the Naval War Staff) dated 9 October 1939,\r\nsets out Doenitz’s views on the advantages of Trondheim and Narvik as\r\nbases. Doenitz proposes the establishment of a base at Trondheim with\r\nNarvik as an alternative (_C-5_).\r\n\r\nDoenitz then gave operation orders to his U-boats for the occupation of\r\nDenmark and Norway. This Top Secret order, dated 30 March 1940, under\r\nthe code name “_Hartmut_,” provided:\r\n\r\n    “The naval force will, as they enter the harbor, fly the British\r\n    flag until the troops have landed, except presumably at Narvik.”\r\n    (_C-151_)\r\n\r\n(3) _England._ The preparations for war against England are perhaps best\r\nshown by the disposition of the U-boats under Doenitz’s command on 3\r\nSeptember 1939, when war broke out between Germany and the Western\r\nAllies. The locations of the sinkings in the following week, including\r\nthat of the _Athenia_, provide corroboration. These matters are\r\ncontained in two charts prepared by the British Admiralty. The first\r\nchart sets out the disposition of German submarines on 3 September 1939.\r\nThe certificate attached to this chart reads:\r\n\r\n    “This chart has been constructed from a study of the orders\r\n    issued by Doenitz between 21 August 1939 and 3 September 1939,\r\n    and subsequently captured. The chart shows the approximate\r\n    disposition of submarines ordered for the 3rd of September 1939,\r\n    and cannot be guaranteed accurate in every detail, as the file\r\n    of captured orders are clearly not complete and some of the\r\n    submarines shown apparently had received orders at sea on or\r\n    about September 3 to move to new operational areas. The\r\n    documents from which this chart was constructed are held by the\r\n    British Admiralty in London.”\r\n\r\nIt will be apparent that U-boats which were in the positions indicated\r\non this chart on 3 September 1939 had left Kiel a considerable time\r\nbefore. The location of the U-boat U-30 is particularly significant.\r\n\r\nThe second chart sets out the sinkings during the first week of the war.\r\nThe attached certificate reads:\r\n\r\n    “This chart has been constructed from the official records of\r\n    the British Admiralty in London. It shows the position and\r\n    sinkings of the British merchant vessels lost by enemy action in\r\n    the seven days subsequent to 3 September 1939.”\r\n\r\nThe location of the sinking of the _Athenia_ is significant.\r\n\r\n    D. _PARTICIPATION IN CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT VIOLATIONS OF RULES OF\r\n                               WARFARE._\r\n\r\nThe course of the war waged against neutral and allied merchant shipping\r\nby German U-boats followed, under Doenitz’s direction, a course of\r\nconsistently increasing ruthlessness.\r\n\r\n(1) _Attacks on Merchant Shipping._ Doenitz displayed “his masterly\r\nunderstanding in adjusting himself to the changing fortunes of war”\r\n(_1463-PS_). From the very early days, merchant ships, both allied and\r\nneutral, were sunk without warning, and when operational danger zones\r\nhad been announced by the German Admiralty, these sinkings continued to\r\ntake place both within and without those zones. With some exceptions in\r\nthe early days of the war, no regard was taken for the safety of the\r\ncrews or passengers of sunken merchant ships, and the announcement\r\nclaiming a total blockade of the British Isles merely served to confirm\r\nthe established situation under which U-boat warfare was being conducted\r\nwithout regard to the established rules of international warfare or the\r\nrequirements of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe course of the war at sea during the first eighteen months is\r\nsummarized by two official British reports made at a time when those who\r\ncompiled them were ignorant of some of the actual orders issued which\r\nhave since come to hand. An official report of the British Foreign\r\nOffice summarizes German attacks on merchant shipping during the period\r\n3 September 1939 to September 1940, that is to say, the first year of\r\nthe war (_D-641-A_). This report, made shortly after September 1940,\r\nstates in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * During the first twelve months of the war, 2,081,062 tons\r\n    of Allied shipping, comprising 508 ships, have been lost by\r\n    enemy action. In addition, 769,213 tons of neutral shipping\r\n    comprising 253 ships, have also been lost. Nearly all these\r\n    merchant ships have been sunk by submarine, mine, aircraft or\r\n    surface craft, and the great majority of them sunk while engaged\r\n    on their lawful trading occasions. 2,836 Allied merchant seamen\r\n    have lost their lives in these ships.\r\n\r\n    “In the last war the practice of the Central Powers was so\r\n    remote from the recognized procedure that it was thought\r\n    necessary to set forth once again the rules of warfare in\r\n    particular as applied to submarines. This was done in the Treaty\r\n    of London 1930, and in 1936 Germany acceded to these rules. The\r\n    rules laid down:\r\n\r\n    “(1) In action with regard to merchant ships, submarines must\r\n    conform to the rules of International Law to which surface\r\n    vessels are subjected.\r\n\r\n    “(2) In particular, except in the case of persistent refusal to\r\n    stop on being summoned, or of active resistance to visit and\r\n    search, a warship, whether surface vessel or submarine, may not\r\n    sink or render incapable of navigation a merchant vessel without\r\n    having first placed passengers, crew, and ship’s papers in a\r\n    place of safety. For this purpose, the ship’s boats are not\r\n    regarded as a place of safety unless the safety of the\r\n    passengers and crew is assured in the existing sea and weather\r\n    conditions, by the proximity of land, or the presence of another\r\n    vessel which is in a position to take them on board.\r\n\r\n    “At the beginning of the present war, Germany issued a Prize\r\n    Ordinance for the regulation of sea warfare and the guidance of\r\n    her naval officers. Article 74 of this ordinance embodies the\r\n    submarine rules of the London Treaty. Article 72, however,\r\n    provides that captured enemy vessels may be destroyed if it\r\n    seems inexpedient or unsafe to bring them into port, and Article\r\n    73 (i) (ii) makes the same provision with regard to neutral\r\n    vessels which are captured for sailing under enemy convoy, for\r\n    forcible resistance, or for giving assistance to the enemy.\r\n    These provisions are certainly not in accordance with the\r\n    traditional British view but the important point is that, even\r\n    in these cases, the Prize Ordinance envisages the capture of the\r\n    merchantman before its destruction. In other words, if the\r\n    Germans adhered to the rules set out in their own Prize\r\n    Ordinance, we might have argued the rather fine legal point with\r\n    them, but we should have no quarrel with them, either on the\r\n    broader legal issue or on the humanitarian one. In the event,\r\n    however, it is only too clear that almost from the beginning of\r\n    the war the Germans abandoned their own principles and waged war\r\n    with steadily increasing disregard for International Law, and\r\n    for what is, after all, the ultimate sanction of all law, the\r\n    protection of human life and property from arbitrary and\r\n    ruthless attacks.” (_D-641-A_)\r\n\r\nTwo instances are then set out:\r\n\r\n    “On the 30th of September, 1939, came the first sinking of a\r\n    neutral ship by a submarine without warning and with loss of\r\n    life. This was the Danish ship ‘_Vendia_’ bound for the Clyde in\r\n    ballast. The submarine fired two shots and shortly after\r\n    torpedoed the ship. The torpedo was fired when the master had\r\n    already signalled that he would submit to the submarine’s orders\r\n    and before there had been an opportunity to abandon ship. By\r\n    November submarines were beginning to sink neutral vessels\r\n    without warning as a regular thing. On the 12th November the\r\n    Norwegian ‘_Arne Kjode_’ was torpedoed in the North Sea without\r\n    any warning at all. This was a tanker bound from one neutral\r\n    port to another. The master and four of the crew lost their\r\n    lives and the remainder were picked up after many hours in open\r\n    boats. Henceforward, in addition to the failure to establish the\r\n    nature of the cargo, another element is noticeable, namely an\r\n    increasing recklessness as to the fate of the crew.” (_D-641-A_)\r\n\r\nAnd then, dealing with attacks on allied merchant vessels, certain\r\nfigures are given:\r\n\r\n                “Ships sunk          241\r\n                “Recorded attacks    221\r\n                “Illegal attacks     112\r\n\r\n    “At least 79 of these 112 ships were torpedoed without warning.”\r\n    (_D-641-A_)\r\n\r\nThe report continues:\r\n\r\n    “By the middle of October submarines were sinking merchant\r\n    vessels without any regard to the safety of the crews. Yet four\r\n    months later the Germans were still officially claiming that\r\n    they were acting in accordance with the Prize Ordinance. Their\r\n    own semi-official commentators however, had made the position\r\n    clearer. As regards neutrals, Berlin officials had early in\r\n    February stated that any neutral ship that is either voluntarily\r\n    or under compulsion bound for an enemy port—including\r\n    contraband control harbours—thereby loses its neutrality and\r\n    must be considered hostile. At the end of February the cat was\r\n    let out of the bag by a statement that a neutral ship which\r\n    obtained a navicert from a British Consul in order to avoid\r\n    putting into a British contraband control base was liable to be\r\n    sunk by German submarines, even if it was bound from one neutral\r\n    port to another. As regards Allied ships, in the middle of\r\n    November 1939 a Berlin warning was issued against the arming of\r\n    British vessels. By that date a score of British merchantmen had\r\n    been illegally attacked by gunfire or torpedo from submarines,\r\n    and after that date some fifteen more unarmed Allied vessels\r\n    were torpedoed without warning. It is clear, therefore, that not\r\n    only was the arming fully justified as a defensive measure, but\r\n    also that neither before nor after this German threat did the\r\n    German submarines discriminate between armed and unarmed\r\n    vessels.” (_D-641-A_)\r\n\r\nA similar report covering the next six months (_D-641-B_) makes these\r\nstatements:\r\n\r\n    “On the 30th January 1941, Hitler proclaimed that ‘every ship,\r\n    with or without convoy, which appears before our torpedo tubes\r\n    is going to be torpedoed.’ On the face of it, this announcement\r\n    appears to be uncompromising; and the only qualification\r\n    provided by the context is that the threats immediately\r\n    preceding it are specifically addressed to the peoples of the\r\n    American Continent. German commentators, however, subsequently\r\n    tried to water it down by contending that Hitler was referring\r\n    only to ships which attempted to enter the area within which the\r\n    German ‘total blockade’ is alleged to be in force.\r\n\r\n    “From one point of view it probably matters little what exactly\r\n    was Hitler’s meaning, since the only conclusion that can be\r\n    reached after a study of the facts of enemy warfare on merchant\r\n    shipping is that enemy action in this field is never limited by\r\n    the principles which are proclaimed by enemy spokesmen, but\r\n    solely by the opportunities or lack of them which exist at any\r\n    given time.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The effect of the German total blockade is to prohibit neutral\r\n    ships from entering an enormous stretch of sea round Britain\r\n    (the area extends to about 500 miles west of Ireland, and from\r\n    the latitude of Bordeaux to that of the Faroe Islands), upon\r\n    pain of having their ships sunk without warning and their crews\r\n    killed. As a matter of fact, at least thirty-two neutral ships,\r\n    exclusive of those sailing in British convoys, have been sunk by\r\n    enemy action since the declaration of the ‘total blockade’.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Yet, though information is lacking in very many cases, details\r\n    are available to prove that, during the period under review, at\r\n    least thirty-eight Allied merchant ships, exclusive of those in\r\n    convoys, have been torpedoed without warning in or near the\r\n    ‘total blockade’ area.\r\n\r\n    “That the Germans themselves have no exaggerated regard for the\r\n    area is proved by the fact that of the thirty-eight ships\r\n    referred to at least sixteen were torpedoed outside the limits\r\n    of the war-zone.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The sinking of the ‘_City of Benares_’ on the 17th September\r\n    1940 is a good example of this. The ‘_City of Benares_’ was an\r\n    11,000-ton liner with 191 passengers on board, including nearly\r\n    100 children. She was torpedoed without warning just outside the\r\n    ‘war zone,’ with the loss of 258 lives, including 77 children.\r\n    It was blowing a gale, with hail and rain squalls and a very\r\n    rough sea when the torpedo struck her at about 10 p. m. In the\r\n    darkness and owing to the prevailing weather conditions, at\r\n    least four of the twelve boats lowered were capsized. Others\r\n    were swamped and many people were washed right out of them. In\r\n    one boat alone sixteen people, including 11 children, died from\r\n    exposure; in another 22 died, including 15 children; in a third\r\n    21 died. The point to be emphasized is not the unusual brutality\r\n    of this attack but rather that such results are inevitable when\r\n    a belligerent disregards the rules of sea warfare as the Germans\r\n    have done and are doing.”\r\n\r\n    “There are hundreds of similar stories, stories of voyages for\r\n    days in open boats in Atlantic gales, of men in the water\r\n    clinging for hours to a raft and gradually dropping off one by\r\n    one, of crews being machine-gunned as they tried to lower their\r\n    boats or as they drifted away in them, of seamen being blown to\r\n    pieces by shells and torpedoes and bombs. The enemy must know\r\n    that such things are the inevitable result of the type of\r\n    warfare he has chosen to employ.” (_D-641-B_)\r\n\r\nThe total sinkings by U-boats during the war (1939 to 1945) amounted to\r\n2,775 British, Allied, and Neutral ships totalling 14,572,435 gross tons\r\n(_D-641-C_).\r\n\r\nAnother example of the ruthless nature of the actions conducted by\r\nDoenitz’s U-boat commanders, particularly as both British and German\r\nversions of the sinking are available, is the sinking of “_S. S. Sheaf\r\nMead_.” The British report, which includes the German account in the\r\nshape of a complete extract from the U-boat’s log, states:\r\n\r\n    “The British ‘_S. S. Sheaf Mead_’ was torpedoed without warning\r\n    on 27 May 1940 with the loss of 31 of the crew. The commander of\r\n    the U-boat responsible is reported to have behaved in an\r\n    exceptionally callous manner towards the men clinging to\r\n    upturned boats and pieces of wood. It was thought that this man\r\n    was Kapitaenleutnant Oehrn of U-37. The following extract from\r\n    his diary for 27 May 1940 leaves no doubt on the matter and\r\n    speaks for itself as to his behaviour.” (_D-644_)\r\n\r\nThe relevant extract from the log, at 1554 hours, reads:\r\n\r\n    “Surface. Stern [referring to the ship which has been torpedoed]\r\n    is underwater. Bows rise higher. The boats are now on the water.\r\n    Lucky for them. A picture of complete order. They lie at some\r\n    distance. The bows rear up quite high. Two men appear from\r\n    somewhere in the forward part of the ship. They leap and rush\r\n    with great bounds along the deck down to the stern. The stern\r\n    disappears. A boat capsizes. Then a boiler explosion. Two men\r\n    fly through the air, limbs outstretched. Bursting and crashing.\r\n    Then all is over. A large heap of wreckage floats up. We\r\n    approach it to identify the name. The crew have saved themselves\r\n    on wreckage. We fish out a buoy. No name on it. I ask a man on\r\n    the raft. He says, hardly turning his head—‘Nix Name.’ A young\r\n    boy in the water calls ‘Help, help, please.’ The others are very\r\n    composed. They look damp and somewhat tired. An expression of\r\n    cold hatred is on their faces. On to the old course. After\r\n    washing the paint off the buoy, the name comes to light:\r\n    Greatafield, Glasgow. 5006 gross registered tons.” (_D-644_)\r\n\r\n“On to the old course” means merely that the U-boat makes off.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Chief Engineer of the “_S. S. Sheaf Mead_” contains\r\nthis description of the situation:\r\n\r\n    “When I came to the surface I found myself on the port side,\r\n    that is, nearest to the submarine, which was only about five\r\n    yards away. The submarine Captain asked the steward the name of\r\n    the ship, which he told him, and the enemy picked up one of our\r\n    lifebuoys, but this had the name ‘_Gretaston_’ on it, as this\r\n    was the name of our ship before it was changed to ‘_Sheaf Mead_’\r\n    last January.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “She had cutaway bows, but I did not notice a net cutter. Two\r\n    men stood at the side with boat hooks to keep us off.\r\n\r\n    “They cruised around for half an hour, taking photographs of us\r\n    in the water. Otherwise they just watched us, but said nothing.\r\n    Then she submerged and went off, without offering us any\r\n    assistance whatever.” (_D-644_)\r\n\r\nThe U-boats log at 1444 hours contains a description of the sighting of\r\nthe ship, the difficulty in identification, and then the sinking:\r\n\r\n    “The distance apart is narrowing. The steamship draws in\r\n    quickly, but the position is still 40-50. I cannot see the stern\r\n    yet. Tube ready. Shall I or not? The gunnery crews are also\r\n    prepared. On the ship’s side a yellow cross in a small, square,\r\n    dark blue ground. Swedish? Presumably not. I raise the periscope\r\n    a little. Hurrah, a gun at the stern, an ack-ack gun or\r\n    something similar. Fire! I cannot miss.” (_D-644_)\r\n\r\nThe actual documents by which Doenitz and his fellow conspirators issued\r\ntheir orders in disregard of International Law indicate that the\r\ncompiler of the above reports understated the case. These orders cover\r\nnot only the period referred to in the above reports, but also the\r\nsubsequent course of the war. It is interesting to note in them the\r\nsteps by which the conspirators progressed. At first they were content\r\nwith breaching the rules of International Law to the extent of sinking\r\nmerchant ships, including neutral ships, without warning where there was\r\na reasonable prospect of being able to do so without discovery. The\r\nfacts already quoted show that the question of whether ships were\r\ndefensively armed or outside the declared operational areas was in\r\npractice immaterial.\r\n\r\nA memorandum by the German Naval War Staff, dated 22 September 1939,\r\n(_C-191_) provides:\r\n\r\n    “Flag Officer U-boats intends to give permission to U-boats to\r\n    sink without warning any vessels sailing without lights. * * *\r\n    In practice there is no opportunity for attacking at night, as\r\n    the U-boat cannot identify a target which is a shadow in a way\r\n    that entirely obviates mistakes being made. If the political\r\n    situation is such that even possible mistakes must be ruled out,\r\n    U-boats must be forbidden to make any attacks at night in waters\r\n    where French and English Naval forces or merchant ships may be\r\n    situated. On the other hand, in sea areas where only English\r\n    units are to be expected, the measures desired by F. O. U-boats\r\n    can be carried out; permission to take this step is not to be\r\n    given in writing, but need merely be based on the unspoken\r\n    approval of the Naval War Staff. U-boat commanders would be\r\n    informed by word of mouth and the sinking of a merchant ship\r\n    must be justified in the War Diary as due to possible confusion\r\n    with a warship or an auxiliary cruiser. In the meanwhile,\r\n    U-boats in the English Channel have received instructions to\r\n    attack all vessels sailing without lights.” (_C-191_)\r\n\r\nThe War Diary of the Naval War Staff of the German Admiralty contains\r\nthe following report by Ia (Staff Operations Officer on the Naval War\r\nStaff) on directive of the Armed Forces High Command of 30 December\r\n1939:\r\n\r\n    “According to this the Fuehrer, on report of the Commander in\r\n    Chief, Navy, has decided:\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) Greek merchant vessels are to be treated as enemy vessels\r\n    in the zone blockaded by U.S.A. and Britain.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) In the Bristol Channel all ships may be attacked without\r\n    warning. For external consumption these attacks should be given\r\n    out as hits by mines.\r\n\r\n    “Both measures may be taken with immediate effect.” (_C-21_)\r\n\r\nAnother report by Ia, refers to intensified measures in naval and air\r\nwarfare in connection with “_Fall Gelb_”.\r\n\r\n    “In consequence of this Directive, the Navy will authorize,\r\n    simultaneously with the general intensification of the war, the\r\n    sinking by U-boats, without any warning, of all ships in those\r\n    waters near the enemy coasts in which _mines can be employed_.\r\n    In this case, for external consumption, pretence should be made\r\n    that mines are being used. The behaviour of, and use of weapons\r\n    by, U-boats should be adapted to this purpose.” (_C-21_)\r\n\r\nA third extract from the Naval War Diary, dated 6 January 1940, states:\r\n\r\n    “* * * the Fuehrer has in principle agreed (see minutes of\r\n    report of C. in C. Navy of 30 December) to authorize firing\r\n    without warning whilst maintaining the pretence of mine hits in\r\n    certain parts of the American blockaded zone.” (_C-21_)\r\n\r\nWhereupon, the order is given to Flag Officer, Submarines, carrying out\r\nthat decision (_C-21_).\r\n\r\nThe report for 18 January 1940 states:\r\n\r\n    “The High Command of the Armed Forces has issued the following\r\n    Directive dated 17th of January, cancelling the previous order\r\n    concerning intensified measures of warfare against merchantmen.\r\n\r\n    “The Navy will authorize, with immediate effect, the sinking\r\n    without warning by U-Boats of all ships in those waters near the\r\n    enemy coasts in which the use of mines can be pretended. U-Boats\r\n    must adapt their behavior and employment of weapons to the\r\n    pretence, which is to be maintained in these cases, that the\r\n    hits were caused by mines. Ships of the United States, Italy,\r\n    Japan and Russia are exempted from these attacks.” (_C-21_)\r\n\r\nAn extract from the BDU War Diary (Doenitz’s War Diary) dated 18 July\r\n1941, reveals a further extension of the above order so as to cut down\r\nthe protected categories:\r\n\r\n    “Supplementary to the order forbidding, for the time being,\r\n    attacks on U. S. warships and merchant vessels in the\r\n    operational area of the North Atlantic, the Fuehrer has ordered\r\n    the following:\r\n\r\n    “1. Attack on U. S. merchant vessels sailing in British or U. S.\r\n    convoys or independently is authorized in the original\r\n    operational area which corresponds in its dimensions to the U.\r\n    S. blockade zone and which does not include the sea-route U. S.\r\n    to Iceland.” (_C-118_)\r\n\r\nAs these orders show, at one date the ships of a particular neutral\r\nunder certain conditions could be sunk, while those of another could\r\nnot. The attitude to be adopted toward ships of particular neutrals\r\nchanged at various times, for Doenitz conducted the U-Boat war against\r\nneutrals with cynical opportunism. It all depended on the political\r\nrelationship of Germany toward a particular country at a particular time\r\nwhether her ships were sunk or not.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Orders Concerning Treatment of Survivors._ A series of orders\r\nled up to the issue of an order which enjoined U-Boat commanders not\r\nmerely to abstain from rescuing crews and give them no assistance, but\r\ndeliberately to annihilate them.\r\n\r\nAmong these preliminary standing orders of the U-Boat Command is Order\r\nNumber 154, signed by Doenitz:\r\n\r\n    “Paragraph (_e_). Do not pick up survivors and take them with\r\n    you. Do not worry about the merchant-ship’s boats. Weather\r\n    conditions and distance from land play no part. Have a care only\r\n    for your own ship and strive only to attain your next success as\r\n    soon as possible. We must be harsh in this war. The enemy began\r\n    the war in order to destroy us, so nothing else matters.”\r\n    (_D-642_)\r\n\r\nIn 1942, when the United States entered the war with its enormous\r\nship-building capacity, the change thus brought about necessitated a\r\nfurther adjustment in the methods adopted by the U-Boats. Doenitz\r\naccordingly issued an order, which intended not merely the sinking of\r\nmerchant ships, not merely the abstention from rescue of the crews, but\r\ntheir deliberate extermination.\r\n\r\nThe course of events is shown by the record of a conversation between\r\nHitler and the Japanese Ambassador, Oshima, (_D-423_) in the presence of\r\nRibbentrop, on 3 January 1942:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer, using a map, explains to the Japanese Ambassador\r\n    the present position of marine warfare in the Atlantic,\r\n    emphasizing that he considers his most important task is to get\r\n    the U-Boat warfare going in full swing. The U-Boats are being\r\n    reorganized. Firstly, he had recalled all U-Boats operating in\r\n    the Atlantic. As mentioned before, they would now be posted\r\n    outside United States ports. Later, they would be off Freetown\r\n    and the larger boats even as far down as Capetown.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “After having given further explanations on the map, the Fuehrer\r\n    pointed out that, however many ships the United States built,\r\n    one of their main problems would be the lack of personnel. For\r\n    that reason, even merchant ships would be sunk without warning\r\n    with the intention of killing as many of the crew as possible.\r\n    Once it gets around that most of the seamen are lost in the\r\n    sinkings, the Americans would soon have difficulties in\r\n    enlisting new people. The training of sea-going personnel takes\r\n    a very long time. We are fighting for our existence and our\r\n    attitude cannot be ruled by any humane feelings. For this reason\r\n    he must give the order that in case foreign seamen could not be\r\n    taken prisoner, which is not always possible on the sea, U-boats\r\n    were to surface after torpedoing and shoot up the lifeboats.\r\n\r\n    “Ambassador Oshima heartily agreed with the Fuehrer’s comments,\r\n    and said that the Japanese too are forced to follow these\r\n    methods.” (_D-423_)\r\n\r\nAn extract from the BDU War Diary of 16 September 1942 is part of the\r\nstory in the sense that it was on the following day that the\r\nannihilation order was issued. It records an attack on a U-boat, which\r\nwas rescuing survivors, chiefly the Italian survivors of the Allied\r\nliner “_Laconia_,” when it was attacked by an Allied aircraft (_D-446_).\r\n\r\nA Top Secret order, sent to all commanding officers of U-boats from\r\nDoenitz’s headquarters, dated 17 September 1942, provided:\r\n\r\n    “1. No attempt of any kind must be made at rescuing members of\r\n    ships sunk, and this includes picking up persons in the water\r\n    and putting them in lifeboats, righting capsized lifeboats, and\r\n    handing over food and water. Rescue runs counter to the\r\n    rudimentary demands of warfare for the destruction of enemy\r\n    ships and crews.\r\n\r\n    “2. Orders for bringing in Captains and Chief Engineers still\r\n    apply.\r\n\r\n    “3. Rescue the shipwrecked only if their statements will be of\r\n    importance for your boat.\r\n\r\n    “4. Be harsh, having in mind that the enemy takes no regard of\r\n    women and children in his bombing attacks on German cities.”\r\n    (_D-630_)\r\n\r\nThe intentions of this carefully worded order are made clear by an\r\nextract from Doenitz’s War Diary which is personally signed by Doenitz.\r\nThe War Diary entry for 17 September 1942 reads:\r\n\r\n    “The attention of all commanding officers is again drawn to the\r\n    fact that all efforts to rescue members of the crews of ships\r\n    which have been sunk contradict the most primitive demands for\r\n    the conduct of warfare by annihilating enemy ships and their\r\n    crews. Orders concerning the bringing in of the Captains and\r\n    Chief Engineers still stand.” (_D-630_).\r\n\r\nIn this connection, a telegram from the Commander of the U-boat\r\n“_Schacht_” to Doenitz’s headquarters, and the reply, are significant.\r\n“_Schacht_” had been taking part in the rescue of survivors from the\r\n“_Laconia_.” The telegram from “_Schacht_,” dated 18 September 1942,\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    “163 Italians handed over to ‘_Annamite_.’ Navigating Officer of\r\n    ‘_Laconia_’ and another English Officer on board.” (_D-630_)\r\n\r\nThe telegram goes on to set out the position of English and Polish\r\nsurvivors in boats.\r\n\r\nThe reply from Doenitz’s headquarters was sent on the 20th:\r\n\r\n    “Action as in wireless telegram message of 17th of September was\r\n    wrong. Boat was detailed to rescue Italian allies and not for\r\n    the rescue of English and Poles.” (_D-630_)\r\n\r\nSuch were Doenitz’s plans before the bombing incident ever occurred.\r\n\r\n“Operation Order Atlantic No. 56,” dated 7 October 1943, contains the\r\nsailing orders of a U-boat (_D-663_). Although the date of this order is\r\n7 October 1943, in fact it is only a reproduction of an order issued\r\nearlier, in the autumn of 1942. The following is an extract from this\r\norder:\r\n\r\n    “Rescue ships: A so-called rescue ship is generally attached to\r\n    every convoy, a special ship of up to 3000 gross registered\r\n    tons, which is intended for the picking up of survivors after\r\n    U-boat attacks. These ships are, for the most part, equipped\r\n    with a shipborne aircraft and large motor-boats, are strongly\r\n    armed with depth-charge throwers, and very manoeuverable, so\r\n    that they are often called U-Boat Traps by the commander. In\r\n    view of the desired destruction of ships’ crews, their sinking\r\n    is of great value.” (_D-663_)\r\n\r\nThe Prosecution does not complain against attacks on rescue ships. They\r\nare not entitled to protection. But the point of the foregoing order to\r\nU-boats was that priority in attack should be given to rescue ships.\r\nThis order, therefore, is closely allied with the order of 17 September\r\n1942 (_D-630_): in view of the Allied shipbuilding program the German\r\nNavy had resolved to take all means to prevent Allied ships from being\r\nmanned.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, it would appear from the War Diary entry of 17 September\r\nthat orders on the lines discussed between Hitler and Oshima were, in\r\nfact, issued. They have not, however, been captured. It may be that they\r\nwere issued orally, and that Doenitz awaited a suitable opportunity\r\nbefore confirming them. The incident of the bombing of the U-boats\r\ndetailed to rescue the Italian survivors from the “_Laconia_” afforded\r\nthe opportunity, and the order to all commanders was issued. Its intent\r\nis clear when it is considered in the light of the War Diary entry. The\r\nwording is, of course, extremely careful, but to any officer of\r\nexperience its intention was obvious: he would know that deliberate\r\naction to annihilate survivors would be approved under that order.\r\n\r\nIt may be contended that this order, although perhaps unfortunately\r\nphrased, was merely intended to stop a commander from jeopardizing his\r\nship by attempting a rescue, which had become increasingly dangerous as\r\na result of the extended coverage of the ocean by Allied aircraft; and\r\nthat the notorious action of U-Boat Commander Eck in sinking the Greek\r\nsteamer “_Peleus_” and then machine-gunning the crew on their rafts in\r\nthe water, was an exception; and that, although it may be true that a\r\ncopy of the order was on board, this action was taken solely, as Eck\r\nhimself swore, on his own initiative.\r\n\r\nIn reply it may be said that if the intention of this order was to stop\r\nrescue attempts, in the interests of the preservation of the U-boat, it\r\nwould have been done by calling attention to Standing Order 154.\r\nSecondly, this very fact would have been prominently stated in the\r\norder. Drastic orders of this nature are not drafted by experienced\r\nstaff officers without the greatest care and an eye to their possible\r\ncapture by the enemy. Thirdly, if it was necessary to avoid the risks\r\nattendant on surfacing, not only would this have been stated but there\r\nwould have been no question of taking any prisoners at all except\r\npossibly in circumstances where virtually no risk in surfacing was to be\r\napprehended. Fourthly, the final sentence of the first paragraph would\r\nhave read very differently. And fifthly, if in fact—and the Prosecution\r\ndoes not accept it—Doenitz did not mean to enjoin murder, his order was\r\nso worded that he cannot escape the responsibility which attaches to\r\nsuch a document.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given by Admiral Doenitz with regard to the murder of\r\nshipwrecked Allied seamen are described in an affidavit by _Oberleutnant\r\nZur See_ Peter Josef Heisig (_D-566_). (Heisig was called as a\r\nprosecution witness in the case against Doenitz and testified on direct\r\nexamination to the same effect, in substance, as the statements in his\r\naffidavit.) In September 1942 Heisig was a Midshipman in a training\r\ncourse for U-boat officers of the watch. On the last day of the course\r\nGrand Admiral Doenitz, who was then Commander-in-Chief, U-boats, held an\r\ninspection tour and made a speech to the officers in training. Heisig\r\ndescribes the content of Doenitz’s speech as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * According to news received from America we were bound to\r\n    reckon with the possibility that in the Allied countries more\r\n    than 1,000,000 net registered tons of new merchant shipping\r\n    space would be brought into service monthly. This was more\r\n    shipping space than would be sunk even with good U-boat\r\n    successes. The bottleneck of the Allies lay only in the problem\r\n    of personnel for these newly built ships. The Atlantic route was\r\n    too dangerous for seamen so that they even had to be brought\r\n    aboard ship under compulsion. This was the point where we, the\r\n    U-boat crews, had to take a hand. He therefore demanded that we\r\n    should from now on carry on total warfare against ship and crew.\r\n    That meant: so far as possible, no seaman from a sunk ship was\r\n    to get home any more. Only thus could the supply line of the\r\n    British Isles be seriously endangered and only thus in the long\r\n    run could we strike a noticeable blow at Allied merchant\r\n    shipping traffic. In this way it would be impossible for the\r\n    opponent even to make use of his newly built ships, since no\r\n    more crews would be available to him. After the sinking of a\r\n    ship, every possibility of rescue must be denied to the crew,\r\n    through the destruction of every means of saving life.\r\n\r\n    “I later discussed these remarks of Admiral Doenitz’s with the\r\n    others, and all present unanimously and unambiguously took them\r\n    to mean that after the sinking of a ship, all possibility of\r\n    escape, whether in boats, on rafts, or by any other means, must\r\n    be denied to the crew and the destruction of the crew was to be\r\n    attempted by every means. This mode of warfare was for me as for\r\n    most of my comrades completely new. Owing to Admiral Doenitz’s\r\n    authoritative position, it was nevertheless fully and completely\r\n    accepted by many of them. He sought to invalidate in advance any\r\n    doubts which might arise, by pointing to the air war and the\r\n    bombing.” (_D-566_)\r\n\r\nFurther light on the real meaning of the Top Secret radio message sent\r\nby the Commander in Chief, U-boats, to all U-boat and operational\r\nflotillas in September 1942 (_D-630_) is contained in the statement of\r\n_Korvettenkapitaen_ Karl Heinz Moehle (_382-PS_). (Moehle was called as\r\na Prosecution witness in the case against Doenitz and testified on\r\ndirect examination to the same effect, in substance, as the statements\r\nin his affidavit.) Concerning this order which was couched in terms of a\r\nprohibition against the rescue of survivors, Moehle states as follows:\r\n\r\n    “This W/T message was without any doubt, sent out at the\r\n    instigation of the Commander in Chief U-boats himself, i.e.\r\n    Grand Admiral Doenitz. In view of my knowledge of the way in\r\n    which the Staff of the Chief Command U-boats worked, I consider\r\n    it quite impossible that an order of such importance could have\r\n    been given without his knowledge.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “So far as concerns the order itself, it undoubtedly states, and\r\n    in particular for those who know the manner in which Commander\r\n    in Chief U-Boats is wont to give his orders, that the High\r\n    Command regard it as desirable that not only ships but also\r\n    their crews should be regarded as objects of attack, i.e. that\r\n    they should be destroyed; at that time German propaganda was\r\n    continually stressing the shortage of crews for enemy merchant\r\n    ships and the consequent difficulties. I too understood this\r\n    order in that way.\r\n\r\n    “Had the point of view of the High Command been otherwise the\r\n    order would undoubtedly have been expressed in different words.\r\n    It would then only have stated that for reasons of security\r\n    rescue measures were to cease and this order would have passed\r\n    as a normal secret W/T message. It was perhaps even the\r\n    intention that this order could be interpreted in two ways and\r\n    the reason may be that in the first place, it contravenes\r\n    international laws of warfare and secondly, that it was an order\r\n    which must give rise to serious conflicts of conscience in\r\n    commanding officers.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “To conclude, I can only stress that the order of September 1942\r\n    appeared to me personally to go too far and I am in total\r\n    disagreement with it at heart. As a serving officer I had\r\n    however to carry out the command to pass on this order to\r\n    commanding officers for their instruction.\r\n\r\n    “During the long time that I was senior officer of the Flotilla\r\n    no single commanding officer mentioned to me that he could not\r\n    reconcile obedience to this order with his conscience and that\r\n    he was therefore unable to carry it out.” (_382-PS_)\r\n\r\nMoehle graphically describes Doenitz’s incitement of his men to the\r\nmurder of survivors:\r\n\r\n    “A type VII boat (500-tonner) reported in her war log that when\r\n    outward bound from a base in France she met far out in the Bay\r\n    of Biscay a raft with five enemy airmen, but was not able to\r\n    take them on board owing to shortage of room (she had a\r\n    complement of 54 and carried full provisions for 14 weeks). The\r\n    boat therefore proceeded without taking any notice of the\r\n    survivors.\r\n\r\n    “This action of the U-boat was vehemently denounced by the\r\n    Commander in Chief U-boats’ staff. It was stated that she would\r\n    have acted more correctly in destroying this raft since it was\r\n    highly probably that the enemy air crew would be rescued by the\r\n    enemy and in the meantime might once more have destroyed a\r\n    German U-boat.\r\n\r\n    “This occurrence made the views of the Commander in Chief\r\n    U-boats clear to me.” (_382-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs senior officer of the Fifth U-boat Flotilla, it was Moehle’s duty to\r\ntransmit orders from the Commander in Chief, U-boats, to commanding\r\nofficers of U-boats. In this connection, Doenitz’s ambiguous order\r\nagainst the rescue of survivors caused difficulties.\r\n\r\n    “I was wont to pass on this controversial and serious order with\r\n    more or less the following words:—‘I have now to inform you of\r\n    a High Command order concerning conduct towards survivors. It is\r\n    a very ticklish matter. Commander in Chief U-boats in September\r\n    1942 gave the following order in an ‘officers only’ signal (* *\r\n    * the exact words of the order were then read out).’\r\n\r\n    “Since I am myself in my innermost conscience in disagreement\r\n    with this order, I was very glad that in most cases commanding\r\n    officers raised no queries and I was therefore relieved of any\r\n    further discussion on this point.\r\n\r\n    “Sometimes however queries were raised and I was wont to answer\r\n    somewhat as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “‘I will explain the viewpoint of the High Command, which gave\r\n    this order, by reference to the following event:’ I then\r\n    mentioned the example of the Type VII boat in the Bay of Biscay\r\n    together with the explanation and viewpoint expressed to me by\r\n    Commander in Chief U-boats’ staff. I then went on to say,\r\n    ‘Gentlemen, you must yourselves decide what is compatible with\r\n    your own consciences. The safety of your own boat must always\r\n    remain your prime consideration.’”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I also remember that many commanding officers after the order\r\n    of September 1942 had been read said, ‘That is quite clear and\r\n    unequivocal however hard it may be.’ Had this order been given\r\n    to me as a commanding officer I would have taken note of it in\r\n    silence but in practice would always have been able with a clear\r\n    conscience not to carry it out since I consider I would endanger\r\n    my own boat by acting in this way, (i.e., by shooting at\r\n    lift-boats).” (_382-PS_)\r\n\r\nFinally, Moehle describes the orders to omit from U-boat logs the\r\nnotation of any actions in violation of International Law:\r\n\r\n    “There was an order—I do not remember whether it was in the\r\n    form of a written or verbal instruction—that no events during a\r\n    war patrol which contravened established international\r\n    agreements should be entered in the war log. I believe that the\r\n    reason for this order was that eight copies were made of war\r\n    logs and were available to many authorities; there was always\r\n    the danger therefore that events of this nature would become\r\n    known and it was undoubtedly undesirable for reasons of\r\n    propaganda that this should be so.\r\n\r\n    “Events of this nature were only to be reported if asked for\r\n    when commanding officers made their personal reports; these were\r\n    invariably made after every patrol to Commander in Chief U-boats\r\n    or later in certain instances to Captain U-boats.” (_382-PS_)\r\n\r\nTwo cases may be noted in which the order of 17 September 1942 (_D-630_)\r\nwas apparently put into effect. The first case is the sinking of a steam\r\ntrawler, the “_Noreen Mary_,” which was sunk by U-247 on 5 July 1944.\r\nThe log of the U-Boat shows that at 1943 hours two torpedoes were fired,\r\nwhich missed (_D-645_).\r\n\r\nAt 2055 hours the log reads:\r\n\r\n    “Surfaced.\r\n\r\n    “Fishing Vessels: [Bearings of 3 ships given].\r\n\r\n    “Engaged the nearest. She stops after three minutes.” (_D-645_)\r\n\r\nThere follows an account of a shot fired as the trawler lay stopped, and\r\nthen, the final entry:\r\n\r\n    “Sunk by flak, with shots into her side. Sank by the stern.”\r\n    (_D-645_)\r\n\r\nThe U-Boat Command made this comment on the action:\r\n\r\n    “Recognized success: Fishing vessel ‘_Noreen Mary_’ sunk by\r\n    flak.” (_D-645_)\r\n\r\nAn affidavit by James MacAlister, who was a deck-hand on board the\r\n“_Noreen Mary_” at the time of the sinking, describes the torpedo tracks\r\nwhich missed the trawler, and continues as follows:\r\n\r\n    “At 2110 hours, while we were still trawling, the submarine\r\n    surfaced on our starboard beam, about 50 yards to the northeast\r\n    of us, and without any warning immediately opened fire on the\r\n    ship with a machine gun. We were 18 miles west from Cape Wrath,\r\n    on a north-westerly course, making 3 knots. The weather was fine\r\n    and clear, sunny, with good visibility. The sea was smooth, with\r\n    light airs.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “When the submarine surfaced I saw men climbing out of the\r\n    conning tower. The skipper [of the trawler] thought at first the\r\n    submarine was British, but when she opened fire he immediately\r\n    slackened the brake to take the weight off gear, and increased\r\n    to full speed, which was about 10 knots. The submarine chased\r\n    us, firing her machine gun, and with the first rounds killed two\r\n    or three men, including the skipper, who were on deck and had\r\n    not had time to take cover. The submarine then started using a\r\n    heavier gun from her conning tower, the first shot from which\r\n    burst the boiler, enveloping everything in steam and stopping\r\n    the ship.\r\n\r\n    “By now the crew had taken cover, but in spite of this all but\r\n    four were killed. The submarine then commenced to circle round\r\n    ahead of the vessel, and passed down her port side with both\r\n    guns firing continuously. We were listing slowly to port all the\r\n    time but did not catch fire.\r\n\r\n    “The Mate and I attempted to release the lifeboat, which was\r\n    aft, but the Mate was killed whilst doing so, so I abandoned the\r\n    attempt. I then went below into the pantry, which was below the\r\n    water line, for shelter. The ship was listing more and more to\r\n    port, until finally at 2210 she rolled right over and sank, and\r\n    the only four men left alive on board were thrown into the sea.\r\n    I do not know where the other three men had taken cover during\r\n    this time, as I did not hear or see them until they were in the\r\n    water.\r\n\r\n    “I swam around until I came across the broken bow of our\r\n    lifeboat, which was upside down, and managed to scramble on top\r\n    of it. Even now the submarine did not submerge, but deliberately\r\n    steamed in my direction and when only 60 to 70 yards away fired\r\n    directly at me with a short burst from the machine gun. As their\r\n    intention was quite obvious, I fell into the water and remained\r\n    there until the submarine ceased firing and submerged, after\r\n    which I climbed back on to the bottom of the boat. The submarine\r\n    had been firing her guns for a full hour.” (_D-645_)\r\n\r\nThe affidavit goes on to describe the attempts of the Second Engineer\r\nand others to rescue themselves and to help each other; they were later\r\npicked up by another trawler. The affidavit continues:\r\n\r\n    “Whilst on board the ‘_Lady Madeleine_’ the Second Engineer and\r\n    I had our wounds dressed. I learned later that the Second\r\n    Engineer had 48 shrapnel wounds, also a piece of steel wire 2½\r\n    inches long embedded in his body. * * * I had 14 shrapnel\r\n    wounds.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “This is my fourth wartime experience, having served in the\r\n    whalers ‘_Sylvester_’ (mined) and ‘_New Seville_’ (torpedoed),\r\n    and the Trawler ‘_Ocean Tide_’, which ran ashore.\r\n\r\n    “As a result of this attack by U-boat, the casualties were six\r\n    killed, two missing, two injured.” (_D-645_).\r\n\r\nThe next case is that of the ship “_Antonico_”, which was torpedoed, set\r\nafire, and sunk on 28 September 1942, off the coast of French Guiana.\r\nThe date of the incident is some eleven days after the issue of the\r\norder (_D-630_). A statement given by the Second Officer describes the\r\nattack on the ship, which by then was on fire (_D-647_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * That the witness saw the dead on the deck of the\r\n    ‘_Antonico_’ as he and his crew tried to swing out their\r\n    lifeboat; that the attack was fulminant, lasting almost 20\r\n    minutes; and that the witness already in the lifeboat tried to\r\n    get away from the side of the ‘_Antonico_’ in order to avoid\r\n    being dragged down by the same ‘_Antonico_’ and also because she\r\n    was the aggressor’s target; that the night was dark, and it was\r\n    thus difficult to see the submarine, but that the fire aboard\r\n    the ‘_Antonico_’ lit up the locality in which she was\r\n    submerging, facilitating the enemy to see the two lifeboats\r\n    trying to get away; that the enemy ruthlessly machined-gunned\r\n    the defenseless sailors in No. 2 lifeboat, in which the witness\r\n    found himself, and killed the Second Pilot Arnaldo de Andrade de\r\n    Lima, and wounded three of the crew; that the witness gave\r\n    orders to his company to throw themselves’ overboard to save\r\n    themselves from the bullets; in so doing, they were protected\r\n    and out of sight behind the lifeboat, which was already filled\r\n    with water; even so the lifeboat continued to be attacked. At\r\n    that time the witness and his companions were about 20 meters in\r\n    distance from the submarine.” (_D-647_)\r\n\r\nThe U-boat’s log in that case is not available, but it may be surmised,\r\nin view of the order that nothing compromising should be included in\r\nentries in logs, that it would be no more helpful than in the case of\r\nthe previous incident.\r\n\r\nA broadcast by a German Naval War Reporter on the long wave propaganda\r\nservice from Friesland, (_D-646-A_) in English, on 11 March 1943,\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “Santa Lucia, in the West Indies, was an ideal setting for\r\n    romance, but nowadays it was dangerous to sail in these\r\n    waters—dangerous for the British and Americans and for all the\r\n    colored people who were at their beck and call. Recently a\r\n    U-boat operating in these waters sighted an enemy windjammer.\r\n    Streams of tracer bullets were poured into the sails and most of\r\n    the Negro crew leaped overboard. Knowing that this might be a\r\n    decoy ship, the submarine steamed cautiously to within 20 yards,\r\n    when hand grenades were hurled into the rigging. The remainder\r\n    of the Negroes then leaped into the sea. The windjammer sank.\r\n    There remained only wreckage. Lifeboats packed with men, and\r\n    sailors swimming. The sharks in the distance licked their teeth\r\n    in expectation. Such was the fate of those who sailed for\r\n    Britain and America.” (_D-646-A_)\r\n\r\nThis statement shows that it was the policy of the enemy to seek to\r\nterrorize crews. It is a part with the order with regard to rescue ships\r\nand with the order on the destruction of steamers.\r\n\r\nAfter Doenitz succeeded Raeder as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy he\r\npresumably also succeeded to the equivalent rank of a Minister of the\r\nReich, which Raeder had held (_2098-PS_).\r\n\r\nAn official report certified by an official of the British Admiralty\r\nsets out the number of meetings, the dates of the meetings, and those\r\npresent, on the occasion of meetings between Doenitz or his\r\nrepresentative with Hitler from the time that he succeeded Raeder until\r\nthe end (_D-648_). The certificate states:\r\n\r\n    “* * * I have compiled from them [captured documents] the\r\n    attached list of occasions on which Admiral Doenitz attended\r\n    conferences at Hitler’s headquarters. The list of other senior\r\n    officials who attended the same conferences is added when this\r\n    information was contained in the captured documents concerned. I\r\n    certify that the list is a true extract from the collective\r\n    documents which I have examined, and which are in the possession\r\n    of the British Admiralty, London.”\r\n\r\nEither Admiral Doenitz or his deputy, Konteradmiral Voss, was present at\r\neach of the numerous meetings listed. Among those who were also\r\nconstantly present were Speer, Keitel, Jodl, Ribbentrop, Goering, and\r\nHimmler or his lieutenants, Fegelein or Kaltenbrunner. The inference is\r\nclear that from the time that he succeeded Raeder, Doenitz was one of\r\nthe rulers of the Reich and was undoubtedly aware of all major decisions\r\nof policy.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Order to Kill Commandos._ An internal memorandum of the Naval\r\nWar Staff, written by the division dealing with International Law to\r\nanother division, discusses the order of 18 October 1942, with regard to\r\nthe shooting of Commandos (_C-178_).\r\n\r\nDoubt appears to have arisen in some quarters with regard to the\r\nunderstanding of this order. Accordingly, in the last sentence of the\r\nmemorandum it is suggested:\r\n\r\n    “As far as the Navy is concerned, it remains to be seen whether\r\n    or not this case should be used to make sure, after a conference\r\n    with the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, that all departments\r\n    concerned have an entirely clear conception regarding the\r\n    treatment of members of commando units.” (_C-178_)\r\n\r\nWhether that conference took place or not is not known. The document is\r\ndated some 11 days after Doenitz had taken over command from Raeder.\r\n\r\nBut in July 1943, the Navy handed over to the SD Norwegian and British\r\nNavy personnel, whom the Navy decided came under the terms of the order,\r\nfor shooting. An affidavit by a British Barrister-at-Law who served as\r\njudge advocate at the trial of the members of the SD who executed the\r\norder states (_D-649_):\r\n\r\n    “The accused were charged with committing a war crime, in that\r\n    they at Ulven, Norway, in or about the month of July 1943, in\r\n    violation of the laws and usages of war, were concerned in the\r\n    killing of * * *” [there follow the names of six personnel of\r\n    the Norwegian Navy, including one officer, and one telegraphist\r\n    of the British Navy, prisoners of war.].\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “There was evidence before the Court, which was not challenged\r\n    by the Defense, that Motor Torpedo Boat No. 345 set out from\r\n    Lerwick in the Shetlands on a naval operation for the purpose of\r\n    making torpedo attacks on German shipping off the Norwegian\r\n    coast, and for the purpose of laying mines in the same area. The\r\n    persons mentioned in the charge were all the crew of the Torpedo\r\n    Boat.\r\n\r\n    “The defense did not challenge that each member of the crew was\r\n    wearing uniform at the time of capture, and there was abundant\r\n    evidence from many persons, several of whom were German, that\r\n    they were wearing uniform at all times after their capture.\r\n\r\n    “On 27th July, 1943, the Torpedo Boat reached the island of Aspo\r\n    off the Norwegian coast, north of Bergen. On the following day\r\n    the whole of the crew were captured and were taken on board a\r\n    German naval vessel which was under the command of Admiral von\r\n    Schrader, the Admiral of the west coast. The crew were taken to\r\n    the Bergenhus, where they had arrived by 11 p. m. on 28th July.\r\n    The crew were there interrogated by Leut. H. P. W. W. Fanger, a\r\n    Naval Leutnant of the Reserve, on the orders of\r\n    Korvettenkapitaen Egon Drascher, both of the German Naval\r\n    Intelligence Service. This interrogation was carried out upon\r\n    the orders of the staff of the Admiral of the west coast. Leut.\r\n    Fanger reported to the Officer in Charge of the Intelligence\r\n    Branch at Bergen that in his opinion all the members of the crew\r\n    were entitled to be treated as prisoners of war, and that\r\n    officer in turn reported both orally and in writing to the Sea\r\n    Commander, Bergen, and in writing to the Admiral of the west\r\n    coast.\r\n\r\n    “The interrogation by the Naval Intelligence Branch was\r\n    concluded in the early hours of 29th July, and almost\r\n    immediately all the members of the crew were handed over on the\r\n    immediate orders of the Sea Commander, Bergen, to\r\n    Obersturmbannfuehrer of the SD, Hans Wilhelm Blomberg, who was\r\n    at that time Kommandeur of the Sicherheitspolizei at Bergen.\r\n    This followed a meeting between Blomberg and Admiral von\r\n    Schrader, at which a copy of the Fuehrer order of the 18th\r\n    October 1942 was shown to Blomberg. This order dealt with the\r\n    classes of persons who were to be excluded from the protection\r\n    of the Geneva Convention and were not to be treated as prisoners\r\n    of war, but when captured were to be handed over to the SD.\r\n    Admiral von Schrader told Blomberg that the crew of this Torpedo\r\n    Boat were to be handed over in accordance with the Fuehrer\r\n    order, to the SD.” (_D-649_)\r\n\r\nThe affidavit goes on to describe the interrogation by officials of the\r\nSD. These officials took the same view as the Naval Intelligence\r\nofficers, that the crew were entitled to be treated as prisoners of war.\r\nNevertheless, the crew were taken out and shot by an execution squad\r\ncomposed of members of the SD. The affidavit concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n    “It appeared from the evidence that in March or April, 1945, an\r\n    order from the Fuehrer Headquarters, signed by Keitel, was\r\n    transmitted to the German authorities in Norway. The substance\r\n    of the order was that members of the crew of commando raids who\r\n    fell into German captivity were from that date to be treated as\r\n    ordinary prisoners of war. This order referred specifically to\r\n    the Fuehrer order referred to above.” (_D-649_)\r\n\r\nThe date mentioned is important; it was time “in March or April, 1945,”\r\nfor these men to put their affairs in order.\r\n\r\n(4) _Reasons for Not Renouncing the Geneva Convention._ The minutes of\r\nconferences on 19 and 20 February 1945 between Doenitz and Hitler read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer is considering whether or not Germany should\r\n    renounce the Geneva Convention * * *” [the 1929 Prisoners of War\r\n    Convention].\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer orders the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy to\r\n    consider the pros and cons of their step and to state his\r\n    opinion as soon as possible.” (_C-158_)\r\n\r\nDoenitz then stated his opinion in the presence of Jodl and a\r\nrepresentative of Ribbentrop:\r\n\r\n    “* * * On the contrary, the disadvantages [of renouncing the\r\n    convention] outweigh the advantages. It would be better to carry\r\n    out the measures considered necessary without warning, and at\r\n    all costs to save face with the outer world.” (_C-158_)\r\n\r\nAn extract from the minutes of another meeting between Doenitz and\r\nHitler, on 1 July 1944,—the extract is signed by Doenitz—states:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Regarding the General Strike in Copenhagen, the Fuehrer\r\n    says that the only weapon to deal with terror is terror. Court\r\n    martial proceedings create martyrs. History shows that the names\r\n    of such men are on everybody’s lips, whereas there is silence\r\n    with regard to the many thousands who have lost their lives in\r\n    similar circumstances without court martial proceedings.”\r\n    (_C-171_)\r\n\r\n(5) _Use of Concentration Camp Labor in Shipyards._ In a memorandum\r\nsigned by Doenitz sometime late in 1944, which was distributed to\r\nHitler, Keitel, Jodl, Speer, and the Supreme Command of the Air Force,\r\nDoenitz reviews German shipping losses, and concludes:\r\n\r\n    “Furthermore, I propose reinforcing the shipyard working parties\r\n    by prisoners from the concentration camps and as a special\r\n    measure for relieving the present shortage of coppersmiths,\r\n    especially in U-boat construction, I propose to divert\r\n    coppersmiths from the construction of locomotives to\r\n    shipbuilding.” (_C-195_)\r\n\r\nIn dealing with sabotage, Doenitz has this to say:\r\n\r\n    “Since, elsewhere, measures for exacting atonement taken against\r\n    whole working parties amongst whom sabotage occurred, have\r\n    proved successful, and, for example, the shipyard sabotage in\r\n    France was completely suppressed, possibly similar measures for\r\n    the Scandinavian countries will come under consideration.”\r\n    (_C-195_)\r\n\r\nItem 2 of the summing-up reads:\r\n\r\n    “12,000 concentration camp prisoners will be employed in the\r\n    shipyards as additional labor (security service [SD] agrees to\r\n    this)” (_C-195_).\r\n\r\nIt was not for nothing that at these meetings Himmler and his\r\nLieutenants, Fegelein and Kaltenbrunner, were present.\r\n\r\nThey were not there to discuss U-boats or the use of battleships. It is\r\nclear from this document that Doenitz knew all about concentration camps\r\nand concentration camp labor, and as one of the rulers of Germany he\r\nmust bear his full share of that responsibility.\r\n\r\n(6) _Doenitz’s Incitement of Ruthless Conduct By His Men._ The orders\r\nissued by Doenitz in April 1945 (_D-650_) show his fanatical adherence\r\nto the Nazi creed, and his preparedness even at that stage to continue a\r\nhopeless war at the expense of human life, and with the certainty of\r\nincreased destruction and misery to his country:\r\n\r\n    “I therefore demand of the commanding officers of the Navy: That\r\n    they clearly and unambiguously follow the path of military duty,\r\n    whatever may happen. I demand of them that they stamp out\r\n    ruthlessly all signs and tendencies among the men which endanger\r\n    the following of this path.\r\n\r\n    “I demand from Senior Commanders that they should take just as\r\n    ruthless action against any commander who does not do his\r\n    military duty. If a commander does not think he has the moral\r\n    strength to occupy his position as a leader in this sense, he\r\n    must report this immediately. He will then be used as a soldier\r\n    in this fateful struggle in some position in which he is not\r\n    burdened with any tasks as a leader.” (_D-650_)\r\n\r\nIn the secret Battle order of the day of 19 April 1945, Doenitz gives an\r\nexample of the type of under-officer who should be promoted:\r\n\r\n    “An example: In a prison camp of the auxiliary cruiser\r\n    ‘_Cormorau_’, in Austria, a petty officer acting as camp senior\r\n    officer, had all communists who made themselves noticeable among\r\n    the inmates of the camp systematically done away with in such a\r\n    way that the guards did not notice. This petty officer is sure\r\n    of my full recognition for his decision and his execution. After\r\n    his return, I shall promote him with all means, as he has shown\r\n    that he is fitted to be a leader.” (_D-650_)\r\n\r\n                            E. _CONCLUSION._\r\n\r\nDoenitz was no plain sailor, playing the part of a service officer,\r\nloyally obedient to the orders of the government of the day. He was an\r\nextreme Nazi who did his utmost to indoctrinate the Navy and the German\r\npeople with the Nazi creed. It is no coincidence that it was he—not\r\nGoering, not Ribbentrop, not Goebbels, not Himmler—who was chosen to\r\nsucceed Hitler. He played a large part in fashioning the U-boat fleet,\r\none of the most deadly weapons of aggressive war. He helped to plan and\r\nexecute aggressive wars, which he knew well were in deliberate violation\r\nof treaties. He was ready to stoop to any ruse where he thought he would\r\nnot be found out: breaches of the Geneva Convention or of neutrality,\r\nwhere it might be asserted that sinking was due to a mine. He was ready\r\nto order, and did order, the murder of helpless survivors of sunken\r\nships, an action only paralleled by that of his Japanese ally.\r\n\r\nThere can be few countries which do not mourn for men of the merchant\r\nnavies whose destruction was due to the callow brutality with which, at\r\nthe orders of this man, the German U-boats did their work.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n    LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO KARL DOENITZ\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 67\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

ERICH RAEDER\r\n\r\n                     A. _POSITIONS HELD BY RAEDER._\r\n\r\nErich Raeder was born in 1876 and joined the German Navy in 1896. By\r\n1915 he had become commander of the Cruiser _Koeln_. In 1928 he became\r\nan admiral, Chief of Naval Command, and head of the German Navy. In 1935\r\nhe became Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. In 1936 he became General\r\nAdmiral, a creation of Hitler’s, on his forty-seventh birthday. In 1937\r\nhe received the golden badge of honor of the Nazi Party. In 1938 he\r\nbecame a member of the Secret Cabinet Council. In 1939 he was made Grand\r\nAdmiral, a rank created by Hitler, who presented Raeder with a marshal’s\r\nbaton. In 1943 he became Admiral Inspector of the German Navy, which was\r\na kind of retirement into oblivion, since after January 1943 Doenitz was\r\nthe effective commander of the German Navy. (_2888-PS_)\r\n\r\n      B. _RAEDER’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO PLAN AND WAGE WARS OF\r\n                              AGGRESSION._\r\n\r\nDuring the years of Raeder’s command of the German Navy, from 1928 to\r\n1943, he played a vital role in building up the Navy as an instrument of\r\nwar, to implement the Nazis’ general plan of aggression.\r\n\r\n(1) _Concealed rearmament in violation of the Treaty of Versailles._ In\r\nsuccessive and secret steps, the small Navy permitted to Germany under\r\nthe Treaty of Versailles was enormously expanded under the guidance of\r\nRaeder.\r\n\r\nThe story of Germany’s secret rearmament in violation of the Treaty of\r\nVersailles is told in a history of the fight of the German Navy against\r\nVersailles, 1919 to 1935, which was published secretly by the German\r\nAdmiralty in 1937 (_C-156_). This history shows that before the Nazis\r\ncame to power the German Admiralty was deceiving not only the\r\ngovernments of other countries, but its own legislature and at one stage\r\nits own government, regarding the secret measures of rearmament ranging\r\nfrom experimental U-Boat and E-Boat building to the creation of secret\r\nintelligence and finance organizations. Raeder’s role in these\r\ndevelopments are described as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Admiral Raeder, had\r\n    received hereby a far-reaching independence in the building and\r\n    development of the Navy. This was only hampered insofar as the\r\n    previous concealment of rearmament had to be continued in\r\n    consideration of the Versailles Treaty.” (_C-156_)\r\n\r\nAn illustration of Raeder’s concealment of rearmament is contained in\r\nhis statement that:\r\n\r\n    “In view of Germany’s treaty obligations and the disarmament\r\n    conference, steps must be taken to prevent the first E-boat\r\n    Half-Flotilla from appearing openly as a formation of\r\n    torpedo-carrying boats, as it was not intended to count these\r\n    E-boats against the number of torpedo-carrying boats allowed\r\n    them.” (_C-141_)\r\n\r\nIt appears that even in 1930 the intention ultimately to attack Poland\r\nwas already current in German military circles. An extract from the\r\nHistory of War Organization and of the Scheme for Mobilization (_C-135_)\r\nwhich is headed “All 850/38”, suggesting that the document was written\r\nin 1938, reads:\r\n\r\n    “Since under the Treaty of Versailles all preparations for\r\n    mobilization were forbidden, these were at first confined to a\r\n    very small body of collaborators and were at first only of a\r\n    theoretical nature. Nevertheless, there existed at that time an\r\n    ‘Establishment Order’ and ‘Instructions for Establishment,’ the\r\n    forerunners of the present-day scheme for Mobilization.\r\n\r\n    “An ‘establishment organization’ and ‘adaptable instructions for\r\n    establishment’ were drawn up for each A-year, the cover name for\r\n    a mobilization year.\r\n\r\n    “As stated, the ‘Establishment Organizations’ of that time were\r\n    to be judged purely theoretically, for they had no positive\r\n    basis in the form of men and materials. They provided,\r\n    nevertheless, a valuable foundation for the establishment of a\r\n    War Organization as our ultimate aim.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The crises between Germany and Poland, which were becoming\r\n    increasingly acute, compelled us, instead of making theoretical\r\n    preparations for war, to prepare in a practical manner for a\r\n    purely German-Polish conflict.\r\n\r\n    “The strategic idea of a rapid forcing of the Polish base of\r\n    Gdynia was made a basis, and the fleet on active service was to\r\n    be reinforced by the auxiliary forces which would be\r\n    indispensable to attain this strategic end, and the essential\r\n    coastal and flak batteries, especially those in Pillau and\r\n    Swinemuende were to be taken over. Thus in 1930 the\r\n    Reinforcement Plan was evolved.” (_C-135_)\r\n\r\nThe extract further shows that Hitler had made a clear political request\r\nto build up for him in five years, that is, by April 1938, armed forces\r\nwhich he could place in the balance as an instrument of political power.\r\n(_C-135_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi seizure of power in 1933 was a signal to Raeder to go full\r\nspeed ahead on rearmament. In June 1934 Raeder told Hitler that the\r\nGerman fleet must be developed to oppose England, and that therefore\r\nfrom 1936 on, the big ships must be armed with big guns to match the\r\nBritish “_King George_” class of battleship. Raeder also went along with\r\nHitler’s demand that the construction of U-Boats should be kept\r\ncompletely secret, especially in view of the Saar plebiscite (_C-189_).\r\nIn November 1934 Raeder had a further talk with Hitler on the financing\r\nof naval rearmament, and on that occasion Hitler told him that in case\r\nof need he would get Doctor Ley to put 120,000,000 to 150,000,000 RM.\r\nfrom the Labor Front at the disposal of the Navy. (_C-190_)\r\n\r\nAnother example of the deceit used by Raeder in building up the German\r\nNavy is the fact that the true displacement of certain German\r\nbattleships exceeded by twenty percent the displacement which the Nazis\r\nhad reported to the British (_C-23_). In similar vein, it was ordered\r\nthat auxiliary cruisers, which were being secretly constructed, should\r\nbe referred to as “transport ships O.” (_C-166_)\r\n\r\nThe support given by the German Navy to the German Armament Industry\r\nillustrates Raeder’s concern with the broader aspects of Nazi policy and\r\nof the close link between Nazi politicians, German Service Chiefs, and\r\nGerman armament manufacturers. (_C-29_)\r\n\r\nA commentary on post-1939 naval rearmament is contained in a letter from\r\nRaeder to the German Navy, dated 11 June 1940. This letter was given\r\nextensive distribution; in fact there is provision in the distribution\r\nlist for 467 copies. This letter of Raeder’s, which is marked with both\r\nself-justification and apology, reads:\r\n\r\n    “The most outstanding of the numerous subjects of discussion in\r\n    the Officer Corps are the Torpedo position and the problem\r\n    whether the naval building program, up to Autumn 1939, envisaged\r\n    the possibility of the outbreak of war as early as 1939, or\r\n    whether the emphasis ought not to have been laid, from the\r\n    first, on the construction of U-boats.\r\n\r\n    “If the opinion is voiced in the Officer Corps that the entire\r\n    naval building program has been wrongly directed, and that, from\r\n    the first, the emphasis should have been on the U-boat weapon\r\n    and, after its consolidation, on the large ships, I must\r\n    emphasize the following matters:\r\n\r\n    “The building up of the Fleet was directed according to the\r\n    political demands, which were decided by the Fuehrer. The\r\n    Fuehrer hoped, until the last moment, to be able to put off the\r\n    threatening conflict with England until 1944-45. At that time\r\n    the Navy would have had available a fleet with a powerful U-boat\r\n    superiority and a much more favorable ratio as regards strength\r\n    in all other types of ships, particularly those designed for\r\n    warfare on the high seas.\r\n\r\n    “The development of events forced the Navy, contrary to the\r\n    expectation even of the Fuehrer, into a war, which it had to\r\n    accept while still in the initial stage of its rearmament. The\r\n    result is that those who represent the opinion that the emphasis\r\n    should have been laid, from the start, on the building of the\r\n    U-boat arm, appear to be right. I leave undiscussed, how far\r\n    this development, quite apart from difficulties of personnel,\r\n    training and dockyards, could have been appreciably improved in\r\n    any way in view of the political limits of the Anglo-German\r\n    Naval Treaty. I leave also undiscussed, how the early and\r\n    necessary creation of an effective Air Force slowed down the\r\n    desirable development of the other branches of the forces. I\r\n    indicate, however, with pride the admirable and, in spite of the\r\n    political restraints in the years of the Weimar Republic,\r\n    far-reaching preparation for U-boat construction, which made the\r\n    immensely rapid construction of the U-boat arm, both as regards\r\n    equipment and personnel, possible immediately after the\r\n    assumption of power.” (_C-155_)\r\n\r\nThis letter shows no trace of reluctance in cooperating with the Nazi\r\nprogram. On the contrary, it is evident that Raeder welcomed and became\r\none of the pillars of the Nazi power.\r\n\r\n(2) _Conversion of the Navy into a tool of the Nazi conspiracy._ Raeder,\r\nmore than anyone else, was responsible for securing the unquestioned\r\nallegiance of the German Navy to the Nazi movement—an allegiance which\r\nDoenitz was to make even more firm and fanatical.\r\n\r\nRaeder’s approval of Hitler was shown particularly clearly on 2 August\r\n1934, the day of Hindenburg’s death, when Raeder and all the men under\r\nhim swore a new oath of loyalty with considerable ceremony, this time to\r\nAdolf Hitler and no longer to the Fatherland (_D-481_). The new oath ran\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “I swear this holy oath by God that I will implicitly obey the\r\n    Leader of the German Reich and people, Adolf Hitler, the Supreme\r\n    Commander of the Armed Forces and that, as a brave soldier, I\r\n    will be willing to stake my life at any time for this oath.”\r\n    (_D-481_)\r\n\r\nFor his fatherland, Raeder substituted the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to elaborate upon the step by which the German Navy was\r\nprogressively drawn into the closest alliance with the Nazi Party. The\r\nfacts of history—such as the incorporation of the swastika into the\r\nensign under which the German Fleet sailed, and the wearing of the\r\nswastika on the uniform of naval officers and men—these facts speak for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe Nazis, for their part, were not ungrateful for Raeder’s obeisance\r\nand collaboration. His services in rebuilding the German Navy were\r\nwidely recognized by Nazi propagandists and by the Nazi press. On his\r\n66th birthday, the Chief Party Organ, the “_Voelkischer Beobachter_,”\r\npublished a special article about him, which summed up Raeder’s\r\ncontribution to Nazi development:\r\n\r\n    “It was to Raeder’s credit to have already built up by that time\r\n    a powerful striking force from the numerically small fleet,\r\n    despite the fetters of Versailles.\r\n\r\n    “With the assumption of power through National Socialism began,\r\n    too, the most fruitful period in the reconstruction of the\r\n    German Fleet.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer openly expressed his recognition of Raeder’s\r\n    faithful services and unstinted cooperation, by appointing him\r\n    General Admiral on the 20th of April, 1936”.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “As a soldier and a seaman, the General-Admiral has proved\r\n    himself to be the Fuehrer’s first and foremost naval\r\n    collaborator.” (_D-448_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Raeder’s political activities and responsibilities._ Raeder’s\r\npersonal part in the Nazi conspiracy arises from the fact that, from the\r\ntime of the Nazi seizure of power, he became increasingly involved in\r\nresponsibility for the general policies of the Nazi State.\r\n\r\nLong before he was promoted to General-Admiral in 1936, he had become a\r\nmember of the secret Reich Defense Council, joining it when it was\r\nfounded, on 4 April 1933. Thus, at an early date, he was involved, both\r\nmilitarily and politically, in the Nazi conspiracy. These facts are\r\ncontained in a document which contains the classic Nazi directive:\r\n\r\n    “Matters communicated orally cannot be proven; they can be\r\n    denied by us in Geneva.” (_EC-177_)\r\n\r\nOn 4 February 1938, Raeder was appointed to be a member of a newly\r\nformed Secret Advisory Council for Foreign Affairs (_2031-PS_). Three\r\nweeks later, a decree of Hitler’s stated that, as well as being equal in\r\nrank with a Cabinet Minister, Raeder was also to take part in the\r\nsessions of the Cabinet (_2098-PS_). It is thus clear that Raeder’s\r\nresponsibility for the political decisions of the Nazi State was\r\nsteadily developed from 1933 to 1938, and that in the course of time he\r\nhad become a member of all the main political advisory bodies. He was a\r\nmember of the inner councils of the conspirators.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration, Raeder was present at two of the key meetings at\r\nwhich Hitler openly declared his intention of attacking neighboring\r\ncountries. The first of these was Hitler’s conference at the Reichs\r\nChancellery on 5 November 1937, concerning matters which were said to be\r\ntoo important to discuss in the larger circle of the Reich Cabinet. The\r\nminutes of this meeting establish conclusively that the Nazis\r\npremeditated their crimes against peace (_386-PS_). The second meeting\r\nwhich Raeder attended was Hitler’s conference on 23 May 1939 (_L-79_).\r\nThis was the conference at which Hitler confirmed his intention to make\r\na deliberate attack upon Poland at the first opportunity, well knowing\r\nthat this must cause widespread war in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those two key conferences, Raeder was also present at\r\nmany others, where he placed his knowledge and professional skill at the\r\nservice of the Nazi war machine. Raeder’s promotion of the military\r\nplanning and preparation for the Polish campaign is discussed in Section\r\n8 of Chapter IX.\r\n\r\n(4) _The “Athenia Case”._ Once the war was underway, Raeder also showed\r\nhimself to be a master of one of the conspirators’ favorite\r\ntechniques—deceit on the grand scale. His handling of the case of the\r\n“_Athenia_” is a case in point.\r\n\r\nThe “_Athenia_” was a passenger liner which was sunk in the evening of 3\r\nSeptember 1939, when she was outward bound to America. About one hundred\r\nlives were lost.\r\n\r\nOn 23 October 1939, the Nazi Party paper, the “_Voelkischer\r\nBeobachter_,” published in screaming headlines the story, “Churchill\r\nsank the Athenia” (_3260-PS_). The scale on which this deliberate lie\r\nwas perpetrated is indicated by the rest of the “_Voelkischer\r\nBeobachter_” for that day; on the front page, with large red\r\nunderlining, were the words: “Now we indict Churchill” (_3260-PS_). An\r\nextract from the third page of this issue of the “_Voelkischer\r\nBeobachter_” refers to photograph of the ship and reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Churchill sank the ‘_Athenia_’. The above picture shows the\r\n    proud ‘_Athenia_’, the ocean giant, which was sunk by\r\n    Churchill’s crime. One can clearly see the big radio equipment\r\n    on board the ship. But nowhere was an SOS heard from the ship.\r\n    Why was the ‘_Athenia_’ silent? Because her captain was not\r\n    allowed to tell the world anything. He very prudently refrained\r\n    from telling the world that Winston Churchill attempted to sink\r\n    the ship, through the explosion of an infernal machine. He knew\r\n    it well, but he had to keep silent. Nearly fifteen hundred\r\n    people would have lost their lives if Churchill’s original plan\r\n    had resulted as the criminal wanted. Yes, he longingly hoped\r\n    that the one hundred Americans on board the ship would find\r\n    death in the waves so that the anger of the American people, who\r\n    were deceived by him, should be directed against Germany as the\r\n    presumed author of the deed. It was fortunate that the majority\r\n    escaped the fate intended for them by Churchill. Our picture on\r\n    the right shows two wounded passengers. They were rescued by the\r\n    freighter, ‘_City of Flint_’, and as can be seen here, turned\r\n    over to the American coast guard boat ‘_Gibb_’ for further\r\n    medical treatment. They are an unspoken accusation against the\r\n    criminal Churchill. Both they and the shades of those who lost\r\n    their lives call him before the Tribunal of the world and ask\r\n    the British people, ‘How long will the office, one of the\r\n    richest in tradition known to Britain’s history, be held by a\r\n    murderer?’” (_3260-PS_)\r\n\r\nContrary to these Nazi allegations, the “_Athenia_” made repeated\r\nwireless distress signals, which were in fact intercepted and answered\r\nby His Majesty’s ships “_Electra_” and “_Escort_,” as well as by the\r\nNorwegian steamship “_Knute Nelson_” and the Swedish yacht “_Southern\r\nCross_.” In fact, the “_Athenia_” was sunk by the German U-boat U-30. So\r\nunjustifiable was the torpedoing of the “_Athenia_,” however, that the\r\nGerman Navy embarked on a course of falsification of their records and\r\non other dishonest measures, in the hope of hiding the guilty secret.\r\nMeanwhile, the Nazi propagandists sought to shift the responsibility to\r\nthe British. The Captain of U-boat 30, _Oberleutnant_ Lemp, was later\r\nkilled in action, but some of the original crew of the U-30 have\r\nsurvived to tell the tale as prisoners of war. An affidavit by a member\r\nof the crew of the U-30 establishes the truth of this episode and\r\nreveals the Nazis’ attempt to conceal the true facts (_D-654_). The\r\naffidavit reads:\r\n\r\n    “I, Adolf Schmidt, Official Number N 1043-33T,\r\n\r\n    “Do solemnly declare that:\r\n\r\n    “I am now confined to Camp No. 133, Lethbridge, Alberta.\r\n\r\n    “That on the first day of war, 3 September 1939, a ship of\r\n    approximately 10,000 tons was torpedoed in the late hours of the\r\n    evening by the U-30.\r\n\r\n    “That after the ship was torpedoed and we surfaced again,\r\n    approximately half an hour after the explosion, the Commandant\r\n    called me to the tower in order to show me the torpedoed ship.\r\n\r\n    “That I have seen the ship with my very eyes, but that I do not\r\n    think that the ship could see our U-boat at that time on account\r\n    of the position of the moon.\r\n\r\n    “That only a few members of the crew had an opportunity to go to\r\n    the tower in order to see the torpedoed ship.\r\n\r\n    “That apart from myself, _Oberleutnant_ Hinsch was in the tower\r\n    when I saw the steamer after the attack.\r\n\r\n    “That I observed that the ship was listing.\r\n\r\n    “That no warning shot was fired before the torpedo was launched.\r\n\r\n    “That I myself observed much commotion on board of the torpedoed\r\n    ship.\r\n\r\n    “That I believe that the ship had only one smoke stack.\r\n\r\n    “That in the attack on this steamer one or two torpedoes were\r\n    fired which did not explode but that I myself heard the\r\n    explosion of the torpedo which hit the steamer.\r\n\r\n    “That _Oberleutnant_ Lemp waited until darkness before\r\n    surfacing.\r\n\r\n    “That I was severely wounded by aircraft 14 September 1939.\r\n\r\n    “That _Oberleutnant_ Lemp, shortly before my disembarkation in\r\n    Reykjavik 19 September 1939, visited me in the forenoon in the\r\n    Petty Officers quarters where I was lying severely wounded.\r\n\r\n    “That _Oberleutnant_ Lemp then had the Petty Officers’ quarters\r\n    cleared in order to be alone with me.\r\n\r\n    “That _Oberleutnant_ Lemp then showed me a declaration under\r\n    oath according to which I had to bind myself to mention nothing\r\n    concerning the incidents of 3 September 1939 on board the U-30.\r\n\r\n    “That this declaration under oath had approximately the\r\n    following wording: ‘I, the undersigned, swear hereby that I\r\n    shall shroud in secrecy all happenings of 3 September 1939 on\r\n    board the U-30, regardless whether foe or friend, and that I\r\n    shall erase from my memory all happenings of this day.’\r\n\r\n    “That I have signed this declaration under oath, which was drawn\r\n    up by the Commandant in his own handwriting, with my left hand\r\n    very illegibly.\r\n\r\n    “That later on in Iceland when I heard about the sinking of the\r\n    ‘_Athenia_,’ the idea came into my mind that the U-30 on the 3\r\n    September 1939 might have sunk the ‘_Athenia_,’ especially since\r\n    the Captain caused me to sign the above-mentioned declaration.\r\n\r\n    “That up to today I have never spoken to anyone concerning these\r\n    events.\r\n\r\n    “That due to the termination of the war I consider myself freed\r\n    from my oaths.” (_D-654_)\r\n\r\nDoenitz’s part in the “_Athenia_” episode is described in an affidavit\r\nwhich he has sworn, in English (_D-638_). At the end of the affidavit\r\nfour words are added in Doenitz’s handwriting, the significance of which\r\nwill be adverted to shortly. Doenitz states:\r\n\r\n    “U-30 returned to harbor about Mid-September. I met the captain,\r\n    _Oberleutnant_ Lemp, on the lockside at Wilhelmshaven, as the\r\n    boat was entering harbor, and he asked permission to speak to me\r\n    in private. I noticed immediately that he was looking very\r\n    unhappy and he told me at once that he thought he was\r\n    responsible for the sinking of the ‘_Athenia_’ in the North\r\n    Channel area. In accordance with my previous instructions, he\r\n    had been keeping a sharp lookout for possible armed merchant\r\n    cruisers in the approaches to the British Isles, and had\r\n    torpedoed a ship he afterwards identified as the ‘_Athenia_’\r\n    from wireless broadcasts, under the impression that she was an\r\n    armed merchant cruiser on patrol. I had never specified in my\r\n    instructions any particular type of ship as armed merchant\r\n    cruiser nor mentioned any names of ships. I despatched Lemp at\r\n    once by air to report to the SKL at Berlin; in the meantime, I\r\n    ordered complete secrecy as a provisional measure. Later the\r\n    same day or early on the following day, I received a verbal\r\n    order from _Kapitaen zur See_ Fricke [head of the Operations\r\n    Division of the Naval War Staff] that:\r\n\r\n    “1. The affair was to be kept a total secret.\r\n\r\n    “2. The OKM considered that a court martial was not necessary as\r\n    they were satisfied that the captain had acted in good faith.\r\n\r\n    “3. Political explanations would be handled by the OKM.\r\n\r\n    “I had had no part whatsoever in the political events in which\r\n    the Fuehrer claimed that no U-boat had sunk the ‘_Athenia_.’\r\n\r\n    “After Lemp returned to Wilhelmshaven from Berlin, I\r\n    interrogated him thoroughly on the sinking and formed the\r\n    impression that although he had taken reasonable care, he had\r\n    still not taken sufficient precautions to establish fully the\r\n    identity of the ship before attacking. I had previously given\r\n    very strict orders that all merchant vessels and neutrals were\r\n    to be treated according to naval prize law, before the\r\n    occurrence of this incident. I accordingly placed him under\r\n    cabin arrest, as I felt certain that a court-martial could only\r\n    acquit him and would entail unnecessary publicity” [whereat\r\n    Doenitz has added the words, “and too much time”]. (_D-638_)\r\n\r\nDoenitz’s suggestion that the captain of the U-30 sank the “_Athenia_”\r\nin mistake for a merchant cruiser must be considered in the light of\r\nDoenitz’s order of 22 September 1939, that\r\n\r\n    “the sinking of a merchant ship must be justified in the War\r\n    Diary as due to possible confusion with a warship or an\r\n    auxiliary cruiser.” (_C-191_)\r\n\r\nThe U-30 returned to Wilhelmshaven on 27 September 1939. On that date\r\nanother fraudulent entry was made in the War Diary of the Chief of\r\nU-boats:\r\n\r\n    “U-30 comes in. She had sunk: ‘S.S. _Blairlogie_’; ‘S.S. _Fanad\r\n    Head_’.” (_D-659_)\r\n\r\nThere is no reference at all to the sinking of the “_Athenia_.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most elaborate forgery in connection with this episode was\r\nmade on the log book of the U-30, which was responsible for sinking the\r\n“_Athenia_” (_D-662_). The Prosecution submits that the first page of\r\nthat log book is a forgery which shows a curiously un-German\r\ncarelessness about detail. It is clear on the original document that the\r\nfirst page of the text is a substitute for pages that have been removed:\r\nThe dates in the first column of that page are in Arabic numerals. On\r\nthe second and more authentic-looking page, and throughout the other\r\npages of the log book, they are in Roman numerals. (_D-662_)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, all reference to the sinking of the “_Athenia_” on 3\r\nSeptember is omitted. The log book shows that at 1400 hours on 3\r\nSeptember 1939 the position of the U-30 is given as AL 0278, which is\r\none of the few positions quoted at all upon that page, and which was\r\nsome 200 miles west of the position where the “_Athenia_” was sunk. The\r\nrecorded course (due south) and the recorded speed (10 knots)—those\r\nentries are obviously designed to suggest that the U-30 was well clear\r\nof the “_Athenia’s_” position on 3 September. (_D-662_)\r\n\r\nFinally, the original shows Lemp’s own signature upon the page dealing\r\nwith 3 September differs from his other signature in the text. The\r\ndifference appears in the final letter of his name. The signature in\r\nquestion shows a Roman “p”, whereas on the other signatures there is a\r\nscript “p.” The inference is that either the signature is a forgery or\r\nit was made by Lemp at some other, and probably considerably later,\r\ndate. (_D-662_)\r\n\r\nThe story of the “_Athenia_” establishes that the German Navy under\r\nRaeder embarked upon deliberate fraud. Even before receiving Lemp’s\r\nreports, the German Admiralty had repeatedly denied the possibility that\r\na German U-boat could be in the area concerned. The charts which showed\r\nthe disposition of U-boats and the position of sinking of the\r\n“_Athenia_” (discussed in Section 14 on Doenitz) have shown the\r\ndishonesty of these announcements. The conclusion to be drawn is this:\r\nRaeder, as head of the German Navy, knew all the facts. Censorship and\r\ninformation control in Nazi Germany were so complete that Raeder, as\r\nhead of the Navy, must have been party to the falsification published in\r\nthe “_Voelkischer Beobachter_,” which was an attempt by the Nazi\r\nconspirators to save face with their own people and to uphold the myth\r\nof an infallible Fuehrer backed by an impeccable war machine.\r\n\r\n(5) _The Attack on Norway and Denmark._ Truth mattered little in Nazi\r\npropaganda, and Raeder’s camouflage was not confined to painting his\r\nships or sailing them under the British flag, as he did in attacking\r\nNorway or Denmark. Raeder’s proud comment upon the invasions of Denmark\r\nand Norway, in which he played a leading part, (see Section 9 of Chapter\r\nIX on aggression against Norway and Denmark), is contained in a letter\r\nof Raeder’s to the Navy, which stated in part:\r\n\r\n    “The operations of the Navy in the occupation of Norway will for\r\n    all time remain the great contribution of the Navy to this war.”\r\n    (_C-155_)\r\n\r\n(6) _The Attack on the U.S.S.R._ With the occupation of Norway and much\r\nof Western Europe safely completed, Hitler turned his eyes towards\r\nRussia. Raeder was against the attack on Russia and tried his best to\r\ndissuade Hitler from embarking upon it. Raeder approached the problem\r\nwith cynicism. He did not object to the aggressive war on Russia because\r\nof its illegality, its immorality, its inhumanity. His only objection to\r\nit was its untimeliness. He wanted to finish England first before going\r\nfurther afield.\r\n\r\nThe story of Raeder’s part in the deliberations upon the war against\r\nRussia is told in extracts from a German compilation of official naval\r\nnotes by the German Naval War Staff (_C-170_). The first entry, dated 26\r\nSeptember 1940, shows that Raeder was advocating to Hitler an aggressive\r\nMediterranean policy, in which the Navy would play a paramount role, as\r\nopposed to a continental land policy. The entry reads:\r\n\r\n    “Naval Supreme Commander with the Fuehrer: Naval Supreme\r\n    Commander presents his opinion about the situation: the Suez\r\n    Canal must be captured with German assistance. From Suez advance\r\n    through Palestine and Syria; then Turkey in our power. The\r\n    Russian problem will then assume a different appearance. Russia\r\n    is fundamentally frightened of Germany. It is questionable\r\n    whether action against Russia from the North will then be still\r\n    necessary.” (_C-170_)\r\n\r\nThe entry for 14 November reads:\r\n\r\n    “Naval Supreme Commander with the Fuehrer: Fuehrer is still\r\n    inclined to instigate the conflict with Russia. Naval Supreme\r\n    Commander recommends putting it off until the time after the\r\n    victory over England since there is heavy strain on German\r\n    forces and the end of warfare is not in sight. According to the\r\n    opinion of the Naval Supreme Commander, Russia will not press\r\n    for a conflict within the next year, since she is in the process\r\n    of building up her Navy with Germany’s help—38 cm. turrets for\r\n    battleships, etc.:—thus, during these years she continues to be\r\n    dependent upon German assistance.” (_C-170_)\r\n\r\nAnd again, the entry for 27 December states:\r\n\r\n    “Naval Supreme Commander with the Fuehrer: Naval Supreme\r\n    Commander emphasizes again that strict concentration of our\r\n    entire war effort against England as our main enemy is the most\r\n    urgent need of the hour. On the one side England has gained\r\n    strength by the unfortunate Italian conduct of the war in the\r\n    eastern Mediterranean and by the increasing American support. On\r\n    the other hand, however, she can be hit mortally by a\r\n    strangulation of her ocean traffic which is already taking\r\n    effect. What is being done for submarine and naval air force\r\n    construction is much too little. Our entire war potential must\r\n    work for the conduct of the war against England; thus for Navy\r\n    and air force every fissure of strength prolongs the war and\r\n    endangers the final success. Naval Supreme Commander voices\r\n    serious objections against Russia campaign before the defeat of\r\n    England.” (_C-170_)\r\n\r\nThe entry for 18 February 1941 reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Chief, Naval Operations (SKL) insists on the occupation of\r\n    Malta even before ‘_Barbarossa_’.” (_C-170_)\r\n\r\nThe 23 February entry reads:\r\n\r\n    “Instruction from Supreme Command, Armed Forces (OKW) that\r\n    seizure of Malta is contemplated for the fall of 1941 after the\r\n    execution of ‘_Barbarossa_’.” (_C-170_)\r\n\r\nThe entry for 19 March 1941 shows that by March 1941 Raeder had begun to\r\nconsider what prospects of naval action the Russian aggression had to\r\noffer. The entry states:\r\n\r\n    “In case of ‘_Barbarossa_’, Supreme Naval Commander describes\r\n    the occupation of Murmansk as an absolute necessity for the\r\n    Navy. Chief of the Supreme Command, Armed Forces, considers\r\n    compliance very difficult.” (_C-170_).\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the entries show that Mussolini was crying out for a\r\nmore active Nazi Mediterranean policy. The entry for 30 May reads:\r\n\r\n    “[Duce] demands urgently decisive offensive Egypt-Suez for fall\r\n    1941; 12 divisions are needed for that; ‘This stroke would be\r\n    more deadly to the British Empire than the capture of London’;\r\n    Chief Naval Operations agrees completely.” (_C-170_)\r\n\r\nFinally, the entry for 6 June indicates the strategic views of Raeder\r\nand the German Navy at that stage:\r\n\r\n    “Naval Supreme Commander with the Fuehrer: Memorandum of the\r\n    Chief, Naval Operations. Observation on the strategic situation\r\n    in the Eastern Mediterranean after the Balkan campaign and the\r\n    occupation of Crete and further conduct of the war.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The memorandum points with impressive clarity to the decisive\r\n    aims of the war in the Near East. Their advancement has moved\r\n    into grasping distance by the successes in the Aegean area, and\r\n    the memorandum emphasizes that the offensive utilization of the\r\n    present favorable situation must take place with the greatest\r\n    acceleration and energy, before England has again strengthened\r\n    her position in the Near East with help from the United States\r\n    of America. The memorandum realizes the unalterable fact that\r\n    the campaign against Russia would be opened very shortly;\r\n    demands, however, that the undertaking ‘_Barbarossa_’, which\r\n    because of the magnitude of its aims naturally stands in the\r\n    foreground of the operational plans of the armed forces\r\n    leadership, must under no circumstances lead to an abandonment,\r\n    diminishing delay of the conduct of the war in the Eastern\r\n    Mediterranean.” (_C-170_)\r\n\r\nThus Raeder, throughout, was seeking an active role for his Navy in the\r\nNazi war plans.\r\n\r\nOnce Hitler had decided to attack Russia, Raeder sought a role for the\r\nNavy in the Russian campaign. The first naval operational plan against\r\nRussia was characteristically Nazi. The entry for 15 June 1941 in the\r\nnotes of the German Naval War Staff reads:\r\n\r\n    “On the proposal of Chief Naval Operations, use of arms against\r\n    Russian submarines, south of the northern boundary of the Poland\r\n    warning area is permitted immediately; ruthless destruction is\r\n    to be aimed at.” (_C-170_)\r\n\r\nKeitel provides a typically fraudulent pretext for this action in his\r\nletter dated 15 June 1941 (_C-38_):\r\n\r\n    “Subject: Offensive action against enemy submarines in the\r\n    Baltic Sea.\r\n\r\n    “To:\r\n\r\n    “High Command of the Navy—OKM (SKL)\r\n\r\n    “Offensive action against submarine south of the line\r\n    Memel—southern tip of Oeland is authorized if the boats cannot\r\n    be definitely identified as Swedish during the approach by\r\n    German naval forces.\r\n\r\n    “The reason to be given up to B-day is that our naval forces\r\n    believed to be dealing with penetrating British submarines.”\r\n    (_C-38_).\r\n\r\nThis order was given on 15 June 1941, although the Nazi attack on Russia\r\ndid not take place until 22 June 1941.\r\n\r\n(7) _Instigation of Japanese aggression._ In the meantime, Raeder was\r\nurging Hitler, as early as 18 March 1941, to enlarge the scope of the\r\nworld war by inducing Japan to seize Singapore. Raeder’s views at his\r\naudience with Hitler on 18 March were as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Japan must take steps to seize Singapore as soon as possible,\r\n    since the opportunity will never again be as favorable (whole\r\n    English Fleet contained; unpreparedness of U.S.A. for war\r\n    against Japan; inferiority of U. S. Fleet vis-a-vis the\r\n    Japanese). Japan is indeed making preparations for this action,\r\n    but according to all declarations made by Japanese officers she\r\n    will only carry it out if Germany proceeds to land in England.\r\n    Germany must therefore concentrate all her efforts on spurring\r\n    Japan to act immediately. If Japan has Singapore all other East\r\n    Asiatic questions regarding the U.S.A. and England are thereby\r\n    solved (Guam, Philippines, Borneo, Dutch East Indies).\r\n\r\n    “Japan wishes if possible to avoid war against U.S.A. She can do\r\n    so if she determinedly takes Singapore as soon as possible.”\r\n    (_C-152_)\r\n\r\nBy 20 April 1941 Hitler had agreed with Raeder’s proposition to induce\r\nthe Japanese to take offensive action against Singapore. The entry in\r\nthe notes of the German Naval War Staff, for 20 April 1941, reads:\r\n\r\n    “Naval Supreme Commander with the Fuehrer: Navy Supreme\r\n    Commander asks about result of Matsuoka’s visit, and evaluation\r\n    of Japanese-Russian pact. Fuehrer has informed Matsuoka, ‘that\r\n    Russia will not be touched if she behaves friendly according to\r\n    the treaty. Otherwise, he reserves action for himself.’\r\n    Japan-Russia pact has been concluded in agreement with Germany,\r\n    and is to prevent Japan from advancing against Vladisvostok, and\r\n    to cause her to attack Singapore.” (_C-170_).\r\n\r\nThe real purpose of Hitler’s words to Matsuoka is revealed in another\r\ndescription of their conversation:\r\n\r\n    “* * * At that time the Fuehrer was firmly resolved on a\r\n    surprise attack on Russia, regardless of what was the Russian\r\n    attitude to Germany. This, according to reports coming in, was\r\n    frequently changing. The communication to Matsuoka was designed\r\n    entirely as a camouflage measure and to ensure surprise.”\r\n    (_C-66_)\r\n\r\nThe Axis partners were not even honest with each other. This is typical\r\nof the jungle diplomacy with which Raeder associated himself.\r\n\r\n       C. _RAEDER’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES._\r\n\r\n(1) _Instigation of the Navy to Violate the Rules of Warfare._ Raeder\r\nthroughout his career showed a complete disregard for any international\r\nrule or usage of war which conflicted with his intention of carrying\r\nthrough the Nazi program of conquest. Raeder has himself summarized his\r\nattitude in a long memorandum compiled by Raeder and the German Naval\r\nWar Staff and dated 15 October 1939, only a few weeks after the war\r\nstarted (_UK-65_). The memorandum, which concerns the intensification of\r\nthe war at sea, reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I. Military requirements for the decisive struggle against\r\n    Great Britain.\r\n\r\n    “Our naval strategy will have to employ all the military means\r\n    at our disposal as expeditiously as possible. Military success\r\n    can be most confidently expected if we attack British\r\n    sea-communications wherever they are accessible to us with the\r\n    greatest ruthlessness; the final aim of such attacks is to cut\r\n    off all imports into and exports from Britain. We should try to\r\n    consider the requirements. It is desirable to base all military\r\n    measures taken on existing International Law; however measures\r\n    which are considered necessary from a military point of view,\r\n    provided a decisive success can be expected from them, will have\r\n    to be carried out, even if they are not covered by existing\r\n    International Law. In principle therefore, any means of warfare\r\n    which is effective in breaking enemy resistance should be used\r\n    on some legal conception, even if that entails the creation of a\r\n    new code of naval warfare.\r\n\r\n    “The supreme War Council will have to decide what measures of\r\n    military and legal nature are to be taken. Once it has been\r\n    decided to conduct economic warfare in its most ruthless form,\r\n    in fulfilment of military requirements, this decision is to be\r\n    adhered to under all circumstances and under no circumstances\r\n    may such a decision for the most ruthless form of economic\r\n    warfare, once it has been made, be dropped or released under\r\n    political pressure from neutral powers; that is what happened in\r\n    the World War to our own detriment. Every protest by neutral\r\n    powers must be turned down. Even threats of further countries,\r\n    including the U. S. coming into the war, which can be expected\r\n    with certainty should the war last a long time, must not lead to\r\n    a relaxation in the form of economic warfare once embarked upon.\r\n    The more ruthlessly economic warfare is waged, the earlier will\r\n    it show results and the sooner will the war come to an end. The\r\n    economic effect of such military measures on our own war economy\r\n    must be fully recognized and compensated through immediate\r\n    re-orientation of German war economy and the re-drafting of the\r\n    respective agreements with neutral states; for this, strong\r\n    political and economic pressure must be employed if necessary.”\r\n    (_UK-65_)\r\n\r\nThose comments of Raeder are revealing and show that as an active member\r\nof the inner councils of the Nazi state up to 1943, Raeder must share\r\nresponsibility for the many war crimes committed by his confederates and\r\nunderlings in the course of their wars.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Navy’s Crimes at Sea._ Apart from this over-all responsibility\r\nof Raeder, certain war crimes were essentially initiated or ordered\r\nthrough the naval chain of command by Raeder himself.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Attacks on neutral shipping._ The minutes of a meeting between\r\nHitler and Raeder on 30 December 1939 read in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Chief of Naval War Staff requests that full power be given\r\n    to the Naval War Staff in making any intensification suited to\r\n    the situation and to the means of war. The Fuehrer fundamentally\r\n    agrees to the sinking without warning of Greek ships in the\r\n    American prohibited area in which the fiction of mine danger can\r\n    be upheld, e.g., the Bristol Channel.” (_C-27_)\r\n\r\nAt this time Greek ships also were neutral. This is another\r\ndemonstration that Raeder was a man without principle.\r\n\r\nThis incitement to crime was a typical group effort, since a directive\r\neffectuating those naval views was issued on 30 December 1939 by the\r\nOKW, and signed by Jodl (_C-12_). This directive reads:\r\n\r\n    “On the 30th of December 1939, according to a report of Ob.d.M.,\r\n    the Fuehrer and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces decided\r\n    that:\r\n\r\n    “(1) Greek merchant ships in the area around England declared by\r\n    U.S.A. to be a barred zone are to be treated as enemy vessels.\r\n\r\n    “(2) In the Bristol Channel, all shipping may be attacked\r\n    without warning—where the impression of a mining incident can\r\n    be created.\r\n\r\n    “Both measures are authorized to come into effect immediately.”\r\n    (_C-12_)\r\n\r\nA pencilled note at the foot of this directive reads:\r\n\r\n    “Add to (1) Attack must be carried out without being seen. The\r\n    denial of the sinking of these steamships in case the expected\r\n    protests are made must be possible.” (_C-12_)\r\n\r\nAnother example of the callous attitude of Raeder’s Navy towards neutral\r\nshipping is found in an entry in Jodl’s diary for 16 June 1942\r\n(_1807-PS_). This extract reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The operational staff of the Navy (SKL) applied on the 29th May\r\n    for permission to attack the Brazilian sea and air forces. The\r\n    SKL considers that a sudden blow against the Brazilian naval and\r\n    merchant ships is expedient at this juncture (a) because defense\r\n    measures are still incomplete; (b) because there is the\r\n    possibility of achieving surprise; and (c) because Brazil is to\r\n    all intents and purposes fighting Germany at sea.” (_1807-PS_).\r\n\r\nThis was a plan for a kind of Brazilian “Pearl Harbor,” although war did\r\nnot in fact break out between Germany and Brazil until the 22 August\r\n1942.\r\n\r\nRaeder also caused the Navy to participate in war crimes ordered by\r\nother conspirators. A single example will suffice.\r\n\r\n(b) _The order to shoot commandos._ On 28 October 1942 the head of the\r\nOperations Division of the Naval War Staff promulgated to naval commands\r\nHitler’s order of 18 October 1942 requiring the shooting of commandos.\r\nThe effect of this order was to deny the protection of the Geneva\r\nConvention to captured commandos. The document dated 28 October 1942\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    “Enclosed please find a Fuehrer Order regarding annihilation of\r\n    terror and sabotage units.\r\n\r\n    “This order must not be distributed in writing by Flotilla\r\n    leaders, Section Commanders or officers of this rank.\r\n\r\n    “After verbal distribution to subordinate sections the above\r\n    authorities must hand this order over to the next highest\r\n    section which is responsible for its confiscation and\r\n    destruction.” (_C-179_).\r\n\r\nIt will be difficult to conceive of clearer evidence than this, that\r\nRaeder appreciated the wrongfulness of Hitler’s commando order.\r\n\r\nOne example will show that this order was executed by the German Navy\r\nduring the period when Raeder was its Commander.\r\n\r\nA certain commando operation of December 1942 had as its objective an\r\nattack on shipping in Bordeaux harbor. The _Wehrmacht_ account of this\r\nincident states that six of the ten participants in that commando raid\r\nwere arrested, and that all were shot on 23 March 1943 (_UK-57_). On\r\nthis particular occasion the Navy under Raeder had implemented Hitler’s\r\norder much more expeditiously. This fact appears in extracts from the\r\nwar diary of Admiral Bachmann, who was the German Flag Officer in charge\r\nof Western France (_C-176_). The entry for 10 December 1942 reads:\r\n\r\n    “About 1015. Telephone call from personal representative of the\r\n    Officer-in-charge of the Security Service in Paris, SS\r\n    Obersturmfuehrer Dr. Schmidt to Flag Officer-in-charge’s Flag\r\n    Lieutenant, requesting postponement of the shooting, as\r\n    interrogation had not been concluded. After consultation with\r\n    the Chief of Operations Staff the Security Service had been\r\n    directed to get approval direct from Headquarters.\r\n\r\n    “1820. Security Service, Bordeaux, requested Security Service\r\n    authorities at Fuehrer’s headquarters to postpone the shooting\r\n    for three days. Interrogations continued for the time being.”\r\n    (_C-176_)\r\n\r\nThe entry for the next day, 11 December 1942, reads:\r\n\r\n    “Shooting of the two prisoners was carried out by a unit\r\n    (strength 1/16) belonging to the naval officer in charge\r\n    Bordeaux, in the presence of an officer of the Security Service,\r\n    Bordeaux, on order of the Fuehrer.” (_C-176_)\r\n\r\nA note in green pencil in the margin opposite this entry reads:\r\n\r\n    “Security Service should have done this. Phone Flag Officer in\r\n    Charge in future cases.” (_C-176_)\r\n\r\nThis provision for “future cases” was in fact an order that commandos\r\nshould be handed over to the Security Service to be shot.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident from Admiral Bachmann’s war diary (_C-176_) that\r\nthe first two men to be shot from the Bordeaux operation were actually\r\nput to death by a naval firing party on 11 December 1942.\r\n\r\nThe Naval War Staff had this comment to make upon that shooting:\r\n\r\n    “The Naval Commander, West France, reports that during the\r\n    course of the day explosives with magnets to stick on, mapping\r\n    material dealing with the mouth of the Gironde, aerial\r\n    photographs of the port installations at Bordeaux, camouflage\r\n    material and food and water for several days were found.\r\n    Attempts to salvage the canoe were unsuccessful. The Naval\r\n    Commander, West France, has ordered that both soldiers be shot\r\n    immediately for attempted sabotage, if their interrogation,\r\n    which has begun, confirms what has so far been discovered. Their\r\n    execution has, however, been postponed in order to obtain more\r\n    information.\r\n\r\n    “According to a _Wehrmacht_ report, both soldiers have meanwhile\r\n    been shot. The measure would be in accordance with the Fuehrer’s\r\n    special order, but is nevertheless something new in\r\n    international law, since the soldiers were in uniform.”\r\n    (_D-658_)\r\n\r\nThat last sentence shows clearly that the Naval High Command under\r\nRaeder accepted allegiance to the Nazi conspiracy as of greater\r\nimportance than any question of moral principle or professional honor.\r\nThe shooting of commandos was not an act of war, but simple murder.\r\n\r\n    D. _RAEDER’S ASSISTANCE TO THE CONSPIRACY THROUGH HIS POLITICAL\r\n                              ACTIVITIES._\r\n\r\nRaeder was not just a military puppet carrying out political orders.\r\nBefore the Nazis came to power he had worked actively to rebuild the\r\nGerman Navy behind the back of the Reichstag. When the Nazis seized\r\npower, he unreservedly joined forces with them. He was the prime mover\r\nin transferring the loyalty of the German Navy to the Nazi Party. He\r\nhimself was as much a member of the inner councils of the Nazis as any\r\nother defendant. He accepted membership in their main political advisory\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nHe was well aware of the designs of the Nazis and assisted in their\r\nrealization not only as a military technician, but also as a mendacious\r\npolitician. And he furthered brutal methods of warfare. And yet of all\r\nthe conspirators Raeder was one of the first to fall from his high\r\nposition. It is true that the extension of the war beyond the boundaries\r\nof Poland came as a disappointment to him. His vision of a Nazi Armada\r\nmastering the Atlantic reckoned without Ribbentrop’s diplomacy and\r\nHitler’s ideas of strategy.\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum dated 10 January 1943, just before his retirement,\r\nentitled, “The Importance of German Surface Forces for the War by powers\r\nsignatory to the Three Power Pact,” Raeder stated:\r\n\r\n    “It was planned by the leaders of the National Socialist Reich\r\n    to give the German Navy by 1944/45 such a strength that it would\r\n    be possible to strike at the British vital arteries in the\r\n    Atlantic with sufficient ships, fighting power and range.\r\n\r\n    “In 1939, the war having begun five years earlier, the\r\n    construction of these forces was still in its initial stages.”\r\n    (_C-161_).\r\n\r\nThis memorandum shows how completely Raeder was cheated in his ambitious\r\nplans by miscalculation as to when his high seas fleet would be\r\nrequired. Raeder made a great effort to recover some of his lost glory\r\nwith his attack on Norway. He made many efforts to liven up the war at\r\nsea, both at the expense of neutrals and also of the customs and laws of\r\nthe sea. His further schemes, however, were disregarded by his fellow\r\nconspirators, and in January 1943 he retired, and thereafter was a\r\nleader in name only.\r\n\r\nThe record, in Raeder’s handwriting, of his interview with Hitler on 6\r\nJanuary 1943, which led to Raeder’s retirement, states in part:\r\n\r\n    “If the Fuehrer was anxious to demonstrate that the parting was\r\n    of the friendliest and wished that the name Raeder should\r\n    continue to be associated with the Navy, particularly abroad, it\r\n    would perhaps be possible to make an appointment to General\r\n    Inspector, giving appropriate publicity in the press, etc. But a\r\n    new C. in C. Navy with full responsibility for this office must\r\n    be appointed. The position of General Inspector, or whatever it\r\n    was decided to call it, must be purely nominal.\r\n\r\n    “Hitler accepted this suggestion with alacrity. The General\r\n    Inspector could perhaps carry out special tasks for him, make\r\n    tours of inspection, etc. The name of Raeder was still to be\r\n    associated with the Navy. After C. in C. Navy had repeated his\r\n    request, the Fuehrer definitely agreed to 30th January as his\r\n    release date. He would like to think over the details.”\r\n    (_D-655_)\r\n\r\nThis was Raeder’s twilight, different from the period of his ascendancy\r\nin 1939, when on 12 March he spoke on the occasion of the German Heroes’\r\nDay (_D-653_). In that speech, during the celebration of “freedom to\r\nrearm,” Raeder stated, in the presence of Hitler and representatives of\r\nthe Party and Armed Forces:\r\n\r\n    “* * * National Socialism, which originates from the spirit of\r\n    the German fighting soldier, has been chosen by the German\r\n    people as its ideology. The German people follow the symbols of\r\n    its regeneration with the same great love and fanatical passion.\r\n    The German people has had practical experience of National\r\n    Socialism and it has not been imposed, as so many outside\r\n    critics believe. The Fuehrer has shown his people that in the\r\n    National Socialist racial community lies the greatest and\r\n    invincible sources of strength, whose dynamic power ensures not\r\n    only peace at home, but also enables to make use of all the\r\n    Nation’s creative powers.” (_D-653_).\r\n\r\nAfter eulogies of Hitler, Raeder continued as follows:\r\n\r\n    “This is the reason for the clear and unsparing summons to fight\r\n    Bolshevism and international Jewry, whose race-destroying\r\n    activities we have sufficiently experienced on our own people.\r\n    Therefore, the alliance with all similar-minded Nations who,\r\n    like Germany, are not willing to allow their strength, dedicated\r\n    to construction and peaceful work at home, to be disrupted by\r\n    alien ideologies as by parasites of a foreign race. * * * If\r\n    later on we instruct in the technical handling of weapons, this\r\n    task demands that the young soldier should also be taught\r\n    National Socialist ideology and the problems of life. This part\r\n    of the task, which becomes for us both a duty of honor and a\r\n    demand which cannot be refused, can and will be carried out if\r\n    we stand shoulder to shoulder and in sincere comradeship to the\r\n    Party and its organization. The armed forces and the Party thus\r\n    became more and more united in attitude and spirit.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Germany is the protector of all Germans within and beyond our\r\n    frontiers. The shots fired at Almeria are proof of that.”\r\n    (_D-653_)\r\n\r\n(The reference is to the bombardment of the Spanish town of Almeria,\r\ncarried out by a German naval squadron on 31 May 1937 during the course\r\nof the Spanish Civil War.) After further panegyries on the Fuehrer and\r\nhis leadership, Raeder hinted of what was to come:\r\n\r\n    “They all planted into a younger generation the great tradition\r\n    of death for a holy cause, knowing that their blood will lead\r\n    the way towards the freedom of their dreams.” (_D-653_)\r\n\r\nThat speech of Raeder’s illustrates his deep personal involvement in the\r\nNazi conspiracy. There is the mixture of heroics and fatalism that led\r\nmillions of Germans to slaughter. There are boasts of the violence used\r\non the people of Almeria. There is the lip service to peace by a man who\r\nplanned conquest. “Armed forces and party have become more and more\r\nunited in attitude and spirit”—there is the authentic Nazi voice. There\r\nis the assertion of racialism. Finally, there is the anti-Semitic\r\ngesture, Raeder’s contribution to the outlook that produced Belsen.\r\nImbued with these ideas, he became an active participant on both the\r\npolitical and military level in the Nazi conspiracy to wage wars of\r\naggression and to wage them ruthlessly.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n    LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ERICH RAEDER\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 67\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

BALDUR VON SCHIRACH\r\n\r\n    A. _SCHIRACH’S NSDAP MEMBERSHIP, NSDAP POSITIONS, AND GOVERNMENT\r\n                              POSITIONS._\r\n\r\nIn an affidavit (_3302-PS_), Schirach has declared that he held the\r\nfollowing positions:\r\n\r\n                     _Positions in the Nazi Party_\r\n\r\n    (1) NSDAP member, 1925 to 1945.\r\n\r\n    (2) Leader of the National Socialist Students League, 1929-1931.\r\n\r\n    (3) Leader of the Hitler Youth organization, 1931-1940.\r\n\r\n    (4) Reich Youth Leader (_Reichsjugendfuehrer_) on the Staff of\r\n    the SA Supreme Command under Ernst Roehm, 1931-1932.\r\n\r\n    (5) Reich Youth Leader (_Reichsjugendfuehrer_) of the NSDAP,\r\n    1931-1940; in 1932 Schirach became an independent Reich Leader\r\n    (_Reichsleiter_), and no longer remained on the Staff of the SA\r\n    Supreme Command.\r\n\r\n    (6) Gruppenfuehrer (Lt. General) of the SA, 1931-1941.\r\n\r\n    (7) Reich Leader (_Reichsleiter_) for Youth Education in the\r\n    NSDAP, 1932-1945.\r\n\r\n    (8) Gau Leader (Gauleiter) of the Reichsgau Vienna, 1940-1945.\r\n\r\n    (9) Obergruppenfuehrer (General) of the SA, 1941-1945.\r\n\r\n                        _Governmental Positions_\r\n\r\n    (1) Reich Youth Leader, 1933-1940.\r\n\r\n    (2) Reich Governor (_Reichsstatthalter_) of the Reichsgau\r\n    Vienna, 1940-1945.\r\n\r\n    (3) Reich Defense Commission of Vienna, 1940-1945.\r\n\r\n    (4) Deputy to the Fuehrer for the Inspection of the Hitler Youth\r\n    (_Beauftragter der Fuehrer fuer die Inspektion der Gesamten\r\n    Hitler Jugend_), 1940-1945.\r\n\r\nSchirach was also a member of the Reichstag from 1932 to 1945\r\n(_2973-PS_).\r\n\r\nB. _SCHIRACH WAS AN INTIMATE AND SLAVISH FOLLOWER OF HITLER SINCE 1925._\r\n\r\nAs early as 1925 Baldur von Schirach, then 18 years old, joined the Nazi\r\nconspirators. Upon special request of Hitler, he went to Munich in order\r\nto study Party affairs. After having joined the NSDAP in 1925, he became\r\nactive in converting students to National Socialism (_3302-PS_). This\r\nwas the start of Schirach’s conspiratorial activities, which he\r\ncontinued for two decades in the spirit of unbending loyalty to Hitler\r\nand to the principles of National Socialism. Schirach shows his slavish\r\nloyalty to Hitler in his principal book, “The Hitler Youth,” published\r\nin 1934:\r\n\r\n    “We were not yet able to account for our conception in detail,\r\n    we simply believed. And when Hitler’s book, _Mein Kampf_, was\r\n    published it was our bible which we almost learned by heart in\r\n    order to answer the questions of the doubters and superior\r\n    critics. Almost everyone today who is leading youth in a\r\n    responsible position joined us in those years.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In my apartment on _Koenigin Strasse_, I was lucky enough to be\r\n    able to express my apprehensions about Strasser to the Fuehrer,\r\n    otherwise I never discussed these things with anybody with the\r\n    exception of Julius Streicher.” (_1458-PS_).\r\n\r\nC. _SCHIRACH WAS THE LEADING NAZI CONSPIRATOR IN DESTROYING INDEPENDENT\r\n     YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS AND IN BUILDING THE NAZI YOUTH MOVEMENT._\r\n\r\n(Reference is made at this point to section 8 of Chapter VII on\r\n“Reshaping of Education and Training of Youth”. See also _3054-PS_.)\r\n\r\nIt was Schirach’s task to perpetuate the Nazi regime through generations\r\nby poisoning the mind of youth, and thereby the mind of the German\r\npeople, and to prepare the German nation for aggressive wars.\r\n\r\nThe basic law concerning the Hitler Youth, which under Schirach’s\r\ntutelage became an instrument of the Nazi State, declares:\r\n\r\n    “The future of the German Nation depends on its youth, and the\r\n    German youth shall have to be prepared for its future duties. *\r\n    * *\r\n\r\n    “All German youth in the Reich is organized within the Hitler\r\n    Youth.\r\n\r\n    “The German youth besides being reared within the family and\r\n    school, shall be educated physically, intellectually, and\r\n    morally in the spirit of National Socialism to serve the people\r\n    and the community, through the Hitler Youth.\r\n\r\n    “The task of educating the German Youth through the Hitler Youth\r\n    is being entrusted to the Reich Leader of German Youth in the\r\n    NSDAP. * * *” (_1392-PS_).\r\n\r\nFor the five years preceding the promulgation of this law Schirach had\r\nbeen leader of the Hitler Youth and Reich Youth Leader of the NSDAP. He\r\ncontinued in these positions until the Nazis launched their aggressive\r\nwars. As late as 4 December 1945, Schirach declared his own feeling of\r\nresponsibility for Nazi policies concerning youth:\r\n\r\n    “I feel myself responsible for the policy of the youth movement\r\n    in the Party and later within the Reich.” (_3302-PS_).\r\n\r\n(1) _Schirach actively promoted the NSDAP and its affiliated youth\r\norganizations before the Nazis seized power._ In 1929 Hitler appointed\r\nSchirach leader of the National Socialist German Students League and in\r\n1931 leader of the Hitler Jugend. After 1931, Schirach devoted his full\r\ntime to Party work (_3302-PS_). Before 1933, Schirach moved throughout\r\nGermany, leading demonstrations and summoning German youth to the Hitler\r\nYouth. When this organization and the wearing of its uniform were\r\nforbidden by law, Schirach continued by illegal means. Of this period he\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n    “Whoever came to us during this illegal time, boy or girl,\r\n    risked everything. * * * With pistols in our belts we drove\r\n    through the Ruhr district while stones came flying after us.”\r\n    (_1458-PS_)\r\n\r\nSchirach admits that Rosenberg and he were not successful before 1933 in\r\nefforts to reach “an understanding” with other youth organizations.\r\nSchirach states that he thereupon arrived at a conclusion which later\r\nwas to spell the doom of independent youth groups:\r\n\r\n    “I realized at that time that an understanding with the leaders\r\n    of the League would never be possible and devoted myself to the\r\n    principle of the totality [_Totalitaet_] of the Hitler Youth\r\n    which in the year 1933 cost all those leagues their independent\r\n    existence.” (_1458-PS_).\r\n\r\n(2) _Schirach, on behalf of the Nazi conspirators, destroyed all\r\nindependent youth organizations or caused them to be absorbed within the\r\nHitler Youth (Hitler Jugend)._ After the Nazi conspirators seized\r\npolitical control of Germany, Schirach was aggressive in bringing the\r\nentire German youth within the Nazi orbit of control and domination.\r\nReferring to the period immediately following 30 January 1933, Schirach\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n    “Now the problem was to apply the victory of the movement to the\r\n    entire youth. Our cabinet ministers were overburdened with their\r\n    new tasks and were working day and night. We could not wait\r\n    until they could find time to solve the youth question by their\r\n    own initiative. Therefore, we had to act ourselves. My\r\n    co-workers met in my Munich apartment and advised me to occupy\r\n    the Reichs Committee [_Reichsausschuss_] of the German Youth\r\n    Leagues [_Jugendverbaende_]. I commissioned General\r\n    [_Obergebietsfuehrer_] Nabersberg with 50 members of the Berlin\r\n    HJ to make a surprise raid on the Reich Committee in the\r\n    Alsenstrasse early the next morning. This was done and at noon\r\n    the press had the report that the HJ [Hitler Youth] had taken\r\n    over the leadership of the Reich Committee.” (_1458-PS_).\r\n\r\nBy a second surprise raid, Schirach took over the Youth Hostels. Of this\r\nSchirach writes in the same book:\r\n\r\n    “In the meantime I gained control over the Reich League for\r\n    German Youth Hostels [_Reichsverband fuer deutsche\r\n    Jugendherbergen_] in a similar manner to the one employed with\r\n    the Reich Committee.” (_1458-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy using the records of the seized Reich Committee, Schirach states that\r\nhe obtained knowledge of the strength and influential personalities of\r\nall the German youth groups.\r\n\r\n    “From this point I recognized the necessity of coming to grips\r\n    with the Greater German Union [_Grossdeutscher Bund_].”\r\n    (_1458-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn June 1933, Schirach was appointed Youth Leader of the German Reich\r\n(_Jugendfuehrer des Deutschen Reiches_) in a solemn ceremony before\r\nHitler. Concerning the period immediately following, Schirach writes in\r\nthe same book:\r\n\r\n    “The first thing I did was to dissolve the Greater German Union\r\n    [_Grossdeutscher Bund_]. Since I headed all German youth\r\n    organizations and I had the right to decide on their leadership,\r\n    I did not hesitate for a moment to take this step, which was for\r\n    the Hitler Youth the elimination of an unbearable state of\r\n    affairs.” (_1458-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of this and other youth organizations was accomplished\r\nby orders issued by Schirach as Youth Leader of the German Reich.\r\n(_2229-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn this position Schirach also appointed deputies to the various German\r\nstates (_Landesbeauftragte_) “to carry out my instructions, and I\r\nappointed district leaders [_Gebietsfuehrer_] to these positions in all\r\nof the states in execution of my right” (_1458-PS_). In this book\r\nSchirach also admits directing the further assimilation or destruction\r\nof other youth organizations:\r\n\r\n    “The Marxist youth as well as all political youth organizations\r\n    I prohibited after the occupation of the Reich Committee. The\r\n    one million members of the HJ which we had on 30 January 1933\r\n    had grown to a round 3,000,000. Only the two large professional\r\n    groups, the Protestant and Catholic youth, were opposed to us.”\r\n    (_1458-PS_)\r\n\r\nSchirach proceeded to hold discussions with the Hitler-appointed Reich\r\nBishop Ludwig Mueller,\r\n\r\n    “And in December 1933, the Reich Bishop and myself were able to\r\n    inform the Fuehrer that incorporation of the Protestant youth\r\n    into the HJ had become a reality.” (_1458-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhen this book was written, Schirach had not yet accomplished the\r\ncomplete coordination of Catholic youth into the Hitler Youth, though he\r\nargued that:\r\n\r\n    “No reasonable man in Germany can give a reason for the\r\n    necessity of the existence of Catholic youth organizations in\r\n    their present form.” (_1458-PS_)\r\n\r\nSchirach’s objective of forcing all German youth into the Hitler Youth\r\nwas finally accomplished by a decree in December 1936. (_1392-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Schirach was mainly responsible for the indoctrination and training\r\nof German youth outside home and school._ The law making compulsory the\r\norganization of all German Youth within the Hitler Youth declared that:\r\n\r\n    “The task of educating the German Youth through the Hitler Youth\r\n    is being entrusted to the Reich Youth Leader in the NSDAP.”\r\n    (_1392-PS_)\r\n\r\nTo make Schirach’s sole competence even clearer, the first executive\r\norder concerning the basic youth law stated:\r\n\r\n    “The youth leader of the German Reich is solely competent for\r\n    all missions of the physical, ideological, and moral education\r\n    of the entire German youth outside of the house of the parents\r\n    and the school.” (_1462-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Schirach was the principal Nazi conspirator in applying the\r\nLeadership principle to German youth._ As a Reich Leader\r\n(_Reichsleiter_) in the NSDAP, Schirach was responsible only to Hitler\r\nor his deputy (_Stellvertreter_), Hess. In youth affairs he was at the\r\ntop of the Nazi leadership pyramid, and under him German youth was\r\ndirected by and completely subjected to the Leadership Principle. The\r\nLeadership Principle, one of the principal control-techniques of the\r\nNazis was explained and glorified by Schirach as it applied to German\r\nyouth:\r\n\r\n    “A single will leads the HJ. The power of authority of the HJ\r\n    leaders, that of the smallest as well as of the largest unit, is\r\n    absolute, i.e., he has the unlimited right to give orders\r\n    because he bears the unlimited responsibility. He knows that the\r\n    responsibility of the higher one comes before that of the lower\r\n    ones. Therefore, he submits silently to the instructions of his\r\n    leaders even if they are directed against him personally. To him\r\n    as well as to all young Germany the history of the HJ is proof\r\n    of the fact that a youth community also can only be successful\r\n    if it unconditionally recognizes the authority of leadership.\r\n    The success of National Socialism is a success of discipline.\r\n    The structure of National Socialist Youth is built on the\r\n    foundation of discipline and obedience. The teachings of the\r\n    time of persecution apply even more to the period of victory and\r\n    power.” (_1458-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _Schirach indoctrinated youth with the Nazi ideology._ Schirach\r\nstates that:\r\n\r\n    “It was my task to educate the youth in the aims, ideology and\r\n    directives of the NSDAP, and beyond this to direct and to shape\r\n    them.” (_3302-PS_)\r\n\r\nFor this purpose the Hitler Youth had an elaborate propaganda apparatus\r\nwhich published numerous periodicals, ranging from a daily press service\r\nto monthly magazines. Through liaison agents the Hitler Youth Propaganda\r\nOffice had permanent contact with Dr. Goebbels’ Propaganda Office of the\r\nNSDAP and with the Ministry of People’s Enlightenment and Propaganda.\r\n(_3349-PS_).\r\n\r\nSchirach, together with Dr. Robert Ley, established the Adolf Hitler\r\nSchools in January 1937. These schools, according to the joint statement\r\nof Reich Leaders (_Reichsleiter_) Schirach and Ley, were open to\r\noutstanding and proven members of the Youth Folk (_Jungvolk_), the\r\njunior section of the Hitler Youth organization. The Adolf Hitler\r\nSchools were destined to train youth free of charge for responsible\r\npositions in National Socialist Germany. These schools were units of and\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the Hitler Youth. Schirach shared with Reich\r\nOrganization Leader (_Reichsorganisationsleiter_) Ley the general\r\nsupervision of the contents of the teaching, the curriculum, and the\r\nstaff of the Adolf Hitler Schools (_2653-PS_). Schirach encouraged a\r\nclose relation between members of the Hitler Youth and the German League\r\nfor Germandom abroad _(Verein fuer das Deutschtum im Ausland_, or\r\n“VDA”). An agreement between Schirach and the leaders of the VDA in 1933\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “(1) With a complete respect for the important racial-political\r\n    task the Hitler Youth recommends to its members membership in\r\n    collaboration with the VDA.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “(3) The school groups of the VDA (racial-German work cells)\r\n    assist the Hitler Youth in their work.” (_L-360-H_)\r\n\r\nSchirach thus subscribed to the “racial-political task” of the NSDAP and\r\nextended his jurisdiction even beyond the border of the German Reich.\r\nHis encouragement and approval of anti-Jewish terror by youth is\r\ndiscussed below.\r\n\r\n(6) _Through the Hitler Youth, Schirach assisted the Nazi conspirators\r\nin developing leaders and members of the NSDAP and its affiliated\r\norganizations, including the SA and the SS._ Sometime before the\r\nlaunching of aggressive wars, the Hitler Youth had become the principal\r\nsource of zealous members for the NSDAP and its affiliated\r\norganizations. Orders of the Party Chancellery concerned with “successor\r\nproblems” of the Party emphasize constant attention to Hitler Youth\r\nmembers as future Nazi leaders, thus attempting the perpetuation of the\r\nNazi regime and Nazi ideology for the immediate future and even into\r\nfuture generations. Only Hitler Youth members who distinguished\r\nthemselves were to be admitted to the Party. Nazi leaders were\r\ninstructed to use “properly qualified full-time Hitler Youth leaders * *\r\n* for the continuation of their political work in the Party service,” so\r\nthat a necessary succession of full-time leaders in the Leader Corps\r\n(_Fuehrerkorps_) of the Party would be secured. (_3348-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Party manual also discusses the Hitler Youth as a recruitment agency\r\nfor future Nazi leaders and members of affiliated organizations of the\r\nNSDAP:\r\n\r\n    “To secure for the Party valuable and trained recruits for\r\n    leadership, suitable Hitler Jugend boys of over 17 can be\r\n    assigned for education and training to leaders from local unit\r\n    leaders on upwards.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Besides the above-mentioned conditions for selections in\r\n    general, a process of elimination results from the fact that\r\n    from youth on the German is cared for, guided, and educated by\r\n    the Party. First they are assembled in the Young Folk\r\n    [_Jungvolk_] from which the young people are transferred into\r\n    the HJ. The boy of the HJ enters the SA, the SS, the NSKK or the\r\n    NSFK or participates in the work of the affiliated organizations\r\n    of the Party. After labor and army service, he returns for\r\n    service to the Party and its affiliates, respectively.”\r\n    (_2401-PS_)\r\n\r\nSpecial arrangements existed between Himmler’s SS and Schirach’s Hitler\r\nYouth concerning the recruiting of members of the Hitler Jugend for\r\nlater service in the SS. Within the Hitler Youth was a special group\r\ncalled the _Streifendienst_ (Patrol Service). Concerning this special\r\ngroup, an official handbook on youth laws states:\r\n\r\n    “Organization of the _Streifendienst_.\r\n\r\n    “1. Since the _Streifendienst_ in the HJ has to perform tasks\r\n    similar to those of the SS for the whole movement, it is\r\n    organized as a special unit for the purpose of securing recruits\r\n    for the general SS; however, as much as possible, recruits for\r\n    the SS special troops, for the SS Death Head Troops, and for the\r\n    officer candidate schools should also be taken from these\r\n    formations.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “4a. The selection of _Streifendienst_ members is made according\r\n    to the principles of racial selection of the _Schutzstaffel_\r\n    [SS]; the competent officials of the SS, primarily unit leaders,\r\n    race authorities, and SS physicians, will be consulted for the\r\n    admission test.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “5. To insure from the beginning a good understanding between\r\n    Reich youth leadership and Reich SS leadership, a liaison office\r\n    will be ordered from the Reich youth leadership to the SS main\r\n    office starting 1 October 1938. The appointment of other leaders\r\n    to the SS sections is a subject for a future agreement.\r\n\r\n    “6. After the organization is completed, the SS takes its\r\n    replacement primarily from these _Streifendienst_ members.\r\n    Admission of youths of German blood who are not members of the\r\n    HJ is then possible only after information and advice of the\r\n    competent Bann leader.” (_2396-PS_)\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, on 17 December 1938, Schirach and Himmler entered\r\ninto and signed another agreement for recruiting SS members from the\r\nranks of the Hitler Youth:\r\n\r\n    “To secure full success for the common effort of the SS and the\r\n    Hitler Youth by strict cooperation, to stem the flight from the\r\n    land, to build a new peasant class, to bring the best part of\r\n    the people into contact with the earth of the homeland, the\r\n    following arrangement has been made in connection with the\r\n    agreement of 26 August 1938.\r\n\r\n    “1. The farm service of the Hitler Youth is according to\r\n    education and aim, particularly well suited as a recruiting\r\n    organization for the _Schutzstaffel_ (general SS and the armed\r\n    sections of the SS; SS special troops and SS death head\r\n    battalions).\r\n\r\n    “2. Boys who suit the special demands of the SS according to\r\n    physical conditions and moral attitude are preferably admitted\r\n    into the farm service of the Hitler Youth.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “5. All farm service members who pass the general admission test\r\n    of the SS will be taken over into the general SS after leaving\r\n    the farm service.” (_2567-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus, by the end of 1938, the Hitler Youth had become the main source\r\nfor future SS members. (For the criminal activities of the SS formations\r\nfor which Hitler Youth members were recruited, see Section 5 of Chapter\r\nXV of the _Schutzstaffeln_ (SS).)\r\n\r\n(7) _Schirach actively engaged in militarizing the Hitler Youth._ In\r\nJune 1933, under an agreement between Hitler and Franz Seldte, which was\r\nnegotiated in the presence of the Reich Minister of War, the “Steel\r\nHelmet League of Front Line Soldiers” (_Stahlhelm, Bund der\r\nFrontsoldaten_) was incorporated into the Nazi movement. The\r\n_Scharnhorst_, the youth organization of the _Stahlhelm_, was integrated\r\ninto the Hitler Youth. (_2260-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Hitler Youth was generally set up along military lines with\r\nuniforms, ranks, and titles. It contained divisions called Naval Hitler\r\nYouth, Motorized Hitler Youth, Hitler Youth Flyers, and Signal Hitler\r\nYouth. According to an official document published by the Reich Youth\r\nLeadership under Schirach, the object of these divisions within the\r\nHitler Youth was to prepare boys, respectively, for the German merchant\r\nmarine and Navy, the National Socialist Motorized Corps (NSKK), for\r\ncivil and military aviation, and for service with signal troops.\r\n(_2654-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn or about 11 August 1939, just before the invasion of Poland, an\r\nagreement was entered into between Schirach and Wilhelm Keitel, then\r\nChief of the High Command of the _Wehrmacht_, which was declared by _Das\r\nArchiv_ to represent “the result of close cooperation” between these two\r\nconspirators. The agreement itself stated:\r\n\r\n    “While it is exclusively the task of the Hitler Youth to attend\r\n    to the training of their units in this direction, it is suitable\r\n    in the sense of a uniform training corresponding to the demands\r\n    of the _Wehrmacht_ to support the leadership of the Hitler Youth\r\n    for their responsible task as trainers and educators in all\r\n    fields of training for defense by special courses * * * A great\r\n    number of courses are in progress.” (_2398-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe agreement stated that it “gives the possibility of roughly\r\nredoubling” the same 30,000 leaders in the Hitler Youth schools for\r\ndirecting shooting practice and field training. Under the agreement,\r\nspecific arrangements were made for messing and billeting the Hitler\r\nYouth leaders at _Wehrmacht_ installations. Former Hitler Youth leaders\r\nin the _Wehrmacht_, who were specially selected volunteers, were to be\r\nassigned as liaison officers and deputies for carrying out this military\r\ntraining. (_2398-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler, in a speech in February 1938, represented that thousands of\r\nGerman boys had received specialized training in naval, aviation, and\r\nmotorized groups within the Hitler Youth, and that over 1 million Hitler\r\nYouth members had received instructions in rifle shooting from 7,000\r\ninstructors. (_2454-PS_)\r\n\r\nD. _SCHIRACH PROMOTED THE ACCESSION TO POWER OF THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS._\r\n\r\nThis allegation of the Indictment is born out by Schirach’s activities\r\nin converting students to National Socialism and by his Leadership of\r\nthe Hitler Youth before the Nazis’ seizure of political power. These\r\nactivities are described above.\r\n\r\n      E. _SCHIRACH PROMOTED THE CONSOLIDATION OF POWER OF THE NAZI\r\n                             CONSPIRATORS._\r\n\r\nSchirach’s acts in accomplishing the Nazis’ complete control over German\r\nyouth are described above. These acts were of notable assistance to the\r\nNazi conspirators in acquiring complete control of Germany during the\r\npre-war years. Schirach’s own words in 1938 leave no doubt as to his own\r\nfeeling of personal responsibility in this connection:\r\n\r\n    “The struggle for the unification of the German youth is\r\n    finished. I considered it as my duty to conduct it in a hard and\r\n    uncompromising manner. Many might not have realized why we went\r\n    through so much trouble for the sake of the youth. And yet: The\r\n    National Socialist German Workers’ Party, whose trustee I felt I\r\n    always was and always will be, this Party considered the\r\n    struggle for the youth as the decisive element for the future of\r\n    the German nation.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “And I promise the German public that the youth of the German\r\n    Reich, the youth of Adolf Hitler, will accomplish its duty in\r\n    the spirit of the man to whom alone their lives belong.”\r\n    (_2306-PS_)\r\n\r\nF. _SCHIRACH PROMOTED THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EDUCATIONAL PREPARATIONS FOR\r\nAGGRESSIVE WAR AND THE MILITARIZATION OF NAZI-DOMINATED ORGANIZATIONS._\r\n\r\nA general outline of Schirach’s acts bearing on this allegation of the\r\nIndictment appears above. By his own admission, Schirach was the\r\nprincipal Nazi responsible for driving the entire Nazi ideology into the\r\nminds of German youths, many of whom grew up to be fanatical Nazis like\r\nSchirach himself. From Hitler, in 1938, came boastings of the\r\naccomplishments of the Hitler Youth in military training. Through the\r\nvast propaganda network of the Reich Youth Leadership, through the Adolf\r\nHitler Schools, through the minute regimentation of youth and its\r\nsubjection to the Leadership Principle, and through the military\r\ntraining of German youth, Schirach fulfilled the edict of the basic law\r\nconcerning the Hitler Youth:\r\n\r\n    “The future of the German nation depends on its youth, and the\r\n    German youth shall have to be prepared for its future duties”.\r\n\r\nIt has been demonstrated that the future duties of the youth entrusted\r\nto Schirach were participation in aggressive wars.\r\n\r\n   G. _SCHIRACH’S GENERAL FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS PARTY AND\r\n              GOVERNMENT LEADER IN THE REICHSGAU VIENNA._\r\n\r\n(1) _Gau Leader_ (_Gauleiter_). Schirach was Gau Leader of the NSDAP for\r\nthe Reichsgau Vienna from July 1940 to 1945. In common with all other\r\nGau Leaders, Schirach was the highest representative of Hitler, the\r\nsupreme Party Leader, in his Gau, and he was the bearer of sovereignty\r\n(_Hoheitstraeger_) of the Party for this regional division of the Party.\r\nAs such, he possessed “sovereign political rights”; he represented the\r\nParty with his Gau; and he was “responsible for the entire political\r\nsituation within” this Gau. (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Party manual makes it mandatory that each Gau Leader meet at least\r\nonce a month with leaders of the affiliated organizations of the NSDAP,\r\nincluding the SA and the SS, “for the purpose of mutual orientation”,\r\nand authorizes the Gau Leader to call upon SA leaders and SS leaders as\r\n“needed for the execution of a political mission.” As a Gau Leader\r\nSchirach was appointed by Hitler and was “directly subordinate” to him.\r\nHe was responsible for coordinating activities of the NSDAP with various\r\nstate authorities, including the police and the Gestapo. (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Reich Governor_ (_Reichsstatthalter_). Schirach was Reich Governor\r\nof the Reichsgau Vienna from July 1940 to 1945. After the _Anschluss_\r\nthe Nazi conspirators abolished the State of Austria as a sovereign\r\nstate and divided Austria into seven Reich Gaus, the most important of\r\nwhich was the Reichsgau Vienna (_Reichsgau Wien_). Schirach, in his\r\ncapacity as Reich Governor, was the lieutenant of the head of the German\r\nState, Hitler, in his Gau. As Reich Governor he was authorized to make\r\ndecrees and issue orders within the limitations set by the supreme Reich\r\nauthorities (_Oberste Reichsbehoerden_). He was especially under the\r\nadministrative supervision of Frick, Reich Minister of Interior. The\r\nReich Governor was also first mayor (_Erster Buergermeister_) of Vienna.\r\n(_3301-PS_)\r\n\r\nSchirach was also Reich Defense Commissar of Vienna from 1940 to 1945.\r\nThese government positions, along with his leadership of the Party in\r\nVienna, made Schirach the most important representative of the Nazi\r\nconspirators in the Reichsgau Vienna. Schirach himself states that as\r\nReich Governor his “field was the direction of the general\r\nadministration” in Vienna. (_3302-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs the highest Party and State leader in the Reichsgau Vienna, Schirach\r\nwas responsible for all the crimes of the Nazi conspirators in the\r\nReichsgau Vienna on the ground that he either initiated, approved,\r\nexecuted, or abetted them. Specific examples, described below,\r\ndemonstrate that in fact he was actively and personally engaged in Nazi\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\n  H. _SCHIRACH PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST\r\n             HUMANITY, PARTICULARLY ANTI-SEMITIC MEASURES._\r\n\r\nSchirach bears responsibility for providing many, if not most, of the\r\nDeath Head (_Totenkopf_) members of the SS, who, in the main,\r\nadministered the concentration camps. As particularized above, the SS,\r\nby agreement between Himmler and Schirach, took “its replacement\r\nprimarily” from _Streifendienst_ members of the Hitler Youth and only\r\nupon special permission could a non-Hitler Youth become an SS man. Nor\r\ncan Schirach escape responsibility for his assistance in implanting in\r\nyouth the Nazi ideology, with its tenets of a master race, “sub-human”\r\npeoples, and world domination. For such notions were the psychological\r\nprerequisites for the instigation and toleration of the atrocities which\r\nzealous Nazis committed throughout Germany and the occupied countries.\r\n\r\n(1) _Schirach directed and participated in the Nazi conspirators’ slave\r\nlabor program._\r\n\r\n(For a full discussion of the slave labor program see Chapter X.)\r\n\r\nVienna was one of the principal cities and an independent Reichsgau of\r\nGreater Germany. Schirach, as Gau Leader and Reich Governor, was\r\ndelegated far-reaching responsibilities concerning the slave labor\r\nprogram and hence shares responsibility for crimes of slave labor.\r\n(_3352-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis document proves that the Gau Leaders were required to be the\r\nsupreme integrating and coordinating agents of the Nazi conspirators in\r\nexecuting the entire manpower program. A circular of the Party\r\nChancellery of 22 March 1942 states that Goering, upon the suggestion of\r\nSauckel, had agreed that the Gau Leaders were to become active as\r\nSauckel’s special Plenipotentiaries (_Bevollmaechtigte_) in order that—\r\n\r\n    “By the leadership of the Party in full appreciation of the\r\n    competence of the corresponding Reich authorities, the highest\r\n    efficiency in the field of manpower shall be guaranteed.”\r\n    (_3352-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering gave Sauckel authority to issue orders to “the agencies of the\r\nParty, its member organizations and affiliated organizations” as well as\r\nto governmental authorities. By an order of 6 April 1942 Sauckel\r\nappointed the Gau Leaders as his “plenipotentiaries for manpower within\r\ntheir respective Gaus,” and charged them with the—\r\n\r\n    “* * * establishment of a harmonious cooperation of all agencies\r\n    of the State, of the Party, of the Armed Forces, and of the\r\n    Economy, charged with problems of manpower and thus to create\r\n    agreement between the different conceptions and requirements to\r\n    obtain the highest efficiency in the field of manpower.”\r\n    (_3352-PS_).\r\n\r\nTo insure that the Gau Leaders could efficiently perform their manpower\r\ntasks, the entire staff of the Provincial Labor Offices were—\r\n\r\n    “* * * directed to be at the disposal of the Gau Leaders for\r\n    information and advice and to fulfill the suggestions and\r\n    demands of the Gau Leader for the purpose of improvements or\r\n    manpower.” (_3352-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn this same order Sauckel said:\r\n\r\n    “By the above mentioned commission of the Gau Leaders of the\r\n    NSDAP, I intend to lead manpower utilization to the greatest\r\n    success.” (_3352-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus, Sauckel, himself an experienced Gau Leader, bears witness to the\r\ninvolvement after 1942 of the Gau Leaders, including Schirach, in the\r\nmanpower utilization program of the Nazi conspirators.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a circular from the Party Chancellery of 4 August 1942,\r\nshows that “Bearers of Sovereignty” (_Hoheitstrager_) of the NSDAP\r\n(which included the Gau Leaders and hence Schirach) were to familiarize\r\nthemselves with the execution of manpower directives on Eastern workers.\r\nOne of the purposes of this directive was to prevent “inept Factory\r\nheads” from giving “too much consideration for the care of the Eastern\r\nWorkers and thereby causing justified annoyance among the German\r\nworkers” (_3352-PS_). What “consideration” was in fact meted out to\r\nEastern Workers in the conspirators’ manpower utilization program is\r\ndiscussed in Chapter X.\r\n\r\n(2) _Schirach participated in the conspiracy to persecute the Churches._\r\nThe activity of Schirach in persecuting churches by dissolving religious\r\nyouth organizations or by incorporating them in the Hitler Youth has\r\nbeen set forth above.\r\n\r\nOfficial letters of Martin Bormann and Hans Lammers, in March 1941, show\r\nthat church properties in Austria had been confiscated for various\r\npretexts after Schirach had become Gau Leader and Reich Governor of the\r\nReichsgau Vienna. Upon a visit of Hitler to Vienna, Schirach and two\r\nother officials raised with him a complaint that the confiscations\r\nshould be made in favor of Gaus rather than of the Reich. Thereafter all\r\nGauleiters were notified that the decision had been made in favor of the\r\nposition Schirach had taken before Hitler, namely in favor of the Gaus.\r\n(_R-146_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Schirach participated in the conspiracy to persecute the Jews._\r\nEven before assuming his Governmental functions in the Reichsgau Vienna,\r\nSchirach was responsible for encouraging anti-Jewish terror. Before\r\n1939, at a meeting of Heidelberg students of the National Socialist\r\nGerman Students Bund (NSDStB), Schirach was chief speaker. After\r\npraising the students for devoting so much of their time to the affairs\r\nof the Party,\r\n\r\n    “* * * he declared that the most important phase of German\r\n    University life in the Third Reich was the program of the\r\n    NSDStB. He extolled various activities of the Bund. He reminded\r\n    the boys of the service they had rendered during the Jewish\r\n    purge. Dramatically he pointed across the river to the old\r\n    University town of Heidelberg where several burnt-out synagogues\r\n    were mute witnesses of the efficiency of Heidelberg students.\r\n    Those skeleton buildings would remain there for centuries, as\r\n    inspiration for future students, as warning to enemies of the\r\n    State.” (_2441-PS_)\r\n\r\nImmediately after becoming Gau Leader and Reich Governor of the\r\nReichsgau Vienna, Schirach’s anti-Jewish measures assumed more\r\nformidable proportions. As early as 7 November 1940, one Dr. Fischer,\r\n“by order” of the Reich Governor Schirach, stated that—\r\n\r\n    “investigations are being made at present by the Gestapo, to\r\n    find out how many able-bodied Jews are still available in order\r\n    to make plans for the contemplated mass projects. It is assumed\r\n    that there are not many more Jews available. If some still\r\n    should be available, however, the Gestapo has no scruples to use\r\n    the Jews even for the removal of the destroyed synagogues. SS\r\n    Colonel Huber will report personally to the\r\n    ‘_Regierungspraesident_’ in this matter.” (_1948-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe _Regierungspraesident_ was Reich Governor Schirach’s personal\r\nrepresentative “within the governmental administration” (_in der\r\nstaatlichen Verwaltung_) of the Reichsgau. (_3301-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe above letter indicates that Schirach and his immediate subordinates\r\nnot only knew of the atrocities which had been committed against the\r\nJews by the Nazi conspirators in the Reichsgau, but also that they\r\nendorsed further forced labor of Jews and worked intimately with the\r\nGestapo and the SS in their measures of persecution. Within six months\r\nafter Schirach became Gau Leader and Reich Governor of Vienna, Dr. Hans\r\nLammers informed Schirach that—\r\n\r\n    “the Fuehrer has decided after receipt of one of the reports\r\n    made by you, that the 60,000 Jews still residing in the\r\n    Reichsgau Vienna, will be deported most rapidly, that is still\r\n    during the war, to the General Government because of the housing\r\n    shortage prevalent in Vienna.” (_1950-PS_)\r\n\r\nLammers’ letter, dated 3 December 1940, informed Schirach that the\r\nGovernor General of Poland, Hans Frank, and the Reichsfuehrer SS,\r\nHimmler, had been informed of the Fuehrer’s decision. (_1950-PS_)\r\n\r\nSchirach’s guilt in this connection, by his own admission, however, runs\r\neven deeper. In a statement to the so-called European Youth League in\r\nVienna in 1942, Schirach stated:\r\n\r\n    “Every Jew who exerts influence in Europe is a danger to\r\n    European culture. If anyone reproaches me with having driven\r\n    from this city, which was once the European metropolis of Jewry,\r\n    tens of thousands upon tens of thousands of Jews into the ghetto\r\n    of the East, I feel myself compelled to reply: I see in this an\r\n    action contributing to European culture.” (_3048-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Conclusion._ Schirach bears responsibility for rendering\r\nsignificant aid to the Nazi conspirators in each major phase of the\r\nconspiracy; winning Nazi supporters before the seizure of power;\r\nconsolidating the Nazis’ control of Germany after the seizure of power;\r\npreparing for aggressive wars; and conducting aggressive wars. From the\r\nbeginning he held important policy-making and administrative positions.\r\nFrom 1931 to the Nazis’ downfall, he was one of the small group of Reich\r\nLeaders (_Reichsleiter_) of the NSDAP who consorted together, directly\r\nsubordinate only to Hitler himself, and who provided the innermost\r\nleaven of the Leadership Corps of the Party. For nearly a decade he was\r\nfully in charge of perpetrating the Nazi regime by poisoning the minds\r\nof the young generation. Although his principal assistance to the\r\nconspiracy was given by his commission of German youth to the\r\nconspirators’ objectives, still he also conspired to wage crimes against\r\nhumanity as a Party and governmental administrator of high standing\r\nafter the conspiracy had reached its inevitable involvement in war of\r\naggression.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO BALDUR VON SCHIRACH\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 65\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

(_2099-PS_)\r\n\r\n   B. _PROMOTION OF THE ACCESSION TO POWER OF THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS,\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF TOTALITARIAN CONTROL OVER GERMANY, AND PREPARATION FOR\r\n                                 WAR._\r\n\r\nWithin the conspiracy Martin Bormann had the managerial task of\r\noperating the Nazis’ Party as a center of control for the benefit of the\r\nconspirators. First as the executive chief of the Nazi Party under Hess,\r\nand since 1941 himself the head of the Party, subject only to Hitler’s\r\nsupreme authority, Bormann was a key member of the Nazi conspiracy. The\r\nParty constituted the most powerful instrument of public control at the\r\ndisposal of the conspirators. Through the Party the conspirators were\r\nable to gain and retain power in Germany. Through it they imposed their\r\nwill on the German nation and obtained its support for their aggressive\r\nwars. Bormann is thus responsible for the crimes committed by the Party\r\nunder the orders of the conspirators.\r\n\r\nBormann began his conspiratorial activities more than 20 years ago. In\r\n1922, when only 22 years old, he joined the Organization Rossbach, one\r\nof the armed illegal groups which developed the aggressive traditions of\r\nthe German Army and established a regime of terror against the small\r\npacifist minority in Germany. While he was District Leader of the\r\nOrganization for Mecklenburg, he was arrested and tried for his part in\r\na political terror assassination. On 15 May 1924 he was found guilty by\r\nthe State Tribunal for the Protection of the Republic and sentenced to\r\none year in prison. (_2981-PS_; _3355-PS_)\r\n\r\nUpon his release from jail in 1925, Bormann again took up his subversive\r\nactivities. First, he joined the Militarist Organization Frontbann.\r\nThen, in the same year, he became a member of the reconstituted Nazi\r\nParty, and began his rise to one of the most influential positions in\r\nthe conspiracy. In 1927 he became Press Chief for the Party Gau of\r\nThuringia. On 1 April 1928 he was made a District Leader in Thuringia,\r\nand Business Manager for the entire Gau.\r\n\r\nFrom 15 November 1928 to August 1930 he was on the Staff of the Supreme\r\nCommand of the SA. Thus he participated decisively in the development of\r\nthese uniformed shock troops with which the conspirators terrorized and\r\ndestroyed their opposition inside Germany. (See Section 4 of chapter XV\r\non the SA.)\r\n\r\nIn August 1930 Bormann organized the Aid Fund (_Hilfskasse_) of the Nazi\r\nParty, of which he became the head. Through this Fund he collected large\r\nsums for the Party Treasury, allegedly for the purpose of aiding\r\nfamilies of Party members who had been killed or imprisoned while\r\n“fighting” for the Party. (_3236-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 30 January 1933 the conspirators and their Party took over the\r\ngovernment of Germany. Shortly thereafter, in July 1933, Bormann was\r\ngiven the number-three post in the Party Organization, that of Chief of\r\nStaff to Rudolf Hess, then Hitler’s Deputy. At the same time he was made\r\na member of the Party Directorate (_Reichsleiter_). In November 1933, he\r\nwas made a member of the Reichstag. (_3236-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs Hess’ Chief of Staff, Bormann was responsible for channeling to him\r\nthe demands of the Party in all the fields of government action. These\r\ndemands were then imposed by Hess, through his participation in Cabinet\r\nmeetings, on legislation, public administration, and appointments.\r\n(_Chart Number 15_; _1395-PS_; _2001-PS_; _D-138_; _3180-PS_)\r\n\r\nBormann also used the Party in order to strengthen the hold of the\r\nGestapo and the SD over the German people. On 14 February 1935 Bormann\r\nordered all Party officers to assist the SD in its work described as\r\n“benefiting principally the Party” (_3237-PS_). On 3 September 1935\r\nBormann ordered Party agencies to hand persons who criticize the Nazi\r\nParty or institutions over to the Gestapo. (_3239-PS_) An order of the\r\nParty Chancery issued on 14 December 1938, demanded closest cooperation\r\nbetween Party agencies and Gestapo (_1723-PS_).\r\n\r\nAfter the flight of Hess to Scotland on 10 May 1941, Bormann succeeded\r\nhim as head of the Party under Hitler, with the title of Chief of the\r\nParty Chancery. In that position he took over all offices and powers\r\nformerly held by Hess, especially his membership in the Cabinet and on\r\nthe Ministers’ Council for the Defense of the Reich (_2099-PS_).\r\n\r\nOnly 8 months later, Hitler issued another Decree which extended\r\nBormann’s powers even beyond those which had been granted to Hess. By\r\nthat Decree Bormann was given extensive control over the preparation of\r\nall laws and directives of the Cabinet, the Fuehrer, and the Ministers’\r\nCouncil for the Defense of the Reich, and over the appointment of all\r\npublic officials (the latter, in Germany, included Judges and university\r\nteachers) (_2100-PS_). Under this legislation Bormann must be held at\r\nleast jointly responsible for every law and order issued after 24\r\nJanuary 1942 by which the conspirators carried out their crimes.\r\n\r\nThis decisive participation of Bormann and the Party agencies under his\r\ndirect control in the day-to-day administration of the German war\r\nprogram was buttressed by the Order of the Ministers’ Council for the\r\nDefense of the Reich, dated 1 December 1942, under which all Party Gau\r\nLeaders were appointed Reich Defense Commissioners and all Gaus became\r\nReich Defense Districts (_3235-PS_). Under this Order the Gau leaders,\r\nwho were Party functionaries under the orders of Bormann, became the\r\nChief Administrators of the entire civilian war effort, not only in\r\nGermany proper but also in all incorporated territories.\r\n\r\nThis development constituted the culmination of the integration of Party\r\nand State which had begun almost ten years earlier. From then on, the\r\nParty, through Bormann, became a decisive factor in the initiation and\r\nexecution of all German war policies, after having been charged in the\r\npreceding years with much of the political and pre-military preparation\r\nof the German people for the aggressive wars of the Conspirators.\r\n(_3242-PS_)\r\n\r\n       C. _DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AND PERSECUTION OF OPPOSITION._\r\n\r\nBormann participated actively in the execution of that part of the\r\nconspirators’ program relating to the persecution and destruction of\r\nindependent groups which were opposed to the aims of the Conspiracy.\r\n\r\n(1) _Persecution of the Churches._ Bormann was among the most relentless\r\nmembers of the conspirators in the persecution of the churches. In a\r\nsecret order of 6 June 1941 he stated bluntly the aim of the\r\nconspirators—to destroy Christianity altogether:\r\n\r\n    “National Socialist and Christian concepts are irreconcilable *\r\n    * *. No human being would know anything of Christianity if it\r\n    had not been drilled into him in his childhood by pastors. The\r\n    so-called dear God in no wise gives knowledge of his existence\r\n    to young people in advance, but in an astonishing manner in\r\n    spite of his omnipotence leaves this to the efforts of the\r\n    pastors. If, therefore, in the future our youth learns nothing\r\n    more of this Christianity whose doctrines are far below ours,\r\n    Christianity will disappear by itself.” (_D-75_; see also\r\n    _098-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this aim, Bormann’s first efforts in the conspiracy’s\r\nfight against religion were directed toward the elimination of churchmen\r\nand church influence from the Party itself. On 3 July 1938 a Bormann\r\norder prohibited clergymen from holding Party offices (_113-PS_). A\r\nBormann circular of 3 June 1939 excluded Christian Scientists from Party\r\nmembership (_838-PS_). Bormann Decrees of 9 February 1937 and 14 July\r\n1939 excluded clergymen and theology students from membership in the\r\nNazi Party (_840-PS_). And a Bormann directive of 17 June 1938,\r\nprohibited all religious activities by members of the Labor Service.\r\n(_107-PS_)\r\n\r\nBormann also opposed religious instruction in the schools. A letter from\r\nBormann’s office to Rosenberg on 25 April 1941 reported success in\r\nreducing the holding of religious morning services in schools and\r\nproposed the substitution of National Socialist school services.\r\n(_070-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn order further to weaken the churches, Bormann enforced the\r\nelimination of numerous Catholic and Protestant Divinity Schools in\r\nGermany and Austria. In a letter to The Minister of Education, dated 24\r\nJanuary 1939, Bormann denied the scientific value of theological\r\ninstruction and suggested a legal basis for the suppression and\r\nrestriction of Divinity Schools (_116-PS_). This was followed by a\r\nreport of The Ministry of Education, dated 6 April 1939, concerning the\r\nsuppression and consolidation of Divinity Schools (_122-PS_). A\r\nconfidential letter from Bormann to The Minister of Education, dated 23\r\nJune 1939, in reply to memorandum of 6 April 1939 (_122-PS_), reported\r\nthe Party’s decision to order the suppression of numerous Divinity\r\nSchools (_123-PS_). In a letter to Rosenberg on 12 December 1939 Bormann\r\nagreed with the suggestion that the University Chairs belonging to the\r\nDivinity School in the University of Munich be used for instructors at\r\nthe Nazi Academy (_Hohe Schule_). (_131-PS_)\r\n\r\nBormann also used his power and position in order to demand that other\r\ngovernment departments deprive the churches of their property and\r\nsubject them to a discriminatory legal regime. A Bormann letter to The\r\nReich Minister of Finance in January 1940, demanded that church\r\nassessments for special war tax be greatly increased (_099-PS_). In a\r\nletter to Amann on 8 March 1940, Bormann demanded reduction in the paper\r\nallotment of church publications (_089-PS_). A Bormann letter to\r\nRosenberg on 24 June 1940 submitted the draft of a discriminatory church\r\nlaw for Danzig and West Prussia (_066-PS_). Throughout 1940-1941 Bormann\r\ncorresponded with numerous officials concerning confiscation of\r\nreligious art treasures. (_1600-PS_)\r\n\r\nFinally, as the war took an increasing part of Germany’s youth into the\r\nArmed Forces, Bormann insisted that soldiers be removed from all\r\nreligious influence. In a letter to the Army High Command in January\r\n1939, Bormann opposed the establishment of an Army Corps of Chaplains\r\n(_117-PS_). A Bormann letter to Rosenberg on 17 January 1940 suggested\r\nthe publication of special Nazi literature for members of the\r\n_Wehrmacht_ in order to replace religious literature which the writer\r\nhad as yet been unable to suppress completely (_101-PS_). In a letter to\r\nRosenberg the next day (18 January 1940) Bormann stated that the\r\npublication of Nazi literature for Army recruits as a countermeasure to\r\nthe circulation of religious writings was “the most essential demand of\r\nthe hour.” (_100-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhen the prosecution of this anti-Church program was turned over to the\r\nRSHA under Himmler, the “Church Specialists” of that organization\r\nreceived clear instructions as to the aims which the Conspirators wanted\r\nthem to achieve, at a meeting of the “Church Specialists” called for\r\nthat purpose on 26 September 1941:\r\n\r\n    “The immediate aim: the church must not regain one inch of the\r\n    ground it has lost.\r\n\r\n    “The ultimate aim: destruction of the churches to be brought\r\n    about by the collection of all material obtained through\r\n    _Nachrichtendienst_ activities, which will, at a given time, be\r\n    produced as evidence for the charge of treasonable activities\r\n    during the German fight for existence.” (_1815-PS_)\r\n\r\nFive years earlier, Bormann had already issued an order to all Party\r\nmembers demanding that they turn priests who criticized the Party over\r\nto the Gestapo (_3246-PS_). Bormann thus bears responsibility for the\r\nmistreatment of priests in concentration camps throughout these years.\r\n(_3249-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Persecution of the Jews._ It was Bormann who was charged by Hitler\r\nwith the transmission and implementation of the latter’s instructions\r\nfor the “liquidation” of the Jewish population in Germany.\r\n\r\nAfter the pogrom of 8-9 November 1938, Bormann, acting on orders of\r\nHitler, instructed Goering to proceed to the “final settlement of the\r\nJewish question” in Germany. (_1816-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs a result of this conference a series of anti-Jewish decrees were\r\nissued. A Bormann order of 17 January 1939 demanded compliance with new\r\nregulations under which Jews were denied access to housing, travel, and\r\nother facilities. (_069-PS_; see _1409-PS_)\r\n\r\nBormann also acted through other government agencies to wipe out the\r\neconomic existence of a large part of the Jewish population. A Bormann\r\norder of 8 January 1937 communicated an order by Frick, issued at his\r\ninstigation, that government employees who consult Jewish doctors,\r\nlawyers, etc., will be denied financial assistance. (_3240-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition to these purely economic measures Bormann, again acting on\r\ninstructions from Hitler, caused Goering to issue a secret order\r\nseverely restricting the living conditions of Jews in Germany.\r\n(_841-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter the outbreak of the war these anti-Jewish measures increased in\r\nintensity and brutality. Thus, Bormann participated in the issuance of\r\nrulings under which 60,000 Jewish inhabitants of Vienna were deported to\r\nthe Government General of Poland, in cooperation with the SS and the\r\nGestapo. (_1950-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter Bormann succeeded Hess as the executive head of the Party, he was\r\none of the prime movers in the campaign of total spoliation, starvation,\r\nand extermination of the Jews living under the rule of the Conspirators.\r\nA Bormann order of 23 October 1942 announced a Ministry of Foods decree,\r\nissued at his instigation, depriving Jews of many essential food items,\r\nand of all special sickness and pregnancy rations, and ordering the\r\nconfiscation of food parcels (_3243-PS_). On 9 October 1942 Bormann\r\nordered that the problem of eliminating forever the millions of Jews\r\nfrom Greater German territory could no longer be solved by emigration\r\nbut only by the application of “ruthless force” in special camps in the\r\nEast (_3244-PS_). The Thirteenth Ordinance under The Reich Citizen Law\r\nof 1 July 1943 (RGBl, 1943, Part I, p. 372), signed by Bormann,\r\ncompletely excluded Jews from the ordinary courts and handed them over\r\nto the exclusive jurisdiction of Himmler’s police. (_1422-PS_; see also\r\n_3085-PS_)\r\n\r\n               D. _THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES._\r\n\r\nBormann’s broad powers over all political aspects of the war as a member\r\nof the Reich Cabinet and the Ministers’ Council for the Defense of the\r\nReich, and as executive head of the Party, were buttressed by the\r\ncreation of the post of Secretary of the Fuehrer, to which he was\r\nappointed on 12 April 1943 (_2981-PS_). In that position Bormann\r\nparticipated in all Hitler’s conferences and became involved in the\r\nplanning of war crimes by his co-conspirators.\r\n\r\nEven before April 1943, however, Bormann took part in planning the basic\r\nwar policies of the conspiracy. Thus, on 16 July 1941, just three weeks\r\nafter the invasion of USSR Territory, Bormann participated in a\r\nconference at Hitler’s field headquarters with Goering, Rosenberg,\r\nKeitel, and Reich Minister Lammers. This conference resulted in the\r\nadoption of detailed plans for the enslavement, depopulation, and\r\nannexation of extensive territories in Russia and other countries of\r\nEastern Europe. In his report on this conference, Bormann included\r\nnumerous suggestions of his own for the effective execution of these\r\nplans. (_L-221_)\r\n\r\nDuring subsequent years, Bormann took a prominent part in the\r\nimplementation of this conspiratorial program. A conference on Eastern\r\nTerritories between Hitler, Rosenberg, Lammers, and Bormann on 8 May\r\n1942, concerned _inter alia_ the suppression of religious freedom, the\r\nforceable resettlement of Dutch peasants in Latvia, the extermination\r\nprogram in Russia, and the economic exploitation of Eastern Territories\r\n(_1520-PS_). Rosenberg and Bormann corresponded concerning the\r\nconfiscation of property, especially art treasures, in the East\r\n(_072-PS_; _071-PS_). A secret Bormann letter of 11 January 1944\r\ndiscussed large-scale organization for the withdrawal of commodities\r\nfrom occupied territories for the use of the bombed-out population in\r\nGermany. (_061-PS_; see also _327-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Bormann issued a series of orders establishing Party\r\njurisdiction over the treatment of prisoners of war, especially when\r\nemployed as forced labor (_232-PS_). In the exercise of that\r\njurisdiction, he called for excessively harsh and brutal treatment of\r\nAllied Prisoners of War. Bormann issued instructions on 5 November 1941\r\nprohibiting decent burials with religious ceremonies for Russian\r\nPrisoners of War (_D-163_). A Bormann circular of 25 November 1943\r\ndemanded harsher treatment of prisoners of war and the fuller\r\nutilization of their man-power (_228-PS_). In a secret circular\r\ntransmitting OKH instructions of 29 January 1943, Bormann provided for\r\nthe enforcement of labor demands on Prisoners of War through the use of\r\nfire-arms and corporal punishment. (_656-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese instructions issued by Bormann culminated in the decree of\r\nSeptember 30 1944, signed by him. This decree took jurisdiction over all\r\nprisoners of war out of the hands of the OKW, handed them over to the\r\ncontrol of Himmler, and provided that all prisoner of war camp\r\ncommanders should be under the orders of the local SS Commanders\r\n(_058-PS_). Through this order, Himmler was enabled to proceed with his\r\nprogram of extermination of Prisoners of War. Bormann also bears part of\r\nthe responsibility for the organized lynching of Allied airmen. As early\r\nas March 1940 Hess had ordered all Party leaders to instruct the\r\ncivilian population to “arrest or liquidate” all bailed-out allied\r\nfliers (_062-PS_). In order to assure the success of this scheme Bormann\r\nissued a secret circular prohibiting any police measures or criminal\r\nproceedings against civilians who had lynched British or American fliers\r\n(_057-PS_). For the execution of these decrees, regulations were issued\r\nto cover the systematic application of Lynch Law against captured Allied\r\nairmen (_735-PS_). That such lynchings actually took place has since\r\nbeen fully established in a series of American Military Commission\r\nproceedings, which resulted in the conviction of German civilians for\r\nthe murder of Allied fliers. (_2559-PS_; _2560-PS_; _2561-PS_)\r\n\r\n         E. _THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY._\r\n\r\nBormann played an important role in the administration of the forced\r\nlabor program. A Bormann circular of 5 May 1943 contained detailed\r\ndirections as to the treatment of foreign workers, stating especially\r\nthat they were subject to SS control for all security matters and that\r\ndifferentiation between them and Germans was all-important (_205-PS_).\r\nAt a conference held on 4 September 1942 it was decided that recruiting,\r\nmobilization, and treatment of 500,000 female domestic workers from the\r\nEast would be handled exclusively by Sauckel, Himmler, and Bormann.\r\n(_025-PS_; see also _D-226_)\r\n\r\nBormann also imposed his views on the administration of the occupied\r\nareas and insisted on the ruthless exploitation of the subjected\r\npopulations in the East. His views were stated in an official memorandum\r\nof the Ministry for the Eastern Territories, headed by Rosenberg, in\r\nwhich they were described as governing actual administrative practice in\r\nthe East:\r\n\r\n    “The Slavs are to work for us. In so far as we don’t need them,\r\n    they may die. Therefore compulsory vaccination and German health\r\n    services are superfluous. The fertility of the Slavs is\r\n    undesirable. They may use contraceptives or practice abortion,\r\n    the more the better. Education is dangerous. It is enough if\r\n    they can count up to 100. At best an education which produces\r\n    useful stooges for us is admissible. Every educated person is a\r\n    future enemy. Religion we leave to them as a means of diversion.\r\n    As for food they won’t get any more than is necessary. We are\r\n    the masters, we come first.” (_R-36_)\r\n\r\nA secret conference on 12 January 1943 discussed Bormann’s order of 12\r\nAugust 1942 under which all Party agencies were placed at Himmler’s\r\ndisposal for the latter’s program of forced resettlement and\r\ndenationalization of occupied populations (_705-PS_). Correspondence\r\nfrom the Office of the Fuehrer’s Deputy reveals Bormann’s demands that\r\nnon-German populations of occupied territories be subjected to a special\r\ndiscriminatory legal regime (_R-139_). An agreement between Thierack and\r\nHimmler was made at Bormann’s suggestion, under which all Eastern\r\npopulations are subjected to brutal police regime, and under which all\r\ndisputes between the parties to the agreement are to be settled by\r\nBormann. (_654-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn issuing these orders Bormann took a large part in the conspiracy to\r\nexterminate millions of people in the Eastern occupied areas.\r\n\r\n                            F. _CONCLUSION._\r\n\r\nMartin Bormann, only 45 years old at the time of Germany’s defeat,\r\ndevoted his entire adult life to the Nazi conspiracy. When he joined the\r\nNazi Party at the age of 25 he had already been active for several years\r\nin conspiratorial and terroristic organizations working secretly to\r\nprepare Germany for war, and had spent one year in jail for his\r\nparticipation in a political murder.\r\n\r\nBormann’s important contribution to the conspiracy remained throughout\r\nin the sphere of the Nazi Party. First, as Chief of Staff to Hess, the\r\nFuehrer’s Deputy, then as Head of the Party Chancery, he managed the\r\nentire organization of the Party in the service of the conspiracy. He\r\nwas responsible for channelling the Party’s demands concerning\r\nlegislation, education, civil service, and all other fields of public\r\nand private life to Hess, who was a member of the Reich Cabinet, which\r\nwas then Germany’s legislative, administrative, and judicial organ.\r\nThus, Bormann advanced the Party’s conspiratorial program through the\r\ncontrol of his co-conspirators over the German government machinery. He\r\nused this power for various criminal purposes, among them the\r\npersecution of the independent churches, demanding their complete\r\nelimination from German life on the ground that Christianity and\r\nNational Socialism were irreconcilable.\r\n\r\nAfter having acceded in 1941 to the highest position in the Nazi Party,\r\ndirectly under Hitler, Bormann exercised the broadest influence in the\r\ndirection of Germany’s aggressive wars. Here he acted in two capacities:\r\n\r\n(1) As executive head of the Party he commanded the Party Gauleaders\r\nwho, as District Defense Commissioners, controlled all civilian and\r\npolitical war activities in German and the annexed territories. In that\r\nposition he became responsible for the multiple war crimes committed by\r\nthe German civilian population, especially the lynching of allied flying\r\npersonnel, and the cruel mistreatment of forced laborers.\r\n\r\n(2) As Secretary to the Fuehrer, Bormann took an active part in the\r\npolicy-making conferences and discussions of Hitler and his political\r\nand military staffs.

FRANZ VON PAPEN\r\n\r\n                   A. _POSITIONS HELD BY VON PAPEN._\r\n\r\n(1) _Awarded the Golden Party Badge by Hitler, thereby becoming member\r\nof NSDAP_ (_2902-PS_; _Das Archiv_ vol. 48, p. 1614).\r\n\r\n(2) _Member of Reichstag_, 1933-1945 (_2902-PS_).\r\n\r\n(3) _Reich Chancellor, 1 June 1932 to 2 December 1932, acting pro-tem\r\nbetween 17 November and 2 December_ (_2902-PS_).\r\n\r\n(4) _Vice Chancellor, 30 January 1933 to August 1934_ (?) (Papen admits\r\nholding office only to 30 June 1934; he also admits that decrees\r\npublished on 1 and 2 August 1934 carry his signature as Vice-Chancellor,\r\nbut claims this was either mistake or forgery) (_2902-PS_).\r\n\r\n(5) _Special Plenipotentiary for the Saar_ (13 November 1933 to 30 June\r\n1934) (_2902-PS_).\r\n\r\n(6) _Negotiator of Concordat with Vatican_ (concluded 20 July 1933)\r\n(_2655-PS_).\r\n\r\n(7) _German Ambassador at Vienna (26 July 1934 to 4 February 1938),\r\ncontinuing thereafter to arrange Berchtesgaden meeting between Hitler\r\nand Schuschnigg and to participate in meeting itself_ (_2902-PS_).\r\n\r\n  B. _AS EX-REICH CHANCELLOR AND PROMINENT POLITICAL LEADER, VON PAPEN\r\n  USED HIS PERSONAL INFLUENCE TO PROMOTE THE ACCESSION OF THE NAZIS TO\r\n                                POWER._\r\n\r\n(1) _When von Papen began these efforts he was well aware of the Nazi\r\nprogram and Nazi methods._ The official NSDAP program was open and\r\nnotorious. For many years it had been published and republished in the\r\nYearbook of the NSDAP and elsewhere. The Nazis made no secret of their\r\nintention to make it the fundamental law of the State. The first three\r\npoints of this program forecast a foreign policy predicated upon the\r\nabsorption of “Germanic” populations outside the boundaries of the\r\nReich, the abrogation of Versailles treaty limitations, and the\r\nacquisition of “_Lebensraum_.” Points 4 to 8 foretold the ruthless\r\nelimination of the Jews, and the 25th point demanded “unlimited\r\nauthority” of the central regime over the entire Reich as a means “for\r\nthe execution of all this” (_1708-PS_).\r\n\r\nHitler and the other leaders of the Party repeatedly reiterated these\r\nviews before 1933. Hitler himself subsequently pointed out that there\r\nwas no excuse for misinterpreting Nazi intentions:\r\n\r\n    “When I came to power in 1933, our path lay unmistakably before\r\n    us. Our internal policy had been, exactly defined by our\r\n    fifteen-year-old struggle. Our program, repeated a thousand\r\n    times, obligated us to the German people. I should be a man\r\n    without honor, worthy of being stoned, had I retracted a single\r\n    step of the program I then enunciated * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “My foreign policy had identical aims. My program was to abolish\r\n    the Treaty of Versailles. It is futile nonsense for the rest of\r\n    the world to pretend today that I did not reveal this program\r\n    until 1933 or 1935 or 1937. Instead of listening to the foolish\r\n    chatter of emigres, these gentlemen would have been wiser to\r\n    read what I have written thousands of times.” (_2541-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler and other Nazi leaders repeatedly made clear their willingness to\r\nuse force if necessary to achieve their purposes. They glorified war.\r\n_Mein Kampf_ is replete with early evidence of such intentions, which\r\nsubsequently were reaffirmed from time to time in the years preceding\r\n1933 (_D-660_; _2771-PS_; _2512-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe Nazi leaders prior to 1933 had openly declared their intentions to\r\nsubvert democratic processes as a means to achieve their purposes, and\r\nto this end to harass and embarrass democratic forces at every turn.\r\nThus Hitler himself had declared that,\r\n\r\n    “We shall become members of all constitutional bodies, and in\r\n    this manner make the Party the decisive factor. Of course, when\r\n    we possess all constitutional rights we shall then mould the\r\n    State into the form we consider to be the right one.”\r\n    (_2512-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrick, writing in the National Socialist Yearbook, declared:\r\n\r\n    “Our participation in the parliament does not indicate a\r\n    support, but rather an undermining of the parliamentarian\r\n    system. It does not indicate that we renounce our\r\n    anti-parliamentarian attitude, but that we are fighting the\r\n    enemy with his own weapons and that we are fighting for our\r\n    National Socialist goal from the parliamentary platform.”\r\n    (_2742-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe practical application of these purposes was thus subsequently\r\ndescribed by a leading Nazi constitutional authority, Ernst Rudolf\r\nHuber:\r\n\r\n    “It was necessary above all to make formal use of the\r\n    possibilities of the party-state system but to refuse real\r\n    cooperation and thereby to render the parliamentary system,\r\n    which is by nature dependent upon the responsible cooperation of\r\n    the opposition, incapable of action.” (_2633-PS_).\r\n\r\nThis practical application of Nazi purposes and methods was manifest at\r\nthe time von Papen was a member of the Reichstag and Vice Chancellor. By\r\nthis time the Nazi members of the Reichstag were engaging in tactics of\r\ndisturbance which finally culminated in physical attacks upon members of\r\nthe Reichstag and upon visitors, and were using terroristic measures to\r\nassure their election (_L-83_).\r\n\r\nVon Papen not only had the opportunity to observe early manifestations\r\nof Nazi violence and irresponsibility. He fully understood the true\r\ncharacter of the Nazi menace before 1933 and publicly condemned it.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the German elections in the summer of 1932, von Papen,\r\nPresident Hindenburg, and certain other German leaders were hoping that\r\nthe rising Nazi menace would be dissipated by providing for National\r\nSocialist participation in a rightist-centrist government. Hitler\r\nrefused all overtures inviting such participation, even when suggested\r\nby President Hindenburg himself, insisting upon assuming the\r\nchancellorship without obligation to other parties. Hitler’s refusal at\r\nthis time to collaborate with Hindenburg and Papen marked the beginning\r\nof a series of public declarations in which von Papen revealed a clear\r\nunderstanding of Nazi methods and objections. Thus, on the occasion of\r\nhis Munster speech of 28 August 1932 von Papen declared:\r\n\r\n    “The licentiousness emanating from the appeal of the leader of\r\n    the National Socialist Movement does not comply very well with\r\n    his claims to governmental power.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I do not concede him the right to regard the mere minority\r\n    following his banner solely as the German nation, and to treat\r\n    all our fellow countrymen as ‘free game’.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I am advocating the constitutional state, the community of the\r\n    people, law and order in government. In doing so, it is I, and\r\n    not he, who is carrying on the struggle against the domination\r\n    of parties, against arbitrarianism and injustice, a struggle\r\n    which millions of his supporters had been wholeheartedly longing\r\n    for years to fight.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I am firmly determined to stamp out the smouldering flame of\r\n    civil war, to put an end to political unrest and political\r\n    violence, which today is still such a great obstacle to the\r\n    positive work representing the sole task of the State.”\r\n    (_3314-PS_)\r\n\r\nWriting in the September 1932 issue of the periodical “_Volk und\r\nReich_,” von Papen declared:\r\n\r\n    “The present situation clearly shows that party domination and\r\n    State leadership are concepts incompatible with one another. It\r\n    is conceivable theoretically that a party might gain the\r\n    majority in parliament and claims the government (State\r\n    leadership) for itself. The NSDAP has proclaimed this\r\n    theoretical possibility as its practical goal and has come very\r\n    close to attaining it. It is to be hoped that the leaders of\r\n    this movement will place the nation above the party and will\r\n    thus lend a visible expression to the faith of millions looking\r\n    for a way out of the spiritual and material distress of the\r\n    nation provided also by the leadership of the State.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * The hope in the hearts of millions of national socialists\r\n    can be fulfilled only by an authoritarian government. The\r\n    problem of forming a cabinet on the basis of a parliamentary\r\n    coalition has again been brought into the field of public\r\n    political discussion. If such negotiations, in the face of\r\n    growing distress, are conducted with the motif of destroying the\r\n    political opponent by the failure of his governmental activity,\r\n    this is a dangerous game against which one cannot warn enough.\r\n    In the last analysis such plans can mean nothing else but a\r\n    tactics which counts on the possibility that matters get worse\r\n    for the people and that the faith of millions will turn into the\r\n    bitterest disappointment, if these tactics only result in the\r\n    destruction of the political adversary. It is within the nature\r\n    of such party-tactical maneuvers that they are veiled and will\r\n    be disclaimed in public. That, however, cannot prevent me from\r\n    warning publicly against such plans, about which it may be\r\n    undecided who is the betrayer and who the betrayed one; plans,\r\n    though, which will certainly cheat the German people out of\r\n    their hope for improvement of their situation. Nothing can prove\r\n    more urgently the necessity for an authoritarian government than\r\n    such a prospect of maneuvers of a tactical game by the parties.”\r\n    (Papen article quoted in “Frankfurter Zeitung”, 2 Sept. 1932, p.\r\n    2).\r\n\r\nIn his Munich speech on 13 October 1932 von Papen was especially clear:\r\n\r\n    “The essence of conservative ideology is its being anchored in\r\n    the divine order of things. That too is its fundamental\r\n    difference compared with the doctrine advocated by the NSDAP.\r\n    The principle of ‘exclusiveness’ of a political ‘everything or\r\n    nothing’ which the latter adheres to, its mythical\r\n    Messiah-belief in the bombastic Fuehrer who alone is destined to\r\n    direct fate, gives it the character of a political sect. And\r\n    therein I see the unbridgeable cleavage between a conservative\r\n    policy born of faith and a national-socialist creed as a matter\r\n    of politics. It seems to me that today names and individuals are\r\n    unimportant when Germany’s final fate is at stake. What the\r\n    nation demands is this: it expects of a movement which has\r\n    written upon its banner the internal and external national\r\n    freedom that it will act, at all times and under all\r\n    circumstances, as if it were the spiritual, social and political\r\n    conscience of the nation. If it does not act that way; if this\r\n    movement follows merely tactical points of view,\r\n    democratic-parliamentarian points of view, if it engages in the\r\n    soliciting of mass support using demagogic agitation and means\r\n    of proletarian class struggle—then it is not a movement any\r\n    more, it has become a political party.\r\n\r\n    “And, indeed, the Reich was almost destroyed by the political\r\n    parties. One simply cannot, on one side, despise mercilessly\r\n    masses and majorities, as Herr Hitler is doing, and on the other\r\n    hand surrender to parliamentarian democracy; surrender to the\r\n    extent of adopting resolutions against one’s own government\r\n    together with Bolshevists.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In the interest of the entire nation we decline the claim to\r\n    power by parties which want to own their followers body and\r\n    soul, and which want to put themselves, as a party or a\r\n    movement, over and above the whole nation.” (_3317-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a series of interviews and speeches in the fall of 1932 von Papen\r\ncastigated the Nazi party for its ambitions to achieve a total and\r\ncentralized control of Germany. He contrasted its objectives and methods\r\nto his own “conservatism” and emphasized its incompatibility with the\r\npreservation of the “federalistic” type of government to which he was\r\ncommitted. His public pronouncements in this connection were clearly\r\nreflected in the contemporary press:\r\n\r\n    “Von Papen claimed that it had been his aim from the very\r\n    beginning of his tenure in office to build a new Reich for and\r\n    with the various states [_Laender_]. The Reich government is\r\n    taking a definite federalist attitude. Its slogan is not a\r\n    dreary centralism or unitarianism.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Wherever one did hear von Papen express himself in public, one\r\n    did hear a chancellor who took special care to be regarded as an\r\n    unconditional federalist.” (_3318-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Vice Chancellor’s campaign against the Nazis culminated finally in a\r\nradio speech to the German public on 4 November 1932, in which he\r\nseverely criticized Nazi political methods. He damned the Nazis’ “pure\r\nparty egoism” which resulted in methods described by him as “sabotage”\r\nand as “a crime against the nation.” He accused the Nazis of wanting\r\ncomplete and permanent power in Germany (_Deutsche Reichsgeshichte in\r\nDokumenten IV_, p. 523 (Rundfunkrede des Reichkanzlers von Papen)).\r\n\r\nNor was von Papen content merely to make speeches against the Nazis. As\r\nlate as November 1932, Papen was prepared to use all the forces at the\r\ncommand of the state in a supreme effort to suppress the rising Nazi\r\nmenace. He was deterred from this purpose only by a failure to secure\r\nthe support of his cabinet. The inner struggles of the German cabinet at\r\nthis time are recounted by Otto Meissner (in a statement made at\r\nNurnberg, 28 November 1945), Chief of the Chancery of Reichspresident\r\nHindenburg.\r\n\r\n    “Papen’s reappointment as Chancellor by President Hindenburg\r\n    would have been probable if he had been prepared to take up an\r\n    open fight against the National Socialists, which would have\r\n    involved the threat or use of force. Almost up to the time of\r\n    his resignation, Papen and some of the other ministers agreed on\r\n    the necessity for pressing the fight against the Nazis by\r\n    employing all the resources of the State and relying on Article\r\n    48 of the Constitution, even if this might lead to armed\r\n    conflict. Other ministers, however, believed that such a course\r\n    would lead to civil war.\r\n\r\n    “The decision was provided by Schleicher, who in earlier times\r\n    had recommended energetic action against the National\r\n    Socialists—even if this meant the use of police and army. Now,\r\n    in the decisive cabinet meeting, he abandoned this idea and\r\n    declared himself for an understanding with Hitler.\r\n\r\n    “The gist of Schleicher’s report—which was given partly by\r\n    himself, partly by Major Ott, who adduced detailed statistical\r\n    material—was that the weakened Reichswehr, which was dispersed\r\n    over the whole Reich, even if supported by civilian volunteer\r\n    formations, would not be equal to military operations on a large\r\n    scale, and was not suited and trained for civil war. The police,\r\n    in particular the Prussian police, had been undermined by\r\n    propaganda and could not be considered as absolutely reliable.\r\n    If the Nazis began an armed revolt, one must anticipate a revolt\r\n    of the Communists and a general strike at the same time. The\r\n    forces of these two adversaries were very strong. If such a ‘war\r\n    against two fronts’ should take place, the forces of the State\r\n    would undoubtedly be disrupted. The outcome of a civil war would\r\n    be at the least most uncertain.\r\n\r\n    “In his, Schleicher’s view, it was impossible to take the risks\r\n    implied in such a policy. In case of failure, which he believed\r\n    likely, the consequences for Germany would be terrible. All\r\n    present in the cabinet meeting were deeply impressed by\r\n    Schleicher’s statement, and even those who had been in favor of\r\n    energetic action against the National Socialists now changed\r\n    their mind, so that Papen was isolated and felt himself to be\r\n    isolated.\r\n\r\n    “In the interview which Papen had with Hindenburg after this\r\n    meeting, on November 17th 1932 Papen did not conceal his deep\r\n    disappointment over Schleicher’s altered position. Although\r\n    Hindenburg asked him to make a new attempt to form a government,\r\n    Papen stood on his decision to resign and Hindenburg gave in.”\r\n\r\n(2) _Despite his appreciation of the Nazi menace, von Papen rigorously\r\nproceeded to conduct negotiations which resulted in placing Hitler and\r\nthe Nazi regime in power._ Following his resignation as Chancellor on 17\r\nNovember 1932 von Papen continued as Chancellor pro-tem until 2 December\r\n1932, when General Schleicher was appointed to replace him (_2902-PS_).\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as he vacated the Chancery, von Papen began plotting to\r\nunseat his arch-rival Schleicher. On about 10 December 1932—less than a\r\nmonth after he was willing to use force to suppress the Nazis—von Papen\r\nrequested Kurt von Schroeder, the Cologne banker, to arrange a meeting\r\nbetween Hitler and von Papen (according to the statement of Schroeder,\r\nmade at Nurnberg, 5 December 1945). Schroeder was one of a group of\r\nrightist industrial and financial leaders who had previously been\r\norganized by Hitler’s man, Wilhelm Keppler, to provide means of\r\nbolstering Nazi economic power.\r\n\r\nHitler himself at this time understood von Papen. He knew that Papen’s\r\nideas were not too different from his own to preclude agreement. He knew\r\nthat Papen’s personal rivalry with Schleicher would make Papen amenable\r\nto some agreement whereby Schleicher might be unhorsed and Papen\r\nrestored to a position of public prominence. He accordingly asked\r\nKeppler to arrange for a meeting with Papen (reported in an affidavit of\r\nWilhelm Keppler, executed at Nurnberg, 26 November 1945).\r\n\r\nThe result of these maneuvers was the now-famous meeting between Hitler\r\nand Papen at banker Schroeder’s Cologne home in January 1933. It was at\r\nthis meeting that Hitler and Papen reached an understanding, subject\r\nonly to the ironing out of minor details. It was at this meeting that\r\nPapen completely committed himself to go along with Nazi policy.\r\n\r\nThe events of this day have been described by Kurt von Schroeder (in a\r\nstatement referred to above):\r\n\r\n    “On January 4, 1933, Hitler, von Papen, Hess, Himmler and\r\n    Keppler came to my house in Cologne. Hitler, von Papen and I\r\n    went to my den where we were closeted in a discussion lasting\r\n    about two hours. Hess, Himmler and Keppler did not participate\r\n    in this discussion but were in the next room. Keppler, who had\r\n    helped arrange this meeting, came from Berlin; von Papen came\r\n    alone from his home in the Saar; and Hitler brought Hess and\r\n    Himmler with him, as they were traveling with him to Lippe in\r\n    connection with the election campaign. The discussion was only\r\n    between Hitler and Papen; I personally had nothing to say in the\r\n    discussion. The meeting started about 11:30 A.M. and the first\r\n    question was raised by Hitler as to why it was necessary to\r\n    punish the two Nazis who had killed the Communist in Silesia.\r\n    Von Papen explained to Hitler that it had been necessary to\r\n    punish these two Nazis, although they had not been put to death,\r\n    because the law was on the books and all political offenders\r\n    under the law must have some punishment. He further explained to\r\n    Hitler that it might be possible to get a pardon from President\r\n    Hindenburg to give serious consideration to making Hitler the\r\n    Chancellor at the time that Hindenburg met with Hitler and von\r\n    Papen and that he had understood that Hindenburg was perfectly\r\n    willing to discuss this matter with Hitler at that time. He said\r\n    that it came as a great surprise and shock to him when\r\n    Hindenburg was unwilling to do so and he felt that someone,\r\n    probably von Schleicher, was responsible for the change in\r\n    Hindenburg’s point of view. Next, von Papen told Hitler that it\r\n    seemed to him the best thing to have the conservatives and\r\n    nationalists who had supported him join with the Nazis to form a\r\n    government. He proposed that this new government should, if\r\n    possible, be headed by Hitler and von Papen on the same level.\r\n    Then Hitler made a long speech in which he said if he were made\r\n    Chancellor, it would be necessary for him to be head of the\r\n    government but that supporters of Papen could go into his\r\n    (Hitler’s) government as ministers when they were willing to go\r\n    along with him in his policy of changing many things. These\r\n    changes he outlined at this time included elimination of Social\r\n    Democrats, Communists and Jews from leading positions in Germany\r\n    and the restoration of order in public life. Von Papen and\r\n    Hitler reached an agreement in principle so that many of the\r\n    points which had brought them in conflict could be eliminated\r\n    and they could find a way to get together. They agreed that\r\n    further details would have to be worked out and that this could\r\n    be done in Berlin or some other convenient place.\r\n\r\n    “I understand they met later with von Ribbentrop and worked out\r\n    further details.\r\n\r\n    “The meeting broke up about 1:30 and the three of us joined\r\n    Hess, Himmler and Keppler at lunch, during which there was\r\n    general conversation which lasted until about four o’clock when\r\n    they, all the guests, departed.”\r\n\r\nHaving reached an understanding with Hitler, von Papen directed his\r\nenergy toward convincing President Hindenburg to allow Hitler to form a\r\nnew government. In this task he had to overcome Hindenburg’s fears that\r\nthis appointment would lead to domestic oppressions and risk of war\r\n(according to a statement of Otto Meissner, Nurnberg, 28 November 1945).\r\n\r\nVon Papen himself subsequently admitted the important role he played in\r\nbringing Hitler to power. At Berchtesgaden on 12 February 1938,\r\nimmediately after Hitler had forced Schuschnigg to sign the document\r\nwhich led to the Austrian Anschluss, Hitler turned to Papen and\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n    “Herr von Papen, through your assistance I was appointed\r\n    Chancellor of Germany and thus the Reich was saved from the\r\n    abyss of communism. I will never forget that.”\r\n\r\nPapen replied:\r\n\r\n    “_Ja, wohl, Mein Fuehrer._” (_2995-PS_)\r\n\r\n    C. _AS VICE-CHANCELLOR, VON PAPEN USED HIS POSITION AND PERSONAL\r\nINFLUENCE TO FACILITATE THE CONSOLIDATION OF NAZI CONTROL OVER GERMANY._\r\n\r\n(1) _In the first critical year and a half of Nazi consolidation of\r\ncontrol over Germany, von Papen was second only to Hitler in the Cabinet\r\nwhich established the legal basis for furtherance of the Nazi program._\r\nAs Vice-Chancellor, van Papen was the only member of the government\r\nempowered to act for the Fuehrer in his absence.\r\n\r\n(2) _Von Papen actively participated in the general abolition of civil\r\nliberties by promoting legislation which paved the way for the Nazi\r\npolice state._ At the first meeting of Hitler’s Cabinet, there was\r\nintensive discussion concerning the possibility of securing passage of\r\nan Enabling Law which in practical effect would liquidate the Reichstag\r\nand make the Nazi Cabinet the supreme law-making power of the Reich. The\r\nconspirators, including von Papen, at this meeting clearly indicated\r\nthat they did not at the time hold sufficient power to achieve this\r\nmeasure by normal constitutional methods (_351-PS_).\r\n\r\nSeizing the Reichstag fire as a pretext, the Cabinet forthwith arranged\r\nfor the suspension of those fundamental civil liberties (including\r\nfreedom of speech, press, assembly and association) which would protect\r\ncitizens who dared to oppose the plans of the conspirators. The\r\nsuspension of civil liberties was accomplished by issuance of a\r\nPresidential decree, which presumably, according to German usage, was\r\nproposed to the Reich President by the Cabinet and countersigned by\r\nthose Ministers whose departments were involved (_1390-PS_; _2050-PS_).\r\n\r\nThis basic law was only the first of a series which placed the\r\nindividual dissenter at the mercy of the Nazi state. As if to underscore\r\nexplicitly the basic policy behind this legislation, von Papen\r\npersonally signed the decree which implemented this legislation by\r\ncreating Special Courts to enforce its provisions. This decree abolished\r\nrights, including the right of appeal, which had previously\r\ncharacterized the administration of justice by the German judicial\r\nsystem. It thus constituted also the first legislative measure for the\r\nNazification of the German judiciary (_2076-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe subsequent creation of the dreaded _Volksgericht_ and the wholesale\r\nNazification of the German system of criminal law was merely the logical\r\ndevelopment of these earlier steps. This too was achieved by decree of\r\nthe Cabinet in which von Papen was Vice-Chancellor (_2014-PS_).\r\n\r\n(3) _Von Papen actively participated in substitution of the Nazi Cabinet\r\nfor the Reichstag as Germany’s supreme law-giving authority,\r\nnotwithstanding his doubts as to the advisability of giving Hitler such\r\nextensive power._ Von Papen actively participated in the Cabinet\r\ndeliberations concerning the proposed so-called Enabling Act, and\r\nconcerning the means by which it might be made law (_351-PS_; _2962-PS_;\r\n_2963-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe enactment of this law deprived the Reichstag of its legislative\r\nfunctions, so that legislative as well as executive powers were\r\nconcentrated in Hitler and his Cabinet (_2001-PS_).\r\n\r\nEnactment of the law was made possible only by the application of Nazi\r\npressure and terror against the potential opponents of this legislation,\r\nand by taking advantage of the Presidential decree of 28 February 1933,\r\nsuspending constitutional guarantees of freedom. (See section 2 of\r\nChapter VII on the Acquisition of Totalitarian Political Control.)\r\n\r\nAs if to indorse the methods by which this legislation was enacted, von\r\nPapen personally signed the Amnesty Decree of 21 March 1933, liberating\r\nall persons who had committed murder between 30 January and 21 March\r\n1933 against anti-Nazi politicians, writers, and Reichstag Deputies\r\n(_2059-PS_).\r\n\r\nVon Papen participated in this program notwithstanding the fact that he\r\nforesaw at that time the implications of granting to Hitler the complete\r\npowers conferred by the Enabling Act. He has so testified (in an\r\ninterrogation at Nurnberg, 3 September 1945):\r\n\r\n    “Q. After Hitler became Chancellor, when for the first time did\r\n    you have any doubts about the wisdom of having allowed him to\r\n    become Chancellor?\r\n\r\n    “A. Well, that’s difficult to say. I mean the first doubt\r\n    certainly I had when the Reichstag gave in to his request for\r\n    the law, to enable him to rule the country without parliament.”\r\n\r\n(4) _Von Papen not only participated in the seizure by the cabinet of\r\nsupreme power for the Nazis, but as a member of the cabinet participated\r\nin the systematic elimination of all potential enemies of the Nazi\r\nconspiracy._ The Reichstag fire and the ensuing suppression of civil\r\nliberties marked the beginning of the destruction of all rival political\r\nparties. The immediate elimination of the legally elected Communist\r\nmembers from the Reichstag was merely the forerunner of the rapid and\r\ncomplete liquidation of all political parties other than the National\r\nSocialists (_2403-PS_; _1396-PS_; _2058-PS_; _1388-PS_). By these\r\nmeasures the suppression of all democratic opposition became complete,\r\nwithin one year of the time when von Papen was warning his countrymen of\r\nthe dangers of authoritarianism.\r\n\r\nHaving substituted the autocracy of the Hitler cabinet for the\r\ndemocratic force of the Reichstag, the cabinet proceeded immediately to\r\nenact a series of laws abolishing the states and coordinating them with\r\nthe Reich (_2004-PS_; _2005-PS_; _2006-PS_). The enactment of these\r\nlaws, which had been clearly indicated by point 25 of the Party program,\r\nremoved all possible retarding influences which the German federal\r\nStates might have exerted against the overwhelming centralization of\r\npower in Hitler’s Reich Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this step, as well as the role played by Papen, is\r\nreflected in an exchange of letters between Reichs President Hindenburg,\r\nvon Papen in his capacity as Reichskommissar for Prussia, and Reichs\r\nMinister Goering. The exchange occurred in connection with the recall of\r\nthe Reichskommissar and the appointment of Goering to the post of\r\nMinister President of Prussia. In tendering his resignation, on 7 April\r\n1933, von Papen wrote to Hitler:\r\n\r\n    “With the draft of the law for the coordination of the states\r\n    with the Reich, passed today by the Reich Chancellor,\r\n    legislative work has begun which will be of historical\r\n    significance for the political development of the German state.\r\n    The step taken by the Reich Government, which I headed at the\r\n    time, is now crowned by this new inter-locking of the Reich.\r\n    You, Herr Reich Chancellor, will now, as once Bismarck, be able\r\n    to coordinate in all points the policy of the greatest of German\r\n    states with that of the Reich. Now that the new law enables you\r\n    to appoint a Prussian Prime Minister I ask you to inform the\r\n    Reich President that I return to his hands my post of Reichs\r\n    Commissar for Prussia.” (_3357-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn transmitting this resignation request to President Hindenburg, Hitler\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “Vice-Chancellor von Papen has sent a letter to me which I\r\n    enclose for your information. Herr von Papen already informed me\r\n    within the last few days that he agreed with Minister Goering to\r\n    resign on his own volition, as soon as the unified conduct of\r\n    the governmental affairs in the Reich and in Prussia would be\r\n    assured by the new law on coordination of policy in the Reich\r\n    and the states [_Laender_].\r\n\r\n    “On the eve of the day when the new law on the institution of\r\n    Reich governors [_Reichs-Statthalter_] was adopted, Herr von\r\n    Papen considered this aim as having been attained and he\r\n    requested of me to undertake the appointment of the Prussian\r\n    Prime Minister, when at the same time he would offer his full\r\n    time services in the Reich Government.\r\n\r\n    “Herr von Papen, in accepting the commission for the Government\r\n    of Prussia in these difficult times since 30 January, has\r\n    rendered a very meritorious service to the realization of the\r\n    idea of coordinating the policy in the Reich and the States. His\r\n    collaboration in the Reich cabinet, for which he now offers all\r\n    his strength, is infinitely valuable; my relationship to him is\r\n    such a heartily friendly one, that I sincerely rejoice at the\r\n    great help I shall thus receive.\r\n\r\n                                         “For profound reverence,\r\n                                               “A.H.” (_3357-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe enactment of this legislation followed repeated declarations in\r\nwhich Papen had warned his countrymen of the dangers of the exaggerated\r\ndegree of centralized authority which would result from abolition of the\r\nfederal system. These warnings began before Hitler’s accession to power\r\nand continued by implication in the reassurances which Papen gave in\r\nFebruary 1933 to Bavarian political leaders who expressed their fears of\r\nNazi centralized authority (_Cuno Horkenbach, Das Deutsche Reich von\r\n1918 bis Heute._ (The German Reich from 1918 until today) (Berlin 1933),\r\np. 44). As late as 3 March 1933, in an election speech at Stuttgart, von\r\nPapen warned that:\r\n\r\n    “Federalism saves us from centralism, that organizational form\r\n    which concentrically draws all the vital forces of a people to\r\n    one point, as a mirror will do with the rays of the sun. No\r\n    people is less suited for being governed centralistically than\r\n    the German people.” (_3313-PS_)\r\n\r\nLess than one month after its seizure of the legislative power, the\r\ncabinet of which von Papen was a member enacted the first of a series of\r\nlaws aimed at establishing firm Nazi control over the entire civil\r\nservice and judiciary (_2012-PS_; _1400-PS_; _1398-PS_). Having been a\r\npublic servant himself, von Papen was aware of the far-reaching effect\r\nof these first legislative and administrative steps in attaining full\r\ntotalitarian control over the entire governmental machinery of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet of which von Papen was a member embarked upon a state policy\r\nof persecution of the Jews. The first organized act in this program was\r\nthe boycott of Jewish enterprises on 1 April 1933, which was approved by\r\nthe entire cabinet. This was followed by a series of laws beginning the\r\nsystematic elimination of the Jews from public and professional life in\r\nGermany. (See Section 7 of Chapter VII on the Program for Persecution of\r\nJews.)\r\n\r\nAll these suppressive measures were in line with long-standing basic\r\nobjectives of the NSDAP to which von Papen had agreed in his January\r\nconference with Hitler and von Schroeder.\r\n\r\n(5) _To complete its suppression of all rival influences, the Cabinet of\r\nwhich von Papen was a member enacted a series of decrees which\r\nstrengthened the Nazi movement by conferring upon it a para-governmental\r\nstatus._ Followers of the Party, through a decree signed personally by\r\nvon Papen, were granted amnesty “for penal acts committed in the\r\nmaterial revolution of the German People, in its preparation of the\r\nfight for the German soil” (_2059-PS_). The perpetrators of Nazi\r\nterrorism were thereby placed above the law, and a pattern was\r\nestablished for the subsequent handling of Nazi excesses.\r\n\r\nThis cabinet enacted measures which gave legal protection to the status\r\nand symbols of the Party and its formations (_1652-PS_; _2759-PS_).\r\n\r\nThis cabinet enacted a series of measures to assure the Nazi movement’s\r\nspiritual control over Germany (_2029-PS_; _2030-PS_; _2415-PS_;\r\n_2083-PS_; _2078-PS_; _2088-PS_).\r\n\r\nHaving first outlawed all political parties other than the NSDAP, the\r\ncabinet of which von Papen was a member formally decreed that:\r\n\r\n    “1. After the victory of the National Socialistic Revolution,\r\n    the National Socialistic German Labor Party is the bearer of the\r\n    concept of the German State and is inseparably the state.\r\n\r\n    “2. It will be a part of the public law. Its organization will\r\n    be determined by the Fuehrer.” (_1395-PS_).\r\n\r\nHaving granted para-governmental status to the Nazi party, and having\r\nassured legal unity of the Party’s Fuehrer and the Reich’s Chancellor,\r\nthe Nazis next step was to combine in the same person the Presidency of\r\nthe German Reich. This was accomplished by merging the offices of\r\nPresident and Chancellor, by means of a decree signed by von Papen\r\n(_2003-PS_). An important consequence of this law was to give to Hitler\r\nthe supreme command of the German armed forces, always a perquisite of\r\nthe Presidency (_2050-PS_).\r\n\r\n(6) _Despite disagreements as to detail, von Papen fundamentally agreed\r\nwith basic Nazi objectives and publicly endorsed the regime for which he\r\nshared responsibility as Vice Chancellor._ Von Papen’s basic political\r\nphilosophy was not so divergent from Nazism as to preclude an easy\r\nbridging of the gap. In 1932, while still Chancellor, von Papen had been\r\nwilling to head a government in which Nazism would be strongly\r\nrepresented. By January 1933 he found it possible—as a price for his\r\nrestoration to a position of public prominence—to submerge his\r\ndifferences with Hitler and to direct his energies to the installation\r\nof a Nazi regime (see B above).\r\n\r\nIn addition to his participation as a cabinet member in the process of\r\nNazifying Germany, von Papen’s devotion to the Nazi cause was repeatedly\r\ndemonstrated throughout this period by public statements and acts both\r\nby himself and by Hitler. Thus, as noted above in connection with his\r\nrole in the elimination of the _Laender_ as a political force, von Papen\r\nwrote Hitler in April 1933, that\r\n\r\n    “You, Herr Reich Chancellor, will now, as once Bismarck, be able\r\n    to coordinate in all points the policy of the greatest of German\r\n    states with that of the Reich,”\r\n\r\nAnd Hitler on that occasion took notice of Papen’s services by declaring\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    “His collaboration in the Reich cabinet, for which he now offers\r\n    all his strength, is infinitely valuable; my relationship to him\r\n    is such a heartily friendly one, that I sincerely rejoice at the\r\n    great help I shall thus receive.” (_3357-PS_).\r\n\r\nAnd again on 2 November 1933, speaking from the same platform with\r\nHitler and Gauleiter Terboven, in the course of the campaign for\r\nReichstag election and the referendum on Germany’s withdrawal from the\r\nLeague of Nations, von Papen declared:\r\n\r\n    “Ever since Providence called upon me to become the pioneer of\r\n    national resurrection and the rebirth of our homeland, I have\r\n    tried to support with all my strength the work of the national\r\n    socialist movement and its leader; and just as I at the time of\r\n    taking over the chancellorship have advocated to pave the way to\r\n    power for the young fighting liberation movement, just as I on\r\n    January 30 was selected by a gracious fate to put the hands of\r\n    our chancellor and Fuehrer into the hand of our beloved field\r\n    marshal, so do I today again feel the obligation to say to the\r\n    German people and all those who have kept confidence in me:\r\n\r\n    “The kind Lord has blessed Germany by giving it in times of deep\r\n    distress a leader who will lead it, through all distresses and\r\n    weaknesses, through all crisis and moments of danger, with the\r\n    sure instinct of the statesman into a happy future.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Let us in this hour say to the Fuehrer of the new Germany that\r\n    we believe in him and his work.” (_3375-PS_).\r\n\r\nBy this time as noted above, the cabinet of which Papen was a member had\r\nabolished the civil liberties which were a condition to any effective\r\nprotest against Nazism, had sanctioned political murder committed in aid\r\nof Nazism’s seizure of power, had substituted itself for the Reichstag\r\nas Germany’s supreme law-making authority, had destroyed all rival\r\npolitical parties, had enacted the basic laws for abolition of the\r\npolitical influence of the _Laender_, had provided the legislative basis\r\nfor purging the civil service and judiciary of anti-Nazi elements, had\r\nembarked upon a state policy of persecution of the Jews, had legislated\r\nNazi influence into the cultural life of the German nation, and had\r\ntaken its first steps toward conferring a para-governmental status upon\r\nthe Nazi party and its principal formations.\r\n\r\nEven after von Papen’s Marburg speech of June 1934, in which he again\r\nshowed some understanding of the dangers of Nazism, he remained a pillar\r\nof Nazi policy and influence. Thus Hitler himself, in attempting to\r\njustify the Blood Purge of 30 June 1934, tacitly admitted that Papen was\r\nstill considered a loyal member of the regime:\r\n\r\n    “The allegations [of foreign newspapers] that Vice-Chancellor\r\n    von Papen, Reichsminister Seldte, or other gentlemen of the\r\n    Reich Cabinet had entertained connections with the rebels is\r\n    refuted by the fact that one of the first intentions of the\r\n    rebels was to assassinate these men.” (_Hitler Reichstag_\r\n    address, 18 July 1934, as quoted in _Das Archiv_, Vol. IV, pp.\r\n    495, 507.)\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer thus made a tacit bid for the continuing loyalty of von\r\nPapen. Von Papen’s subsequent career demonstrated that this was not a\r\nvain expectation. He left the vice-chancellorship only to assume the new\r\ntask of special emissary of the Fuehrer to Austria. But before leaving,\r\nwhile still Vice Chancellor, von Papen signed the decree combining the\r\npositions of President and Reichs Chancellor on 1 August 1934, and on 5\r\nAugust 1934 he delivered the document—the so-called Hindenburg\r\nTestament—which purported to confer the revered president’s dying\r\nblessing upon Hitler and the Nazi regime (_Notice concerning delivery of\r\nHindenburg’s testament by Vice Chancellor von Papen, Das Archiv_, Vol.\r\nV, page 648).\r\n\r\n D. _AS GERMANY’S MOST FAMOUS CATHOLIC LAYMAN AND AS NEGOTIATOR OF THE\r\nVATICAN CONCORDAT, VON PAPEN USED HIS POSITION AND PERSONAL INFLUENCE TO\r\n  PARTICIPATE IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF NAZI CONTROL OVER GERMANY AND IN\r\n                   NAZI PREPARATION FOR AGGRESSION._\r\n\r\n(1) _Immediately upon Nazi seizure of power within Germany, von Papen\r\nendeavored to weld German Catholicism into a powerful body of support\r\nfor the Nazi state._ When Naziism seized control of Germany in January\r\n1933, its relations with the church were at a low ebb. The period of the\r\nReichstag elections of July and November 1932 was marked by certain\r\nwidely circulated anti-Nazi pronouncements of the German bishops,\r\nespecially in such Catholic papers as _Germania_, _Koelnische\r\nVolkszeitung_, and the _Rhein-Mainische Volkszeitung_. These bishops\r\ndiscerned the fundamental incompatibility between the Church and the\r\nNazis’ own declarations of State policy. They accordingly publicly\r\nstigmatized the Nazi movement as anti-Christian, forbade the Catholic\r\nclergy to participate in any ceremonies (such as funerals) in which the\r\nNazi Party was officially represented, refused the sacraments to Party\r\nofficials, and in several pastorals expressly warned the faithful\r\nagainst the danger to German Catholicism created by the Party\r\n(_3389-PS_).\r\n\r\nImmediately upon seizure of power, the main concern of the new regime\r\nwas to liquidate political opposition. Achievement of this objective was\r\npredicated upon the strategy of “divide and rule”. A first step in this\r\nstrategy was to convince conservatives that the efforts of the\r\ngovernment were being directed primarily against the Communists and\r\nother forces of the extreme Left, and that their own interests would\r\nremain safe in Nazi hands as long as they would consent to refrain from\r\npolitical activity. The result was a brief but active period of\r\nrapprochement between Church and Party. Von Papen was a leader in this\r\nstrategy. The minutes of the Reich cabinet meeting of 15 March 1933\r\ncontain the following notation in connection with discussions on the\r\nEnabling Act:\r\n\r\n    “The Vice Chancellor and Reich Commissar for the State of\r\n    Prussia said it is of decisive importance to integrate into the\r\n    new State the masses standing behind the Parties. He said that\r\n    the question of coordination of political Catholicism into the\r\n    new State is of special importance.” (_2962-PS_)\r\n\r\nEight days later, speaking at the second meeting of the Reichstag of\r\n1933, on 23 March 1933, Hitler asked for adoption of the Enabling Act.\r\nIn this speech he declared:\r\n\r\n    “While the government is determined to carry through the\r\n    political and moral purging of our public life, it is creating\r\n    and insuring prerequisites for a truly religious life. The\r\n    government sees in both Christian confessions the factors most\r\n    important for the maintenance of our Folkdom. It will respect\r\n    agreements concluded between them and the states. However, it\r\n    expects that its work will meet with a similar appreciation. The\r\n    government will treat all other denominations with equal\r\n    objective justice. However, it can never condone that belonging\r\n    to a certain denomination or to a certain race might be regarded\r\n    as license to commit or tolerate crimes. The Government will\r\n    devote its care to the sincere living together of Church and\r\n    State.” (_3387-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of this assurance was action by the conference of\r\nGerman bishops, meeting in Fulda on 28 March 1933. This conference\r\nlifted restrictions imposed on members of the church adhering to the\r\nNazi movement. In a cautious statement which placed full faith and\r\ncredit in the Papen-inspired Hitler assurances, the bishops declared:\r\n\r\n    “The high shepherds of the dioceses of Germany in their dutiful\r\n    anxiety to keep the Catholic faith pure and protect the\r\n    untouchable aims and rights of the Catholic Church have adopted,\r\n    for profound reasons, during the last years, an oppositional\r\n    attitude toward the National Socialist movement, through\r\n    prohibitions and warnings, which was to be in effect as long and\r\n    as far as those reasons remained valid.\r\n\r\n    “It must now be recognized that there are official and solemn\r\n    declarations issued by the highest representative of the Reich\r\n    Government—who at the same time is the authoritarian leader of\r\n    that movement—which acknowledge the inviolability of the\r\n    teachings of Catholic faith and the unchangeable tasks and\r\n    rights of the church, and which expressly assure the full value\r\n    of the legal pacts concluded between the various German States\r\n    and the Church.\r\n\r\n    “Without lifting the condemnation of certain religious and\r\n    ethical errors implied in our previous measures, the Episcopate\r\n    now believes it can entertain the confidence that those\r\n    prescribed general prohibitions and warnings may not be regarded\r\n    as necessary any more.” (_3389-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis action opened the door for mass Party adherence by practicing\r\nCatholics. All those German Catholics who were inclined to adopt Nazi\r\npolitical views and had hesitated only because of the anti-Nazi attitude\r\nof the hierarchy hastened now to join the victorious party of the\r\n“National Revolution”. This tendency was marked by a tremendous and\r\nsudden burst of activity by the so-called “bridge-builders,” who rushed\r\nto close the gap between the Church and the Nazi State. Von Papen, who\r\nonly a short time before had been willing to use armed force to suppress\r\nthe Nazis, was foremost among these “bridge-builders”, who not only\r\nclaimed an ideological affinity between the Nazi system and the alleged\r\nanti-liberal character of Catholic politics, but affirmatively\r\napologized for excesses of the State which even then had begun to shock\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nExisting agencies were used for this purpose. Thus, the Union of\r\nCatholic Germans (_Arbeitsgemeinschaft Katholischer Deutscher_), of\r\nwhich von Papen was president, insisted in its program that the church,\r\nlike the Nazi movement itself, was guided by the leadership principle\r\n(Cuno Horkenbach, _Das Deutsche Reich von 1918 bis Heute_ (The German\r\nReich from 1918 Until Today) (Berlin 1935), pp. 436, 504). The same\r\norganization, in the course of the election campaign which preceded\r\nadoption of the Enabling Act, had bitterly criticized the Catholic\r\npolitical opposition to Marxism and urged that Catholics “by all means\r\nvote unanimously the National Socialist ticket”, because “We Catholics\r\ndo not wish to be denied to march in the lead in this election campaign”\r\n(Election Appeal, _Voelkischer Beobachter_, 23 February 1933, p. 2).\r\nLater, on the eve of the Nazis’ first anti-Jewish boycott, this same\r\norganization played its part in the extensive campaign replying to\r\nforeign newspaper reports concerning atrocities committed against German\r\nJews. On 1 April 1933 it published through the Prussian News Service, an\r\n“Appeal to all Christians”, viewing “with great indignation” this\r\n“irresponsible campaign against Germany” which “continues in spite of\r\nofficial German declarations and corrections”. This “Appeal”\r\ncharacterized the foreign reports as “intentional lies and\r\nfalsifications” and “a reckless, crafty campaign of destruction\r\nconducted by the Jewish world alliance and moneyed powers against the\r\nright of self-determination of all peoples and against the entire\r\nChristian civilization”. It called upon “the Christians of all\r\ncountries, irrespective of denominations, to form a world-wide front of\r\ndefense against that Jewish conspiracy disturbing the true peace”\r\n(“_Appeal to All Christians_”, _Voelkischer Beobachter_ (People’s\r\nObserver), 30 March 1933, p. 2).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the force of these activities, this Nazification by\r\nexisting agencies was not deemed adequate to the task of organizing\r\nCatholic lay support. The result was the creation, in early April 1933,\r\nunder the sponsorship of von Papen, of a new “Bund” of Catholic Germans\r\ncalled “Cross and Eagle” (“_Kreuz und Adler_”) which made it its task\r\n“to contribute enthusiastic devotion to the upbuilding of the future\r\nReich” (Gerd Ruehle, _Das Dritte Reich_ (The Third Reich), p. 250).\r\n\r\nThis whole program of rapprochement between Church and Party manifests\r\nthe Papen “touch”—the same quality of handiwork which had manifested\r\nitself in Hitler’s accession to power and which later was to reappear in\r\nAustria: First, gentle hints by Papen as to strategy, followed within\r\neight days by reassurances in Hitler’s Reichstag speech. Next, again\r\nfollowing merely by days, the formal lifting of the restrictions on Nazi\r\nmembership by the leaders of the Church of which von Papen was the most\r\nfamous lay member. Finally, again within a few days, the open campaign\r\nby which Papen-sponsored organizations endeavoured to align Church and\r\nParty. The close timing of these events was not a coincidence.\r\n\r\n(2) _Having achieved initial successes in consolidating Catholic support\r\nwithin Germany, von Papen undertook international consolidation of\r\nNazi-Church relationships by negotiation of a Concordat with the\r\nVatican._ The program of rapprochement and the public declarations\r\nbridging the gap between the Church and the Nazi movement were merely\r\nadvertising media by which Nazi-minded Catholics were herded into the\r\nmovement, and slogans by which the conspirators might placate the\r\nCatholic hierarchy. Throughout this period there continued an\r\nundercurrent of anti-Catholic activity. A thorough job was done in\r\npurging Reich, state, and municipal administrations of officials\r\nappointed for their adherence to the Centre or Bavarian People’s\r\nparties. Former leaders of those parties, including priests, joined\r\nCommunists and Social Democrats in the concentration camps, and the\r\ncampaign of hatred against the “black” was resumed. By April 1933 the\r\nbishops were making appeals for clemency toward former civil servants,\r\nwho, they pointed out, were not able to join the celebration of national\r\nawakening because they had been dismissed from positions in which they\r\nhad given their best to the community of the German people. And on 31\r\nMay 1933, a meeting of the Bavarian bishops adopted a solemn statement\r\ndirected against the tendency of attributing to the State alone the\r\nright of educating, organizing, and leading ideologically the German\r\nyouth (_Dismissal of Catholics_, Excerpts from _Voelkischer Beobachter_,\r\nFebruary-March 1933; _Excerpt, Voelkischer Beobachter_, 19 April 1933\r\n(Munich ed.), p. 2).\r\n\r\nBy this maintenance of a certain amount of pressure against Catholic\r\ninterests, the hierarchy was reminded of the dangers of not coming to a\r\ndefinite agreement with the Nazi State. The stage was thus set for von\r\nPapen’s negotiation of a Concordat with the Vatican.\r\n\r\nAt the time of these activities, the government of which von Papen was\r\nVice Chancellor had already launched its program to mold the state\r\nmachinery into the Nazi image. The Enabling Act had become law, and the\r\ngeneral outlines of the Nazi State were already manifest.\r\nNotwithstanding the doubts created in his mind by Hitler’s insistence\r\nupon the Enabling Act, von Papen undertook negotiations with the\r\nVatican. In fact, he since has claimed that these fears gave rise to the\r\nnegotiation of the Concordat (Interrogation at Nurnberg, 3 Sept. 1945):\r\n\r\n    “I became alarmed, you remember, somewhere in June when I went\r\n    to Rome to negotiate a concordat because I certainly feared that\r\n    the particular powers of the Hitler Party would create\r\n    difficulties on the religious side. So that with the consent of\r\n    Hitler I went to Rome to make that concordat.”\r\n\r\nIt is clear, however, that these alleged fears of the Enabling Act were\r\nnot fears at all. They were merely an understanding of the threat they\r\ncarried to all persons and instrumentalities antagonistic to the Nazi\r\nsystem. Von Papen understood the significance of these developments.\r\nWhat he actually feared was that the rest of the world would also\r\nunderstand Nazi methods and would erect barriers to the consummation of\r\nthe plans of the conspirators. The situation plainly called for a\r\nneutralizing of these potential barriers to Nazi plans. One method of\r\nachieving this result at that time was the negotiation of solemn\r\nagreements whereby other powers would commit themselves to a policy of\r\nnon-intervention by either armed or moral force.\r\n\r\nWhen von Papen concluded the Concordat with the Vatican, the political\r\nobjectives of furthering the purposes of the Nazi conspiracy were thus\r\nforemost in his mind. Even at that time, in the first half of 1933, von\r\nPapen had in mind, in concluding this Concordat, not only the\r\nconsolidation of Catholicism behind the Nazi regime within Germany, but\r\nalso the psychological build-up of the Austrians in preparation for\r\nAnschluss. Von Papen’s own words eloquently characterize these\r\nmanoeuvres (monograph entitled “Austria” written at Nurnberg, 1945):\r\n\r\n    “Although the ‘_Heimwehr_’ movement [in Austria] had brought\r\n    these patriotic elements together before this, and had fought\r\n    with them to free the country from strong Socialistic pressure,\r\n    yet they were armed only from the standpoint of domestic\r\n    politics and remained aloof from all ambitions for a greater\r\n    Germany. The cause lay mostly in the Catholic nature of the\r\n    country, and in the strong influence of the clergy in political\r\n    leadership. The Reich was considered a bulwark of Protestantism,\r\n    despite its twenty million Catholics. The anti-clerical wave,\r\n    which was dominant in the Reich under the leadership of Prussia,\r\n    itself led by Socialists, appeared to have verified the fears of\r\n    the Austrian clergy. For in spite of Catholics at the head of\r\n    the Reich—Wirth, Marx, Bruening—the Centre Party had always\r\n    put through its cultural demands by logrolling with the\r\n    Socialists. There were at least two Socialist officials,\r\n    university professors or teachers for every Catholic appointee.\r\n    In contrast to the obviously badly functioning Weimar\r\n    Constitution, there was an effort in Austria, under clerical\r\n    leadership and with the strong support of the Vatican, to\r\n    develop into a corporate state.\r\n\r\n    “Those were serious obstacles on both sides. When, after the\r\n    seizure of power of the NSDAP in 1933, as the first remedy\r\n    against a new ‘_Kulturkampf_’, I safely concluded the Concordat\r\n    of the New Reich with the Holy See, my thoughts at the time were\r\n    not focused only on the Reich. For a peaceful evolution of the\r\n    German-Austrian question it was of the greatest importance that\r\n    the doubts of the clergy on the Austrian side be completely\r\n    eliminated.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It was my first purpose in the diplomatic field to deprive the\r\n    Austrian problem of its European character, and to develop it\r\n    gradually into an exclusively internal problem between the Reich\r\n    and Austria.\r\n\r\n    “It therefore had to be my primary aim to convince the Vatican\r\n    that a union could not endanger the Vatican’s interests. A\r\n    Concordat of the Reich with the Vatican had been my first\r\n    attempt to prevent religious difficulties arising from Nazism’s\r\n    revolutionary doctrine; the attempt had obviously failed. Under\r\n    the growing influence of his Party, Hitler sabotaged the\r\n    Concordat. Rome was deeply disappointed and in the greatest\r\n    excitement.”\r\n\r\nOn 20 July 1933 the Reich Concordat with the Vatican was signed by von\r\nPapen as representative of the Nazi Government of Germany. This\r\ninstrument was an international treaty which purported to give the\r\nchurch an official guarantee of all the church rights it had sought. In\r\naddition it purported to confer freedom for Catholic organizations,\r\nmaintenance of parochial schools, and preservation of the general\r\ninfluence of the church on the education of the German Catholic youth.\r\nAmong the 33 articles of the Concordat, 21 treated exclusively the\r\nrights and prerogatives accorded to the church. Reciprocation consisted\r\nonly in a pledge of loyalty by the clergy to the Reich Government and a\r\npromise that Catholic religious instruction would emphasize the\r\npatriotic duties of the Christian citizen and insist on a loyal attitude\r\ntoward the Fatherland. Since it had always been the practice of the\r\nCatholic church to abide by established governments and to promote\r\npatriotic convictions among the faithful, these stipulations of the\r\nConcordat were no more than legalizations of an existing custom. They\r\nwere no more than a guarantee of goodwill betokening harmonious\r\nChurch-State relations (_2655-PS_).\r\n\r\n(3) _The signing of the Concordat was only an interlude in the church\r\npolicy of the Nazi Conspirators, which was a policy of reassurances and\r\nrepression._ The signing of the Concordat merely marked the beginning of\r\nevasions and violations of both its spirit and letter. The ink was\r\nhardly dry before it became necessary for the Vatican to complain about\r\na false interpretation of the text, made by the Nazi government in its\r\nown favour. (See Section 6 of Chapter VII on Suppression of the\r\nChristian Churches.)\r\n\r\nBy action taken only ten days after the signing of the Concordat, and\r\ndespite its provision for the continuance of the Catholic Youth\r\nAssociation, simultaneous membership in the Hitler Jugend and the\r\nCatholic Youth Association was forbidden, and the campaign to smash the\r\nlatter organization thereby commenced (_2456-PS_).\r\n\r\nThese first steps were merely a foretaste of a long series of violations\r\nwhich were to commence almost immediately and eventually to result in\r\npapal denunciation and serious excesses committed against the clergy\r\n(_3280-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe continuing character of the conspirators’ church policy—and of von\r\nPapen’s participation in it—is further revealed by von Papen’s action\r\nof 19 September 1934, when, as president of the Union of Catholic\r\nGermans (_Arbeitsgemeinschaft Katholischer Deutscher_), he ordered\r\ndissolution of this organization. By this time the Nazis were dropping\r\nall pretext that rival organizations might be permitted to exist, and\r\nwere well along in their plans for the integration of all German\r\ninstitutions into the Nazi system. The official published announcement\r\nof dissolution is a revealing document:\r\n\r\n    “Since the Reich Party Leadership through its department for\r\n    spiritual peace increasingly and immediately administers all\r\n    cultural problems and those concerning the relationship of State\r\n    and Churches, the tasks at first delegated to the Union of\r\n    Catholic Germans are now included in those of the Reich Party\r\n    Leadership in the interest of a stronger coordination.\r\n\r\n    “Vice-Chancellor von Papen, up to now the Leader of the Union of\r\n    Catholic Germans, declared about the Dissolution of this\r\n    organization that it was done upon his suggestion, since the\r\n    attitude of the national socialist State toward the Christian\r\n    and Catholic Church had been explained often and inequivocally\r\n    through the leader and chancellor himself.” (_3376-PS_).\r\n\r\n   E. _AS ENVOY AT VIENNA, VON PAPEN USED HIS POSITION AND INFLUENCE\r\nDELIBERATELY TO WEAKEN THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT, AND PARTICIPATED IN THE\r\n   POLITICAL PLANNING AND PREPARATION FOR MILITARY AGGRESSION AGAINST\r\n                               AUSTRIA._\r\n\r\n(1) _Von Papen accepted appointment as envoy at Vienna knowing he would\r\n“front” for a Nazi fifth column in Austria._ In July 1934, the Austrian\r\npolicy of the Nazi government of Germany was in bad odor throughout the\r\ncivilized world. The historical record of this period was written in the\r\nnewspaper headlines of the day. A period of Nazi pressure and terror\r\nculminated on 25 July 1934 in an attempted revolutionary putsch, the\r\nmurder of the Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, in which the German\r\nMinister, Reith, was implicated. (See Section 3 of Chapter IX on\r\nAggression Against Austria.) The situation was such as to call for\r\nremoval of the German Minister, Reith, and for the prompt substitution\r\nof a man who was an enthusiast for Anschluss with Germany, who could be\r\ntolerant of Nazi objectives and methods, but who could lend an aura of\r\nrespectability to official German representation in Vienna. Hitler’s\r\nreaction was immediate. He chose von Papen as quickly as he heard the\r\nnews of the Dollfuss murder. Writing of this event in 1945 after his\r\narrest by Allied authorities, von Papen dramatically describes the\r\nFuehrer’s response to the situation (monograph on “Austria” referred to\r\nabove):\r\n\r\n    “Suddenly, at three o’clock in the morning, there was a loud\r\n    ringing of my doorbell. SS men demanded admission. My son and I\r\n    were of the opinion that I was going to be imprisoned. We went\r\n    to the front door armed with pistols. Our suspicions were\r\n    unfounded. The SS men declared that they had come from the\r\n    Chancellery with the order to put through a telephone connection\r\n    between Hitler and myself.\r\n\r\n    “Hitler was in Bayreuth and had been trying for hours without\r\n    success to get in touch with me. The connection was made.\r\n\r\n    “Hitler started, ‘You know of course what has happened in\r\n    Vienna. You must go there immediately and try to set things in\r\n    order.’\r\n\r\n    “I replied, ‘I have no idea what has happened in Vienna. I have\r\n    just returned from the country and I don’t understand what you\r\n    want with me in Vienna. I am in the act of packing my trunk to\r\n    leave Berlin once and for all.’\r\n\r\n    “Hitler, highly excited, gave thereupon a short description of\r\n    the dramatic events in Vienna which led to the murder of\r\n    Dollfuss, and continued, ‘You are the only person who can save\r\n    the situation. I implore you to carry out my request.’”\r\n\r\nAs a result of this telephone call, von Papen flew immediately to join\r\nHitler at Bayreuth. There it was clear that the Nazi leadership feared\r\ninternational repercussions from their Austrian policy and felt\r\nthemselves in dire need of a respectable “front” man. Von Papen has\r\ndescribed this meeting:\r\n\r\n    “There I found Hitler and his entire entourage, excited as an\r\n    ant-hill. It was difficult to get anything approaching an exact\r\n    picture of the Vienna ‘_Putsch_’ and the role of Hitler’s\r\n    promoters. Even if one had come into this gathering in complete\r\n    ignorance of the different circumstances involved, one could\r\n    have gathered with one look that they had a very bad conscience\r\n    and now were fearing the consequences. From the very first\r\n    moment I was certain that the immoderate policy of the Austrian\r\n    NSDAP under the leadership of Hitler’s condottiere, Habig, had\r\n    led to this coup d’etat.\r\n\r\n    “This was, then, a few days after the 30 June, the second bloody\r\n    excess of the Party which had promised to bring Germany by\r\n    peaceful means to social tranquility, welfare, and respect. It\r\n    was obvious that both events had made a deep impression on the\r\n    entire world, and that the governmental methods of the Party\r\n    must damage most seriously the political credit of the Reich”.\r\n\r\nAt this meeting it was Papen himself who drafted the letter of\r\nappointment. This letter was a masterpiece of deceit, calculated to\r\nconceal completely Hitler and Papen’s goal of annexation. It stated:\r\n\r\n    “As a result of the events in Vienna I am compelled to suggest\r\n    to the Reichs-President the removal of the German Minister to\r\n    Vienna, Dr. Reith, from his post, because he, at the suggestion\r\n    of Austrian Federal Ministers and the Austrian rebels\r\n    respectively consented to an agreement made by both these\r\n    parties concerning the safe conduct and retreat of the rebels to\r\n    Germany without making inquiry of the German Reich Government.\r\n    Thus the Minister has dragged the German Reich into an internal\r\n    Austrian affair without any reason.\r\n\r\n    “The assassination of the Austrian Federal Chancellor which was\r\n    strictly condemned and regretted by the German Government has\r\n    made the situation in Europe, already fluid, more acute, without\r\n    any fault of ours. Therefore, it is my desire to bring about if\r\n    possible an easing of the general situation, and especially to\r\n    direct the relations with the German Austrian State, which have\r\n    been so strained for a long time, again into normal and friendly\r\n    channels.\r\n\r\n    “For this reason, I request you, dear Mr. von Papen, to take\r\n    over this important task, just because you have possessed and\r\n    continue to possess my most complete and unlimited confidence\r\n    ever since we have worked together in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, I have suggested to the Reichs-President that you,\r\n    upon leaving the Reich-Cabinet and upon release from the office\r\n    of Commissioner for the Saar, be called on special mission to\r\n    the post of the German Minister in Vienna for a limited period\r\n    of time. In this position you will be directly subordinated to\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n    “Thanking once more for all that you have at a time done for the\r\n    coordination of the Government of the National Revolution and\r\n    since then together with us for Germany, I remain.” (_2799-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe actual mission of von Papen was stated more frankly, shortly after\r\nhis arrival in Vienna, in the course of a private conversation with the\r\nAmerican Minister, George S. Messersmith. Mr. Messersmith has described\r\nthis meeting:\r\n\r\n    “When I did call on von Papen in the German Legation, he greeted\r\n    me with ‘Now you are in my Legation and I can control the\r\n    conversation’. In the baldest and most cynical manner he then\r\n    proceeded to tell me that all of Southeastern Europe, to the\r\n    borders of Turkey, was Germany’s natural hinterland, and that he\r\n    had been charged with the mission of facilitating German\r\n    economic and political control over all this region for Germany.\r\n    He blandly and directly said that getting control of Austria was\r\n    to be the first step. He definitely stated that he was in\r\n    Austria to undermine and weaken the Austrian Government and from\r\n    Vienna to work towards the weakening of the Governments in the\r\n    other states to the South and South East. He said that he\r\n    intended to use his reputation as a good Catholic to gain\r\n    influence with certain Austrians, such as Cardinal Innitzer,\r\n    towards that end. He said that he was telling me this because\r\n    the German Government was bound on this objective of getting\r\n    this control of Southeastern Europe and there was nothing which\r\n    could stop it and that our own policy and that of France and\r\n    England was not realistic.\r\n\r\n    “The circumstances were such, as I was calling on him in the\r\n    German Legation, that I had to listen to what he had to say and\r\n    of course I was prepared to hear what he had to say although I\r\n    already knew what his instructions were. I was nevertheless\r\n    shocked to have him speak so baldly to me and when he finished I\r\n    got up and told him how shocked I was to hear the accredited\r\n    representative of a supposedly friendly state to Austria admit\r\n    that he was proposing to engage in activities to undermine and\r\n    destroy that Government to which he was accredited. He merely\r\n    smiled and said, of course this conversation was between us and\r\n    that he would, of course, not be talking to others so clearly\r\n    about his objectives. I have gone into this detail with regard\r\n    to this conversation as it is characteristic of the absolute\r\n    frankness and directness with which high Nazi officials spoke of\r\n    their objectives.” (_1760-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Von Papen proceeded forthwith to accomplish his mission—the\r\nmaintenance of an outward appearance of non-intervention while keeping\r\nappropriate contacts useful in the eventual overthrow of the Austrian\r\ngovernment._ Throughout the earlier period of his mission to Austria,\r\nvon Papen’s activity was characterized by the assiduous avoidance of any\r\nappearance of intervention. His true mission was reaffirmed with\r\nclarity, several months after its commencement, when he was instructed\r\nby Berlin that “during the next two years nothing can be undertaken\r\nwhich will give Germany external political difficulties”. Every\r\n“appearance” of German interference in Austrian affairs “must be\r\navoided” (_1760-PS_). As von Papen himself stated to Berger-Waldenegg,\r\nthe Austrian Foreign Minister:\r\n\r\n    “Yes, you have your French and English friends now and you can\r\n    have your independence a little longer.” (_1760-PS_).\r\n\r\nThroughout this period, the Nazi movement was gaining strength in\r\nAustria without openly-admitted German intervention, and Germany needed\r\nmore time to consolidate its diplomatic position. These reasons for\r\nGerman policy were frankly expressed by the German Foreign Minister von\r\nNeurath in conversation with the American Ambassador to France\r\n(_L-150_).\r\n\r\nVon Papen accordingly restricted his public activity to the normal\r\nambassadorial function of cultivating all respectable elements in\r\nAustria and ingratiating himself in these circles—particularly if they\r\nwere well-disposed (but not too obviously) to notions of Pan-Germanism.\r\nIn these efforts he was particularly careful to exploit his background\r\nas a former professional officer and a Catholic (_1760-PS_).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, the Austrian Nazis continued illegal organization in\r\nanticipation of the possibility of securing their objectives by force if\r\nnecessary. In these efforts they were aided by Germany, which permitted\r\nthe outlawed Austrian Nazis to meet and perfect their plots within\r\nGermany and with German Nazi assistance; which harbored the Austrian\r\nLegion; which made funds available to National Socialists in Austria;\r\nand which established appropriate contact with them through the Reich\r\nPropaganda Ministry and through “respectable” Austrian “front”\r\npersonalities (_1760-PS_; _812-PS_). (See also Section 3 of Chapter IX\r\non Aggression Against Austria.)\r\n\r\nVon Papen was fully aware of the existence and activities of these\r\ngroups, and of their potentialities in effecting an Anschluss. Thus, in\r\na report to Hitler dated 27 July 1935, entitled “Reflections on the\r\nAnniversary of Dollfuss’ Death”, he reviewed the activities of these\r\nillegal groups and concluded that National Socialism could “certainly\r\nbecome the rallying point of all racially German units beyond the\r\nborders”. In this report he declared:\r\n\r\n    “The Third Reich will be with Austria, or it will not be at all.\r\n    National Socialism must win it or it will perish, if it is\r\n    unable to solve this task.” (_2248-PS_).\r\n\r\nThese sentiments concerning the role of National Socialism were\r\nsomething more than idle speculation. Von Papen knew that the presence\r\nof the Austrian Legion in Germany in itself produced incidents, and that\r\nthe Austrian Nazi movement was dependent on German support. He has so\r\ntestified (at an interrogation in Nurnberg, 13 October 1945). In fact,\r\ndespite his facade of strict non-intervention, he remained in contact\r\nwith subversive and potentially subversive elements within Austria.\r\nThus, in a report to Hitler dated 17 May 1935 he advised concerning the\r\nAustrian Nazi strategy as proposed by Captain Leopold, leader of the\r\nillegal Austrian Nazis (_2247-PS_). In subsequent statements he has\r\nrevealed his _modus operandi_ in the use of his embassy staff. This\r\nmethod provided him with an opportunity to disclaim responsibility if\r\nthese activities should be questioned. Thus, his military attache, Mutz,\r\n“maintained good relations with the Army circles which were inclined\r\ntowards National Socialism”. Von Papen’s all-around contact man with the\r\nAustrian Nazis was a member of his staff, Baron von Kettler, who “had\r\nalways maintained intimate contact with a group of young Austrian\r\nNational Socialists who, as we both agreed, had a conservative coating\r\nand fought for a healthy development within the Party”. The practical\r\neffect of these contacts has been clarified in questioning of von Papen\r\n(at Nurnberg, 8 October 1945):\r\n\r\n    “* * * A. As I told you, I charged one of my younger people of\r\n    the Embassy, von Kettler—he was made the go-between with these\r\n    Nazi people, to smooth them down and talk with them. Personally\r\n    I had not very much to do with them.\r\n\r\n    “Q. Well, I know that. That is what you always said. But the\r\n    result of your time in Austria was that their interests were\r\n    furthered through your office. Whether you did it personally or\r\n    somebody working for you did it, I don’t think it is too\r\n    important for what we have in mind here tonight; do you?\r\n\r\n    “A. No.\r\n\r\n    “Q. Now, isn’t it a fact that their interests were furthered\r\n    through your office, if not through you as an individual during\r\n    those years that you were there?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes, I wanted to know about their doings, you see. I must\r\n    have been informed what was going on.”\r\n\r\n(3) _Conclusion of the Agreement of 11 July 1936 merely constituted\r\nanother step towards Anschluss._ Prior to 1936, sponsorship of political\r\nsubversion was not the only pressure applied by Germany in its efforts\r\nto gain control of Austria. The German Government in addition had placed\r\ncertain economic barriers against trade between German and Austrian\r\nsubjects, the most serious of which was the 1000 mark law, which\r\ncrippled the Austrian tourist traffic by levying a 1000 RM tax on any\r\nGerman citizen crossing the border into Austria. The effect of these\r\npressures was to induce the Austrian Chancellor, Kurt von Schuschnigg,\r\nto seek from Hitler an agreement to “lift the 1000 Mark barrier he had\r\nlevied against Austria and reassure Austria that he had no political\r\ndesigns concerning our state, Austria” (_2994-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe result was the agreement of 11 July 1936 between Germany and\r\nAustria, which was negotiated by von Papen as Hitler’s representative.\r\nThe published form of this agreement provided:\r\n\r\n    “Being convinced that they are making a valuable contribution\r\n    towards the whole European development in the direction of\r\n    maintaining peace, and in the belief that they are thereby best\r\n    serving the manifold mutual interests of both German States, the\r\n    Governments of the Federal State of Austria and of Germany have\r\n    resolved to return to relations of a normal and friendly\r\n    character. In this connection it is declared—\r\n\r\n    “(1) The German Government recognizes the full sovereignty of\r\n    the Federal State of Austria in the spirit of the pronouncements\r\n    of the German Fuehrer and Chancellor of May 21, 1935.\r\n\r\n    “(2) Each of the two Governments regards the inner political\r\n    order (including the question of Austrian National-Socialism)\r\n    obtaining in the other country as an internal concern of that\r\n    country, upon which it will exercise neither direct nor indirect\r\n    influence.\r\n\r\n    “(3) The Austrian Federal Government will constantly follow in\r\n    its policy in general, and in particular towards Germany, a line\r\n    in conformity with leading principles corresponding to the fact\r\n    that Austria regards herself as a German State.\r\n\r\n    “By such a decision neither the Rome Protocols of 1934 and their\r\n    additions of 1936, nor the relationships of Austria to Italy and\r\n    Hungary as partners in these protocols, are affected.\r\n    Considering that the detente desired by both sides cannot become\r\n    a reality unless certain preliminary conditions are fulfilled by\r\n    the Governments of both countries, the Austrian Federal\r\n    Government and the German Government will pass a number of\r\n    special measures to bring about the requisite preliminary state\r\n    of affairs.” (_TC-22_).\r\n\r\nMore interesting was the secret part of this agreement, the most\r\nimportant provisions of which have been summarized by Mr. Messersmith:\r\n\r\n    “Austria would (1) appoint a number of individuals enjoying the\r\n    Chancellor’s confidence but friendly to Germany to positions in\r\n    the Cabinet; (2) would devise means to give the ‘National\r\n    opposition’ a role in the political life of Austria and within\r\n    the framework of the Patriotic Front, and (3) would amnesty all\r\n    Nazis save those convicted of the most serious offenses.”\r\n    (_1760-PS_)\r\n\r\nEspecially interesting was the manner in which this agreement contained\r\nGerman economic concessions and further solemn assurances regarding\r\nAustrian independence and integrity, on the one hand, alongside\r\nfar-reaching political concessions to the Nazi movement (_2994-PS_). The\r\neffect was to place Austria completely at the mercy of German good\r\nfaith. Von Papen has correctly described it (in an interrogation at\r\nNurnberg, 8 October 1945) as “the first step” toward preparation for\r\nAnschluss, notwithstanding his clear understanding at the time that the\r\nAustrian government desired and intended to retain its independence.\r\n\r\nThe Germans lost no time in making the most of their new opportunities,\r\nsolemn assurances notwithstanding. The agreement merely heralded a new\r\nera in “legitimizing” the German fifth column in Austria. Thus, the\r\nimmediate amnesty to political prisoners in itself presented serious\r\npolice problems. The freedom granted to political demonstrations and\r\norganization by German Nazis made it difficult to police the\r\npropagandizing of Austrians. And the agreement specifically gave the\r\nGerman Nazis an opening wedge to representation in the Austrian\r\ngovernment. The terroristic activities and pressure of the illegal Nazis\r\ncontinued without interruption under German sponsorship, until their\r\nhand was strengthened to the point of openly asking for official\r\nrecognition (_812-PS_; _1760-PS_; _2994-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe importance of this agreement to the Germans was underscored by the\r\npromotion of its negotiator from _Gesandter_ to _Botschafter_, at the\r\ntime of its signing (Announcement, _Das Archiv_, XXVIII, p. 571).\r\n\r\nVon Papen himself participated in this pressure game by maintaining\r\ncontact with the illegal Nazis, by trying to influence appointments to\r\nstrategic cabinet positions, and by attempting to secure official\r\nrecognition of Nazi “front” organizations. Reporting to Hitler shortly\r\nafter conclusion of the 11 July 1936 agreement, he succinctly summarized\r\nhis program for “normalizing” Austro-German relations under the regime\r\nof the new agreement:\r\n\r\n    “The progress of normalizing relations with Germany at the\r\n    present time is obstructed by the continued persistence of the\r\n    Ministry of Security, occupied by the old anti-National\r\n    Socialistic officials. Changes in personnel are therefore of\r\n    utmost importance. But they are definitely not to be expected\r\n    prior to the conference on the abolishing of the Control of\r\n    Finances [_Finanzkontrolle_] at Geneva. The Chancellor of the\r\n    League has informed Minister de Glaise-Horstenau, of his\r\n    intention, to offer him the portfolio of the Ministry of the\r\n    Interior. As a guiding principle [_Marschroute_] I recommend on\r\n    the tactical side, continued, patient psychological\r\n    manipulations, with slowly intensified pressure directed at\r\n    changing the regime. The proposed conference on economic\r\n    relations, taking place at the end of October will be a very\r\n    useful tool for the realization of some of our projects. In\r\n    discussion with government officials as well as with leaders of\r\n    the illegal party (Leopold and Schattenfreh) who conform\r\n    completely with the concordat of July 11, I am trying to direct\r\n    the next developments in such a manner to aim at corporative\r\n    representation of the movement in the fatherland front\r\n    [_Vaterlaendischen Front_] but nevertheless refraining from\r\n    putting National-Socialists in important positions for the time\r\n    being. However such positions are to be occupied only by\r\n    personalities, having the support and the confidence of the\r\n    movement. I have a willing collaborator in this respect in\r\n    Minister Glaise-Horstenau.” (_2246-PS_).\r\n\r\nThis activity continued through 1937. In fact, by 14 January 1937 the\r\nnegotiations with the Austrian Minister of Security and the development\r\nof “front” organizations had proceeded so far that “a very intensive\r\ncrisis has arisen for the illegal party” with respect to its future\r\nprogram. In urging a patient attitude toward these problems, von Papen\r\nappeared less concerned with the legitimacy of their position under the\r\n11 July 1936 agreement than with his fear that\r\n\r\n    “a too strong and far-reaching connection (with a proposed\r\n    conservative ‘German Action’ front organization) would be\r\n    understood neither in our own ranks nor could it be of use to\r\n    the action itself.” (_2831-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand when an Austrian cabinet minister failed to show\r\nsufficient energy to suit von Papen’s purpose, he showed no hesitancy,\r\nunder the terms of his 11 July 1936 agreement, to urge replacement by a\r\nmore cooperative individual. Thus, von Papen has summarized his efforts\r\nto remove the Austrian Minister of the Interior (monograph “Austria”):\r\n\r\n    “I had tried to persuade Schuschnigg to appoint another minister\r\n    to his cabinet beside Herr von Glaise, who was not very active.\r\n    The new minister was to act as trusted liaison man between the\r\n    two governments, able to work on innumerable problems directly\r\n    without diplomatic intervention. This simplification would also\r\n    bring the men on both sides of the fence closer together.”\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1938, the Nazi hand had been so strengthened in\r\nAustria, and the differences and misunderstandings regarding the\r\nagreement of 11 July had become so serious and frequent, that Chancellor\r\nSchuschnigg found it expedient to accept von Papen’s invitation to meet\r\nHitler at Berchtesgaden, notwithstanding serious misgivings on the part\r\nof Schuschnigg (_2995-PS_). Von Papen showed no hesitancy in extending\r\nthis invitation despite the fact that he knew Hitler’s “idea to swallow\r\nAustria”, despite his knowledge of Schuschnigg’s distrust of Hitler, and\r\ndespite his own doubts concerning the value of Hitler’s word.\r\nNotwithstanding the situation, he found it possible even to urge\r\nSchuschnigg that Hitler was a man upon whom Schuschnigg could rely. And\r\nin making these representations, he was fully aware of the extent of\r\nGerman rearmament and of its possible use as a diplomatic pressure\r\ndevice (according to interrogations, Nurnberg, 19 September and 8\r\nOctober 1945).\r\n\r\nOn 11 February 1938, Schuschnigg left for Berchtesgaden to meet Hitler.\r\nAt this meeting the severest pressure was exerted to extort far-reaching\r\nconcessions from Austria, including reorganization of the cabinet,\r\nappointment of Seyss-Inquart as Minister of Security and the Interior,\r\nand a general amnesty to Nazis convicted of crimes (_2995-PS_;\r\n_2461-PS_; _1544-PS_; _1780-PS_).\r\n\r\nIt was at this meeting that Papen urged upon Hitler the appointment of\r\nSeyss-Inquart as Minister of Security and the Interior (according to\r\nmonograph “Austria”).\r\n\r\nThoroughly entrenched in the government, the Nazis were now able to\r\nseize upon Schuschnigg’s plebiscite as an excuse to seize power, and to\r\ncall for military intervention by Germany (_812-PS_; _2996-PS_). (See\r\nalso Section 3 of Chapter IX on Aggression Against Austria.)\r\n\r\nThereafter it was only a matter of hours before Austria became a\r\nprovince of the Reich—by a law signed by von Papen’s man, Seyss-Inquart\r\n(_2307-PS_).\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n   LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO FRANZ VON PAPEN\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 63\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

The following is an\r\nexcerpt from that letter:\r\n\r\n    “Until July 1934, I conducted myself as a regular member of the\r\n    Party. And if I had quietly in whatever form paid my membership\r\n    dues, the first one according to a receipt, I paid in December\r\n    1931.” (_2219-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a voluntary statement signed by Seyss-Inquart, with the advice of his\r\ncounsel, he discussed his affiliation with the Nazi Party as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I supported also the National Socialist Party as long as it was\r\n    legal, because it declared itself with particular determination\r\n    in favor of the Anschluss. From 1932 onward I made financial\r\n    contributions to this Party, but I discontinued financial\r\n    support when it was declared illegal in 1934.” (_3425-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the foregoing assertions of the defendant,\r\nSeyss-Inquart wrote a letter to Heinrich Himmler on 19 August 1939 in\r\nwhich he confirmed the fact that he became a member of the Nazi Party in\r\n1931 and also stated that he continued his membership in the Nazi Party\r\neven after it was declared illegal in Austria. The following is an\r\nexcerpt from that letter:\r\n\r\n    “Concerning my membership in the Nazi Party, I want to state\r\n    that I never was asked to enter the Nazi Party but I asked Dr.\r\n    Kier in December 1931 to take care of my relation to the Party.\r\n    At that time I saw the basis of the solution of the Austrian\r\n    question only in the Party. I wrote this already in the year\r\n    1929 to Dr. Neubacher to adjust his hopes which he had put in\r\n    the Austria-German Volksbund. After that, I paid my membership\r\n    fees and, as I remember, direct to the Gau Wien. The payments\r\n    were made even after the party was forbidden. Some time later, I\r\n    got in direct touch with the _Ortsgruppe_ in Dornbach. The\r\n    membership fees were paid by my wife but the Blockwart couldn’t\r\n    possibly have any doubt that those payments were for my wife and\r\n    myself since the amount of the fees, S 40 [40 Schillings] a\r\n    month, was a sure indication of this fact and I was treated in\r\n    every respect as a Party member. Besides that, I was, since\r\n    1932, a member of the _Steirischen Heimatschutzes Kammerhofer_.\r\n    In this organization I made every effort to absorb the\r\n    _Steirische Heimatschutz_ in the Party and mainly on account of\r\n    my efforts, von Habicht declared that the members of the\r\n    _Steirische Heimatschutz_ were members of the Party. That proves\r\n    that I felt myself, in every respect, as a member of the Party\r\n    and I was regarded as belonging to the Party and as I said\r\n    before, already in December 1931.” (_3271-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Seyss-Inquart, even before he became a member of the Nazi Party,\r\nbelonged to an organization conceived and founded upon principles which\r\nlater became those of the Nazi Party._ Seyss-Inquart has stated in\r\nwriting that he had been a member of a secret organization known as the\r\n“German Brotherhood” (_Deutsche Gemeinschaft_). This is evidenced by the\r\nfollowing excerpts from his letter to Himmler of 19 August 1939:\r\n\r\n    “It must be known to you that at the time of the Black-Red\r\n    Coalition, there existed an extremely secret organization under\r\n    the name of ‘German Community.’ Here met all sorts of\r\n    Nationalists and Catholic elements who, at least at that time,\r\n    were anti-Semitic and anti-Marxists. Dr. Doelter, who was my\r\n    office chief, was one of the leaders of this association and\r\n    through him I came into this movement. Dolfuss was also active\r\n    here. He was of my age and was a very active anti-Semitic. It is\r\n    through success of the activities of this organization that the\r\n    Black-Red Coalition was broken and the Marxists never came back\r\n    in the government. After the establishment of National\r\n    Socialism, this organization was dissolved.” (_3271-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe secret organization, “German Brotherhood”, (_Deutsche\r\nGemeinschaft_), was organized to promote the anti-Semitic and anti-Free\r\nMason doctrines later adopted by the Nazi Party. This fact is evidenced\r\nby Seyss-Inquart’s copy of the minutes of a meeting of this organization\r\non 28 December 1918 and by its constitution and by-laws, a portion of\r\nwhich appear in the following quotation:\r\n\r\n    “The purpose of this organization is the liberation of the\r\n    German people from Jewish influences, and combat against Jewry\r\n    with all available means. The organization is secret. Since a\r\n    contact of the organization with the public can’t be avoided it\r\n    has to be done under pretense of unsuspicious purposes and\r\n    without showing the actual set-up.” (_3400-PS_)\r\n\r\nNew members of this organization were required to make a sworn\r\nstatement, i.e.:\r\n\r\n    “As a German man, I assure with my honor, as far as I know,\r\n    there is no Jewish blood in my descendency. Furthermore, I am\r\n    not connected by marriage with a wife or other companion of\r\n    Jewish descendency, and I never will have relation with one of\r\n    those. I am not a Free Mason, I assure to be forever a good\r\n    member of the Deutsche Gemeinschaft and I will always represent\r\n    the interest of the German people against the Jewish people and\r\n    I am willing to fight the Jewish people with all my power, any\r\n    place and at any time. I promise to obey all orders and decrees\r\n    of the leadership of the organization and to preserve complete\r\n    secrecy about their institution, about the persons of the\r\n    organization, and the events within it, as long as I live.”\r\n    (_3400-PS_)\r\n\r\nNew members were also asked the question: “In case you will be accepted,\r\nare you willing to employ only Aryan physicians, attorneys, and\r\nbusinessmen?” (_3400-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Seyss-Inquart, after the Austrian Nazi Party was declared illegal\r\nin July 1934, posed as a non-member of the Nazi Party but continued to\r\nsupport it in its activities, principles, and objectives in a subversive\r\nmanner._\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart has stated that:\r\n\r\n    “Before the Anschluss, I worked for the legal, political\r\n    activities of the Austrian Socialists under the conditions laid\r\n    down in the Austrian Constitution. * * * From 1932 onwards I\r\n    made financial contributions to this party but I discontinued\r\n    financial support when it was declared illegal in 1934. From\r\n    July 1934 until the year 1936 I supported individual National\r\n    Socialists as lawyer and in collaboration with the welfare work\r\n    Langoth in Linz. From July 1936 onwards, I endeavored to help\r\n    the National Socialists to regain their legal status and finally\r\n    to participate in the Austrian Government. * * * I was\r\n    sympathetic towards the efforts of the Austrian Nazi Party to\r\n    gain political power and corresponding influence because they\r\n    were in favor of the Anschluss. * * * On 10 March 1938 I\r\n    suggested to Chancellor Schuschnigg, as a solution to the\r\n    difficulties resulting from his plebiscite plan, that the\r\n    National Socialists be appointed to the Cabinet, after I became\r\n    in May 1937 State Councillor and then on 16-2-1938 Minister of\r\n    Interior and Security.” (_3425-PS_)\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart was an official in the Austrian Government, yet he\r\nrendered services, and physical and moral support to the illegal\r\nAustrian Nazi Party during those years, knowing that the radical\r\nelements engaged in terroristic acts.\r\n\r\n    “During this time, particularly after the Party was forbidden in\r\n    July 1934, I knew that the radical element of the Party was\r\n    engaged in terroristic activities, such as the attacks on\r\n    railroads, bridges, telephone communications, etc. I knew that\r\n    the governments of both Chancellors Dolfuss and Schuschnigg,\r\n    although they held the same total German viewpoint in principle,\r\n    were opposed to the Anschluss then because of the National\r\n    Socialist regime in the Reich. I was sympathetic towards the\r\n    efforts of the Austrian Nazi Party to gain political power and\r\n    corresponding influence, because they were in favor of the\r\n    Anschluss. On the day of the unsuccessful ‘putsch,’ 25 July\r\n    1934, I was at my home in Stannern near Iglau, Czechoslovakia. I\r\n    learned later that the murder of Chancellor Dolfuss on that day\r\n    was the outcome of a ‘putsch’ plan, in which SS circles were\r\n    mainly involved, to arrest the Chancellor and put in an Austrian\r\n    government with National Socialist participation. Eight or ten\r\n    days before this unsuccessful ‘putsch’ Chancellor Dolfuss sent\r\n    for me. We discussed the disturbances and troubled state of\r\n    affairs created in Austria by the radical element of the\r\n    Austrian National Socialists. I advised Chancellor Dolfuss to\r\n    make an arrangement with Hitler because the Austrian National\r\n    Socialists and even this radical element would obey Hitler’s\r\n    orders. I conjectured—later I found confirmation—that these\r\n    terroristic activities had a certain support from the Reich.\r\n    Chancellor Dolfuss told me he would think the matter over and\r\n    made a tentative future appointment for a further discussion. I\r\n    informed among others, also acquaintances, of this conversation\r\n    whom I knew had influence among the Austrian National\r\n    Socialists. About one week later Chancellor Dolfuss informed me\r\n    that at the moment he had no time for further discussion.”\r\n    (_3425-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Seyss-Inquart derived personal benefits and political power as the\r\nresult of the subversive manipulations and terroristic activities of his\r\nfellow Nazi collaborators._ He was appointed State Councillor of Austria\r\nin May 1937, and Minister of the Interior and Security of that country\r\nas the direct result of Nazi manipulation. These facts he has admitted:\r\n\r\n    “My appointment as State Councillor was the result of an\r\n    agreement between Austria and Germany on 11-7-1936. My\r\n    appointment as Minister of the Interior and Security was one of\r\n    the results of the conference between Chancellor Schuschnigg and\r\n    Hitler at Berchtesgaden on 12-2-1938.” (_3425-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother result of the Berchtesgaden conference was that Austrian Nazis\r\nwere thereafter allowed openly to demonstrate their conviction, an\r\nadvantage which they exploited to the full.\r\n\r\n    “The Austrian National Socialists must certainly have taken my\r\n    appointment as Minister of Interior and Security as an\r\n    indication of their right to activity. Still more, however, the\r\n    outcome of the agreement of 12-2-1938 allowed them to\r\n    demonstrate their convictions. This right they utilized in more\r\n    and more widespread demonstrations.” (_3425-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _Seyss-Inquart used his affiliation with the Nazis to promote the\r\nabsorption of Austria into the Greater German Reich, according to plan\r\nas conceived by his fellow Nazi conspirators._ Seyss-Inquart had had a\r\ncontinuous and constant interest in the union of Austria and Germany for\r\ntwenty years, and during all that time worked, planned, and collaborated\r\nwith others until the union became an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\n    “In 1918 I became interested in the Anschluss of Austria with\r\n    Germany. From that year on I worked, planned, and collaborated\r\n    with others of a like mind to bring about a union. * * * It was\r\n    my desire to effect this union of the two countries—in an\r\n    evolutionary manner and by legal means. Among my Austrian\r\n    collaborators were Dr. Neubacher, City Councillor Speiser, the\r\n    University Professor Hugelmann, and Dr. Wilhelm Bauer, Professor\r\n    Wettstein and others. Later, during the rise of National\r\n    Socialism, Dr. Friedrich Rainer, Dr. Jury, Glaise-Horstenau,\r\n    Major Klausner, Dr. Muehlmann, Globotschnigg, and others. * * *\r\n    After I became State Councillor, I discussed several times with\r\n    von Papen, the German Ambassador, the possibilities of an\r\n    understanding between the Austrian government and the Austrian\r\n    National Socialists, respectively the Reich. We did not talk of\r\n    the Anschluss as an actual program. However, we were both of the\r\n    opinion that a successful understanding would bring about in the\r\n    course of time the Anschluss by evolutionary means in some form.\r\n    The last time I spoke to von Papen was in January 1938 in\r\n    Garmisch where I met him by chance.” (_3425-PS_)\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart contributed his efforts to revive the Austrian Nazi Party\r\nafter the unsuccessful “putsch” of July 25, 1934, and to provide relief\r\nfor the families of arrested and condemned Nazis. He has described these\r\nactivities in the following words:\r\n\r\n    “The effect of the ‘Putsch’ was a complete catastrophe to the\r\n    National Socialist Camp. Not merely the leaders, but party\r\n    members were arrested in so far as they did not escape; the\r\n    confiscation of their fortunes was announced; the revolt which\r\n    led to military actions in Steiriermark, Karnten and\r\n    Oberoesterreich did cost victims; the political management was\r\n    seriously compromised by the Nazis and above all, a most\r\n    sinister looking situation was created in regard to foreign\r\n    politics. In any case, the idea of a union had suffered a severe\r\n    setback. I was in agreement about the effect with Dr. Neubacher,\r\n    and it was our desire to assist easing the tension. Following\r\n    this situation I felt urged to take up politics beyond the\r\n    question of the ‘Anschluss.’ * * * The former National delegate\r\n    to the ‘Langoth’ in Linz was working with Rheintaller. Dr.\r\n    Neubacher and myself contacted this circle and met there some\r\n    other men whose names I have forgotten, but who later did not\r\n    play a particular role. After some time, the lawyer applicant\r\n    from Linz, Dr. Kaltenbrunner, joined this circle. He was said to\r\n    be an SS man. The main activities consisted in organizing an\r\n    institution to succor the needy families of those arrested and\r\n    condemned Nazis. * * * As matters calmed down, the Austrian\r\n    National Socialists collected themselves again into an illegal\r\n    party, the organization was built up for better or worse\r\n    according to the old schedule, those who returned from the Reich\r\n    were considered to be more ‘in the know’ and authoritative. The\r\n    institution of succor, ‘Langoth,’ remained outside the party\r\n    organization. But here were also men in the Nazi circles who\r\n    considered an absolute dependence on the Reich as politically\r\n    wrong and endeavored for an independent Austrian National\r\n    Socialist Party. In effect, Dr. Rainer from Karnten belonged to\r\n    those, and by his influence the future Gauleiter Klausner who is\r\n    now dead; also Globotschnigg was in it, though I doubt he was\r\n    sincerely convinced, and also others. Dr. Neubacher took a\r\n    keener interest in political affairs and entered into\r\n    relationship with the proper Party circles.” (_3254-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe defendant submitted his plans to Hitler, Hess, and Goering for their\r\napproval, and contacted other German Nazis.\r\n\r\n    “After my appointment as State Councillor, Wilhelm Keppler, the\r\n    German Secretary of State for Austrian affairs, arranged a visit\r\n    for me with Hess and Goering. I explained my intentions and\r\n    plans to them, namely, the attainment of the legal activity for\r\n    the Austrian National Socialist, independent of the Reich Party.\r\n    Hess expressed his interest and said to me among other things:\r\n    he regretted that I was not one of the original ‘old fighters.’\r\n    I believe that at that time Goering had already established\r\n    direct connections with the Austrian State Secretary, Guido\r\n    Schmid. After my appointment as Minister of Interior and\r\n    Security of Austria, I went to Berlin to visit Hitler. I arrived\r\n    in Berlin on 17-2-1938 where I was met by Keppler who took me to\r\n    Himmler. This visit was not anticipated in my program. Himmler\r\n    wanted to talk over police matters, I informed him, however,\r\n    that I was not conversant to speak about them. I did not follow\r\n    the suggestions which he made. I greeted Hitler with raised\r\n    hand—permissible after the agreement of 12-2—advised him,\r\n    however, immediately that as Austrian Minister, my\r\n    responsibility lay with Austria. I explained to Hitler my plans,\r\n    namely: I was to be the living guaranty for Dr. Schuschnigg of\r\n    the evolutionary way. The Austria National Socialists must only\r\n    conduct their activities according to the Austrian Constitution\r\n    and on those lines find their way to the Reich; they must not\r\n    make any totalitarian claim nor conduct a cultural struggle. The\r\n    leadership of the Austrian National Socialists must be\r\n    independent of the Reich and remain responsible to Austria. I\r\n    would have, as Minister of Security, to oppose any kind of\r\n    illegal activity. Against this the Austrian National Socialist\r\n    would be permitted full freedom of activity to work for the\r\n    closest cooperation of Austria and Germany. Hitler agreed to my\r\n    plans but expressed certain doubts whether Dr. Schuschnigg would\r\n    be willing to go so far. During my conference with Hitler,\r\n    Keppler and Ribbentrop waited in the ante-room of Hitler’s\r\n    office.” (_3425-PS_)\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart’s fellow Nazi conspirators regarded his position as\r\nCouncillor of State in the Austrian Government as most important to\r\nthem, because he had a mandate from the German Nazis in power, which he\r\nwas attempting to carry out. Because his negotiations with Chancellor\r\nSchuschnigg seemed to be running aground, Seyss-Inquart sent a report of\r\nthat fact to Keppler by courier, stating that he felt compelled to\r\nreturn his mandate, and expressing a desire to discuss the matter before\r\nacting accordingly. Keppler immediately sought advice from Goering in a\r\nletter dated 6 January 1938. On that same day Goering’s secretary was\r\ninstructed to telephone instructions to Keppler to do anything to avoid\r\nthe resignations of Councillor of State Dr. Seyss-Inquart and State\r\nMinister Glaise von Horstenau. Keppler received this telephone message\r\non 7 January 1938, and on 8 January 1938 wrote a letter to Seyss-Inquart\r\ninforming him of Goering’s instructions and relaying Goering’s request\r\nnot to give up the mandate under any circumstances without discussing\r\nthe matter with Goering. (_3473-PS_; _3397-PS_)\r\n\r\nDespite assertions, in statements since his arrest and indictment, to\r\nthe effect that he desired a union of Austria and Germany in an\r\nevolutionary manner and by legal means, Seyss-Inquart has on other\r\noccasions made statements to the contrary. His letter of 14 July 1939 to\r\nGoering is particularly illuminating on this point:\r\n\r\n    “I told myself in July 1934 that we must fight this clerical\r\n    regime on its own ground in order to give the Fuehrer a chance\r\n    to use whatever method he desires. I told myself that this\r\n    Austria was worth a mass. I have stuck to this attitude with an\r\n    iron determination because I and my friends have had to fight\r\n    against the whole political church, and Free Masonry, the Jewry,\r\n    in short, against everything in Austria. The slightest weakness\r\n    which we might have displayed would undoubtedly have led to our\r\n    political annihilation; it would have deprived the Fuehrer of\r\n    the means and tools to carry out his ingenious political\r\n    solution for Austria as became evident in the days of March\r\n    1938. I have been fully conscious of the fact that I am\r\n    following a path which is not comprehensible to the masses and\r\n    also not to my party comrades. I have followed it calmly and\r\n    would without hesitation follow it again because I am satisfied\r\n    that at one point I could serve the Fuehrer as a tool in his\r\n    work, even though my former attitude, even now, gives occasion\r\n    to very worthy and honorable Party comrades to doubt my\r\n    trustworthiness. I have never paid attention to such things\r\n    because I am satisfied with the opinion which the Fuehrer and\r\n    the men close to him have of me.” (_2219-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother statement of the defendant, which throws some light on this\r\npoint, is found in his letter to Himmler dated 19 August 1939:\r\n\r\n    “On November 8, 1938, the Fuehrer invited several political\r\n    leaders for supper. The Fuehrer asked me to be next to him. We\r\n    discussed the situation in Ostmark. I told him that in\r\n    accordance with his order, we started to dissolve the competence\r\n    of the Austrian government by giving the powers partly to the\r\n    Gauen and partly to the central leaders. But there still would\r\n    remain certain affairs which would be common for all Gauen.”\r\n    (_3271-PS_)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Seyss-Inquart has made the following statement:\r\n\r\n    “I was happy that the Anschluss of Austria with the German Reich\r\n    had come at last after so many vain endeavors since 1918 because\r\n    I was in favor of the Anschluss of Austria with the Reich under\r\n    many conditions. I was aware at least to a certain extent of the\r\n    harshness of the National Socialist regime, but I was of the\r\n    opinion that these two German countries belonged together and\r\n    that the German people should solve their own internal affairs\r\n    and difficulties. I was convinced that the harshness of the\r\n    National Socialist regime chiefly because of its achievement of\r\n    the National aim—cancellation of discriminatory peace treaties\r\n    and achievement of the right of self-determination—would in\r\n    time be surmounted.” (_3425-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe subversive machinations of the Austrian Nazis to bring about the\r\nabsorption of Austria by the Greater German Reich was described in\r\ndetail by Dr. Friedrich Rainer, a leading Austrian Nazi and a\r\ncollaborator of Seyss-Inquart who became one of Hitler’s Gauleiters, in\r\na report prepared by him and forwarded to Buerckel. A copy of this\r\nreport accompanied by a letter of transmittal was later sent to\r\nSeyss-Inquart by Dr. Rainer. In substance, the report related how the\r\nNazi party lost a parliamentary battle in 1933, continued its efforts to\r\nforce admission of its representatives into the Austrian government, and\r\nfinally flowered into the unsuccessful “Putsch” of July 1934, which, in\r\neffect, destroyed the Nazi organization. Following the unsuccessful\r\n“Putsch”, Hitler liquidated the first stage of the battle, and\r\ninstructed Franz von Papen to restore normal relationships between the\r\ntwo countries. Accordingly, a new method of political penetration was\r\nadopted. The result was that Hinterleitner, an Austrian Nazi got in\r\ntouch with the lawyer Seyss-Inquart, who had connections with Dr.\r\nWachter originating from Seyss-Inquart’s support of the July uprising.\r\nSeyss-Inquart also had a good position in the legal field and especially\r\nwell established relations with Christian Social politicians. Dr.\r\nSeyss-Inquart came from the ranks of the “Styrian Heimatschutz” and had\r\nbecome a Nazi party member when the entire “Styrian Heimatschutz” was\r\nincorporated in the NSDAP. The reason for utilizing Seyss-Inquart\r\nappears in the following excerpt from the covering letter which\r\naccompanied Dr. Rainer’s report to Reich Commissar Gauleiter Josef\r\nBuerckel, dated 6 July 1939:\r\n\r\n    “I think the main reason for the fact that the person of Dr.\r\n    Seyss-Inquart seemed to Hitler and to public opinion to have\r\n    stepped in the limelight in those March days, was that no\r\n    position existed in the party which one might have presented\r\n    oneself to the public, and that there was no man who had the\r\n    guts to let himself be presented. The actual reason was that the\r\n    party leadership had to remain secret during the whole illegal\r\n    fight, secret even from the Reich German public.” (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus it is clear why Seyss-Inquart was surreptitiously a member of the\r\nAustrian Nazi Party after it was declared illegal in 1934.\r\n\r\nDr. Rainer goes on to report that full recognition of the party\r\nleadership was given by Seyss-Inquart and also that the defendant was in\r\npermanent contact with Captain Leopold, who became a member of the staff\r\nof Hess. After Hinterleitner was arrested, Dr. Rainer became his\r\nsuccessor as leader of the Austrian Nazi Party, and, on 16 July 1936,\r\nDr. Rainer and Globocnik visited Hitler at Obersalzburg, where they\r\nreceived a clear explanation of the situation and the wishes of the\r\nFuehrer. Subsequently, on 17 July 1936, all illegal Gauleiters met in\r\nAnif near Salzburg, where they received a complete report from Dr.\r\nRainer on the statement of the Fuehrer and his political instructions\r\nfor carrying out the fight. After the agreement between Germany and\r\nAustria on 11 July 1936, Hitler appointed Wilhelm Keppler as Chief of a\r\nmixed commission to supervise the execution of the agreement. At the\r\nsame time Keppler was given full authority for the Nazi Party in\r\nAustria. (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\n(6) _The activities of Seyss-Inquart and his fellow Nazi conspirators\r\nand collaborators forced the then Austrian government into a critical\r\nsituation and a struggle for survival._ As the result of the plans,\r\nmaneuvers, and disturbances created by the Nazis in Austria,\r\nSchuschnigg, Chancellor of Austria, accompanied by his State Secretary,\r\nGuido Schmid, conferred with Hitler at Berchtesgaden on 12 February\r\n1938. Dr. Muehlmann was also present but not as a member of the\r\nSchuschnigg delegation. At this meeting the possibilities for military\r\naction by Germany against Austria were demonstrated to the Chancellor.\r\nThe ultimate result was that Chancellor Schuschnigg had no choice but to\r\naccept the demands of Hitler that the Austrian Nazi Party be legalized;\r\nthat amnesty be granted to Austrian Nazis already convicted for illegal\r\nactivities; and that Seyss-Inquart be appointed Minister of the Interior\r\nand Security in the Austrian cabinet, (_2995-PS_; _3254-PS_; _3425-PS_;\r\n_2469-PS_; _2464-PS_)\r\n\r\nA few days after the Berchtesgaden meeting of Hitler and Schuschnigg,\r\nand immediately after his appointment as Minister of the Interior and\r\nSecurity of Austria, Seyss-Inquart went to Berlin for a conference with\r\nHitler. Upon arrival in Berlin he was met by Keppler, Hitler’s special\r\ndelegate on Austrian affairs, who took him to Himmler. After a short\r\nconference with Himmler, the defendant was conducted to Hitler, to whom\r\nhe gave the Nazi salute and with whom he had a conference lasting two\r\nhours and ten minutes. Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop and Keppler\r\nwaited in the ante-chamber during the conference. Seyss-Inquart first\r\noffered Hitler an explanation for greeting him with the Hitler salute,\r\nby saying: “I consider him as the Fuehrer of the German people who led\r\nus out of the discriminations of the peace treaties.” During the\r\nconference, he rendered a report to Hitler concerning the Austrian\r\nsituation since June of 1934 and presented his own program for Hitler’s\r\napproval. Hitler expressed his approval of the plan but told\r\nSeyss-Inquart that he doubted whether Chancellor Schuschnigg would be\r\nwilling to go so far. It seems clear that Hitler’s doubt concerning\r\nSchuschnigg’s approval of the Seyss-Inquart plan referred solely to\r\nSeyss-Inquart’s proposal to allow Austrian Nazis to “conduct their\r\nactivities according to the Austrian Constitution and on those lines\r\nfind their way to the Reich,” because all other portions of his plan had\r\npreviously been adopted as a result of the Berchtesgaden Agreement.\r\n(_3254-PS_; _3425-PS_; _2484-PS_)\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart has asserted that, upon his return to Vienna after his\r\nconference with Hitler, he reported to Chancellor Schuschnigg the\r\ncontent of his discussion and urged the Chancellor to make a decision\r\nabout the Austrian National Socialist question. He then attended rallies\r\nof the Austrian National Socialists held in various places in Austria to\r\ninform them of the content of his conference with Hitler. Two of the\r\nprincipal meetings were held at Graz and Linz (_3425-PS_; _3254-PS_).\r\nConsiderable doubt is cast upon the truth of Seyss-Inquart’s assertions\r\nthat he reported the contents of his conference with Hitler to\r\nChancellor Schuschnigg and in public meetings of the Austrian Nazis, by\r\na statement contained in a letter written by Seyss-Inquart to Himmler on\r\n19 August 1939. The statement is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I had a conversation of over two hours with the Fuehrer on\r\n    February 17, 1938, in which I explained to him my point of view.\r\n    I would only be able to make statements about the content of\r\n    this conversation if the Fuehrer would grant me permission. I\r\n    left this discussion as a very sincere man and with a feeling of\r\n    great happiness to be of help to the Fuehrer.” (_3271-PS_)\r\n\r\n(7) _Finally Chancellor Schuschnigg determined to go before the people\r\nfor a decision on the question of Austrian independence._ Chancellor\r\nSchuschnigg planned to hold a plebiscite on that precise question and\r\nfixed 13 March 1938 as a date upon which the plebiscite would be held.\r\nThe Chancellor took Seyss-Inquart into his confidence and discussed the\r\nmatter of the plebiscite with him. The Chancellor requested\r\nSeyss-Inquart to keep the matter a secret until noon of the next day,\r\nand the defendant promised to do so. Thereafter, Seyss-Inquart prepared\r\na letter to Schuschnigg objecting to the plebiscite on constitutional\r\ngrounds and alleging that the manner in which the plebiscite was to be\r\nheld would not allow the Austrians to express their own desires.\r\nSeyss-Inquart admits that a copy of his letter was delivered to Hitler\r\nin Berlin by Globotschnigg. (_3254-PS_; _3425-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 9 March 1938, a meeting of the Austrian Nazis was held because they\r\nhad learned, through an illegal information service, that a plebiscite\r\nwas to be held. Dr. Rainer describes this meeting in the following\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n    “The ‘_Landesleitung_’ received word about the planned\r\n    plebiscite through illegal information services on 9 March 1938\r\n    at 10 a. m. At the session, which was called immediately\r\n    afterwards, Seyss-Inquart explained that he had known about this\r\n    information only a few hours, but that he could not talk about\r\n    it because he had given his word to keep silent on this subject.\r\n    But during the talks he made us understand that the illegal\r\n    information we received was based on truth, and that in view of\r\n    the new situation, he had been cooperating with the\r\n    ‘_Landesleitung_’ from the very first moment. Klausner, Jury,\r\n    Rainer, Globotschnigg, and Seyss-Inquart were present at the\r\n    first talks which were held at 10 a. m. There it was decided\r\n    that first, the Fuehrer had to be informed immediately;\r\n    secondly, the opportunity for the Fuehrer to intervene must be\r\n    given to him by way of an official declaration made by Minister\r\n    Seyss-Inquart to Schuschnigg; and thirdly, Seyss-Inquart must\r\n    negotiate with the government until clear instructions and\r\n    orders were received from the Fuehrer. Seyss-Inquart and Rainer\r\n    together composed a letter to Schuschnigg, and only one copy of\r\n    it was brought to the Fuehrer by Globocnik, who flew to him on\r\n    the afternoon of 9 March 1938.” (_812-PS_).\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart himself admits that he attended this meeting, which was\r\nheld at the Regina Hotel, Vienna (_3425-PS_; _3254-PS_). The defendant\r\nwas informed at this meeting that he would receive a letter from Hitler\r\nby messenger the next morning. (_3425-PS_; _3254-PS_).\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of 11 March 1938, Seyss-Inquart received Hitler’s\r\nletter. He describes it as having contained several erroneous statements\r\nand containing a demand that a decision should be arrived at before\r\nnoon; that in case of rejection the Reich Government would denounce the\r\nagreement of 12 February 1938 and military action must be understood.\r\nAccording to Seyss-Inquart, Hitler also gave expression to his belief\r\nthat there would be disturbances in Austria if Chancellor Schuschnigg\r\nwould not relent and that the Reich would come to the help of Austria if\r\nAustria demanded so. Glaise-Horstenau arrived by plane in Vienna early\r\nthat same morning with the information that Berlin was greatly excited\r\nand that military steps were in preparation. (_3254-PS_; _3425-PS_)\r\n\r\n(8) _Seyss-Inquart then proceeded to carry out Hitler’s orders and to\r\nfulfill the plans made by himself and his fellow Nazi conspirators._ Dr.\r\nRainer in his report to Reich Commissar Gauleiter Josef Buerckel, and in\r\nhis covering letter dated 6 July 1939, related his version of the\r\nsequence of events during this period and described the precise role of\r\nSeyss-Inquart, as he viewed it. He complained about the fact that Hitler\r\nand the general public seemed to give Seyss-Inquart all the credit for\r\nthe annexation of Austria by Germany. The following quotation from this\r\nletter and report is significant:\r\n\r\n    “Soon after taking over in Austria, Klausner, Globocnik, and I\r\n    flew to Berlin to report to Hitler’s deputy, Hess, about the\r\n    events which led to our taking over the government. We did this\r\n    because we had the impression that the general opinion, perhaps\r\n    also Hitler’s own, was that the liberation depended more on\r\n    Austrian matters of state rather than the Party. To be more\r\n    exact, Hitler especially mentioned Dr. Seyss-Inquart alone; and\r\n    public opinion gave him alone credit for the change and thus\r\n    believed him to have played the sole leading role.” (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\nDr. Rainer then proceeded to describe just what happened in those\r\ncritical days, and outlined the final instructions given by him for\r\nFriday, 11 March 1938. He explained that three situations might develop\r\nwithin the following days:\r\n\r\n    “1st Case: The plebiscite will not be held. In this case, a\r\n    great demonstration must be held.\r\n\r\n    “2nd Case: Schuschnigg will resign. In this case, a\r\n    demonstration was ordered in taking over the government power.\r\n\r\n    “3rd Case: Schuschnigg will take up the fight. In this case, all\r\n    party leaders were ordered to act upon their own initiative,\r\n    using all means to capture the position of power.” (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\nDr. Seyss-Inquart took part in these talks with the Gauleiters.\r\n\r\n    “On Friday, 11 March, the Minister Glaise-Horstenau arrived in\r\n    Vienna after a visit with the Fuehrer. After talks with\r\n    Seyss-Inquart he went to see the chancellor. At 11:30 a. m. the\r\n    ‘_Landesleitung_’ had a meeting at which Klausner, Rainer,\r\n    Globocnik, Jury, Seyss-Inquart, Glaise-Horstenau, Fishboeck and\r\n    Muehlmann participated. Dr. Seyss-Inquart reported on his talks\r\n    with Dr. Schuschnigg which had ended in a rejection of the\r\n    proposal of the two ministers.\r\n\r\n    “In regard to Rainer’s proposal, von Klausner ordered that the\r\n    government be presented with an ultimatum, expiring at 1400\r\n    hours, signed by legal political, ‘Front’ men, including both\r\n    ministers and also State Councillors Fishboeck and Jury, for the\r\n    establishment of a voting date in three weeks and a free and\r\n    secret ballot in accordance with the constitution.\r\n\r\n    “On the basis of written evidence which Glaise-Horstenau had\r\n    brought with him, a leaflet, to be printed in millions of\r\n    copies, and a telegram to the Fuehrer calling for help, were\r\n    prepared.\r\n\r\n    “Klausner placed the leadership of the final political actions\r\n    in the hands of Rainer and Globocnik. Schuschnigg called a\r\n    session of all ministers for 2:00 p. m. Rainer agreed with\r\n    Seyss-Inquart that Rainer would send the telegram to the Fuehrer\r\n    and the statement to the population at 3:00 p. m. and at the\r\n    same time he would start all necessary actions to take over\r\n    power unless he received news from the session of the ministers’\r\n    council before that time. During this time all measures had been\r\n    prepared. At 2:30 Seyss-Inquart ’phoned Rainer and informed him\r\n    that Schuschnigg had been unable to take the pressure and had\r\n    recalled the plebiscite but that he had refused to call a new\r\n    plebiscite and had ordered the strongest police measures for\r\n    maintaining order. Rainer asked whether the two ministers had\r\n    resigned, and Seyss-Inquart answered: ‘No.’ Rainer informed the\r\n    ‘Reichskanzlei’ through the German Embassy, and received an\r\n    answer from Goering through the same channels that the Fuehrer\r\n    will not consent to partial solutions and that Schuschnigg must\r\n    resign. Seyss-Inquart was informed of this by Globocnik and\r\n    Muehlmann; talks were had between Seyss-Inquart and Schuschnigg:\r\n    Schuschnigg resigned. Seyss-Inquart asked Rainer what measures\r\n    the party wished taken. Rainer’s answer: Reestablishment of the\r\n    government by Seyss-Inquart, legalization of the party, and\r\n    calling up of the SS and SA as auxiliaries to the police force.\r\n    Seyss-Inquart promised to have these measures carried out, but\r\n    very soon the announcement followed that everything might be\r\n    threatened by the resistance of Miklas. Meanwhile word arrived\r\n    from the German Embassy that the Fuehrer expected the\r\n    establishment of a government under Seyss-Inquart with a\r\n    national majority, the legalization of the party, and permission\r\n    for the legion to return, all within the specified time of 7:30\r\n    p. m.; otherwise, German troops would cross the border at 8:00\r\n    p. m. At 5:00 p. m. Rainer and Globocnik, accompanied by\r\n    Muehlmann, went to the Chancellor’s office to carry out this\r\n    errand.\r\n\r\n    “Due to the cooperation of the above-mentioned people with group\r\n    leader Keppler and other officials of the Reich and due to the\r\n    activities of other contact-men in Austria, it was possible to\r\n    obtain the appointment of Seyss-Inquart as ‘_Staatsrat_’\r\n    [councillor of State] in July 1937. Due to the same facts, the\r\n    Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg was forced to take a new so-called\r\n    ‘satisfactory action’. Through all this a new and stronger\r\n    political position was won in the Austrian system. The\r\n    National-Socialist Party became acceptable again in the\r\n    political field and became a partner with whom one had to\r\n    negotiate, even when it was not officially incorporated into\r\n    internal Austrian political developments. This complicated\r\n    political maneuver, accompanied by the steadily increasing\r\n    pressure from the Reich, led to talks between the Fuehrer and\r\n    Schuschnigg at the Obersalzberg. Here Gruppenfuehrer Keppler\r\n    presented the concrete political demands of the fighting\r\n    underground movement, which he estimated according to his\r\n    personal experiences and the information he received. The\r\n    results of these talks were the right of a free acknowledgment\r\n    of the National Socialist movement on the one hand and the\r\n    recognition of an independent Austrian state on the other hand,\r\n    as well as the appointment of Seyss-Inquart as Minister of\r\n    Interior and Public Safety, as a person who will guarantee to\r\n    both sides the proper carrying out of the agreements. In this\r\n    way Seyss-Inquart occupied the key position and was in the\r\n    center of all obvious political actions. A legal base in the\r\n    government was won for the party. This resulted in a paralysis\r\n    of the ‘system apparates’ [Schuschnigg government] at a time\r\n    when a revolution needed to be carried out. Through this, the\r\n    basis for a new attack on the Schuschnigg government was won.\r\n\r\n    “Situation: Miklas negotiated with Ender for the creation of a\r\n    government which included, blacks, reds and National Socialists,\r\n    and proposed the post of Vice-Chancellor to Seyss-Inquart. The\r\n    latter rejected it and told Rainer that he was not able to\r\n    negotiate by himself because he was personally involved, and\r\n    therefore a weak and unpleasant political situation might\r\n    result. Rainer negotiated with Zernette. Director of the cabinet\r\n    Huber, Guido Schmid, Glaise-Horstenau, Legation Councillor\r\n    Stein, Military Attache General Muffe, and the ‘Gruppenfuehrer’\r\n    Keppler, who had arrived in the meantime, were also negotiating.\r\n    At 7:00 Seyss-Inquart entered the negotiations again. Situation\r\n    at 7:30 p. m.: Stubborn refusal of Miklas to appoint\r\n    Seyss-Inquart as Chancellor; appeal to the world in case of a\r\n    German invasion.\r\n\r\n    “Gruppenfuehrer Keppler explained that the Fuehrer did not yet\r\n    have an urgent reason for the invasion. This reason must first\r\n    be created. The situation in Vienna and in the country is most\r\n    dangerous. It is feared that street fighting will break out any\r\n    moment because Rainer ordered the entire party to demonstrate at\r\n    3 o’clock. Rainer proposed storming and seizing the government\r\n    palace in order to force the reconstruction of the government.\r\n    The proposal was rejected by Keppler but was carried out by\r\n    Rainer after he discussed it with Globocnik. After 8:00 p. m.\r\n    the SA and SS marched in and occupied the government buildings\r\n    and all important positions in the city of Vienna. At 8:30 p. m.\r\n    Rainer, with the approval of Klausner, ordered all Gauleiters of\r\n    Austria to take over power in all eight ‘gaus’ of Austria, with\r\n    the help of the SS and SA and with instructions that all\r\n    government representatives who try to resist should be told that\r\n    this action was taken on order of Chancellor Seyss-Inquart.\r\n\r\n    “With this, the revolution broke out, and this resulted in the\r\n    complete occupation of Austria within three hours and the taking\r\n    over of all important posts by the party * * *.\r\n\r\n    “The seizure of power was the work of the party supported by the\r\n    Fuehrer’s threat of invasion and the legal standing of\r\n    Seyss-Inquart in the government. The national result in the form\r\n    of the taking over of the government by Seyss-Inquart was due to\r\n    the actual seizure of power by the party on one hand, and the\r\n    political efficiency of Dr. Seyss-Inquart in his territory on\r\n    the other; but both factors may be considered only in the\r\n    relation to the Fuehrer’s decision on 9 March 1938 to solve the\r\n    Austrian problem under any circumstances and the orders\r\n    consequently issued by the Fuehrer.” (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart’s own story of the events on 11 March 1938 is not\r\nfundamentally different, although he does show a marked tendency to\r\nminimize his role in the planning, precipitating, and accomplishment of\r\nthe annexation of Austria by Germany, in a statement signed by him after\r\nhis arrest and indictment:\r\n\r\n    “At 10 o’clock in the morning Glaise-Horstenau and I went to the\r\n    Bundes Chancellery and conferred for about two hours with Dr.\r\n    Schuschnigg. We told him of all that we knew, particularly about\r\n    the possibility of disturbances and preparations by the Reich.\r\n    The Chancellor said that he would give his decision by 1400\r\n    hours. While I was with Glaise-Horstenau and Dr. Schuschnigg, I\r\n    was repeatedly called to the telephone to speak to Goering. He\r\n    informed me, (the demands of the Reich steadily increasing) that\r\n    the agreement of 12-2 had been cancelled, and demanded Dr.\r\n    Schuschnigg’s resignation and my appointment as Chancellor. I\r\n    delivered this information verbally to Dr. Schuschnigg and\r\n    withdrew from the conference.\r\n\r\n    “In the meantime Keppler arrived from Berlin and had a\r\n    conference in the Bundes Chancellery, I believe also with\r\n    President Miklas. The latter refused to concede to the demands\r\n    and sought to find various other solutions. When Keppler arrived\r\n    from Berlin he showed me the contents of a telegram which I, as\r\n    leader of the provisional Austrian Government, was to send to\r\n    Hitler and in which I was to request sending of German troops to\r\n    Austria to put down disorders. I refused as I did not want to\r\n    establish myself as head of a provisional government, and there\r\n    were no disorders in Austria. Keppler repeatedly urged me about\r\n    the telegram. Around 6 p. m. I told him that he knew my\r\n    standpoint and should do what he wished with Berlin. Keppler, as\r\n    I have been able to confirm from records available, understood\r\n    my answer and did not send off the telegram at that time. Around\r\n    7:30 p. m. a frontier police post announced that German troops\r\n    were crossing the frontier. Thereupon Dr. Schuschnigg gave his\r\n    well known farewell speech over the radio. Upon requests from\r\n    various sides I followed with a speech over the radio, stating\r\n    that I was still functioning as Minister of Interior and\r\n    Security, requesting preservation of peace and order, and gave\r\n    directions that no resistance should be offered the German\r\n    troops.\r\n\r\n    “As I am able to gather from the records available, I was again\r\n    requested about 10 p. m. to give my sanction to another somewhat\r\n    altered telegram, about which I informed President Miklas and\r\n    Dr. Schuschnigg. Finally President Miklas appointed me\r\n    Chancellor and a little while later he approved of my proposed\r\n    ministers.” (_3425-PS_)\r\n\r\nHowever, Seyss-Inquart displayed undue modesty in this statement. His\r\nletter to Himmler indicates how active he was on 11 March 1938, and\r\nreveals that he was not satisfied with making demands upon Chancellor\r\nSchuschnigg, but also handed an ultimatum to President Miklas:\r\n\r\n    “It is only possible that Buerckel made a statement that in the\r\n    critical hours it was hard to find me. After I had handed an\r\n    ultimatum to Miklas which was respited until 5:45 p. m. I took a\r\n    recess of about a half hour to catch some fresh air. I conceded\r\n    that I was, in a way, exhausted from the things which happened\r\n    just a few hours before that and I tried to find recreation in\r\n    the fresh air. Besides that I planned to take a look at the\r\n    situation on the streets. Furthermore, I wanted to make a phone\r\n    call to Berlin, not from the Chancellery, but from some other\r\n    place. Phone calls from the Chancellery were always tapped\r\n    whereas they were only sometimes tapped from other places. I was\r\n    sure they didn’t need me until 5:30 p. m., because the men of\r\n    the old system would not make a decision a second earlier than\r\n    they had to.” (_3271-PS_)\r\n\r\nA stenographic transcript of Goering’s telephone conversation with\r\nSeyss-Inquart confirms the fact that Seyss-Inquart was ordered to demand\r\nChancellor Schuschnigg’s resignation and the appointment of himself as\r\nChancellor. (_2949-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis stenographic record of Goering’s conversations also reveals that\r\nSeyss-Inquart had an agent keep in contact with Goering during the\r\nnegotiations with Chancellor Schuschnigg. Seyss-Inquart was given an\r\norder by Goering through this agent to report by 7:30 p. m., 11 March\r\n1938, that he had formed a new government. He was informed that the\r\nforeign political aspect would be handled exclusively by Germany and\r\nthat Hitler would talk with him about this matter at a future date.\r\n(_2949-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition the stenographic transcript of these telephone conversations\r\nshow that the selection of individual members of the cabinet of the new\r\ngovernment to be established by Seyss-Inquart was to be made by the Nazi\r\nconspirators in Berlin. (_2949-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt 1726 hours on the night of 11 March 1938, Seyss-Inquart reported to\r\nGoering by telephone as ordered. He reported that President Miklas had\r\naccepted the resignation of Chancellor Schuschnigg but wanted to appoint\r\na man like Ender to the Chancellorship. He further reported his\r\nsuggestion to the President that the Chancellorship be entrusted to\r\nhim—Seyss-Inquart—and also reported that “We have ordered the SA and\r\nthe SS to take over police duties.” Thereupon Goering ordered\r\nSeyss-Inquart to go with Lt. Gen. Muff to President Miklas and inform\r\nhim that if the demands were not met immediately German troops, already\r\nadvancing to the frontier, would invade Austria that night and Austria\r\nwould cease to exist. An audience with the President was to be demanded.\r\nThe invasion would be stopped only if President Miklas entrusted\r\nSeyss-Inquart with the Chancellorship. Seyss-Inquart was also instructed\r\nto call out the National Socialists of Austria all over the country,\r\nbecause Austrian Nazis should even then be in the streets. Seyss-Inquart\r\nwas to report again at 7:30 p. m. (_2949-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe telegram, already prepared, asking Hitler to send German troops into\r\nAustria, over the defendant Seyss-Inquart’s signature, was transmitted\r\nas ordered and agreed upon. (_2463-PS_)\r\n\r\nEven before Seyss-Inquart received his appointment as Chancellor of\r\nAustria he dispatched a telegram using that title. An affidavit of\r\nAugust Eigruber states as follows:\r\n\r\n    “On the evening of 11 March 1938 at between 8 and 9 o’clock p.\r\n    m. he received two telegrams; one of which came from Dr.\r\n    Seyss-Inquart, as Bundes Chancellor of Austria, and the other\r\n    from one Dr. Rainer; that the telegram from Dr. Seyss-Inquart\r\n    appointed the affiant as temporary _Landeshauptmann_ in Upper\r\n    Austria; and that the telegram from Dr. Rainer appointed the\r\n    affiant temporary leader of the National Socialist Party in\r\n    Upper Austria.” (_2909-PS_)\r\n\r\nSchuschnigg presented his resignation, which was accepted by President\r\nMiklas. The appointment of Seyss-Inquart as Chancellor came late on the\r\nevening of 11 March 1938. (_2465-PS_)\r\n\r\n(9) _Having infiltrated into the Austrian Government of Chancellor\r\nSchuschnigg according to plan, Seyss-Inquart exploited his opportunities\r\nto carry out the plan to its ultimate conclusion, i.e. German annexation\r\nof Austria._ The first act of Seyss-Inquart as the new Chancellor of\r\nAustria was to hold a telephone conversation with Hitler early in the\r\nmorning of 12 March 1938. He has described the substance of this\r\ntelephone conversation as follows:\r\n\r\n    “During the morning of 12 March I held a telephone conversation\r\n    with Hitler in which I suggested that while German troops were\r\n    entering Austria, Austrian troops as a symbol should march into\r\n    the Reich. Hitler agreed to this suggestion and we agreed to\r\n    meet in Linz, Upper Austria, later on that same day.”\r\n    (_3425-PS_)\r\n\r\nThereafter, on 12 March 1938, Seyss-Inquart greeted Hitler on the\r\nbalcony of the City Hall of Linz, Upper Austria. In his ensuing speech,\r\nSeyss-Inquart announced that Article 88 of the Treaty of St. Germain,\r\nwhich provided that “the independence of Austria is inalienable\r\notherwise than with the consent of the Council of the League of\r\nNations,” was no longer operative.\r\n\r\n    “I then flew to Linz with Himmler, who had arrived in Vienna\r\n    from Berlin. I greeted Hitler on the balcony of the City Hall,\r\n    and said that Article 88 of the Treaty of St. Germain was now\r\n    inoperative.” (_3425-PS_; _L-231_)\r\n\r\nIn his memorandum entitled “The Austrian Question” Seyss-Inquart\r\ndescribes his meeting with Hitler as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In the afternoon, I flew with Himmler to Linz and drove then to\r\n    meet Hitler. Hitler entered Linz in the evening. I never saw\r\n    such an enthusiasm. The welcome was spontaneous and of no\r\n    precedence. In my (welcome) speech I declared that Article 88 of\r\n    the St. Germain Treaty was no longer binding.” (_3254-PS_;\r\n    _2485-PS_)\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart then drove back to Vienna on the morning of 13 March 1938.\r\nHis Secretary of State for Security begged that he be allowed to resign,\r\na decision he reached as a result of a conversation with Himmler, which\r\nhad caused him to fear for his own personal welfare. Seyss-Inquart then\r\nnominated Kaltenbrunner for State Secretary for Security, and the\r\nnomination was accepted by President Miklas. About noon State Under\r\nSecretary Stuckart of the German Reich Ministry of the Interior brought\r\na proposal for a reannexation act uniting Austria to Germany, and\r\nannounced Hitler’s wish for prompt execution of it. Seyss-Inquart then\r\ncalled a meeting of his Council of Ministers, and on his proposal the\r\ncouncil adopted the act. (_3254-PS_)\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart, realizing that if the President of Austria resigned his\r\noffice, then he, Seyss-Inquart, would be the successor, went to\r\nPresident Miklas with the information about the action of the Council of\r\nMinisters. Seyss-Inquart describes this meeting with President Miklas as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “In the case where the Bund President would, for any reason,\r\n    either have resigned his functions or be, for some time, impeded\r\n    in fulfilling them, his prerogatives were to go over to the Bund\r\n    Chancellor, I went to the Bund President with Dr. Wolff. The\r\n    President told me that he did not know whether this development\r\n    would be of welfare to the Austrian Nation, but that he did not\r\n    wish to interfere and preferred to resign his functions, so that\r\n    all rights would come into my hands, according to the\r\n    Constitution. The possibility of my dismissal or resignation\r\n    were only slightly mentioned and recognized as inopportune in\r\n    the prevailing situation.” (_3254-PS_)\r\n\r\nPresident Miklas then resigned and Seyss-Inquart succeeded to his\r\noffice. (_2466-PS_)\r\n\r\nThereafter Seyss-Inquart signed the Act uniting Austria with Germany and\r\nhurried back to Linz to report this news to Hitler:\r\n\r\n    “Then there were some letters exchanged between the Bund\r\n    President and myself, confirming our conversation and his\r\n    retirement. Thereafter I drove to Linz, where I arrived around\r\n    mid-night and reported to the Fuehrer the accomplishment of the\r\n    Anschluss Law. Hitler was very much impressed by it; for a while\r\n    he remained quiet, then tears dropped from his eyes down his\r\n    cheeks. He said then that he was especially happy because his\r\n    Motherland had achieved her annexation to the Reich without any\r\n    shedding of blood.” (_3254-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 14 March 1938 Hitler entered Vienna. On 15 March 1938 there was a\r\npublic demonstration in Vienna and Hitler introduced Seyss-Inquart as\r\n“Reich _Statthalter_ for Austria.” Hitler then put him in charge of the\r\nCivil Administration of Austria, while political matters were assigned\r\nto Gauleiter Josef Buerckel, who shortly thereafter was made Reich\r\nCommissar for the Anschluss. (_3425-PS_)\r\n\r\n(10) _Despite Seyss-Inquart’s modesty since arrest and indictment, his\r\nfellow Nazi conspirators recognized the importance of his part in the\r\nAustrian Anschluss._\r\n\r\nGoering made a speech in Vienna on 26 March 1938 in which he said:\r\n\r\n    “At this moment [announcement of the plebiscite in Austria] it\r\n    has been established that now the decision really came. A\r\n    complete unanimity between the Fuehrer and the N. S. confidants\r\n    inside of Austria existed. According to their opinion also the\r\n    hour of action had come, but they thought they could not use any\r\n    more democratic methods in negotiations and they took the law of\r\n    action in their own strong hands and forced the others to\r\n    retreat. If the N. S. rising succeeded so quickly and thoroughly\r\n    without bloodshed, it is first of all due to the intelligent and\r\n    decisive firmness of the present Reichsstatthalter Seyss-Inquart\r\n    and his confidants. But this too proved the correctness of the\r\n    previous continued politics because if our confidants had not\r\n    been in the government, this whole course of events would not\r\n    have been possible.” (_3270-PS_)\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Rainer, Hitler and the general public gave\r\nSeyss-Inquart credit for playing the leading role in the annexation of\r\nAustria by Germany. This is evidenced by the covering letter written by\r\nDr. Rainer, dated 6 July 1939, to Reich Commissar Gauleiter Josef\r\nBuerckel:\r\n\r\n    “We had the impression that the general opinion, perhaps also\r\n    Hitler’s own, was that the liberation depended more upon\r\n    Austrian matters of state rather than the Party. To be more\r\n    exact, Hitler especially mentioned Seyss-Inquart alone; and\r\n    public opinion gave him alone credit for the change and thus\r\n    believed him to have played the sole leading role.” (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn his report to Reich Commissar Buerckel, Dr. Rainer said:\r\n\r\n    “But as a result of the agreement at Berchtesgaden and the\r\n    statement of the Fuehrer made to him during his state visit to\r\n    Berlin, Seyss-Inquart was the personal trustee of the Fuehrer\r\n    and directly responsible to him for the illegal NSDAP in Austria\r\n    within the confines of his political sphere. * * * The seizure\r\n    of power was the work of the party supported by the Fuehrer’s\r\n    threat of invasion and the legal standing of Seyss-Inquart in\r\n    the government.\r\n\r\n    “The national result in the form of the taking over of the\r\n    government by Seyss-Inquart was due to the actual seizure of\r\n    power by the Party on one hand and the political efficiency of\r\n    Dr. Seyss-Inquart in his territory on the other.” (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\nHans Frank recognized the importance of the services rendered by\r\nSeyss-Inquart to the Nazi cause in Austria. When Seyss-Inquart was about\r\nto leave Poland to become Reich commissar of the Occupied Netherlands\r\nTerritories, Frank extolled him as follows:\r\n\r\n    “But your name without that is shining like a light through the\r\n    history of the Third Reich, since you are the creator of the\r\n    National Socialist Austria.” (_3465-PS_)\r\n\r\n(11) _The Nazi conspirators within the German Reich evidenced their\r\nintentions of annexing Austria in many ways._ Hitler, on the first page\r\nof Chapter 1 of _Mein Kampf_, said:\r\n\r\n    “Today it seems to me providential that Fate should have chosen\r\n    Braunau on the Inn as my birthplace. For this little town lies\r\n    on the boundary between two German states which we of the\r\n    younger generation at least have made it our life work to\r\n    reunite by every means at our disposal.\r\n\r\n    “German-Austria must return to the great German Mother Country,\r\n    and not because of any economic considerations. No, and again\r\n    no: even if such a union were unimportant from an economic point\r\n    of view; yes, even if it were harmful, it must nevertheless take\r\n    place. One blood demands one Reich. Never will the German Nation\r\n    possess the moral right to engage in Colonial politics until, at\r\n    least, it embraces its own sons within a single state. Only when\r\n    the Reich borders include the very last German, but can no\r\n    longer guarantee his daily bread, will the moral right to\r\n    acquire foreign soil arise from the distress of our own people.\r\n    Their sword will become our plow, and from the tears of war the\r\n    daily bread of future generations will grow.”\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart devoted his efforts to legalize the sale and circulation\r\nof _Mein Kampf_ in Austria. His letter to Keppler, German Secretary of\r\nState for Austrian Affairs, contained the following passage.\r\n\r\n    “The _Teinfaltstrasse_ is very well informed even if not in\r\n    detail about my efforts regarding the re-permission of the book\r\n    ‘Mein Kampf’.” (_3392-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering and Schacht both told an American diplomat that it was Germany’s\r\ndetermination to annex Austria and Sudetenland to the Reich. (_L-151)_\r\n\r\nOne of the missions of von Papen, as German Ambassador to Austria, was\r\nto effect a change in the personnel of the Austrian Cabinet headed by\r\nChancellor von Schuschnigg and to eliminate anti-Nazi opposition,\r\nparticularly in the Ministry of Interior and Security. (_2246-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe German Reich applied economic pressure upon Austria. One of the\r\nmeans adopted was the law of 24 March 1933, which required payment of\r\n1,000 Reichs Marks by every German crossing the border into Austria\r\n(_3467-PS_). Kurt von Schuschnigg, former Chancellor of Austria, in his\r\naffidavit of 19 November 1945, described this economic pressure upon\r\nAustria by Germany in the following words:\r\n\r\n    “* * * During my tenure of office as Federal Chancellor of\r\n    Austria, more particularly on the 11th day of July, 1936, I\r\n    negotiated with the then existing government of the German\r\n    Reich, and with Adolf Hitler, an Agreement more particularly\r\n    known as the Agreement of 11 July 1936.\r\n\r\n    “I further depose and say that prior to the consummation of the\r\n    aforesaid Agreement, the German Government had placed certain\r\n    economic barriers against trade between Germany and Austria such\r\n    as—to-wit—the 1,000 mark barrier which said barrier provided\r\n    that any German citizen who crosses the border of Germany into\r\n    Austria is obliged to pay to the German Government the sum of\r\n    1,000 German Reichs Marks for the privilege thereof—Austria had\r\n    been accustomed before this edict of the German Government to\r\n    receive into Austria some one hundred thousand visitors from\r\n    Germany annually.\r\n\r\n    “I further state that the aforesaid barrier placed against\r\n    Austria was extremely injurious to Austrian agriculture and\r\n    industrial interests.” (_2994-PS_)\r\n\r\nJodl stated in his diary that in 1938 the aim of German policy was the\r\nelimination of Austria and Czechoslovakia. The will of resistance in\r\nboth countries was undermined by pressure on the government as well as\r\nby propaganda and the fifth column. At the same time German military\r\npreparations for attack were worked out (_1780-PS_). (“Case Otto” was\r\nthe code name for the Austrian campaign, and “Case Green” was the code\r\nname for the battle plans against Czechoslovakia.)\r\n\r\nJodl also stated in his diary that when Chancellor von Schuschnigg\r\nannounced the proposed plebiscite for 13 March 1938, Hitler was\r\ndetermined to intervene. Goering, General Reichenau, and Minister\r\nGlaise-Horstenau were called before Hitler. “Case Otto” was to be\r\nprepared, and the mobilization of army units and air forces was ordered\r\non 10 March 1938. The march into Austria took place on 11 March 1938.\r\n(_1780-PS_).\r\n\r\n(12) _Hitler and the Nazi conspirators completed the annexation of\r\nAustria by decree._ On 11 March 1938 Hitler issued a directive regarding\r\n“Case Otto” addressed to the German armed forces, classified Top Secret,\r\nin which he stated that, if other measures proved useless, his\r\nintentions were to invade Austria with armed force. The directive\r\nprescribed operational duties and assigned objectives. It further\r\nprovided that resistance was to be broken up ruthlessly with armed\r\nforce. (_C-102_)\r\n\r\nLater on that same day, at 8:45 p. m., Hitler issued a second directive,\r\nwhich stated in substance, that the demands of the German ultimatum to\r\nAustria had not been fulfilled, and for that reason the entry of German\r\narmed forces into Austria would commence at daybreak on 12 March 1938.\r\nHe directed that all objectives were to be reached by exerting all\r\nforces to the full as quickly as possible. (_C-182_)\r\n\r\nOn 13 March 1938 Germany in violation of Article 80 of the Treaty of\r\nVersailles, formally incorporated Austria into the Reich by decree and\r\ndeclared it to be a province of the German Reich. (_2307-PS_)\r\n\r\nOfficials of the Province of Austria were then required by decree to\r\ntake an oath of personal obedience to Hitler.

When M. Sidor\r\n    showed hesitation, Herr Buerckel took him on one side and\r\n    explained that Herr Hitler had decided to settle the question of\r\n    Czecho-Slovakia definitely. Slovakia ought, therefore, to\r\n    proclaim her independence because Herr Hitler would otherwise\r\n    disinterest himself in her fate. M. Sidor thanked Herr Buerckel\r\n    for this information, but said that he must discuss the\r\n    situation with the Government at Prague.” (_D-571_)\r\n\r\nHitler expressed his intention to crush Czechoslovakia in the following\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n    “‘At Munich I did not take Bohemia and Moravia into the German\r\n    territorial sphere [“_Lebensraum_”]. I left the Czechs only\r\n    another five months, but for the Slovaks I have some sympathy. I\r\n    approved the Award of Vienna in the conviction that the Slovaks\r\n    would separate themselves from the Czechs and declare their\r\n    independence, which would be under German protection. That is\r\n    why I have refused Hungarian demands in respect of Slovakia. As\r\n    the Slovaks appear to be agreeing with the Czechs it looks as\r\n    though they have not respected the spirit of the Vienna Award.\r\n    This I cannot tolerate. To-morrow at mid-day I shall begin\r\n    military action against the Czechs, which will be carried out by\r\n    General Brauchitsch’ (who was present and to whom he pointed).\r\n    ‘Germany,’ he said, ‘does not intend to take Slovakia into her\r\n    “_Lebensraum_,” and that is why you must either immediately\r\n    proclaim the independence of Slovakia or I will disinterest\r\n    myself in her fate. To make your choice I give you until\r\n    to-morrow mid-day, when the Czechs will be crushed by the German\r\n    steam-roller.’” (_D-571_)\r\n\r\nRibbentrop and von Neurath also participated in the execution of the\r\nNazi plot to obliterate Czechoslovakia as a nation. (_D-571_)\r\n\r\nThe use of pressure, fifth columnists, and propaganda to undermine\r\nresistance in Czechoslovakia, and the preparation of military plans for\r\nthe attack upon that country were all noted by Jodl in his diary.\r\n(_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nBefore the annexation of Austria by Germany Seyss-Inquart was in\r\ncommunication and contact with Konrad Henlein, the leader of the Sudeten\r\nGerman Nazis in Czechoslovakia. On 29 December 1937 Seyss-Inquart wrote\r\na letter to Henlein in encouraging terms and extended his warmest\r\nsympathy and hope for the success of the Sudeten Germans (_3523-PS_).\r\nHenlein thereafter replied in a letter to Seyss-Inquart dated a few days\r\nafter the German annexation of Austria had been accomplished. In this\r\nletter Henlein expressed his pride in the fact that Seyss-Inquart, born\r\na Sudeten German, had fulfilled the task determined by the Fuehrer in\r\nthe most decisive hour of German history. He also thanked Seyss-Inquart\r\nfor the effect and influence the developments in Austria would have in\r\nthe Sudetenland. (_3522-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _SEYSS-INQUART PARTICIPATED IN THE POLITICAL PLANNING AND PREPARATION\r\nOF THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS FOR WARS OF AGGRESSION AND WARS IN VIOLATION OF\r\n INTERNATIONAL TREATIES, AGREEMENTS, AND ASSURANCES SET FORTH IN COUNTS\r\n                    ONE AND TWO OF THE INDICTMENT._\r\n\r\nThe German Reichstag came under the control of the Nazi conspirators\r\nwith the advent of Hitler into the German Government and became a\r\nwilling tool in the hands of Hitler and the conspirators. (See Sections\r\n2, 3, and 4 of chapter VII on the acquisition and consolidation of\r\ntotalitarian political control, and terrorization of political\r\nopponents.)\r\n\r\nThe members of the Reich Cabinet were the accomplices, aiders and\r\nabettors of Hitler and his closest Nazi lieutenants in the political\r\nplanning and preparation for Wars of Aggression and Wars in Violation of\r\nInternational Treaties, Agreements and Assurances. (See section 3 of\r\nchapter XV on the Reich Cabinet.)\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart was a member of the Reichstag and of the Reich Cabinet\r\nbefore the invasion of Poland, and occupied those positions until the\r\nunconditional surrender of Germany. Thus he is equally responsible for\r\nthe acts and decisions of the members of those governmental bodies\r\nconcerning the political planning and preparation of the Nazi\r\nConspirators for Wars of Aggression and Wars in Violation of\r\nInternational Treaties, Agreements and Assurances set forth in Counts\r\nOne and Two of the Indictment. (_2910-PS_)\r\n\r\n    D. _SEYSS-INQUART AUTHORIZED, DIRECTED, AND PARTICIPATED IN THE\r\n    CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AS SET FORTH IN THE INDICTMENT._\r\n\r\n(1) _Austria._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Position and authority of Seyss-Inquart._ Seyss-Inquart was\r\nappointed Reich Governor of Austria by Hitler on 15 March 1938, and was\r\nput in charge of the Civil Administration. Austria had then ceased to\r\nexist as an independent nation and was a province of the German Reich.\r\n(_2910-PS_; _3425-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering, as Delegate for the Four-Year Plan, commissioned Seyss-Inquart,\r\nwho was then _Reichsstatthalter_ in Austria, jointly with the\r\nPlenipotentiary of the Reich, to consider and take any steps necessary\r\nfor the “Aryanization of business and economic life, and to execute this\r\nprocess in accordance with our laws” (Laws of the Reich). (_3460-PS_)\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart participated in the drafting of laws for the sequestration\r\nand confiscation of property of the so-called “enemies of the people and\r\nState.” Evidence of this fact is found in the correspondence between\r\nSeyss-Inquart and Dr. Lammers, Chief of the Reichs Chancellery. On 24\r\nOctober 1938 Seyss-Inquart wrote a letter to Dr. Lammers stating in\r\nsubstance that the law providing for the sequestration and confiscation\r\nof the property of enemies of the State was almost completed and ready\r\nfor the signature of the Fuehrer, and expressing hope that the signature\r\nwould be obtained soon. Dr. Lammers replied to Seyss-Inquart that the\r\ndecree would be issued by the Reichsministerof the Interior, a copy of\r\nwhich had been submitted to Hitler, who had expressed no objections.\r\n(_3448-PS_; _3447-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe power and authority of Seyss-Inquart with respect to the\r\nsequestration and confiscation of the property of “enemies of the State”\r\nstemmed from a decree empowering the _Reichsstatthalter_ in Vienna, or\r\nthe office designated by him, to confiscate property of persons or\r\nsocieties which had promoted efforts inimical to the people of the\r\nState. This decree also attempted to legalize the confiscation of\r\nproperty ordered by the Secret State Police prior to the issuance of the\r\ndecree. (_3450-PS_) This decree appeared to be a secret law, because it\r\nwas not published. Yet its existence as law is evidenced by a letter\r\nwritten to the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police, Himmler,\r\nin January 1939, which shows that the decree was in fact issued on 18\r\nNovember 1938. (_3449-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Murder and illtreatment of civilians._ Seyss-Inquart was aware\r\nthat so-called enemies of the State were imprisoned in concentration\r\ncamps. His knowledge of this matter is evidenced by his claim of credit\r\nfor the transfer of his predecessor—Chancellor of Austria, von\r\nSchuschnigg—from one concentration camp to another in south Germany\r\nwhich was in the path of the armed forces of the United States.\r\n(_3254-PS_)\r\n\r\nOne of the most notorious concentration camps was Mauthausen, located in\r\nAustria and in existence while Seyss-Inquart was the Reich Governor of\r\nthe Province of Austria. As has already been shown, this camp became\r\nnoted as an extermination center. (_2176-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Plunder of public and private property._ Even before the issuance\r\nof the above decree for the sequestration and confiscation of the\r\nproperty of the so-called enemies of the State, Seyss-Inquart wrote a\r\nletter to Hitler indicating that he had come into possession of from 700\r\nto 900 valuable tapestries. Seyss-Inquart offered to display the most\r\nbeautiful pieces so that the Fuehrer might make a selection. In this\r\nsame letter Seyss-Inquart expressed his pride and wonder over the manner\r\nin which Hitler had “solved the Sudeten problem.” (_3391-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhile Seyss-Inquart was Reich Governor of the Province of Austria a\r\nlarge quantity of valuable property, including works of art, belonging\r\nto the so-called enemies of the State, was seized, sequestered, and\r\nconfiscated. A partial list of such property is found in a memorandum\r\nwhich referred to a report of the Reich Fuehrer SS and Chief of the\r\nGerman Police submitted with a letter dated 10 August 1938 and received\r\nin Berlin 26 September 1938. This inventory listed a total of 162 cases\r\nof confiscation, of which 113 cases had a value of some 93,366,358.24\r\nmarks. It is significant that the former owners of this property were\r\nJews and political opponents of the Nazis. (_3446-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Poland._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Position and authority._ Seyss-Inquart was appointed Deputy\r\nGovernor General of the Polish Occupied Territory by Hitler’s decree of\r\n12 October 1939, which also appointed Hans Frank Governor General of the\r\nPolish Occupied Territory. The official title of the government of\r\nPoland under the Nazi conspirators was the “General Government”\r\n(_3147-PS_). Prior to his appointment as Deputy Governor General of the\r\nPolish Occupied Territory from the early part of September 1939 to 12\r\nOctober 1939, Seyss-Inquart was Chief of the Civil Administration of\r\nSouth Poland (_2910-PS_). Seyss-Inquart as Deputy Governor General of\r\nthe Polish Occupied Territory was second only to the Governor General,\r\nFrank. (_2233-CC-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Office of the Governor General of the Polish Occupied\r\nTerritory and the Higher SS and Police Leaders were directly subordinate\r\nto the Governor General and his representative. In turn the leaders of\r\nthe General and Security Police were subordinated to the Higher SS and\r\nPolice Leaders. (_3468-PS_)\r\n\r\nAccording to Hans Frank, Seyss-Inquart organized the General Government\r\nof Poland. When Seyss-Inquart was about to depart to assume his new\r\nduties as Reich Commissar for the Occupied Netherlands, Frank eulogized\r\nSeyss-Inquart as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In the construction of the General-Government, your name will\r\n    forever take a place of honor as originator of this organization\r\n    and State system. I express our thanks, Mr. Reichsminister, for\r\n    your collaboration and for your creative energy in the name of\r\n    all officers, employees, and laborers, of all SS organizations\r\n    and the whole police force of the General-Government, and in the\r\n    name of the District Chiefs, the Gau and city leaders, in the\r\n    name of all otherwise on the order of the Reich and the Fuehrer\r\n    her active persons. * * *” (_3465-PS_)\r\n\r\nDuring November 1939 Seyss-Inquart made a tour of inspection in Poland.\r\nWhile on this tour he gave lectures to the German officials of the\r\nGeneral Government of Poland concerning their duties and German\r\nadministrative policy in that country. He told these officials that the\r\nonly principal aim of that policy was to satisfy the interests of the\r\nReich and that they should promote everything of use to the Reich and\r\nhamper all that might damage the Reich. He instructed the officials that\r\nthe German Government must utilize the General Government of Poland for\r\nGerman economic purposes. (_2278-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Murder and illtreatment of the civilian population of occupied\r\nterritories._ While Seyss-Inquart was on the aforesaid tour of\r\ninspection, a Dr. Lasch, who was a District Governor, reported to\r\nSeyss-Inquart that all criminals found in the penitentiaries were shot.\r\nThe executions, however, were conducted in closed-off wooded areas and\r\nnot in public. (_2278-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn his report concerning his tour of inspection Seyss-Inquart stated\r\nthat the intellectuals of Poland were to a greater part locked up. He\r\nalso passed on the suggestion made by District Governor Schmidt to use\r\nthe “moorish” country around Cychov, Poland, as a reservoir for Jews\r\nbecause this measure might have a decimating effect upon the Jewish\r\npopulation of Poland. (_2278-PS_)\r\n\r\nHans Frank, in his capacity as Governor General of the Polish Occupied\r\nTerritory, made an official report to Hitler in which he stated that, in\r\nthe course of time, the German rule had led to a substantial\r\ndeterioration in the “attitude” of the entire Polish people due to\r\nmalnutrition, mass arrests, mass shootings, and rigorous methods used to\r\nobtain forced labor. In this report it was admitted that before 1939 the\r\nfood supply of the Polish people was quite adequate to sustain them.\r\n(_437-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Plunder of public and private property._ During the aforesaid\r\ntour of inspection Seyss-Inquart ordered the seizure of all soap stocks,\r\nand informed the German officials that the seizure of soap and tea was\r\nto be regarded as most important. In addition he ordered a marshalling\r\nof goods such as oil, salt, manures, etc., in monopolies such as\r\ncooperative societies. He also directed that the Polish unemployment\r\nfund in a considerable amount be diverted to the repair of damaged\r\nbuildings. (_2278-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrank in his report to Hitler stated that there had been a confiscation\r\nof a great part of Polish estates, together with encroachments upon and\r\nconfiscation of the assets of industries, trades, professions, and other\r\nprivate property. (_437-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Conscription of civilian labor._ Seyss-Inquart, as Deputy\r\nGovernor General of the Polish Occupied Territory, attended most staff\r\nmeetings held by Frank, the Governor General. Among the subjects\r\ndiscussed and decided upon at those meetings was the conscription and\r\ndeportation of vast numbers of Polish nationals to the Reich for forced\r\nlabor. Some of these deportees were employed in instruments of war\r\nproduction in violation of Articles 6, 23h, 46, and 52 of the Hague\r\nRegulations 1907, as well as the Prisoner of War Convention (Geneva\r\n1929). On 11 January 1940 one Frauendorfer reported in the presence of\r\nSeyss-Inquart that daily transports, each carrying 1,000 workers, were\r\ngoing to the Reich. Thus Seyss-Inquart aided and abetted in these\r\nviolations. (_2233-B-PS_)\r\n\r\nAccording to Frank approximately 160,000 agricultural workers and 50,000\r\nindustrial workers were conscripted and deported from Poland to the\r\nReich up to and including 21 April 1940. Because the total quota had\r\nbeen fixed at 500,000 and because there were not enough “voluntary\r\nenlistments”, solution to the problem was sought in the use of coercive\r\nmeasures. Seyss-Inquart participated actively in the discussions on this\r\nmatter, and thus aided materially in the solution of the problem.\r\n(_2233-N-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Germanization of occupied territories._ The Nazi government of\r\nthe Polish Occupied Territory was determined to make Poland entirely\r\nGerman. (Evidence of this intention is discussed in Chapter XIII.) In\r\naddition, Frank in his report to Hitler reported that there had been an\r\nexpropriation of property and expulsion of Polish nationals therefrom\r\nfor German settlements in Poland. (_437-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _The Netherlands._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Position and authority of Seyss-Inquart._ Seyss-Inquart was\r\nappointed Reich Commissar for the occupied Netherlands territories by\r\ndecree of Hitler dated 18 May 1940. This decree made Seyss-Inquart\r\n“guardian of the interests of the Reich” and invested him with “supreme\r\ncivil authority.” Seyss-Inquart was made responsible only to Hitler, and\r\nempowered to promulgate laws by decree for the occupied Netherlands\r\nterritories. (_1376-PS_; _2910-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Abrogation and modification of Netherlands legislation not\r\njustified by military necessity._ In his capacity as Reich Commissar of\r\nthe occupied Netherlands territories Seyss-Inquart authorized and\r\ndirected the abrogation or modification of Netherlands legislation not\r\ndemanded or justified by military exigency. This action was in violation\r\nof Article 43 of the Hague Regulations, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe acts abolished included Provincial and Municipal Laws. (_3340-PS_;\r\n_3342-PS_)\r\n\r\nOrdinary criminal laws not in conflict with the permissible objectives\r\nof the occupying power were abrogated, suspended, or radically changed.\r\nAdministrative courts martial were established by decree of\r\nSeyss-Inquart as Reich Commissar which empowered the Leader of the\r\nSuperior SS and the Police and Special Agents appointed by the Reich\r\nCommissar to deviate from existing law. This decree also prescribed\r\nharsh penalties for misdemeanors, extending from 10 years to life\r\nimprisonment, and include the death penalty (i) for participation in\r\n“activities likely to disturb or endanger public order and security” and\r\n(ii) for intentional violation of the orders of the Reich Commissar.\r\n(_2111-PS_)\r\n\r\nExisting marriage laws were amended by Seyss-Inquart so as to require\r\napproval of the Reich Commissar instead of the consent of parent or\r\nguardian in the case of Dutch girls. The statutory waiting period was\r\nalso abolished. Thus, intermarriage of Germans with female persons of\r\nNetherlands nationality were facilitated and promoted. (_3339-PS_)\r\n\r\nExisting legislation concerning Netherlands nationality was modified by\r\nSeyss-Inquart so as to favor Germany. (_3341-PS_)\r\n\r\nAdditional decrees not justified or demanded by the military interests\r\nof the occupant were issued by Seyss-Inquart as Reich Commissar. These\r\ndecrees amended or superseded and distorted existing laws concerning\r\npress, education, social services, corporate life, trade unionism,\r\nmedical care, art, science, and divers phases of the political, social,\r\neconomic, and industrial life of the Netherlands. Some of these\r\nenactments, including the discriminatory decrees against the Jews, are\r\nconsidered in greater detail hereafter. (_1726-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Germanization of Netherlands Territory._ Seyss-Inquart in his\r\ncapacity as Reich Commissar for the occupied Dutch Territory, took\r\naffirmative steps to assimilate the territory under his jurisdiction\r\npolitically, culturally, socially, and economically into the German\r\nReich. This action violated Articles 43, 46, 55, and 56 of the Hague\r\nRegulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles\r\nof criminal law, the internal penal laws of the countries in which such\r\ncrimes were committed, and Article 6 (b) of the Charter.\r\n\r\nThe more offensive crimes in the above category, such as economic\r\nexploitation and enforced conscription are considered in detail\r\nelsewhere in this section. Other “Germanization” measures, such as the\r\ndecrees promoting marriage between German males and female\r\nNetherlanders, and altering citizenship laws in favor of Germany, have\r\nbeen previously adverted to.\r\n\r\nWhen he assumed office on 29 May 1940, Seyss-Inquart said in a speech at\r\nThe Hague:\r\n\r\n    “We neither will oppress this land and its people\r\n    imperialistically nor will we impose on them our political\r\n    convictions. We will bring this about in no other way—only\r\n    through our deportment and our example.” (_3430-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe _bona fides_ of the above statement is belied by a public statement\r\nmade by Seyss-Inquart two years later. In a speech at Hengelo on 19 May\r\n1943 he revealed his true purpose:\r\n\r\n    “Several times it has been held against me that I have let\r\n    national socialism come to the fore in all phases in public\r\n    life. As far as I am concerned that is no reproach, it is a\r\n    historical mission, which I have to fulfill here.” (_3430-PS_)\r\n\r\nFull disclosure of Seyss-Inquart’s intentions and actions with respect\r\nto nazification and exploitation of Holland was made in a Top Secret\r\nreport prepared by him and sent to Berlin covering the situation in the\r\nNetherlands during the period 29 May to 19 July 1940. This report was\r\nforwarded by Lammers of the Reich Chancellery to Rosenberg.\r\nSeyss-Inquart prefaces the report by describing his mission as not\r\nmerely the guarding of Reich interests and maintaining order, but also\r\nthe building of close economic ties between the Netherlands and the\r\nReich. The report catalogues in considerable detail the measures\r\ninitiated by Seyss-Inquart, discusses the building up of the NSDAP in\r\nthe Netherlands, and adverts to the proposed creation of Nazi\r\npara-military and corresponding organizations. It also mentions the\r\nefforts made to bring about an assimilation of interests between Holland\r\nand Germany in the fields of economics and agriculture, culture, art,\r\nand science. The report points out that the allocation of supplies made,\r\nand financial and currency arrangements prescribed, were favorable to\r\nthe Reich; that such transactions were signed by Dutch officials so that\r\nthe “appearance of being voluntary” was preserved. (_997-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Spoliation of property._ In his capacity as Reich Commissar for\r\nthe Occupied Netherlands territory Seyss-Inquart authorized, directed,\r\nand participated in the exploitation of the material resources of the\r\nOccupied Netherlands territory for purposes unrelated to the needs of\r\nthe Army of Occupation. These acts were all in violation of Article 6\r\n(b) of the Charter and Articles 43, 46-49, 52 of the Hague Regulations,\r\n1907.\r\n\r\nThese crimes, for which Seyss-Inquart is responsible not only by virtue\r\nof his position as the dominant civil representative of the Reich\r\nGovernment in the Occupied Netherlands territory but also because of his\r\ndirect participation in the initiation and execution of such criminal\r\npolicies, took the following form:\r\n\r\nControl and exploitation of the Netherlands economy in the interest of\r\nthe German total war effort.\r\n\r\nLevy of excessive occupation charges on the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nExaction of large sums of money and gold as “external occupation costs,”\r\nor “contributions to the war against Bolshevism.”\r\n\r\nRequisitioning of gold and foreign exchange of Dutch nationals for\r\npurposes unrelated to the needs of the occupation army.\r\n\r\nUse of German reichsmarks as currency in the Netherlands for purposes\r\nunrelated to the needs of the occupation army, with compulsory free\r\nexchange of such Reichsmarks for gulden by the Netherlands Bank.\r\n\r\n(Evidence of the foregoing methods of exploitation of the occupied\r\nNetherlands and correlative enrichment of the Reich is discussed in\r\nChapter XIII.)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators were measurably aided in executing the foregoing\r\npolicies in Holland by the cooperation of a local Nazi, Rost van\r\nTonnigen, who was appointed President of the Netherlands Bank and\r\nTreasurer in the Netherlands Ministry of Finance by Seyss-Inquart in the\r\nspring of 1941. The cooperative spirit with which van Tonnigen\r\ndischarged his responsibilities in these posts was disclosed in the\r\nfollowing excerpt from a report of the German Commissar of the\r\nNetherlands Bank:\r\n\r\n    “The new President of the Netherlands Bank, Mr. Rost van\r\n    Tonnigen, is, in contrast to a large part of the leadership,\r\n    penetrated in his movements and his official acts by the greater\r\n    German thought, and convinced of the necessity of the creation\r\n    of a greater European economic space. This ideological attitude\r\n    in itself gives him the correct position on financial and\r\n    monetary policy questions for his country in relation to the\r\n    greater German economic space. Furthermore it makes easier\r\n    cooperation with my office, a fact which deserves special\r\n    mention in consideration of the frequently observed impossible\r\n    conduct of the Netherlands agencies before the entrance into\r\n    office of the new President. I consider as a fortunate solution\r\n    the fact that the Reichskommissar for the Occupied Dutch Areas\r\n    has also entrusted Mr. Rost van Tonnigen with the Treasury of\r\n    the Ministry of Finance [_Schatzamt des Finanzministeriums_].\r\n    Mr. Rost van Tonnigen took over this office at the end of the\r\n    month of April. Thus there is a guarantee that the financial and\r\n    monetary policy of the country will be conducted according to\r\n    unified points of view.” (_ECR-174_; see also\r\n    _Verordnungsblatt_, No. 22, 24 August 1940 (Fourth Order of the\r\n    Reich Commissar for the Occupied Netherlands concerning certain\r\n    Administrative Measures); _Lemkin_, “Axis Rule in Occupied\r\n    Europe,” pp. 455-456.)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the responsibility which attaches to Seyss-Inquart as a\r\nresult of his dominant position in the Netherlands, his appointment of\r\nNazi-minded individuals to key positions, and his complete knowledge of\r\nand acquiescence in illegal Nazi policies, there is conclusive evidence\r\nof his initiation of such policies. In April 1942 “at the instigation of\r\nthe Reich Commissar Seyss-Inquart” the Netherlands began to pay a\r\n“voluntary contribution to the war against Bolshevism” of 50,000,000\r\ngulders per month, retroactive to 1 July 1941, of which ten million per\r\nmonth was paid in gold. (_ECR-195_)\r\n\r\nBy 31 March 1944, this contribution amounted to 2,150,000,000 RM.\r\n(_EC-86_)\r\n\r\nThe alleged “voluntary” character of the contribution is to be taken\r\nwith considerable reserve in view of the admission contained in\r\nSeyss-Inquart’s Top Secret report of 29 May to 19 July 1940, that the\r\nvoluntary nature of previous financial and economic measures was in\r\nreality fictional. (_997-PS_)\r\n\r\nHowever, the question whether or not the contribution is to be deemed at\r\nthe direction of Seyss-Inquart or was in fact “voluntary” is immaterial.\r\nIt is manifest that the then President of the Netherlands Bank and\r\nTreasurer in the Ministry of Finance, van Tonnigen, acted in the German\r\ninterest and to the detriment of the Netherlands. His acts are\r\nattributable to the responsible head of the German Civil Administration\r\nin the Netherlands and the individual to whom he owed his appointment,\r\nSeyss-Inquart.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Participation in activities of Einsatzstab Rosenberg._\r\nSeyss-Inquart, in his capacity as Reich Commissar for the Occupied\r\nNetherlands territory, also cooperated with and acquiesced in the\r\nactivities of the _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_ in the territory under his\r\njurisdiction. He is therefore responsible for his actions in this\r\nregard, which constituted crimes under Article 6 (b) of the Charter and\r\nviolations of Articles 46, 47, and 56 of the Hague Regulations, 1907.\r\n\r\n(The _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_, which commenced as a research library\r\nproject, developed into a systematic program for the wholesale looting\r\nof art treasures and cultural objects in the conquered territories. Its\r\nactivities are discussed in Chapter XIV.)\r\n\r\nImplication of Seyss-Inquart in the criminal activities of the\r\n_Einsatzstab Rosenberg_ is revealed in a detailed progress report of its\r\nchief Netherlands representative, Schimmer. The first paragraph of this\r\nreport states as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Working Group Netherland of the _Einsatzstab Reichsleiter\r\n    Rosenberg_ began its work in agreement with the competent\r\n    representative of the Reichkommissar during the first days of\r\n    September 1940. The execution of the post, conforming with the\r\n    Fuehrer’s orders, coordinated itself with the liquidation, that\r\n    is confiscation, according to civil law, of the various\r\n    subversive institutions—as set forth in the circulars of the\r\n    OKW, dated 5 July 1940, and of the Chief of the OKW to the\r\n    Commander in Chief of the _Wehrmacht_ in France, dated 17\r\n    September 1940, as well as to the Commander in Chief of the OKW\r\n    in the Netherlands, dated 30 October 1940. The screening of the\r\n    material of the various Masonic lodges was taken care of\r\n    primarily, and the library and the archives of the following\r\n    lodges were sifted and all useful material was packed.”\r\n    (_176-PS_)\r\n\r\nThere follows the specification of some 92 Masonic IOOF Lodges and\r\nRotary Clubs which were screened and yielded 470 cases of valuable\r\nobjects. Also, a large number of libraries and scientific and cultural\r\ninstitutions were listed with the statement that all books and archives\r\ncontained therein were being catalogued preparatory to shipment to\r\nGermany. (_176-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe report concludes with the following statement indicating close\r\nintegration in the Netherlands between Rosenberg’s program of grand\r\nlarceny and Seyss-Inquart’s anti-Jewish program, viz:\r\n\r\n    “The Working Group, in executing the afore-mentioned tasks, is\r\n    bound strictly to the pace set by the Reichskommissar for the\r\n    handling of the Jewish questions and that of the international\r\n    organizations. This pace again is determined by the political\r\n    evolution which is taking shape according to decisions made on a\r\n    higher level, and which must not be hampered by individual\r\n    acts.” (_176-PS_)\r\n\r\nOther documents captured from Rosenberg’s files remove any doubt\r\nwhatever as to Seyss-Inquart’s full knowledge of the criminal activities\r\nof the _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_ in Holland and his participation therein.\r\nOn 11 September 1944 Rosenberg informed Seyss-Inquart by letter that\r\norders had been issued for the seizure and transportation to Germany of\r\nthe library of the Social Institute in Amsterdam.

These acts were all in violation of Articles 6 (b) and (c)\r\nof the Charter; Articles 6, 23h, 46, and 52 of the Hague Regulations,\r\n1907 (_3737-PS_); and the Prisoner of War Convention, Geneva, 1929.\r\n(_3738-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe deportation program in the Netherlands was initiated on 20 June\r\n1940, five weeks after the occupation of that country. The Germans at\r\nfirst deported only the unemployed, threatening them with curtailment of\r\ntheir dole for refusal. Thereafter in 1942 measures were taken to draft\r\nemployed workmen. Dutch business concerns were combed in\r\n“Sauckel-actions” for available workers, who were forced to register at\r\nthe labor offices. Workmen who refused were prosecuted by the SD,\r\ncommitted to one of the prisoners’ camps in the Netherlands, and\r\neventually put to work in Germany. By the end of April 1942 the program\r\nwas in full operation, and not less than 22,000 workers were deported\r\nthat month. Many Belgian concerns not considered essential were closed\r\ndown to release manpower for deportation to Germany or for work in Dutch\r\nindustries deemed essential to the German war effort. New measures of a\r\ndrastic nature were inaugurated in the spring of 1943. All males between\r\n18 and 35 were forced to register for “_arbeitseinsatz_” (war effort),\r\nwhich was synonymous with deportation. As time elapsed and the German\r\nmilitary situation deteriorated, the measures taken became increasingly\r\nmore ruthless. Whole sections of a town were lined off and people were\r\nseized in the streets or in their homes and transported to Germany. A\r\ntotal of approximately 431,500 Netherlands workers were deported to\r\nGermany and other foreign countries. (_1726-PS_)\r\n\r\nIllustrative of the participation of Seyss-Inquart in the slave labor\r\nprogram are four proclamations which he caused to be issued, calling up\r\nDutch civilians between certain ages for forced labor and threatening\r\nthem with shooting in the case of noncompliance. (_1162-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel, General Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor, on 5\r\nOctober 1945 disclosed, under oath, the part played by Seyss-Inquart in\r\nthe forced recruitment of Dutch workers for German war production. The\r\nfollowing is an excerpt from an interrogation of Sauckel:\r\n\r\n    “Q. For a moment I want to turn our attention to Holland. It is\r\n    my understanding that the quotas for the workers for Holland\r\n    were agreed upon, and then the numbers given to the\r\n    Reichskommissar Seyss-Inquart to fulfill. Isn’t that correct?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes, that is correct.\r\n\r\n    “Q. After the quota was given to Seyss-Inquart, it was his\r\n    mission to fulfill it with the aid of your representatives, was\r\n    it not?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes. This was the only possible thing for me to do and the\r\n    same applied to the other countries.” (_3722-PS_)\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart has himself acknowledged under oath his active\r\nparticipation in deporting 250,000 Netherlands workmen between the ages\r\nof 17 and 42 toward the end of 1944, although he attempted to shift\r\nresponsibility by stating that the order was issued by the _Wehrmacht_\r\nand that “I can’t intervene against the _Wehrmacht_.” However, he\r\nadmitted:\r\n\r\n    “I didn’t oppose it. I helped to carry it out in my province.”\r\n    (_Transcript of Interrogation of Seyss-Inquart_, afternoon\r\n    session, 18 September 1945, pp. 19-20.)\r\n\r\n(_g_) _Murder and ill-treatment of civilian population, including\r\nkilling of hostages._ Seyss-Inquart, in his capacity as Reich Commissar\r\nfor the Occupied Netherlands Territory, authorized and directed the\r\nexaction of collective penalties, murder, and ill-treatment of the\r\ncivilian population of the Netherlands, and the killing of hostages. All\r\nthese actions constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity within\r\nthe meaning of Article 6 (b) and (c) of the Charter, and violated (i)\r\nthe Hague Regulations, 1907, Articles 46 and 50, (ii) the laws and\r\ncustoms of war, (iii) the general principles of criminal law as derived\r\nfrom the criminal laws of all civilized nations and (iv) the internal\r\npenal laws of Netherlands.\r\n\r\nPublic utterances of Seyss-Inquart reveal his determination to resort to\r\nruthless measures for the purpose of intimidating and repressing the\r\ncivilian population. In a speech commemorating the 10th Anniversary of\r\nGermany’s coming into power, at Weert on 29 January 1943, before workers\r\nand trades of the NSDAP, he spoke in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I will give my instructions. They must be executed by all. In\r\n    the present situation a refusal to execute such instructions\r\n    could be regarded only as sabotage. It is also clear, now more\r\n    than ever, that every resistance which is directed against this\r\n    fight for existence must be suppressed. Some time ago the\r\n    representatives of the churches had written to the _Wehrmacht_\r\n    commander and to me, and they presented their conception against\r\n    the execution of death sentences which the Wehrmacht commanders\r\n    announced in the meantime. To this I can only say the following:\r\n    The moment in which our men, fathers and sons with iron\r\n    determination look towards their fate in the east and\r\n    unflinchingly and steadfastly perform their highest pledge, it\r\n    is unbearable to tolerate conspiracies whose goal is to weaken\r\n    the rear of this eastern front. Whoever dares this must be\r\n    annihilated. We must be severe and become even more severe\r\n    against our opponents, this is the command of a relentless\r\n    sequence of events, and for us perhaps humanly hard, but our\r\n    holy duty. We remain human because we do not torture our\r\n    opponents, we must remain firm by annihilating them.”\r\n    (_3430-PS_)\r\n\r\nEndorsement of the policy of holding innocent persons responsible for\r\nthe misconduct of others beyond their control is implicit in the\r\nfollowing public statement of Seyss-Inquart made at Weert on 8 January\r\n1945:\r\n\r\n    “I have given orders to suppress all appearances with a\r\n    severeness corresponding to the brutality of the crime. If in\r\n    connection with these measures Dutch citizens are affected and\r\n    have to undergo difficulties and limitations of special nature,\r\n    then they have to seek the cause therefor solely in these\r\n    eruptions of the anarchistic mental attitude of a few culprits\r\n    and the just-as-criminal-tolerance or apathy within their own\r\n    circles.” (_3430-PS_)\r\n\r\nEvidence of Seyss-Inquart’s application of this doctrine of vicarious\r\nresponsibility is contained in a poster signed by him and warning the\r\nDutch population to expect reprisals in the event of sabotage. The\r\nposter reads as follows:\r\n\r\n                                “NOTICE\r\n\r\n    “I consider all inhabitants responsible for the destruction or\r\n    damage to railroad installations, waterways with their\r\n    installations, telephone cables and Post Offices occurring\r\n    within the boundaries of their locality.\r\n\r\n    “The population of such localities may therefore expect\r\n    reprisals in the form of seizure of property and destruction of\r\n    houses or groups of houses.\r\n\r\n    “I therefore advise the population to protect the means of\r\n    transportation and communications by means of patrols or other\r\n    appropriate measures.\r\n\r\n                          “The Hague 24 Sept 1944\r\n                          “/s/ Seyss-Inquart\r\n                          “The Reich Commissar for the\r\n                          Occupied Netherlands Territories.” (_1163-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother poster issued by the Superior SS and Police Chief publicized\r\nwith remarkable candor the fact that 12 Netherlanders were executed\r\n“independent of further investigation” as reprisals for the killing of\r\ntwo Germans. That poster reads as follows:\r\n\r\n                                “NOTICE\r\n\r\n    “The Superior SS and Police Chief gives notice that on 20\r\n    November 1944 Schutzgruppenmann Janssen and on 13 December 1944\r\n    the Senior Officer Candidate Guse were shot in the back by\r\n    criminal Netherlands elements. Both were robbed of their\r\n    pistols.\r\n\r\n    “Independent of further investigation of the perpetrators, two\r\n    houses were blasted and 12 Netherlanders were executed at the\r\n    place of one of the crimes as reprisals.\r\n\r\n                               “The Hague, 16 Dec 1944.” (_1163-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn an interrogation under oath Seyss-Inquart has acknowledged that\r\nNetherlanders were shot as hostages without trial. While he sought to\r\nshift responsibility to the SS he admitted that upon one occasion the SS\r\ncalled on him to furnish 50 hostages and that he gave five instead, all\r\nof whom were shot. (_Transcript of Interrogation of Seyss-Inquart_, 18\r\nSeptember 1945, p. 20)\r\n\r\nOther crimes against humanity are documented in the statement of the\r\nDutch Government. The vastness of the scale of the commission of such\r\ncrimes and the necessary notoriety thereof clearly implicate\r\nSeyss-Inquart as the responsible civil head of the German Government in\r\nthe Netherlands territory. (_1726-PS_)\r\n\r\n   E. _SEYSS-INQUART PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMES\r\n           AGAINST HUMANITY AS SET FORTH IN THE INDICTMENT._\r\n\r\n(1) _Austria._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Persecution of the Jews._ While Seyss-Inquart was the Reich\r\nGovernor of the Province of Austria, laws were issued against Jews and\r\nagainst those who opposed the Nazi Regime politically. As has been\r\nshown, this usually took the form of decrees providing for the\r\nsequestration and confiscation of the property of these so-called\r\n“enemies of the State.”\r\n\r\nIn the early days of November 1938, pogroms against the Jews took place\r\nall over the German Reich, including Austria. These pogroms resulted\r\nfrom the killing of von Rath, a diplomatic official at the German\r\nEmbassy in Paris, by a young Jew named Grynszpan. Jewish synagogues,\r\nhomes and shops were smashed and destroyed by fire. Large numbers of\r\nJews were arrested, jailed, or placed in concentration camps. A partial\r\nreport as to what occurred during the 9th and 10th of November 1938 is\r\nfound in a letter written by the Reich Commissar for the Reunion of\r\nAustria with the German Reich, Josef Buerckel, to Goering, dated 18\r\nNovember 1938. This report reveals that the fire department was not\r\nutilized to control the flames consuming Jewish homes, stores, shops,\r\nand synagogues. The school children in Vienna were given an opportunity\r\nto participate in the demonstration “according to the order.” Buerckel’s\r\nreport also discloses that enormous quantities of valuables, jewelry,\r\nand merchandise were stolen from the Jews during these pogroms.\r\n(_2237-PS_)\r\n\r\nA more detailed description of what happened in Vienna during the 9th\r\nand 10th of November 1938 is found in the stenographic report of a\r\nmeeting on “The Jewish Question” under the Chairmanship of Goering\r\n(_1816-PS_). This meeting was held on 12 November 1938. It appears from\r\nthis report that altogether 101 synagogues were destroyed by fire, 76\r\nsynagogues demolished, and 7,500 stores ruined in the Reich, including\r\nAustria. In this same meeting, a member of the official family of\r\nSeyss-Inquart (Reich Governor of the Province of Austria) related the\r\nefficiency with which the Civil Administration in Austria dealt with the\r\nso-called “Jewish Question.” This official was Fischboeck, and in his\r\nverbal report to Goering he said:\r\n\r\n    “Your Excellency,\r\n\r\n    “In this matter we have already a very complete plan for\r\n    Austria. There are 12,000 Jewish artisans and 5,000 Jewish\r\n    retail shops in Vienna. Before the National Revolution, we had\r\n    already a definite plan for tradesmen, regarding this total of\r\n    17,000 stores. Of the shops of the 12,000 artisans about 10,000\r\n    were to be closed indefinitely and 2,000 were to be kept open.\r\n    4,000 of the 5,000 retail stores should be closed and 1,000\r\n    should be kept open, that is, were to be Aryanized. According to\r\n    this plan, between 3,000 and 3,500 of the total of 17,000 stores\r\n    would be kept open, all others closed. This was decided\r\n    following investigations in every single branch and according to\r\n    local needs, in agreement with all competent authorities, and is\r\n    ready for publication as soon as we receive the law which we\r\n    requested in September; this law shall empower us to withdraw\r\n    licenses from artisans quite independently from the Jewish\r\n    Question.” (_1816-PS_)\r\n\r\nTo this Goering replied:\r\n\r\n    “I shall have this decree issued today.” (_1816-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe stenographic report of this meeting further reveals that the\r\nsolution of the so-called “Jewish Problem” adopted in Austria by\r\nSeyss-Inquart and his official family was most efficient from the\r\nviewpoint of Nazi objectives. The plan adopted in Austria became a model\r\nfor the entire Reich. (_1816-PS_)\r\n\r\nA report of the Bureau of Statistics for the Provinces of Austria on the\r\nJewish population in Vienna and in Austria, dated 15 December 1939,\r\nshows that after the Nazi conspirators assumed power in Austria, the\r\nJewish population in that country decreased approximately 100,000.\r\n(_1949-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhile the reasons for the decreases in the Jewish population of Austria\r\nwould seem to be obvious, yet tangible evidence of at least one reason\r\nis provided by Seyss-Inquart himself in a letter written by him to\r\nHimmler, dated 4 November 1939. In substance Seyss-Inquart, while Deputy\r\nGovernor General of the Polish Occupied Territory, stated that an\r\nofficial in Cracow had informed him that there was a plan to send Jews\r\nfrom Vienna to Poland, whereupon he gave instructions that such action\r\nshould be carried out only in cooperation with the SD and by the SD,\r\nsince he would not permit wild-cat actions. (_3398-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Persecution on political grounds._ Seyss-Inquart has supplied\r\nevidence that the SS in Austria was responsible for the murder of\r\nChancellor Dolfuss on 25 July 1934. (_3425-PS_)\r\n\r\nSeyss-Inquart has also supplied evidence that his predecessor as\r\nChancellor of Austria, von Schuschnigg, had been confined in a\r\nconcentration camp after his forced resignation from office. (_3254-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Poland._ The manner is which Polish Jews were treated and given\r\n“special handling” by the Nazi conspirators, although a matter of common\r\nknowledge, was described in detail in the “Black Book of Poland.” This\r\ndocument tells of the establishment of special reservations for the Jews\r\nas well as ghettos in various parts of Poland. The report also relates\r\nhow the Jews were starved and exterminated in large numbers. A great\r\nportion of these crimes were committed in Poland by the Nazis while\r\nSeyss-Inquart occupied the position of Deputy Governor General of the\r\nPolish Occupied Territory. (_2613-PS_)\r\n\r\nDuring the time that Seyss-Inquart held this high office in the Nazi\r\ngovernment of Poland, a special decree was issued by Frank, dated 26\r\nOctober 1939, which required compulsory labor for Jews domiciled in the\r\nGeneral Government of Poland. The decree was to take effect immediately\r\nand the Jews were to be formed in forced labor groups. The execution of\r\nthe decree was placed in the hands of the Higher SS and Police Leaders.\r\n(_2613-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _The Netherlands._ Seyss-Inquart, in his capacity as Reich Commissar\r\nof the occupied Dutch territory, bears full individual responsibility\r\nfor the execution in the Netherlands of the Nazi program of persecution\r\nof Jews. Acts against the Jews authorized, directed, or condoned by\r\nSeyss-Inquart, which constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity\r\nas defined in Article 6 (b) and (c) of the Charter, included:\r\nstigmatization; disfranchisement; denial of civil rights, personal\r\nliberty, and economic freedom; religious and cultural persecution; use\r\nof organized “spontaneous violence” against persons and property of\r\nJews; ghettoization; starvation; enforced labor; enslavement; mass\r\ndeportation, and annihilation.\r\n\r\nThe intentions of Seyss-Inquart with respect to treatment of the Jews is\r\na matter of record. In a speech before a gathering of all workers and\r\ntrades of the NSDAP at Amsterdam on 13 March 1941 he left no doubt as to\r\nwhere he stood on the Jewish question. He said:\r\n\r\n    “The Jews are the enemy of national socialism and the national\r\n    socialistic Reich. From the moment of their emancipation, their\r\n    methods were directed to the annihilation of the common and\r\n    moral worth of the German people and to replace national and\r\n    responsible ideology with international nihilism. The fatal\r\n    meaning of Judaism became completely clear to the German people\r\n    during the years of the world war. It was really they, who stuck\r\n    the knife in the back of the German army which broke the\r\n    resistance of the Germans, and in the year 1918, it was they who\r\n    wanted to dissolve and decompose all national tradition and also\r\n    moral and religious beliefs of the German people. The Jews for\r\n    us are not Dutchmen. They are those enemies with whom we can\r\n    neither come to an armistice nor to peace. This applies here, if\r\n    you wish, for the duration of the occupation. Do not expect an\r\n    order from me which stipulates this, except regulations\r\n    concerning police matters. We will beat the Jews wherever we\r\n    meet them, and those who join them must bear the consequences.\r\n    The Fuehrer declared that the Jews have played their final act\r\n    in Europe, and therefore they played their final act.”\r\n    (_3430-PS_)\r\n\r\nFollowing his assumption of office in the Netherlands on 29 May 1940,\r\nSeyss-Inquart, pursuant to the authority vested in him as Reich\r\nCommissar Of the Netherlands by the Fuehrer decree of 18 May 1940,\r\nsystematically promulgated decrees designed to implement the Nazi\r\nprogram of persecution and elimination of Jews. He promulgated a law\r\nwhich prohibited the Jewish ritual slaughter of animals in the\r\nNetherlands Occupied Territories, thus making it impossible for devout\r\northodox Jews to live in accordance with their religious dietary laws.\r\n(_2705-PS_)\r\n\r\nOther anti-Semitic decrees of a like nature, all of which were signed by\r\nSeyss-Inquart and published in the _Verordnungsblatt fuer die besetzen\r\nniederlandischen Gebiete_ (VOBL), may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n_Publication Date and No.             _Summary of Subject Matter_\r\n        of VOBL_\r\n_3333-PS,                    Order to register all businesses belonging to\r\nVerordnungsblatt_, No.       Jews, joint stock corporations including\r\n33, p. 546, 26 Oct 1940.     either one Jewish partner or one Jewish\r\n                             member in their Board of Directors, or those\r\n                             of which more than 25% of the capital stock\r\n                             belong to Jews or those in which half of all\r\n                             votes are to be exercised by Jews, or in\r\n                             general, businesses which in fact are placed\r\n                             under predominatingly Jewish influence.\r\n                             Section 4 defines the quality of a Jew.\r\n                             Property situated abroad is to be embodied in\r\n                             the declaration of registration.

CONSTANTIN VON NEURATH\r\n\r\n             A. _POSITIONS AND HONORS HELD BY VON NEURATH._\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the Nazi Party from 30 January 1937 until 1945, and\r\nwas awarded the Golden Party Badge on 30 January 1937.\r\n\r\nHe was General in the SS. He was personally appointed _Gruppenfuehrer_\r\nby Hitler in September 1937, and was promoted to _Obergruppenfuehrer_ on\r\n21 June 1943.\r\n\r\nHe was Reich Minister of Foreign Affairs under the Chancellorship of von\r\nPapen from 2 June 1932, and under the Chancellorship of Hitler from 30\r\nJanuary 1933 until he was replaced by von Ribbentrop on 4 February 1938.\r\n\r\nHe was Reich Minister from 4 February 1938 until May 1945.\r\n\r\nHe was President of the Secret Cabinet Council, to which he was\r\nappointed on 4 February 1938.\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the Reich Defense Council.\r\n\r\nHe was Reichs Protector for Bohemia and Moravia from 18 March 1939 until\r\nhe was replaced by Frick on 25 August 1943.\r\n\r\nHe was awarded the _Adlerorden_ by Hitler at the time of his appointment\r\nas Reich Protector. Ribbentrop was the only other German to receive this\r\ndecoration.\r\n\r\nThese facts are collected in a document signed by von Neurath and his\r\ncounsel (_2972-PS_). Von Neurath comments on certain of these matters.\r\nHe says that the award of the Golden Party Badge was made on 30 January\r\n1937 against his will and without his being asked. Yet he not only\r\nrefrained from repudiating the allegedly unwanted honor, but after\r\nreceiving it attended meetings at which wars of aggression were planned,\r\nactively participated in the forcible annexation of Austria, and\r\ntyrannized over Bohemia and Moravia.\r\n\r\nHe also contends that his appointment as SS _Gruppenfuehrer_ was also\r\nagainst his will and without his being asked. But in this connection,\r\nhis wearing of the SS uniform, his receipt of the further promotion to\r\n_Obergruppenfuehrer_, and the actions against Bohemia and Moravia must\r\nbe considered. In addition, von Neurath says that his appointment as\r\nForeign Minister was by Reichspresident von Hindenburg. Yet President\r\nvon Hindenburg died in 1934, and von Neurath continued as Foreign\r\nMinister until 1938, under the chancellorship first of von Papen and\r\nthen of Hitler. He further claims that he was an inactive Minister from\r\n4 February 1938 until May 1945. His activities in this connection will\r\nbe mentioned below, particularly with regard to Bohemia and Moravia.\r\n\r\nVon Neurath next alleges that the Secret Cabinet Council never sat or\r\nconferred. This Council, of which von Neurath was president, has been\r\nauthoritatively described as a select committee of the Cabinet for the\r\ndeliberation of foreign affairs, directly subordinated to the Fuehrer\r\nfor counsel and assistance (_1774-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “A Privy Cabinet Council, to advise the Fuehrer in the basic\r\n    problems of foreign policy, has been created by the decree of 4\r\n    February 1938 * * * This Privy Cabinet Council is under the\r\n    direction of Reich-Minister v. Neurath, and includes the Foreign\r\n    Minister, the Air Minister, the Deputy Commander for the\r\n    Fuehrer, the Propaganda Minister, the Chief of the\r\n    Reich-Chancellery, the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army and Navy\r\n    and the Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces. The\r\n    Privy Cabinet Council constitutes a select staff of\r\n    collaborators of the Fuehrer which consists exclusively of\r\n    members of the Government of the Reich; thus, it represents a\r\n    select committee of the Reich Government for the deliberation on\r\n    foreign affairs.” (_1774-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe formal composition of this body is shown in 2031-PS. Von Neurath\r\nheld himself out as a member of this body by communicating with the\r\nBritish Ambassador on Secret Cabinet Council stationery. (_3287-PS_)\r\n\r\nVon Neurath, finally, objects that he was not a member of the Reich\r\nDefense Council. This Council was set up soon after Hitler’s accession\r\nto power, on 4 April 1933 (_2261-PS_). In an affidavit by Frick\r\n(_2986-PS_), this Council is described as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * We were also members of the Reich Defense Council, which\r\n    was supposed to plan preparations in case of war which later on\r\n    were published by the Ministerial Council for the Defense of the\r\n    Reich.” (_2986-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe membership of this Council included the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, who was then von Neurath. This is shown by a document giving\r\nthe composition of the Reich Defense Council, and including among\r\npermanent members the Minister for Foreign Affairs (_EC-177_). That\r\ndocument is dated “Berlin, 22 May 1933,” which was during von Neurath’s\r\ntenure of that office.\r\n\r\nThe functioning of the Reich Defense Council, with a representative of\r\nvon Neurath’s ministry, von Buelow, present, is shown by the minutes of\r\nthe 12th meeting on 14 May 1936 (_EC-407_). Under the secret law of 4\r\nSeptember 1938 von Neurath was a member of the Reich Defense Council by\r\nvirtue of his presidency of the Secret Cabinet Council. This fact is\r\nshown by the enclosure of a copy of that law in a letter addressed to\r\nvon Neurath as Reich Protector for Bohemia and Moravia on 6 September\r\n1939 (_2194-PS_). It is curious that the Reich Protector for Bohemia and\r\nMoravia denies his membership in the Council when the letter enclosing\r\nthe law is one addressed to him. This law describes the tasks of the\r\nCouncil as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The task of the Reich Defense Council consists, in peace-time,\r\n    of the decision on all measures for the preparation of Reich\r\n    defense, and the gathering together of all forces and means of\r\n    the nation according to the directions of the Leaders and Reich\r\n    Chancellor. The tasks of the Council in wartime will be\r\n    especially determined by the Leader and Reich Chancellor.”\r\n    (_2194-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe law also lists the permanent members of the Council, and the seventh\r\none is the President of the Secret Cabinet Council, who was von Neurath.\r\n\r\n B. _VON NEURATH’S PART, AS FOREIGN MINISTER, IN THE CONSPIRACY FOR THE\r\n                     BREACH OF TREATY OBLIGATIONS._\r\n\r\nIn assuming the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs in Hitler’s\r\nCabinet, von Neurath assumed charge of a foreign policy committed to\r\nbreach of treaties.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi Party had repeatedly and for many years made known its\r\nintention to overthrow Germany’s international commitments, even at the\r\nrisk of war. Sections 1 and 2 of the Party Program (_1708-PS_), which\r\nwas published year after year, declared:\r\n\r\n    “1. We demand the unification of all Germans in the Greater\r\n    Germany on the basis of the right of self-determination of\r\n    peoples.\r\n\r\n    “2. We demand equality of rights for the German people in\r\n    respect to the other nations; abrogation of the peace treaties\r\n    of Versailles and St. Germain.” (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn even clearer statement of these goals is contained in Hitler’s speech\r\nat Munich on 15 March 1939, in which he said:\r\n\r\n    “My foreign policy had identical aims. My program was to abolish\r\n    the Treaty of Versailles. It is futile nonsense for the rest of\r\n    the world to pretend today that I did not reveal this program\r\n    until 1933 or 1935 or 1937. Instead of listening to this foolish\r\n    chatter of emigres, these gentlemen would have been wiser to\r\n    read what I have written thousands of times.” (_2771-PS_)\r\n\r\nIf it is “futile nonsense” for foreigners to raise that point, it would\r\nbe still more futile for Hitler’s Foreign Minister to suggest that he\r\nwas ignorant of the aggressive designs of Nazi policy. The acceptance of\r\nforce as a means of solving international problems and achieving the\r\nobjectives of Hitler’s foreign policy must have been known to anyone as\r\nclosely in touch with Hitler as was von Neurath. This doctrine, for\r\nexample, is constantly reiterated in _Mein Kampf_ (_D-660_). (See\r\nSection 6 of Chapter IX on Aggression as a Basic Nazi Idea.)\r\n\r\nHence, by the acceptance and implementation of this foreign policy, von\r\nNeurath assisted and promoted the realization of the illegal aims of the\r\nNazi Party.\r\n\r\n   C. _VON NEURATH’S PART, AS FOREIGN MINISTER, IN THE CONSPIRACY TO\r\n  CONSOLIDATE NAZI CONTROL OVER GERMANY IN PREPARATION FOR AGGRESSIVE\r\n                                 WAR._\r\n\r\nIn his capacity as Minister of Foreign Affairs von Neurath directed the\r\ninternational aspects of the first phase of the Nazi conspiracy, the\r\nconsolidation of control in preparation for war.\r\n\r\nFrom his close connection with Hitler von Neurath must have known the\r\ncardinal points of Hitler’s policy leading up to the outbreak of World\r\nWar II, as outlined in retrospect by Hitler in his speech to his\r\nmilitary leaders on 23 November 1939 (_789-PS_). This policy had two\r\nfacets: internally, the establishment of rigid control; externally, the\r\nprogram to release Germany from its international commitments. The\r\nexternal program had four points:\r\n\r\n    1. Secession from the disarmament conference;\r\n\r\n    2. The order to re-arm Germany;\r\n\r\n    3. The introduction of compulsory military service; and\r\n\r\n    4. The remilitarization of the Rhineland.\r\n\r\nThese points were set out in Hitler’s address of 23 November 1939, after\r\nthe invasion of Poland:\r\n\r\n    “* * * I had to reorganize everything beginning with the mass of\r\n    the people and extending it to the armed forces. First,\r\n    reorganization of the interior, abolishment of appearance of\r\n    decay and defeatist ideas, education to heroism. While\r\n    reorganizing the interior, I undertook the second task, to\r\n    release Germany from its international ties. Two particular\r\n    characteristics are to be pointed out: secession from the League\r\n    of Nations and denunciation of the disarmament conference. It\r\n    was a hard decision. The number of prophets who predicted that\r\n    it would lead to the occupation of the Rhineland was large, the\r\n    number of believers was very small. I was supported by the\r\n    nation, which stood firmly behind me, when I carried out my\r\n    intentions. After that, the order for rearmament. Here again\r\n    there were numerous prophets who predicted misfortunes, and only\r\n    a few believers. In 1935 the introduction of compulsory armed\r\n    service. After that, militarization of the Rhineland, again a\r\n    process believed to be impossible at that time. The number of\r\n    people who would trust in me were very small. Then the beginning\r\n    of the fortification of the whole country, especially in the\r\n    West.” (_789-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler thus summarized his pre-war foreign policy in four points. Von\r\nNeurath participated directly and personally in accomplishing each of\r\nthese four points, at the same time officially proclaiming that these\r\nmeasures did not constitute steps toward aggression. The first is a\r\nmatter of history. When Germany left the disarmament conference von\r\nNeurath sent telegrams, dated 14th October 1933, to the President of the\r\nConference announcing Germany’s withdrawal (Documents of German\r\nPolitics, 1933, vol. I, p. 94). Similarly, von Neurath made the\r\nannouncement of Germany’s withdrawal from the League of Nations on 21\r\nOctober 1933. (Documents of German Politics, 1933, vol. I). At the same\r\ntime, the German government was undertaking far-reaching military\r\npreparation (_C-140_; _C-153_).\r\n\r\nThe second point regarding German rearmament: When von Neurath was\r\nForeign Minister, on 10 March 1935, the German Government officially\r\nannounced the establishment of the German air force (_TC-44_). On 21 May\r\n1935, Hitler announced a purported unilateral repudiation of the Naval,\r\nMilitary, and Air clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty for\r\nthe Restoration of Friendly Relations with the United States\r\n(_2288-PS_). On the same day the Reich Cabinet, of which von Neurath was\r\na member, enacted the secret Reich Defense Law creating the office of\r\nPlenipotentiary General for War Economy (_2261-PS_), afterwards\r\ndescribed by the _Wehrmacht_ armament expert as “the cornerstone of\r\nGerman rearmament” (_2353-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The latter orders were decreed in the Reich defense law of 21\r\n    May 1935, which was supposed to be published only in case of\r\n    war, and was already declared valid for carrying out war\r\n    preparations. As this law fixed the duties of the armed forces\r\n    and the other Reich authorities in case of war, it was also the\r\n    fundamental ruling for the development and activity of the war\r\n    economy organization.” (_2353-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe third point is the introduction of compulsory military service. On\r\n16 March 1935 von Neurath signed the law for the organization of the\r\narmed forces, which provided for universal military service and\r\nanticipated a vastly expanded German army (_Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1935, I,\r\np. 369) (_1654-PS_). This was described by Keitel as the real start of\r\nthe large-scale rearmament program which followed.\r\n\r\nThe fourth point was the remilitarization of the Rhineland. The\r\nRhineland was reoccupied on 7 March 1936. This action was announced by\r\nHitler (_2289-PS_), who had also previously given the order for\r\n“Operation Schulung,” directing the military action which was to be\r\ntaken if necessary (_C-139_). These were acts for which von Neurath\r\nshared responsibility from his position and from the steps which he\r\ntook. Some time later he summed up his views on the actions detailed\r\nabove in a speech to Germans abroad, on 29 August 1937:\r\n\r\n    “The unity of the racial and national will created through\r\n    Nazism with unprecedented elan has made possible a foreign\r\n    policy through which the bonds of the Versailles Treaty were\r\n    slashed, freedom to arm regained, and the sovereignty of the\r\n    whole nation reestablished. We have again become master in our\r\n    own home, and we have produced the means of power to remain\r\n    henceforth that way for all times. The world should notice from\r\n    Hitler’s deeds and words that his aims are not aggressive war.”\r\n    (_D-449_)\r\n\r\nD. _VON NEURATH’S PART, AS FOREIGN MINISTER AND ADVISOR TO THE FUEHRER,\r\n                IN THE PLANNING OF WARS OF AGGRESSION._\r\n\r\nBoth as Minister of Foreign Affairs and as one of the inner circle of\r\nthe Fuehrer’s advisors on foreign political matters, von Neurath\r\nparticipated in the political planning and preparation for acts of\r\naggression against Austria, Czechoslovakia, and other nations.\r\n\r\n(1) _The von Neurath technique._ If von Neurath’s policy may be\r\ndescribed in a sentence it may be summarized as breaking one treaty only\r\nat a time. He himself put it slightly more pompously but to the same\r\neffect in a speech before the Academy of German Law on 30 October 1937:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Out of the acknowledgment of these elementary facts the\r\n    Reich Cabinet has always interceded in favor of treating every\r\n    concrete international problem within methods especially suited\r\n    for it, not to complicate it unnecessarily by amalgamation with\r\n    other problems, and as long as problems between only two powers\r\n    are concerned to choose the way for an immediate understanding\r\n    between these two powers. We are in a position to state that\r\n    this method has fully proved itself good not only in the German\r\n    interest, but also in the general interest.” (_D-471_)\r\n\r\nThe only countries whose interests von Neurath failed to mention in that\r\nspeech are the other parties to the various treaties that were dealt\r\nwith in that way. The working out of that policy can be seen from a\r\nbrief summary of the actions of von Neurath when he was Foreign\r\nMinister, and those of his immediate successor when von Neurath still\r\npurported to have influence.\r\n\r\nIn 1935 action was directed against the Western Powers, in the form of\r\nthe rearmament of Germany. When that was going on another country had to\r\nbe reassured. At that time it was Austria, which still had—up to\r\n1935—the support of Italy. Hence, the fraudulent and clearly false\r\nassurance, the essence of the technique in that case, given by Hitler,\r\non 21 May 1935. (_TC-26_)\r\n\r\nThen, in 1936, action was again taken against the Western Powers in the\r\noccupation of the Rhineland. Another fraudulent assurance was made to\r\nAustria in the Treaty of 11 July of that year, (_TC-22_) the deceitful\r\nnature of which is shown by letters from von Papen. (_2246-PS_;\r\n_2247-PS_)\r\n\r\nThen, in 1937 and 1938, the Nazis moved on a step and action was\r\ndirected against Austria. That action was absorption, finally planned,\r\nat the latest, at the meeting on 5 November 1937 (_386-PS_). The action\r\nwas taken on 11 March 1938. Reassurance had to be given to the Western\r\nPowers; hence the assurance to Belgium on 13 October 1937. (_TC-34_)\r\n\r\nLess than a year later the object of the aggressive action was\r\nCzechoslovakia. The Sudetenland was obtained in September 1938, and the\r\nwhole of Bohemia and Moravia was absorbed on 15 March 1939. At that time\r\nit was necessary to reassure Poland; so an assurance to Poland was given\r\nby Hitler oh 20 February 1938 (_2357-PS_), and repeated up to 26\r\nSeptember 1938 (_2358-PS_). The falsity of that assurance is shown in\r\nSection 8 of Chapter IX on Aggression Against Poland.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the Nazis decided to take action for the conquest of\r\nPoland in the next year, assurance had to be given to Russia. Hence, a\r\nnon-aggression pact was entered into with the U.S.S.R. on 23 August\r\n1939. (_TC-25_)\r\n\r\nWith regard to the foregoing summary, the Latin tag, _res ipsa loquitur_\r\nis apposite. But a frank statement from von Neurath with regard to the\r\nearlier part of it is found in the account of his conversation with the\r\nUnited States Ambassador, Mr. Bullitt, on 18 May 1936 (_L-150_):\r\n\r\n    “Von Neurath said that it was the policy of the German\r\n    Government to do nothing active in foreign affairs until ‘the\r\n    Rhineland had been digested.’ He explained that he meant that,\r\n    until the German fortifications had been constructed on the\r\n    French and Belgian frontiers, the German Government would do\r\n    everything possible to prevent rather than encourage an outbreak\r\n    by the Nazis in Austria and would pursue a quiet line with\r\n    regard to Czechoslovakia. ‘As soon as our fortifications are\r\n    constructed and the countries of Central Europe realize that\r\n    France cannot enter German territory at will, all those\r\n    countries will begin to feel very differently about their\r\n    foreign policies and a new constellation will develop,’ he\r\n    said.” (_L-150_)\r\n\r\nThe conversation between von Papen as Ambassador and Mr. Messersmith is\r\nmuch to the same effect. (_1760-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Austria._ At the time of the aggression against Austria von Neurath\r\nwas Foreign Minister. This included the preliminary stages, during the\r\nearly Nazi plottings against Austria in 1934. In this period occurred\r\nthe Nazi murder of Chancellor Dolfuss and the ancillary acts which were\r\nafterwards so strongly approved by the German Government. (See Section 3\r\nof Chapter IX on Aggression Against Austria.) Von Neurath was also\r\nForeign Minister when the false assurance was given to Austria on 21 May\r\n1935 (_TC-26_) and the fraudulent treaty was made on 11 July 1936\r\n(_TC-22_). And von Neurath was Foreign Minister when his ambassador to\r\nAustria, von Papen, was carrying on his subterranean intrigue in the\r\nperiod from 1935 to 1937. (_2247-PS_; _2246-PS_)\r\n\r\nVon Neurath was present when Hitler declared, in a highly confidential\r\ncircle, on 5 November 1937, that the German question could only be\r\nsolved by force, and that his plans were to conquer Austria and\r\nCzechoslovakia (_386-PS_). Hitler expressed his designs on Austria as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * For the improvement of our military political position,\r\n    it must be our first aim in every case of entanglement by war to\r\n    conquer Czechoslovakia and Austria simultaneously, in order to\r\n    remove any threat from the flanks in case of a possible advance\r\n    westwards.” (_386-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for von Neurath, after that meeting, to say that he was\r\nnot acting except with his eyes completely open and with complete\r\ncomprehension as to what was intended.\r\n\r\nDuring the _Anschluss_ von Neurath received a note from the British\r\nAmbassador dated 11 March 1938 (_3045-PS_). In reply von Neurath uttered\r\ntwo obvious untruths. The first:\r\n\r\n    “* * * It is untrue that the Reich used forceful pressure to\r\n    bring about this development, especially the assertion, which\r\n    was spread later by the former Chancellor Schuschnigg, that the\r\n    German Government had presented the Federal President with a\r\n    conditional ultimatum. It is a pure invention.” (_3287-PS_)\r\n\r\nAccording to the German ultimatum, Schuschnigg had to appoint a proposed\r\ncandidate as Chancellor and form a Cabinet conforming to the proposals\r\nof the German Government. Otherwise the invasion of Austria by German\r\ntroops was held in prospect. (See Section 3 of Chapter IX on Aggression\r\nAgainst Austria.) The second untruth:\r\n\r\n    “The truth of the matter is that the question of sending\r\n    military or police forces from the Reich was only brought up\r\n    when the newly formed Austrian Cabinet addressed a telegram,\r\n    already published by the press, to the German Government,\r\n    urgently asking for the dispatch of German troops as soon as\r\n    possible, in order to restore peace and order and to avoid\r\n    bloodshed. Faced with the immediately threatening danger of a\r\n    bloody civil war in Austria the German Government then decided\r\n    to comply with the appeal addressed to it.” (_3287-PS_)\r\n\r\n(As to the inspired nature of the Austrian telegram, see Section 3 of\r\nChapter IX on Aggression Against Austria.)\r\n\r\nAll that can be said is that it must have given von Neurath a certain\r\nmacabre sort of humor to write that note (_3287-PS_) when the truth was\r\nthe opposite, as shown by the report of Gauleiter Rainer to Buerckel\r\n(_812-PS_), the transcripts of Goering’s telephone conversations with\r\nAustria (_2949-PS_), and the entries in Jodl’s diary for 11, 13, and 14\r\nFebruary. (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nAccording to Jodl’s diary—the entry for 10 March:\r\n\r\n    “At 13.00 hours General Keitel informs Chief of Operational\r\n    Staff and Admiral Canaris. Ribbentrop is being detained in\r\n    London. Neurath takes over the Foreign Office.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is inconceivable when von Neurath had taken over the Foreign Office,\r\nwas dealing with the matter and was co-operating with Goering to suit\r\nthe susceptibilities of the Czechs, that he should have been so ignorant\r\nof the truth of events as to write that letter (_3287-PS_) in good\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nVon Neurath’s position is shown equally clearly by the account which is\r\ngiven of him in the affidavit of Messersmith (_2385-PS_). Von Neurath’s\r\nstyle of activity at this crisis is described as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I should emphasize here in this statement that the men who made\r\n    these promises were not only the dyed-in-the-wool Nazis, but\r\n    more conservative Germans who already had begun to willingly\r\n    lend themselves to the Nazi program.\r\n\r\n    “In an official dispatch to the Department of State from Vienna,\r\n    dated October 10, 1935, I wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n    “‘Europe will not get away from the myth that Neurath, Papen,\r\n    and Mackensen are not dangerous people and that they are\r\n    diplomats of the old school. They are in fact servile\r\n    instruments of the regime, and just because the outside world\r\n    looks upon them as harmless they are able to work more\r\n    effectively. They are able to sow discord just because they\r\n    propagate the myth that they are not in sympathy with the\r\n    regime’.” (_2385-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Czechoslovakia._ At the time of the occupation of Austria, von\r\nNeurath gave the assurance to M. Mastny, the Ambassador of\r\nCzechoslovakia to Berlin, regarding the continued independence of\r\nCzechoslovakia (_TC-27_). M. Jan Masaryk, Czechoslovakian Foreign\r\nMinister, describes the circumstances as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I have in consequence been instructed by my Government to bring\r\n    to the official knowledge of His Majesty’s Government the\r\n    following facts: Yesterday evening (the 11th March)\r\n    Field-Marshal Goering made two separate statements to M. Mastny,\r\n    the Czechoslovak Minister in Berlin, assuring him that the\r\n    developments in Austria will in no way have any detrimental\r\n    influence on the relations between the German Reich and\r\n    Czechoslovakia, and emphasizing the continued earnest endeavor\r\n    on the part of Germany to improve those mutual relations.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “M. Mastny was in a position to give him [Goering] definite and\r\n    binding assurances on this subject [Czech mobilization] and\r\n    today spoke with Baron von Neurath, who, among other things,\r\n    assured him on behalf of Herr Hitler that Germany still\r\n    considers herself bound by the German-Czechoslovak Arbitration\r\n    Convention concluded at Locarno in October 1925.” (_TC-27_)\r\n\r\nIn view of von Neurath’s presence at the meeting on 5 November 1937,\r\nfour months previously, where he had heard Hitler’s views on\r\nCzechoslovakia (_386-PS_), and that it was only six months before the\r\ntreaty was disregarded, von Neurath’s assurance is an excellent example\r\nof the technique of diplomacy developed by von Neurath.\r\n\r\nOn 28 May 1938 Hitler held a conference of important leaders, including\r\nBeck, von Brauchitsch, Raeder, Keitel, Goering, and Ribbentrop, at which\r\nHitler affirmed that preparations should be made for military action\r\nagainst Czechoslovakia by October (_388-PS_; _2360-PS_). It is believed,\r\nalthough not confirmed, that von Neurath attended.\r\n\r\nOn 4 September 1938 the Government of which von Neurath was a member\r\nenacted a new Secret Reich Defense Law which defined various official\r\nresponsibilities, in clear anticipation of war. This law provided, as\r\ndid the previous Secret Reich Defense Law, for a Reich Defense Council\r\nas a supreme policy board for war preparations (_2194-PS_). Then came\r\nthe Munich agreement of 29 September 1938, in spite of which, on 14\r\nMarch 1939, German troops marched into Czechoslovakia. (_TC-50_)\r\n\r\nOn 16 March 1939 the German Government, of which von Neurath was still a\r\nmember, promulgated the Decree of the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor on\r\nthe Establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. (_TC-51_)\r\nDuring the following week, von Ribbentrop signed a treaty with Slovakia\r\n(_1439-PS_), Article 2 of which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “For the purpose of making effective the protection undertaken\r\n    by the German Reich, the German armed forces shall have the\r\n    right at all times to construct military installations and to\r\n    keep them garrisoned in the strength they deem necessary, in an\r\n    area delimited on its western side by the frontiers of the State\r\n    of Slovakia, and on its eastern side by a line formed by the\r\n    eastern rims of the Lower Carpathians, the White Carpathians,\r\n    and the Javornik Mountains.\r\n\r\n    “The Government of Slovakia will take the necessary steps to\r\n    assure that the land required for these installations shall be\r\n    conveyed to the German armed forces. Furthermore, the Government\r\n    of Slovakia will agree to grant exemption from custom duties for\r\n    imports from the Reich for the maintenance of the German troops\r\n    and the supply of military installations.” (_1439-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe ultimate objective of Hitler’s policies, disclosed at the meeting at\r\nwhich von Neurath was present on 5 November 1937 (_386-PS_), is obvious\r\nfrom the terms of this treaty. It was the resumption of the _drang_ for\r\n_lebensraum_ in the East.\r\n\r\n  E. _VON NEURATH’S PART, AS PROTECTOR FOR BOHEMIA AND MORAVIA, IN THE\r\n     CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY._\r\n\r\nBy accepting and occupying the position of Reich Protector of Bohemia\r\nand Moravia, von Neurath personally adhered to the aggression against\r\nCzechoslovakia. As Protector he further actively participated in the\r\nconspiracy for world aggression, and assumed a position of leadership in\r\nthe execution of policies involving violations of the laws of war and\r\nthe commission of crimes against humanity.\r\n\r\nVon Neurath’s responsibility for these crimes derives from the legal\r\nposition which he assumed. Von Neurath assumed the position of Protector\r\nunder a sweeping grant of powers. Article V of the act creating the\r\nProtectorate provided:\r\n\r\n    “1. As trustee of Reich interests, the Leader and Chancellor of\r\n    the Reich shall nominate a Reich Protector in Bohemia and\r\n    Moravia. His seat of office will be Prague.\r\n\r\n    “2. The Reich Protector, as representative of the Leader and\r\n    Chancellor of the Reich and as Commissioner of the Reich\r\n    Government, is charged with the duty of seeing to the observance\r\n    of the political principles laid down by the Leader and\r\n    Chancellor of the Reich.\r\n\r\n    “3. The members of the Government of the Protectorate shall be\r\n    confirmed by the Reich Protector. The confirmation may be\r\n    withdrawn.\r\n\r\n    “4. The Reich Protector is entitled to inform himself of all\r\n    measures taken by the Government of the protectorate and to give\r\n    advice. He can object to measures calculated to harm the Reich\r\n    and, in case of danger, issue ordinances required for the common\r\n    interest.\r\n\r\n    “5. The promulgation of laws, ordinances and other legal\r\n    announcements and the execution of administrative measures and\r\n    legal judgments shall be annulled if the Reich Protector enters\r\n    an objection.” (_2119-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt the very outset of the Protectorate, von Neurath’s supreme authority\r\nwas implemented by a series of basic decrees. These established the\r\nalleged legal foundation for the policy and program which resulted, all\r\naimed toward the systematic destruction of the national integrity of the\r\nCzechs. Among these decrees were:\r\n\r\n(1) The decree granting “Racial Germans” in Czechoslovakia a supreme\r\norder of citizenship (_2119-PS_);\r\n\r\n(2) An act concerning the representation in the Reichstag of Greater\r\nGermany of German Nationals Resident in the Protectorate (13 April\r\n1939);\r\n\r\n(3) An order concerning the acquisition of German citizenship by former\r\nCzechoslovakian citizens of German origin (20 April 1939).\r\n\r\nAnother series of decrees granted “Racial Germans” in Czechoslovakia a\r\npreferred status at law and in the courts:\r\n\r\n(1) An order concerning the Exercise of Criminal Jurisdiction in the\r\nProtectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (14 April 1939);\r\n\r\n(2) An order concerning the Exercise of Jurisdiction in Civil\r\nProceedings (14 April 1939);\r\n\r\n(3) An order concerning the Exercise of Military Jurisdiction (8 May\r\n1939).\r\n\r\nThe Ordinance on Legislation in the Protectorate (7 June 1939) also\r\ngranted to the Protector broad powers to change by decree the autonomous\r\nlaw of the Protectorate.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Protector was authorized, with the Reich Leader SS and the\r\nChief of the German Police (Himmler) “to take, if necessary, such\r\n(police) measures which go beyond the limits usually valid for police\r\nmeasures.” It is difficult to imagine what can be police measures\r\n“beyond the limits usually valid for police measures” in view of the\r\npolice measures in Germany between 1933 and 1939. (See Section 4 of\r\nChapter VII on Purge of Political Opponents and Section 6 of Chapter XV\r\non the Gestapo and SD.) But presumably such increase was believed to be\r\npossible, and was given to von Neurath to use for coercion of the\r\nCzechs.\r\n\r\nThe declared basic policy of the Protectorate was to destroy the\r\nidentity of the Czechs as a nation and to absorb their territory into\r\nthe Reich. This is borne out by a memorandum signed by Lt. Gen. of\r\nInfantry Frederici (_862-PS_), which is headed “The Deputy General of\r\nthe Armed Forces with the Reich Protector in Bohemia and Moravia”. It is\r\nmarked Top Secret and dated 15 October 1940. That was practically a year\r\nbefore von Neurath went on leave, as he puts it, on 27 September 1941.\r\nThe memorandum discusses “Basic Political Principles in the\r\nProtectorate,” and copies went to Keitel and Jodl. The memorandum\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “On 9 October of this year [1940] the office of the Reich\r\n    protector held an official conference in which State Secretary\r\n    SS Lt. General K. H. Frank spoke about the following:\r\n\r\n    “Since creation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia,\r\n    party agencies, industrial circles, as well as agencies of the\r\n    central authorities of Berlin, have had difficulties about the\r\n    solution of the Czech problem.\r\n\r\n    “After ample deliberation, the Reich Protector expressed his\r\n    view about the various plans in a memorandum. In this, three\r\n    ways of solution were indicated:\r\n\r\n    “A. German infiltration of Moravia and _reduction of the Czech\r\n    nationality to a residual Bohemia_.\r\n\r\n    “This solution is considered as unsatisfactory, because the\r\n    Czech problem, even if in a diminished form, will continue to\r\n    exist.\r\n\r\n    “B. Many arguments can be brought up against the most radical\r\n    solution, namely, the deportation of all Czechs. Therefore the\r\n    memorandum comes to the conclusion that it can not be carried\r\n    out within a reasonable space of time.\r\n\r\n    “C. Assimilation of the Czechs, i.e. absorption of about half of\r\n    the Czech nationality by the Germans, insofar as this is of\r\n    importance by being valuable from a racial or other standpoint.\r\n    This will take place among other things, also by increasing the\r\n    _Arbeitseinsatz_ of the Czechs in the Reich territory, with the\r\n    exception of the Sudeten German border district; in other words,\r\n    by dispersing the closed Czech nationality. The other half of\r\n    the Czech nationality must be deprived of its power, eliminated\r\n    and shipped out of the country by all sorts of methods. This\r\n    applies particularly to the racially mongoloid part, and to the\r\n    major part of the intellectual class. The latter can scarcely be\r\n    converted ideologically, and would represent a burden by\r\n    constantly making claims for leadership over the other Czech\r\n    classes, and thus interfering with a rapid assimilation.\r\n\r\n    “Elements which counteract the planned Germanization are to be\r\n    handled roughly and should be eliminated.\r\n\r\n    “The above development naturally presupposes an increased influx\r\n    of Germans from the Reich territory into the Protectorate.\r\n\r\n    “After a discussion, the Fuehrer has chosen Solution C\r\n    (assimilation) as a directive for the solution of the Czech\r\n    problem, and decided that, while keeping up the autonomy of the\r\n    Protectorate on the surface, the Germanization will have to be\r\n    carried out in a centralized way by the office of the Reich\r\n    Protector for years to come. From the above no particular\r\n    conclusions are drawn by the Armed Forces. This is the direction\r\n    which has always been represented from here.\r\n\r\n    “In this connection, I refer to my memorandum which was sent to\r\n    the Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces, dated 12\r\n    July 1939, entitled ‘The Czech Problem’.” (_862-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat view of the Reich Protector was accepted and formed a basis of his\r\npolicy. The result was a program of consolidating German control over\r\nBohemia and Moravia by the systematic oppression of the Czechs through\r\nthe abolishment of civil liberties, and the systematic undermining of\r\nthe native political, economic, and cultural structure by a regime of\r\nterror. The only protection given by von Neurath was a protection to the\r\nperpetrators of innumerable crimes against the Czechs. (Proof of this\r\naspect of von Neurath’s responsibility was left for development by the\r\nSoviet prosecuting staff.)\r\n\r\n                            F. _CONCLUSION._\r\n\r\nVon Neurath received many honors and rewards as his worth. It even\r\nappears that Hitler showered more honors on von Neurath than on some of\r\nthe leading Nazis who had been with the Party since the very beginning.\r\nHis appointments as President of the newly created Secret Cabinet\r\nCouncil in 1938 was in itself a new and singular distinction. On 22\r\nSeptember 1940 Hitler awarded him the War Merit Cross, First Class, as\r\nReich Protector for Bohemia and Moravia. He was also awarded the Golden\r\nBadge of the Party, and was promoted by Hitler personally from the rank\r\nof _Gruppenfuehrer_ to _Obergruppenfuehrer_ in the SS, on 21 June 1943.\r\nVon Neurath and Ribbentrop were the only two Germans to be awarded the\r\n_Adlerorden_, a distinction normally reserved for foreigners. Von\r\nNeurath’s seventieth birthday, 2 February 1943, was made the occasion\r\nfor most of the German newspapers to praise his many years of service to\r\nthe Nazi regime. This service, in the view of the prosecution, may be\r\nsummed up in two ways:\r\n\r\n(1) He was an internal fifth columnist among Conservative political\r\ncircles in Germany. They had been anti-Nazi but were converted in part\r\nby seeing one of themselves, in the person of von Neurath,\r\nwholeheartedly with the Nazis.\r\n\r\n(2) His previous reputation as a diplomat made public opinion abroad\r\nslow to believe that he would be a member of a cabinet which did not\r\nstand by its words and assurances. It was most important for Hitler that\r\nhis own readiness to break every treaty or commitment should be\r\nconcealed as long as possible, and for this purpose he found in von\r\nNeurath his handiest tool.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n   LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO CONSTANTIN VON\r\n                                NEURATH\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  29, 64\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

HANS FRITZSCHE\r\n\r\n          A. _POSITIONS HELD BY FRITZSCHE IN THE NAZI STATE._\r\n\r\nFritzsche’s Party membership and his various positions in the propaganda\r\napparatus of the Nazi State are shown in two affidavits made by himself\r\n(_2976-PS_; _3469-PS_). Fritzsche became a member of the Nazi Party on 1\r\nMay 1933, and continued to be a member until Germany’s collapse in 1945.\r\n\r\nFritzsche began his service with the staff of the Reich Ministry for\r\nPeople’s Enlightenment and Propaganda (hereinafter referred to as the\r\nPropaganda Ministry) on 1 May 1933, he remained within the Propaganda\r\nMinistry until the Nazi downfall in the spring of 1945.\r\n\r\nBefore the Nazis seized political power in Germany, and beginning in\r\nSeptember 1932, Fritzsche was head of the Wireless News Service\r\n(_Drahtloser Dienst_), an agency of the Reich Government, which at that\r\ntime was the government of von Papen. After the Wireless News Service\r\nwas incorporated into Dr. Goebbels’ Propaganda Ministry in May 1933,\r\nFritzsche continued as its head until 1938. Upon entering the Progapanda\r\nMinistry in May 1933, Fritzsche also became head of the news section of\r\nthe Press Division of the Propaganda Ministry. He continued in this\r\nposition until 1937. In the summer of 1938 Fritzsche was appointed\r\ndeputy to Alfred Ingemar Berndt, who was then head of the German Press\r\nDivision. (The German Press Division, in the Indictment, is called the\r\n“Home Press Division.” Since “German Press Division” seems to be a more\r\nliteral translation, it is referred to as the German Press Division\r\nthroughout this section. It is sometimes otherwise known as the Domestic\r\nPress Division.) This Division, as will be later shown, was the major\r\nsection of the Press Division of the Reich Cabinet.\r\n\r\nIn December 1938 Fritzsche succeeded Berndt as the head of the German\r\nPress Division. Between 1938 and November 1942, Fritzsche was promoted\r\nthree times. He advanced in title from Superior Government Counsel to\r\nMinisterial Counsel, then to _Ministerialdirigent_, and finally to\r\n_Ministerialdirektor_.\r\n\r\nIn November 1942 Fritzsche was relieved of his position as head of the\r\nGerman Press Division by Dr. Goebbels. In its place he accepted from Dr.\r\nGoebbels a newly created position in the Propaganda Ministry, that of\r\nPlenipotentiary for the Political Organization of the Greater German\r\nRadio. At the same time he also became head of the Radio Division of the\r\nPropaganda Ministry. He held both these positions in radio until the\r\nNazi downfall.\r\n\r\nThere are two allegations in the Indictment concerning Fritzsche’s\r\npositions for which no proof is available. The first unsupported\r\nallegation states that Fritzsche was Editor-in-Chief of the official\r\nGerman News Agency, _Deutsche Nachrichten Buero_. The second unsupported\r\nallegation states that Fritzsche was head of the Radio Division of the\r\nPropaganda Department of the Nazi Party. Fritzsche, in his affidavit,\r\ndenies having held either of these positions, and these two allegations\r\nmust fall for want of other proof.\r\n\r\nB. _FRITZSCHE’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO CONSOLIDATE NAZI CONTROL OVER\r\n               GERMANY AND TO LAUNCH WARS OF AGGRESSION._\r\n\r\nIn one of his affidavits (_3469-PS_), which contains numerous statements\r\nin the nature of self-serving declarations, Fritzsche states that he\r\nfirst became a successful journalist in the service of the Hugenberg\r\nPress, the most important chain of newspaper enterprises in pre-Nazi\r\nGermany. The Hugenberg concern owned papers of its own, but it was\r\nimportant primarily because it served newspapers which principally\r\nsupported the so-called “national” parties of the Reich, including the\r\nNSDAP.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 5 of this affidavit (_3469-PS_), Fritzsche relates that in\r\nSeptember 1932, when von Papen was Reich Chancellor, he was made head of\r\nthe Wireless News Service, replacing an official who was politically\r\nunbearable to the Papen regime. The Wireless News Service was a\r\ngovernment agency for spreading news by radio. Fritzsche began making\r\nradio broadcasts at about this time, with a success which Goebbels\r\nrecognized and later exploited on behalf of the Nazi conspirators.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day when the Nazis seized power, the 30 January\r\n1933, two emissaries from Goebbels visited Fritzsche. One of them was\r\nDressler-Andrees, head of the Radio Division of the NSDAP; the other was\r\nan assistant of Dressler-Andrees named Sadila-Mantau. These two\r\nemissaries notified Fritzsche that although Goebbels was angry with\r\nFritzsche for writing an article critical of Hitler, still Goebbels\r\nrecognized Fritzsche’s public success on the radio. They stated further\r\nthat Goebbels desired to retain Fritzsche as head of the Wireless News\r\nService on certain conditions: (1) that Fritzsche discharge all Jews;\r\n(2) that he discharge all other personnel who would not join the NSDAP;\r\n(3) that he employ with the Wireless News Service the second Goebbels’\r\nemissary, Sadila-Mantau. Fritzsche refused all these conditions except\r\nthe hiring of Sadila-Mantau. (_3469-PS_)\r\n\r\nFritzsche continued to make radio broadcasts during this period in which\r\nhe supported the national National Socialist coalition government then\r\nstill existing.\r\n\r\nIn early 1933 SA troops several times called at the Wireless News\r\nService and Fritzsche prevented them, with some difficulty, from making\r\nnews broadcasts.\r\n\r\nIn April 1933 Goebbels called Fritzsche to him for a personal audience.\r\nAt paragraph 9 of his affidavit (_3469-PS_) Fritzsche has described his\r\nprior relationship with Dr. Goebbels:\r\n\r\n    “I was acquainted with Dr. Goebbels since 1928. Apparently he\r\n    had taken a liking to me, besides the fact that in my press\r\n    activities I had always treated the National Socialists in a\r\n    friendly way until 1931. Already before 1933, Goebbels, who was\r\n    the editor of the ‘_Attack_’ [“_Der Angriff_”] a Nazi newspaper,\r\n    had frequently made flattering remarks about the form and\r\n    content of my work, which I did as contributor of many\r\n    ‘National’ newspapers and periodicals, among which were also\r\n    reactionary papers and periodicals.” (_3469-PS_)\r\n\r\n(1) _Establishment of complete Nazi control over press and radio._ At\r\nthe first Goebbels-Fritzsche discussion in early April 1933, Goebbels\r\ninformed Fritzsche of his decision to place the Wireless News Service\r\nwithin the Propaganda Ministry as of 1 May 1933. He suggested that\r\nFritzsche make certain rearrangements in the personnel so as to remove\r\nJews and other persons who did not support the NSDAP. Fritzsche debated\r\nwith Goebbels concerning some of these steps. During this period\r\nFritzsche made some effort to place Jews in other jobs.\r\n\r\nIn a second conference with Goebbels shortly thereafter, Fritzsche\r\ninformed Goebbels about the steps he had taken in reorganizing the\r\nWireless News Service. Goebbels thereupon informed Fritzsche that he\r\nwould like to have him reorganize and modernize the entire news services\r\nof Germany within the controls of the Propaganda Ministry. On 17 March\r\n1933, approximately two months before this time, the Propaganda Ministry\r\nhad been created by decree. (_2029-PS_) Fritzsche was intrigued by the\r\nGoebbels offer. He proceeded to conclude the Goebbels-inspired\r\nreorganization of the Wireless News Service and, on 1 May 1933, together\r\nwith the remaining members of his staff, he joined the Propaganda\r\nMinistry. On this same day he joined the NSDAP and took the customary\r\noath of unconditional loyalty to the Fuehrer (_3469-PS_).\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, whatever reservations Fritzsche may have had, either\r\nthen or later, to the course of events under the Nazis, Fritzsche was\r\ncompletely within the Nazi camp. For the next 13 years he assisted in\r\ncreating and in using the propaganda devices which the conspirators\r\nsuccessfully employed in each of the principal phases of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nFrom 1933 until 1942 Fritzsche held one or more positions within the\r\nGerman Press Division. For four years, from 1938 to 1942—the period\r\nwhen the Nazis undertook military invasions of neighboring countries—he\r\nheaded this Division. By virtue of its functions, the German Press\r\nDivision became an important and unique instrument of the Nazi\r\nconspirators, not only in dominating the minds and psychology of\r\nGermans, but also as an instrument of foreign policy and psychological\r\nwarfare against other nations. Thus, the already broad jurisdiction of\r\nthe Propaganda Ministry was extended as follows by a Hitler decree of 30\r\nJune 1933:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda has\r\n    jurisdiction over the whole field of spiritual indoctrination of\r\n    the nation, of propagandizing the State, of cultural and\r\n    economic propaganda, of enlightenment of the public at home and\r\n    abroad. Furthermore, he is in charge of the administration of\r\n    all institutions serving those purposes.” (_2030-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn exposition of the general functions of the German Press Division of\r\nthe Propaganda Ministry is contained in an excerpt from a book by George\r\nWilhelm Mueller, a Ministerial Director in the Propaganda Ministry.\r\n(_2434-PS_) Paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 of Fritzsche’s affidavit contain an\r\nexposition of the functions of the German Press Division, a description\r\nwhich confirms and adds to the exposition in Mueller’s book. Concerning\r\nthe German Press Division, Fritzsche’s affidavit (_3469-PS_) states:\r\n\r\n    “During the whole period from 1933 to 1945 it was the task of\r\n    the German Press Division to supervise the entire domestic press\r\n    and to provide it with directives by which this division became\r\n    an efficient instrument in the hands of the German State\r\n    leadership. More than 2,300 German daily newspapers were subject\r\n    to this control. The aim of this supervision and control, in the\r\n    first years following 1933, was to change basically the\r\n    conditions existing in the press before the seizure of power.\r\n    That meant the coordination into the New Order of those\r\n    newspapers and periodicals which were in the service of\r\n    capitalistic special interests or party politics. While the\r\n    administrative functions, wherever possible, were exercised by\r\n    the professional associations and the Reich Press Chamber, the\r\n    political leadership of the German press was entrusted to the\r\n    German Press Division. The head of the German Press Division\r\n    held daily press conferences in the Ministry for the\r\n    representatives of all German newspapers. Hereby all\r\n    instructions were given to the representatives of the press.\r\n    These instructions were transmitted daily, almost without\r\n    exception, and mostly by telephone, from headquarters by Dr.\r\n    Otto Dietrich, Reich Press Chief, in a fixed statement, the\r\n    so-called ‘Daily Parole of the Reich Press Chief.’ Before the\r\n    statement was fixed the head of the German Press Division\r\n    submitted to him—Dietrich—the current press wishes expressed\r\n    by Dr. Goebbels and by other Ministries. This was the case\r\n    especially with the wishes of the Foreign Office, about which\r\n    Dr. Dietrich always wanted to make decisions personally or\r\n    through his representatives at the headquarters, Helmut\r\n    Suendermann and chief editor Lorenz. The practical use of the\r\n    general directions in detail was thus left entirely to the\r\n    individual work of the individual editor. Therefore, it is by no\r\n    means true that the newspapers and periodicals were a monopoly\r\n    of the German Press Division or that essays and leading articles\r\n    through it had to be submitted to the Ministry. Even in war\r\n    times this happened in exceptional cases only. The less\r\n    important newspapers and periodicals which were not represented\r\n    at the daily press conferences received their information in a\r\n    different way—by providing them either with ready-made articles\r\n    and reports, or with a confidential printed instruction. The\r\n    publications of all other official agencies were directed and\r\n    coordinated likewise by the German Press Division. To enable the\r\n    periodicals to get acquainted with the daily political problems\r\n    of newspapers and to discuss these problems in greater detail,\r\n    the _Informationskorrespondenz_ was issued especially for\r\n    periodicals. Later on it was taken over by the Periodical Press\r\n    Division. The German Press Division likewise was in charge of\r\n    pictorial reporting in so far as it directed the employment of\r\n    pictorial reporters at important events. In this way, and\r\n    conditioned by the current political situation, the entire\r\n    German Press was made a permanent instrument of the Propaganda\r\n    Ministry by the German Press Division. Thereby, the entire\r\n    German Press was subordinate to the political aims of the\r\n    Government. This was exemplified by the timely measuring and the\r\n    emphatic presentation of such press polemics as appeared to be\r\n    most useful, as shown for instance in the following themes: the\r\n    class struggle of the system era; the leadership principle and\r\n    the authoritarian state; the party and interest politics of the\r\n    system era; the Jewish problem; the conspiracy of World Jewry;\r\n    the Bolshevistic danger; the plutocratic Democracy abroad; the\r\n    race problem generally; the church; the economic misery abroad;\r\n    the foreign policy; and living space [_lebensraum_].”\r\n    (_3469-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis description of Fritzsche’s establishes clearly that the German\r\nPress Division was the instrument for subordinating the entire German\r\npress to the political aims of the Nazi Government.\r\n\r\nFritzsche’s early activities within the German Press Division on behalf\r\nof the conspirators are described in his affidavit (_3469-PS_). In a\r\nconference with Goebbels the following occurred:\r\n\r\n    “At this time Dr. Goebbels suggested to me, as a specialist on\r\n    news technique, the establishment and direction of a section\r\n    ‘News,’ within the Press Division of his Ministry, in order to\r\n    organize fully and to modernize the German news agencies. In\r\n    executing this assignment given to me by Dr. Goebbels I took for\r\n    my field the entire news field for the German Press and the\r\n    radio in accordance with the directions given by the Propaganda\r\n    Ministry, at first with the exception of the DNB, German News\r\n    Agency.” (_3469-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe reason why the DNB was excepted from Fritzsche’s field at this time\r\nis that it did not come into existence until 1934.\r\n\r\nLater on in his affidavit Fritzsche mentions the sizeable funds put at\r\nhis disposal in building up the Nazi news services. Altogether, the\r\nGerman news agencies received a ten-fold increase in their budget from\r\nthe Reich, an increase from 400,000 to 4,000,000 marks. Fritzsche\r\nhimself selected and employed the Chief Editor for the Transocean News\r\nAgency and also for the Europa Press. Fritzsche states that some of the\r\n\r\n    “* * * directions of the Propaganda Ministry which I had to\r\n    follow were * * * increase of German news copy abroad at any\r\n    cost * * * spreading of favorable news on the internal\r\n    construction and peaceful intentions of the National Socialistic\r\n    System. * * *” (_3469-PS_)\r\n\r\nAbout the summer of 1934 Funk, then Reich Press Chief, achieved the\r\nfusion of the two most important domestic news agencies, the Wolff\r\nTelegraph Agency and the Telegraph Union, and thus formed the official\r\nGerman news agency known as DNB. Although Fritzsche held no position\r\nwith DNB at any time, nevertheless as head of the news section of the\r\nGerman Press Division, Fritzsche’s duties gave him official jurisdiction\r\nover the DNB, which was the official domestic news agency of the Reich\r\nafter 1934. Fritzsche admits that he coordinated the work of the various\r\nforeign news agencies\r\n\r\n    “within the inland Europe and overseas foreign countries with\r\n    each other and in relationship to DNB” (_3469-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe Wireless News Service was headed by Fritzsche from 1930 to 1937.\r\nAfter January 1933 the Wireless News Service was the official instrument\r\nof the Nazi government in spreading news over the radio. During the same\r\ntime that Fritzsche headed the Wireless News Service, he personally made\r\nradio broadcasts to the German people. These broadcasts were naturally\r\nsubject to the controls of the Propaganda Ministry and reflected its\r\npurposes. The influence of Fritzsche’s broadcasts to the German people,\r\nduring this period of consolidation of control by the Nazi conspirators,\r\nis all the more important since Fritzsche was concurrently head of the\r\nWireless News Service, and thus in control of all radio news.\r\n\r\n(2) _Use of propaganda to prepare the way for aggressions_. The use made\r\nby the Nazi conspirators of psychological warfare is well known. Before\r\neach major aggression, with some few exceptions based on expediency,\r\nthey initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and\r\nto prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. They used\r\nthe press, after their earlier conquests, as a means for further\r\ninfluencing foreign politics and in maneuvering for the next following\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nBy the time of the occupation of the Sudetenland on 1 October 1938,\r\nFritzsche had become deputy head of the entire German Press Division.\r\nFritzsche states that the role of German propaganda before the Munich\r\nAgreement on the Sudetenland was directed by his immediate chief,\r\nBerndt, head of the German Press Division. Fritzsche describes Berndt’s\r\npropaganda as follows:\r\n\r\n    “He exaggerated minor events very strongly, used sometimes old\r\n    episodes as new—and there even came complaints from the\r\n    Sudetenland itself that much of the news reported by the German\r\n    press was untrustworthy. As a matter of fact, after the great\r\n    foreign political success at Munich in September 1938, there\r\n    came a noticeable crisis in confidence of the German people in\r\n    the trustworthiness of its press. This was one reason for the\r\n    recalling of Berndt, in December 1938 after the conclusion of\r\n    the Sudeten action and for my appointment as head of the German\r\n    Press Division. Beyond this, Berndt, by his admittedly\r\n    successful but still primitive military-like orders to the\r\n    German Press, had lost the confidence of the German editors.”\r\n    (_3469-PS_)\r\n\r\nFritzsche was accordingly made head of the German Press Division in\r\nplace of Berndt. Between December 1938 and 1942, Fritzsche, as head of\r\nthe German Press Division, personally gave to the representatives of the\r\nprincipal German newspapers the “daily parole of the Reich Press Chief.”\r\nDuring this period he was the principal conspirator directly concerned\r\nwith the manipulations of the press.\r\n\r\nThe first important foreign aggression after Fritzsche became head of\r\nthe German Press Division was the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia.\r\nFritzsche describes the propaganda action surrounding the incorporation\r\nof Bohemia and Moravia as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The action for the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia, which\r\n    took place on 15 March 1939, while I was head of the German\r\n    Press Division, was not prepared for such a long period as the\r\n    Sudeten action. According to my memory, it was in February that\r\n    I received the order from the Reich Press Chief, Dr. Dietrich,\r\n    which was repeated as a request by the envoy Paul Schmidt of the\r\n    Foreign Office, to bring the attention of the press to the\r\n    efforts for independence of Slovakia and to the continued\r\n    anti-German coalition politics of the Prague government. I did\r\n    this. The daily paroles of the Reich Press Chief and the press\r\n    conference minutes at that time show the wording of the\r\n    corresponding instructions. These were the typical headlines of\r\n    leading newspapers and the emphatic leading articles of the\r\n    German daily press at that time: (1) the terrorizing of Germans\r\n    within the Czech territory by arrest, shooting of Germans by the\r\n    state police, destruction and damaging of German homes by Czech\r\n    gangsters; (2) the concentration of Czech forces on the Sudeten\r\n    frontier; (3) the kidnaping, deporting, and persecuting of\r\n    Slovakian minorities by the Czechs; that the Czechs must get out\r\n    of Slovakia; (4) secret meetings of Red functionaries in Prague.\r\n    Some few days before the visit of Hacha, I received the\r\n    instruction to publish in the press very emphatically the\r\n    incoming news on the unrest in Czechoslovakia. Such information\r\n    I received only partly from the German News Agency, DNB. Mostly\r\n    it came from the Press Division of the Foreign Office and some\r\n    of it came from big newspapers with their own news services.\r\n    Among the newspapers offering information was above all the\r\n    ‘_Voelkischer Beobachter_’ which, as I learned later on,\r\n    received its information from the SS Standartenfuehrer Gunter\r\n    D’Alquen. He was at this time in Pressburg. I had forbidden all\r\n    news agencies and newspapers to issue news on unrest in\r\n    Czechoslovakia before I had seen it. I wanted to avoid a\r\n    repetition of the very annoying results of the Sudeten action\r\n    propaganda, and I did not want to suffer a loss of prestige\r\n    caused by untrue news. Thus, all news checked by me was\r\n    admittedly full of tendency [_voller Tendenz_] however, not\r\n    invented. After the visit of Hacha in Berlin and after the\r\n    beginning of the invasion of the German Army, which took place\r\n    on 15 March 1939, the German press had enough material for\r\n    describing those events. Historically and politically the event\r\n    was justified with the indication that the declaration of\r\n    independence of Slovakia had required an interference and that\r\n    Hacha with his signature had avoided a war and had reinstated a\r\n    thousand-year union between Bohemia and the Reich.” (_3469-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe propaganda campaign of the press preceding the invasion of Poland on\r\n1 September 1939 bears again the handiwork of Fritzsche and his German\r\nPress Division. Fritzsche speaks of the conspirators’ treatment of this\r\nepisode as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Very complicated and changing was the press and propagandists\r\n    treatment in the case of Poland. Under the influence of the\r\n    German-Polish agreement, it was generally forbidden in the\r\n    German press for many years to publish anything on the situation\r\n    of the German minority in Poland. This remained also the case\r\n    when in the Spring of 1939 the German press was asked to become\r\n    somewhat more active as to the problem of Danzig. Also, when the\r\n    first Polish-English conversations took place, and when the\r\n    German press was instructed to use a sharper tone against\r\n    Poland, the question of the German minority still remained in\r\n    the background. But during the summer this problem was picked up\r\n    again and created immediately a noticeable sharpening of the\r\n    situation, namely, each larger German newspaper had for quite\r\n    some time an abundance of material on complaints of the Germans\r\n    in Poland without the editors having had a chance to use this\r\n    material. The German papers, from the time of the minority\r\n    discussion at Geneva, still had correspondents of free\r\n    collaborators in Kattewitz, Bromberg, Posen, Thorn, etc. Their\r\n    material now came forth with a bound. Concerning this the\r\n    leading German newspapers, upon the basis of directions given\r\n    out in the so-called ‘daily parole’ brought out the following\r\n    publicity with great emphasis: (1) cruelty and terror against\r\n    Germans and the extermination of Germans in Poland; (2) forced\r\n    labor of thousands of German men and women in Poland; (3)\r\n    Poland, land of servitude and disorder; the desertion of Polish\r\n    soldiers; the increased inflation in Poland; (4) provocation of\r\n    frontier clashes upon direction of the Polish Government; the\r\n    Polish lust to conquer; (5) persecution of Czechs and Ukrainians\r\n    by Poland. The Polish Press replied particularly sharply.”\r\n    (_3469-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe press campaign preceding the invasion of Yugoslavia followed the\r\nconventional pattern. The customary definitions, lies, incitement, and\r\nthreats, and the usual attempt to divide and weaken the victim, are\r\ncontained in Fritzsche’s description of this propaganda action:\r\n\r\n    “During the period immediately preceding the invasion of\r\n    Yugoslavia, on the 16th of April 1941, the German press\r\n    emphasized by headlines and leading articles the following\r\n    topics: (1) the planned persecution of Germans in Yugoslavia,\r\n    including the burning down of German villages by Serbian\r\n    soldiers; also the confining of Germans in concentration camps\r\n    and also the physical mishandling of German-speaking persons;\r\n    (2) the arming of Serbian bandits by the Serbian Government; (3)\r\n    the incitement of Yugoslavia by the plutocrats against Germany;\r\n    (4) the increasing anti-Serbian feeling in Croatia; (5) the\r\n    chaotic economic and social conditions in Yugoslavia.”\r\n\r\nSince Germany had a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, and\r\nbecause the conspirators wanted the advantage of surprise, there was no\r\nspecial propaganda campaign immediately preceding the attack on the\r\nU.S.S.R. Fritzsche’s affidavit discusses the propaganda line which was\r\ngiven the German people in justification of this aggressive war:\r\n\r\n    “During the night from the 21st to the 22nd of June 1941,\r\n    Ribbentrop called me in for a conference in the Foreign Office\r\n    Building at about 5 o’clock in the morning, at which\r\n    representatives of the domestic and foreign press were present.\r\n    Ribbentrop informed us that the war against the Soviet Union\r\n    would start that same day and asked the German press to present\r\n    the war against the Soviet Union as a preventative war for the\r\n    defense of the Fatherland, as a war which was forced upon us\r\n    through the immediate danger of an attack of the Soviet Union\r\n    against Germany. The claim that this was a preventative war was\r\n    later repeated by the newspapers which received their\r\n    instructions from me during the usual daily parole of the Reich\r\n    Press Chief. I, myself, have also given this presentation of the\r\n    cause of the war in my regular broadcasts.” (_3469-PS_)\r\n\r\nFritzsche, throughout his affidavit, constantly refers to his expert\r\ntechnical assistance to the apparatus of the Propaganda Ministry. In\r\n1939, apparently becoming dissatisfied with the efficiency of the\r\nexisting facilities of the German Press Division, he established a new\r\ninstrument for improving the effectiveness of Nazi propaganda:\r\n\r\n    “About the summer of 1939 I established within the German Press\r\n    Division a section called ‘Speed-Service.’ * * * At the start it\r\n    had the task of checking the correctness of news from foreign\r\n    countries. Later on, about the Fall of 1939, this section also\r\n    elaborated on collecting materials which were put at the\r\n    disposal of the entire German press. For instance, dates from\r\n    the British Colonial policy, from political statements of the\r\n    British Prime Minister in former times, descriptions of social\r\n    distress in hostile countries, etc. Almost all German newspapers\r\n    used such material as a basis for their polemics. Hereby was\r\n    achieved a great unification within the fighting front of the\r\n    German press. The title ‘Speed Service’ was chosen because\r\n    materials for current comments were supplied with unusual\r\n    speed.” (_3469-PS_)\r\n\r\nThroughout this entire period preceding and including the launching of\r\naggressive wars, Fritzsche made regular radio broadcasts to the German\r\npeople under the program titles of “Political Newspaper Review,”\r\n“Political and Radio Show,” and later “Hans Fritzsche Speaks.” His\r\nbroadcasts naturally reflected the polemics and the controls of his\r\nMinistry and thus of the conspiracy. Fritzsche, the most eminent member\r\nof Goebbels’ propaganda team, helped substantially in making possible,\r\nboth within Germany and without, the conspirators’ plans for aggressive\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n C. _FRITZSCHE’S USE OF PROPAGANDA TO FURTHER THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT\r\n             ATROCITIES AND EXPLOIT OCCUPIED TERRITORIES._\r\n\r\nFritzsche incited atrocities and encouraged a ruthless occupation\r\npolicy. The results of propaganda as a weapon of the Nazi conspirators\r\nreaches into every aspect of this conspiracy, including the atrocities\r\nand ruthless exploitation in occupied countries. It is likely that many\r\nordinary Germans would never have participated in or tolerated the\r\natrocities committed throughout Europe, had they not been conditioned\r\nand goaded by the constant Nazi propaganda. The callousness and zeal of\r\nthe people who actually committed the atrocities was in large part due\r\nto the constant and corrosive propaganda of Fritzsche and his official\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\n(1) _Persecution of the Jews._ With respect to Jews, the Department of\r\nPropaganda within the Propaganda Ministry had a special branch for the\r\n“Enlightenment of the German people and of the world as to the Jewish\r\nquestion, fighting with propagandistic weapons against enemies of the\r\nState and hostile ideologies.” This quotation is taken from a book\r\nwritten in 1940 by Ministerial Director Mueller, entitled “The\r\nPropaganda Ministry.” (_2434-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn his radio broadcasts Fritzsche took a particularly active part in\r\nthis “enlightenment” concerning the Jewish question. These broadcasts\r\nwere full of provocative libels against Jews, the result of which was to\r\ninflame Germans to further atrocities against Jews. Even Streicher, the\r\nmaster Jew-baiter of all time, could scarcely outdo Fritzsche in some of\r\nhis anti-Jewish incitements. Broadcasts by Fritzsche which were\r\nmonitored and translated by the British Broadcasting Corporation are\r\nquite revealing (_3064-PS_). These radio speeches of Fritzsche were\r\nbroadcast during the period 1941-1945, which was a period of intensified\r\nanti-Jewish measures.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in a broadcast on 18 December 1941, Fritzsche declared:\r\n\r\n    “The fate of Jewry in Europe has turned out as unpleasant as the\r\n    Fuehrer predicted in the case of a European war. After the\r\n    extension of the war instigated by Jews, this unpleasant fate\r\n    may also spread to the New World, for you can hardly assume that\r\n    the nations of this New World will pardon the Jews for the\r\n    misery of which the nations of the Old World did not absolve\r\n    them.” (_3064-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 18 March 1941 Fritzsche broadcast as follows:\r\n\r\n    “But the crown of all wrongly-applied Rooseveltian logics is the\r\n    sentence ‘There never was a race and there never will be a race\r\n    which can serve the rest of mankind as a master.’ Here too we\r\n    can only applaud Mr. Roosevelt. Precisely because there exists\r\n    no race which can be the master of the rest of mankind, we\r\n    Germans have taken the liberty to break the domination of Jewry\r\n    and of its capital in Germany, of Jewry which believed to have\r\n    inherited the Crown of secret world domination.” (_3064-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 9 October 1941 Fritzsche declared over the radio:\r\n\r\n    “We know very well that these German victories, unparalleled in\r\n    history, have not yet stopped the source of hatred, which, for a\r\n    long time, has fed the war mongers and from which this war\r\n    originated. The international Jewish-Democratic Bolshevistic\r\n    campaign of incitement against Germany still finds cover in this\r\n    or that fox’s lair or rat-hole. We have seen only too frequently\r\n    how the defeats suffered by the war mongers only doubled their\r\n    senseless and impotent fury.” (_3064-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnd on 8 January 1944 Fritzsche broadcast the following:\r\n\r\n    “It is revealed clearly once more that not a system of\r\n    Government, not a young nationalism, not a new and well applied\r\n    Socialism brought about this war. The guilty ones are\r\n    exclusively the Jews and the Plutocrats. If discussion on the\r\n    post-war problems brings this to light so clearly, we welcome it\r\n    as a contribution for later discussions and also as a\r\n    contribution to the fight we are waging now, for we refuse to\r\n    believe that world history will confide its future developments\r\n    to those powers which have brought about this war. This clique\r\n    of Jews and Plutocrats have invested their money in armaments\r\n    and they had to see to it that they would get their interests\r\n    and sinking funds; hence they unleashed this war.” (_3064-PS_)\r\n\r\nFinally, in a broadcast on 13 January 1945, Fritzsche stated:\r\n\r\n    “If Jewry provided a link between divergent elements as\r\n    Plutocracy and Bolshevism and if Jewry was first able to work\r\n    successfully in the Democratic countries in preparing this war\r\n    against Germany, it has by now placed itself unreservedly on the\r\n    side of Bolshevism which, with its entirely mistaken slogans of\r\n    racial freedom against racial hatred, has created the very\r\n    conditions the Jewish race requires in its struggle for\r\n    domination over other races.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Not the last result of German resistance on the fronts, so\r\n    unexpected to the enemy, is the fruition of a development which\r\n    began in the pre-war years, the process of subordinating British\r\n    policy to far-reaching Jewish points of view. It began long\r\n    before this when Jewish emigrants from Germany started their\r\n    war-mongering against us from British and American soil.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “This whole attempt aiming at the establishment of Jewish world\r\n    domination, now increasingly recognizable, has come to a head at\r\n    the very moment when the people’s understanding of their racial\r\n    origins has been far too much awakened to promise success to the\r\n    undertaking.” (_3064-PS_)\r\n\r\nAll this was designed not only as a justification of prior anti-Jewish\r\nactions, but also as an invitation to further persecution of the Jews.\r\n\r\n(2) _Ruthless treatment of peoples of the USSR._ Fritzsche also incited\r\nand encouraged ruthless measures against the peoples of the USSR.\r\n\r\nIn his regular broadcasts Fritzsche’s incitements against the peoples of\r\nthe USSR were often linked to, and were certainly as inflammatory as,\r\nhis rantings against the Jews. It is ironic that his propaganda\r\nascribing atrocities to the peoples of the USSR are accurate\r\ndescriptions of some of the many atrocities committed by the German\r\ninvaders. Shortly after the invasion of the USSR in June 1941 Fritzsche\r\nbroadcast as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The evidence of letters reaching us from the front, of P. K.\r\n    [_Propaganda Kompanie_] reporters and soldiers on leave\r\n    demonstrates that, in this struggle in the East, not one\r\n    political system is pitted against another, not one view of life\r\n    is fighting another, but that culture, civilization, and human\r\n    decency make a stand against the diabolical principle of a\r\n    sub-human world.”\r\n\r\n    “It was only the Fuehrer’s decision to strike in time that saved\r\n    our homeland from the fate of being overrun by those sub-human\r\n    creatures, and our men, women, and children from the unspeakable\r\n    horror of being their prey.” (_3064-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn his broadcast on 10 July 1941 Fritzsche spoke of the alleged inhuman\r\ndeeds committed in various areas by the Soviet Union, and he states that\r\nupon seeing the evidence of those deeds one is\r\n\r\n    “* * * finally to make the holy resolve to give his aid in the\r\n    final destruction of those who are capable of such dastardly\r\n    acts.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Bolshevist agitators make no effort to deny that in towns,\r\n    thousands, in the villages, hundreds, of corpses of men, women\r\n    and children have been found, who had been either killed or\r\n    tortured to death. Yet the Bolshevik agitators allege that this\r\n    was not done by Soviet Commissars but by German soldiers. Now we\r\n    Germans know our soldiers. No German woman, father, or mother\r\n    requires proof that their husband or their son cannot have\r\n    committed such atrocious acts.” (_3064-PS_)\r\n\r\nEvidence to be offered by the Soviet prosecuting staff will prove that\r\nrepresentatives of the Nazi conspirators did not hesitate to exterminate\r\nSoviet soldiers and civilians by scientific mass methods. The\r\nincitements by Fritzsche make him an accomplice in these crimes. His\r\nlabeling of the Soviet peoples as members of a “sub-human world” seeking\r\nto “exterminate” the German people, and similar talk, helped fashion the\r\npsychological atmosphere of unreason and hatred which not only made\r\npossible these atrocities in the East, but made them appear a holy duty.\r\n\r\n(3) _Exploitation of occupied territories._ Fritzsche encouraged and\r\nglorified the policy of the Nazi conspirators in ruthlessly exploiting\r\nthe occupied countries. In his radio broadcast of 9 October 1941 he\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “Today we can only say: Blitzkrieg or no—this German\r\n    thunderstorm has cleansed the atmosphere of Europe. It is quite\r\n    true that the dangers threatening us were eliminated one after\r\n    the other with lightning speed; but in these lightning blows\r\n    which shattered England’s allies on the Continent, we saw not a\r\n    proof of the weakness, but a proof of the strength and\r\n    superiority of the Fuehrer’s gift as a statesman and military\r\n    leader; a proof of the German peoples’ force; we saw the proof\r\n    that no opponent can stand up to the courage, discipline, and\r\n    readiness for sacrifice displayed by the German soldier; and we\r\n    are particularly grateful for these lightning, unmatched\r\n    victories, because—as the Fuehrer emphasized last Friday—they\r\n    give us the possibility of embarking on the organization of\r\n    Europe and of lifting of the treasures of this old continent,\r\n    already now in the middle of war, without it being necessary for\r\n    millions and millions of German soldiers to be on guard,\r\n    fighting day and night along this or that threatened frontier;\r\n    and the possibilities of this continent are so rich that they\r\n    suffice for any need of peace or war.” (_3064-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn his affidavit, Fritzsche admits having encouraged the exploitation of\r\nforeign countries:\r\n\r\n    “The utilization of the productive capacity of the occupied\r\n    countries for the strengthening of the war potential, I have\r\n    openly and gloriously praised, chiefly because the competent\r\n    authorities put at my disposal much material, especially on the\r\n    voluntary placement of manpower.” (_3469-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Control of German radio._ In addition to continuing as the head of\r\nthe German Press Division until after the conspirators had begun the\r\nlast of their aggression, Fritzsche was also the high commander of the\r\nentire German radio system. In November 1942 Goebbels created a new\r\nposition, that of Plenipotentiary for the Political Organization of the\r\nGreater German Radio, a position which Fritzsche was the first and the\r\nlast to hold. In his affidavit, Fritzsche narrates how the entire German\r\nRadio and Television System was organized under his supervision:\r\n\r\n    “My office practically represented the high command of German\r\n    radio.” (_3469-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs special Plenipotentiary for the Political Organization of the Greater\r\nGerman Radio, Fritzsche issued orders to all the Reich propaganda\r\noffices by teletype. These were used in conforming the entire radio\r\napparatus of Germany to the desires of the conspirators.\r\n\r\nGoebbels customarily held an eleven o’clock conference with his closest\r\ncollaborators within the Propaganda Ministry. When both Goebbels and his\r\nundersecretary, Dr. Naumann, were absent, Goebbels, after 1943,\r\nentrusted Fritzsche with the holding of this eleven o’clock press\r\nconference.\r\n\r\nIn Goebbels’ introduction to a book by Fritzsche, called “War to the War\r\nMongers,” he took occasion to praise Fritzsche’s broadcasts in this\r\nfashion:\r\n\r\n    “Nobody knows better than I how much work is involved in those\r\n    broadcasts, how many times they were dictated within the last\r\n    minutes to find some minutes later a willing ear by the whole\r\n    nation.” (_3255-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is clear from Goebbels himself that the entire German nation was\r\nprepared to lend willing ears to Fritzsche, after he had made his\r\nreputation on the radio.\r\n\r\nThe rumor passed that Fritzsche was “His Master’s Voice” (_Die Stimme\r\nseines Herren_). This is borne out by Fritzsche’s functions. When\r\nFritzsche spoke on the radio it was plain to the German people that they\r\nwere listening to the high command of the conspirators in this field.\r\n\r\n                            D. _CONCLUSION._\r\n\r\nFritzsche was not the type of conspirator who signed decrees, or who sat\r\nin the inner councils planning the overall grand strategy. The function\r\nof propaganda is, for the most part, apart from the field of such\r\nplanning. The function of a propaganda agency is somewhat more analogous\r\nto an advertising agency or public relations department, the job of\r\nwhich is to sell the product and to win the market for the enterprise in\r\nquestion. Here the enterprise was the Nazi conspiracy. In a conspiracy\r\nwhich depends upon fraud as a means, the salesmen of the conspiratorial\r\ngroup are quite as essential and culpable as the master planners, even\r\nthough he may not have contributed substantially to the formulation of\r\nall the basic strategy, but rather concentrated on making the execution\r\nof this strategy possible. In this case, propaganda was a weapon of\r\ntremendous importance to this conspiracy. Furthermore, the leading\r\npropagandists were major accomplices in this conspiracy, and Fritzsche\r\nwas one of them.\r\n\r\nWhen Fritzsche entered the Propaganda Ministry, which has been called\r\nthe most fabulous “lie factory” of all time, and thus attached himself\r\nto the conspiracy, he did so with more of an open mind than most of the\r\nconspirators who had committed themselves at an earlier date, before the\r\nseizure of power. He was in a particularly strategic position to observe\r\nthe frauds committed upon the German people and the world by the\r\nconspirators.\r\n\r\nIn 1933, before Fritzsche took his Party oath of unconditional obedience\r\nand subservience to the Fuehrer, he had observed at first hand the\r\noperations of the storm troopers and the execution of Nazi race actions.\r\nWhen, notwithstanding, Fritzsche undertook to bring all German news\r\nagencies within Nazi control, he learned from the inside, indeed from\r\nGoebbels himself, the intrigue and lies against opposition groups within\r\nand without Germany. He observed, for example, how opposition\r\njournalists, a profession to which he had previously belonged, were\r\neither absorbed or eliminated. He continued to support the conspiracy.\r\nHe learned from day to day the art of intrigue and quackery in the\r\nprocess of perverting the German nation, and he grew in prestige and\r\ninfluence as he practiced this art.\r\n\r\nFritzsche learned a lesson from his predecessor, Berndt, who fell from\r\nthe leadership of the German Press Division partly because he\r\nover-played his hand by blunt and excessive manipulation of the\r\nSudetenland propaganda. Fritzsche stepped into the gap caused by the\r\nloss of confidence of both the editors and the German people, and did\r\nhis job with more skill and subtlety. His shrewdness and ability to be\r\nmore assuring and “to find,” as Goebbels said, “willing ears of the\r\nwhole nation,”—these things made him the more useful accomplice of the\r\nconspirators.\r\n\r\nNazi Germany and its press went into war with Fritzsche in control of\r\nall German news, whether by press or radio. In 1942, when Fritzsche\r\ntransferred from the field of the press to radio, he was not removed for\r\nbungling, but because Goebbels then needed his talents most in the field\r\nof radio. Fritzsche is not in the dock as a free journalist but as a\r\npropagandist who helped substantially to tighten the Nazi stranglehold\r\nover the German people, who made the excesses of the conspirators\r\npalatable to the German people, who goaded the German nation to fury and\r\ncrime against people they were told by him were sub-human.\r\n\r\nWithout the propaganda apparatus of the Nazi State, the world would not\r\nhave suffered the catastrophe of these years, and it is because of\r\nFritzsche’s role in behalf of the Nazi conspirators, and their deceitful\r\nand barbarous practices, that he is called to account before the\r\nInternational Military Tribunal.\r\n\r\n(See also Section 9 of Chapter VII on Propaganda, Censorship, and\r\nSupervision of Cultural Activities.)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n   LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO HANS FRITZSCHE\r\n\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n     Document     │             Description              │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                  │                                      │      │\r\n                  │Charter of the International Military │      │\r\n                  │  Tribunal, Article 6.                │  I   │       5\r\n                  │International Military Tribunal,      │      │\r\n                  │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (H);│      │\r\n                  │  Appendix A.                         │  I   │  26, 68\r\n                  │                 ————                 │      │\r\n                  │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a  │      │\r\n                  │document indicates that the document  │      │\r\n                  │was received in evidence at the       │      │\r\n                  │Nurnberg trial.

American spelling occurs throughout the document. There are\r\ndifferences in spellings of cities depending on whether the source is\r\nthe prosecutor or part of a quoted statement. Multiple occurrences of\r\nthe following spellings which differ and are found throughout this\r\nvolume are as follows:\r\n\r\n                           Luxemberg Luxembourg\r\n                            Esthonia Estonia\r\n                                Kiew Kiev\r\n                     Czecho-Slovakia Checkoslovakia\r\n\r\nAlthough some sentences may appear to have incorrect spellings or verb\r\ntenses, the original text has been maintained as presented and read into\r\nthe record and reflects the actual translations of the various national\r\ndocuments presented as material for the trial(s). This volume has no\r\nGerman, Polish, Czech, Russian or other eastern European diacritics,\r\nonly French diacritics. As a result, Goering and Fuehrer are spelled\r\nwithout umlauts throughout.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this ebook, proofers noted several errors of fact between\r\nthe text and the documents being referenced. These are noted in the text\r\nas [_sic_] next to the original text. These are:\r\n\r\n    Page 141: \"The SA Conquors Rastenberg,\" 26 January, 1936[_sic_]:\r\n    p. 7. The correct date was 26 January, =1935=.\r\n\r\n    Page 196: “_The Purge of 20[_sic_] June 1934._” Should read\r\n    “_The Purge of =30= June 1934._”\r\n\r\n    Page 196: Himmler referred to this same event in his Posen\r\n    speech when he is quoted “Just as we did not hesitate on June\r\n    20[_sic_] 1934, to do the duty we were bidden . . .” should also\r\n    read June =30= 1934.\r\n\r\n    Page 695: A photograph published in “_Der Stuermer_” in April\r\n    1937 . . . “Ritual murder at Polna . . . by the Jews Hilsner,\r\n    Erdmann[_sic_], and Wassermann, taken from a contemporary\r\n    postcard” . . . The actual “_Der Stuermer_” edition has the\r\n    photograph caption “by the Jews Hilsner, =Erbmann=, and\r\n    Wassermann . . .”\r\n\r\n    Page 700: “The fire-brigades, which had been notified\r\n    immediately, saw to it that the fire was continued[_sic_] to the\r\n    original outbreak.” The actual document states that the fire was\r\n    =confined=, and not continued, to the original outbreak.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to produce this ebook in a format as close as\r\npossible to the original document's presentation and layout.\r\n\r\n[The end of _Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression (Vol. 2)_, by Various.]",
