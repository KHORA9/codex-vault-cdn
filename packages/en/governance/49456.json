In no other representative\r\ncharacter is personality so clearly defined; in no other is the range\r\nof expression and of action so great.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInexhaustible are his activities, and of endless variety the moments\r\nof thought and of action in which the soul of the nation has been\r\nthus caught and fixed. Uncle Sam, farmer, householder, and landed\r\nproprietor, has domestic responsibilities upon a scale never\r\nknown before. One sees him, too complacently,--in a rich-Jonathan\r\nmoment,--riding the reapers and gathering in inexhaustible harvests;\r\none sees him waking sleepily from a Rip-van-Winkle drowsiness, to guard\r\nhis forests and waterfalls from despoiling hands; or, with a face less\r\nfirm than it should have been, settling a dispute among the children,\r\nperhaps in a threatened nation-wide strike. There is often a fatherly\r\nor grandfatherly touch about him; guardian of western lands and seas,\r\nhe has not only his own but his step-children to look after.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne cannot touch the many aspects of his whimsical, doubting,\r\ndetermined, sensitive face. Nearly the whole range of human feeling, of\r\nhuman expression is there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHonestly he tries to secure a right balancing of the scales of\r\njustice for his multifarious offspring, yet often finds this delicate\r\nadjustment puzzling beyond his power to endure. Swift are the changes\r\nwhereby his Hamlet moments of indecision slip into his Napoleonic\r\nmoments of great deeds. Something of woman’s intuition is in him, and\r\nsometimes, too, woman’s over-ready action in the line of eager and\r\nsudden conviction; yet again, sinewy, virile, he shows the muscles\r\nstiffening along his arm, and he is become the very incarnation of lean\r\nand powerful masculinity, moving determinedly to a goal seen steadily\r\nfrom the beginning.\r\n\r\n                           Margaret Sherwood in _The Atlantic Monthly_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\n     ESTABLISHED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A POPULAR INTEREST IN ART,\r\n        LITERATURE, MUSIC, SCIENCE, HISTORY, NATURE AND TRAVEL\r\n\r\n                 THE MENTOR IS PUBLISHED TWICE A MONTH\r\n\r\n     BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC., AT 114-116 EAST 16TH STREET,\r\n      NEW YORK, N.

In the fight against two far more\r\ndangerous and insidious foes with whom we are _always_ at war--Disease\r\nand Ignorance--our doctors have the aid and guidance of the United\r\nStates Public Health Service and our schools that of the United\r\nStates Bureau of Education. These Federal institutions are aided,\r\nrespectively, by state and local boards of health and by state and\r\nlocal boards of education.\r\n\r\nThe Public Health Service, which is a branch of the Treasury\r\nDepartment, was formerly called the Marine Hospital Service, and was\r\noriginally devoted only to caring for sick and disabled seamen of\r\nthe American merchant marine. Today it is safeguarding the health of\r\neverybody in the country. It maintains quarantine stations and offices\r\nfor the medical inspection of immigrants at the principal seaports;\r\nestablishes domestic quarantines, when necessary, to prevent the spread\r\nof disease from state to state; investigates and suppresses epidemics;\r\ncollects and publishes health statistics; makes elaborate studies\r\nof important diseases, such as hookworm disease, malaria, pellagra,\r\ntrachoma, typhoid fever, and tuberculosis; investigates public water\r\nsupplies and sewage; carries on research in regard to school, mental\r\nand industrial hygiene; and, last but not least, educates the people\r\nin hygiene and sanitation by distributing tons of literature, holding\r\nexhibits, giving lectures, lending lantern-slides, et cetera. During\r\na recent outbreak of influenza the Public Health Service distributed\r\n6,000,000 leaflets in regard to the disease. A new duty of the Service\r\nis to operate hospitals for the physical restoration and re-education\r\nof discharged soldiers disabled in the World War. The Service has\r\nestablished a Sanitary Reserve Corps, consisting of medical men and\r\nothers who are available for active duty in time of national emergency.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Education, which is under the Department of the\r\nInterior, is the national clearing-house of information on educational\r\nsubjects. This information is set forth in a large number of valuable\r\npublications, and the Bureau also maintains a corps of experts who\r\ntravel about the country giving advice and conducting investigations\r\nin regard to various lines of education. One of the duties of this\r\nBureau is to supervise the expenditure of the liberal funds provided\r\nby the Government toward the support of agricultural and mechanical\r\ncolleges, commonly known as the “land-grant colleges.” Another is to\r\noperate schools for the education of native children in Alaska and\r\nto look after the Government reindeer industry in that territory. A\r\ncomparatively recent undertaking is the promotion of home gardening\r\nunder school direction in cities and towns throughout the country,\r\nand the organization of a School Garden Army, which has materially\r\nincreased the national food-supply.\r\n\r\nAnother educational agency of the Government is the Federal Board for\r\nVocational Education, which was organized in the year 1917. This Board\r\ndirects a scheme of cooperation between the Federal Government and\r\nthe states for the promotion of vocational education in the fields\r\nof agriculture, home economics and the industrial arts. Congress\r\nhas made liberal appropriations for this work, and these are to be\r\nincreased annually until they amount to $7,367,000 a year. Each state\r\nis required to spend as much for vocational education as it receives\r\nfrom the national Government for the same purpose. Before this plan\r\nwas inaugurated, the training of young people at public expense for\r\ndefinite trades and industries had made little progress in the United\r\nStates. Since the World War the Board has had charge of the training\r\nand education of discharged and disabled soldiers and sailors. This\r\nwork is carried on in the various technical, trade and commercial\r\nschools of the country, or other institutions offering special courses,\r\nand also directly in the trades and industries. It is not limited to\r\nmanual training. The Board has announced that “all careers are open to\r\nthe disabled men.”\r\n\r\nThis educational work must not be confused with that carried on for\r\ndischarged soldiers in the hospitals conducted by the Public Health\r\nService, and for soldiers still in service in the Army hospitals.\r\n\r\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 7, No. 11, SERIAL No. 183\r\n    COPYRIGHT, 1919, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BOYS’ CORN CLUB--COUNTY AGENT GIVING INSTRUCTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE STORY OF UNCLE SAM_\r\n\r\n_The Department of Agriculture_\r\n\r\nTWO\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would take a good-sized library to tell adequately all the things\r\nthe Department of Agriculture is doing for the people of the United\r\nStates. A formal program issued each year sets forth in barest outlines\r\nthe undertakings on which the Department is engaged. Although only\r\na few brief paragraphs are devoted to each project, one of these\r\n“Programs of Work” fills about 600 pages of fine print.\r\n\r\nThis Department is devoted to the two-fold task of gathering and\r\ndisseminating information; primarily for the benefit of farmers, but\r\nalso, directly or indirectly, for that of every man, woman and child in\r\nthis country. It is also charged with the duty of administering various\r\nlaws designed to safeguard the health and welfare of the people. Under\r\nthis head come the inspection of food and drugs, meat inspection,\r\nprotection of useful birds and animals, supervision of the national\r\nforests, and a host of other useful activities.\r\n\r\nLet us set down at random some of the astonishingly varied tasks with\r\nwhich the Department has lately been occupied. Last year nearly sixty\r\nmillion animals were slaughtered for food under the inspection of the\r\nBureau of Animal Industry. The Biological Survey treated more than\r\nthirteen million acres of land with poisoned grain to destroy rodent\r\npests. The Bureau of Crop Estimates published monthly data obtained\r\nfrom an army of about two hundred thousand volunteer crop reporters.\r\nThe Bureau of Public Roads administered the Federal-Aid Road Act of\r\nJuly 11, 1916, under which the Government is to cooperate with the\r\nstates in road-building by means of appropriations which began with\r\n$5,000,000 for the year 1916, and will increase annually by $5,000,000\r\nto $25,000,000 for the year 1921. The Bureau of Soils continued its\r\nwork of mapping and classifying the soils, which work now extends\r\nover nearly a million square miles. The Weather Bureau established\r\nnew observing stations in the West Indies, to keep a lookout for\r\nhurricanes, and added the study of volcanic phenomena to its wide range\r\nof scientific undertakings. The Federal Horticultural Board conducted\r\nan immense campaign to rid the cotton-growing regions of the country of\r\nthe pink boll-worm. The Department as a whole led a nation-wide effort\r\nto provide means of feeding a hungry world. In a single year the area\r\nplanted with agricultural crops was increased by 22,000,000 acres. In\r\n1918 the planted area amounted to 289,000,000 acres. During the same\r\nyear the country produced about nineteen and a half billion pounds of\r\nmeat: an increase of about four billion pounds since 1914.\r\n\r\nA branch of the Department known as the States Relations Service is\r\nengaged in educational work on a vast scale. All over the country\r\nits “county agents” are giving direct instruction and advice to the\r\nfarmers. There are about twenty-four hundred of these officials now\r\nin the field, besides 1,700 “home demonstration agents,” who help the\r\nfarmers’ wives to solve their domestic problems. Farm work is made\r\ninteresting and profitable to the rising generation by means of some\r\nforty different kinds of clubs, such as Pig Clubs, Corn Clubs, Canning\r\nClubs and Poultry Clubs, in which are enrolled more than two million\r\nboys and girls.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Department is by far the largest publisher of agricultural\r\ninformation in the world. Last year it issued over twenty-five hundred\r\ndocuments of all kinds, in editions aggregating nearly one hundred\r\nmillion copies. Included in this stupendous flood of literature were\r\nmillions of copies of Farmers’ Bulletins, distributed free of charge,\r\nand each devoted to some practical topic connected with rural life and\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 7, No. 11, SERIAL No. 183\r\n    COPYRIGHT, 1919, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXHIBIT OF BUREAU OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC COMMERCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE STORY OF UNCLE SAM_\r\n\r\n_Promoting Commerce_\r\n\r\nTHREE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department of Commerce, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal\r\nReserve Board, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Bureau of\r\nMarkets, the Shipping Board, and many other agencies of the Federal\r\nGovernment are engaged in promoting and regulating the commercial\r\nbusiness of the country. The Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce,\r\na branch of the Department of Commerce, collects information about\r\nforeign markets for American goods from American consuls, commercial\r\nattachés stationed at the principal foreign capitals, and a corps of\r\ntraveling special agents. The Bureau issues a daily newspaper called\r\n_Commerce Reports_, containing notes and articles of commercial\r\ninterest from all parts of the world and a list of “Foreign Trade\r\nOpportunities.” Each of these “opportunities” for American business in\r\nsome foreign country is set forth in a brief paragraph. The following\r\nare examples:\r\n\r\n    29267.*--Chemicals, and equipment and supplies for\r\n    electroplating work are required by a firm in Denmark.\r\n    Correspondence may be in English. Reference.\r\n\r\n    29268.*--A company in India desires to purchase and secure an\r\n    agency for the sale of steel and iron in bars, sheets, tubes,\r\n    plates, etc.; builders’ and engineers’ hardware; caustic soda;\r\n    and petroleum and lubricating oils. References.\r\n\r\n    29269.*--The purchase of plywood and veneers in all thicknesses\r\n    and sizes is desired by a man in England. Terms, credit\r\n    preferred, or will pay cash against documents. References.\r\n\r\nAn American manufacturer or exporter who is interested in one of these\r\nnotices can obtain the address of the foreign concern that desires\r\ngoods, agencies, etc., by writing to the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic\r\nCommerce, in Washington. The Bureau maintains district offices in\r\nseveral large American cities. At the New York office, which is in\r\nthe Custom House, there is a permanent exhibit of samples showing the\r\nvarious kinds of foreign-made goods sold in the principal importing\r\ncountries of the world. The exhibits, after being shown first in New\r\nYork, are usually shown in the principal centers of the particular\r\nindustry concerned. Special exhibits of samples are also held in\r\nconnection with trade conventions. Apart from _Commerce Reports_,\r\nthe Bureau publishes an immense amount of statistical information\r\nconcerning the foreign commerce of the United States and foreign\r\ntariffs, and also extensive studies of foreign markets for particular\r\nlines of goods.\r\n\r\nThe other bureaus of the Department of Commerce are the Bureau of\r\nStandards, which facilitates commerce by regulating weights and\r\nmeasures and by carrying on scientific research relating to all the\r\nmanufacturing industries; the Bureau of the Census, which compiles\r\nelaborate statistics concerning trade and industry, as well as those\r\nrelating to population; the Bureau of Fisheries, which has immensely\r\nstimulated trade in fishery products; and four bureaus which aid,\r\nprotect and regulate navigation--the Bureau of Lighthouses, the Coast\r\nand Geodetic Survey, the Steamboat-Inspection Service, and the Bureau\r\nof Navigation.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Trade Commission is charged with the duty of preventing\r\nvarious abuses in interstate business, especially in the nature of\r\nunlawful trusts and combinations. The Federal Reserve Board supervises\r\nthe affairs of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks, and indirectly\r\nexercises a certain amount of control over the banking system of the\r\ncountry. The Interstate Commerce Commission regulates interstate\r\ntransportation, controls freight rates and passenger fares, and\r\npromotes the safety of travel by prescribing rules concerning equipment\r\nand methods of operation. The Bureau of Markets of the Department of\r\nAgriculture promotes business in all kinds of agricultural products,\r\nand maintains a market news service. The Shipping Board, which was\r\nestablished in 1916, is engaged in the very important work of building\r\nup the American merchant marine.\r\n\r\nThe Pan American Union, a potent factor in promoting our trade with\r\nthe Latin-American countries, is not a branch of the United States\r\nGovernment, but an international organization in which all the American\r\nrepublics are represented. It has its permanent headquarters in\r\nWashington, and the Secretary of State of the United States is _ex\r\nofficio_ chairman of its governing board.\r\n\r\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 7, No. 11, SERIAL No. 183\r\n    COPYRIGHT, 1919, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMMIGRATION STATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR.\r\nHONOLULU--JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS AWAITING EXAMINATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE STORY OF UNCLE SAM_\r\n\r\n_The Department of Labor_\r\n\r\nFOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his annual report for the year 1918, the Secretary of Labor declared\r\nthat “had the Department of Labor not existed at the beginning of the\r\nwar, Congress would have been obliged to create such a department.”\r\nDuring that year, mainly under the stress of war conditions, the number\r\nof bureaus in this department increased from four to thirteen, and\r\nimmense efforts were put forth by it to promote the smooth running\r\nof industrial machinery at home, so that the military forces might\r\nsuccessfully prosecute their great task abroad.\r\n\r\nIn normal times the chief purpose of the Department is, as stated in\r\nthe Act creating it, “to foster, promote and develop the welfare of the\r\nwage-earners of the United States, to improve their working conditions,\r\nand to advance their opportunities for profitable employment.” To\r\nthis end the Department collects, digests and publishes statistics\r\nand information concerning labor at home and abroad; supervises the\r\nadmission of immigrants into the country and their naturalization; and\r\naids in the adjustment of disputes between workmen and their employers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting branches of this Department is known\r\nas the Children’s Bureau. The law provides that this Bureau “shall\r\ninvestigate and report upon all matters pertaining to the welfare of\r\nchildren and child life among all classes of our people, and shall\r\nespecially investigate the questions of infant mortality, the birth\r\nrate, orphanage, juvenile courts, desertion, dangerous occupations,\r\naccidents and diseases of children, employment, and legislation\r\naffecting children in the several states and territories.” The\r\nChildren’s Bureau has been especially identified with efforts to secure\r\neffective laws restricting child labor, and it furnished the machinery\r\nfor administering the United States Child-Labor Law which went into\r\noperation September 1, 1917, only to be set aside the following\r\nJune, when it was pronounced unconstitutional by the United States\r\nSupreme Court. The Court unanimously agreed, however, that child labor\r\nis an evil, and Federal legislation on this important subject not\r\ninconsistent with the Constitution will doubtless be eventually enacted.\r\n\r\nA notable development of the war was the United States Employment\r\nService. The Department of Labor had previously maintained an\r\nemployment service in a small way under the Bureau of Immigration\r\nfor the purpose of helping newly-arrived immigrants to find work.\r\nDuring the war this expanded into a vast organization for mobilizing\r\nthe labor resources of the country. About eight hundred public\r\nemployment exchanges were opened, and labor was moved from place to\r\nplace as required, whether for war industries, for harvesting the\r\ncrops, or for other purposes. During the year 1918 nearly two million\r\nwage-earners were placed by this service in positions for which\r\nthey were qualified and in which their services were needed. After\r\nthe armistice an important branch of the work consisted in finding\r\npositions for discharged soldiers. As a means of recruiting workers\r\nfor the industries of the country and helping solve the problem of\r\nunemployment, this service is one of the most promising undertakings\r\nof the Government, but its future depends upon further legislation by\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year before the war began in Europe the number of\r\nimmigrants admitted to the United States was 1,218,480. The laws\r\nrelating to immigration and the Chinese-exclusion laws are administered\r\nby a branch of the Department of Labor known as the Bureau of\r\nImmigration. Immigration stations are maintained at the principal\r\nseaports, where physical, mental and moral defectives, as well as\r\npersons likely to become public charges or afflicted with contagious\r\ndiseases, polygamists, anarchists, contract laborers and Chinese are\r\neliminated. The most important immigration station is at Ellis Island,\r\nin New York Harbor.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Naturalization, besides supervising the work of the\r\ncourts in naturalizing aliens, is in charge of an extensive campaign of\r\neducating and Americanizing prospective citizens.\r\n\r\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 7, No. 11, SERIAL No. 183\r\n    COPYRIGHT, 1919, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EQUIPMENT OF A POSTAL MOTOR TRUCK ROUTE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE STORY OF UNCLE SAM_\r\n\r\n_The Postal Service_\r\n\r\nFIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1790 there were 75 postoffices in the United States. In\r\n1918 there were 54,345. The number of pieces of mail handled in a year\r\napproximates twenty million. In order to operate this vast business\r\nenterprise Uncle Sam requires the services of 300,000 people.\r\n\r\nThe Postoffice Department, constant in service, day and night, probably\r\nhas no rival among Government institutions. In 1863 the free delivery\r\nof mail was undertaken in half a hundred cities, with 449 carriers. In\r\n1918 there were 2,000 city delivery offices, with 35,000 carriers. The\r\nfirst rural free delivery routes, three in number, were established\r\nas an experiment in 1896. There are now considerably more than a\r\nmillion miles of such routes, employing over forty thousand carriers.\r\nSpecial delivery service was established in 1885. In an average year\r\nthe number of pieces of mail handled by special delivery approximates\r\nfifty million. In 1865 there were 419 money-order offices and the\r\nmoney orders issued amounted to $1,360,122. In 1918 only a very small\r\npercentage of postoffices did not issue money orders, and the value of\r\nthe orders amounted to $940,575,219.\r\n\r\nThe postal savings system was begun in 1911. Within six years there\r\nwere upward of six thousand postoffices that received deposits and\r\nthe amount to the credit of depositors was nearly $150,000,000. The\r\nsmallest deposit accepted is $1, but smaller amounts may be saved by\r\npurchasing a 10-cent savings card and affixing 10-cent savings stamps.\r\nInterest is allowed at the rate of 2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe parcel post system dates from 1913. It has gradually been made more\r\nserviceable to the public by the removal of restrictions regarding the\r\nsize, weight, packing and nature of shipments and by the increased use\r\nof motor vehicles. The Department estimates that 3,000,000,000 parcels\r\nwere handled in 1918.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 1918, the first regular air mail route was established in\r\nthis country between Washington, Philadelphia and New York. The flight\r\nbetween Washington and New York requires approximately two hours, as\r\ncompared with five hours by the fastest railway trains. Other routes\r\nare in course of development.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the World War the Postoffice Department\r\noperated the telegraph and telephone systems of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1918 the Department inaugurated a system of motor-truck\r\nparcel post routes, especially to facilitate the distribution of\r\nfood stuffs. The trucks are owned by the Government and many former\r\nArmy trucks are now utilized in this service. A great variety of\r\nmerchandize is hauled along these routes; all sorts of farm products\r\nare carried to the city markets and the merchandize purchased in the\r\ncity is distributed through the rural districts on the return trip.\r\nThe trucks pick up parcels anywhere along their routes--not merely at\r\npostoffices, but at farmhouses--and deliver in the same way.

In fact, in the payment of pensions to former\r\nsoldiers and sailors, and their families, not only as compensation\r\nfor wounds or other disabilities incurred in the service, but also as\r\na reward for brief participation in a war, this country has carried\r\nliberality to an extreme not approached by any other nation. The\r\nRevolutionary War cost the United States about $70,000,000 in pensions,\r\nand every subsequent war, except the recent world struggle, has added\r\nto the pension roll, which reached its high-water mark in the year\r\n1905, with a total of 998,441 pensioners, while the annual payments\r\nrose to a maximum of $174,171,661 in 1913. The Pension Office is still\r\none of the largest and busiest establishments of the Government,\r\nalthough our latest war added practically nothing to its labors.\r\n\r\nShortly after the World War began, and long before the United States\r\nbecame a participator, Congress established a new office under the\r\nTreasury Department known as the Bureau of War Risk Insurance, for the\r\npurpose of insuring American vessels and their cargoes against the\r\nrisks of war. In June, 1917, the Government provided insurance for the\r\nofficers and crews of such vessels. Finally, in October, 1917, the\r\nBureau of War Risk Insurance became the agency for a vast scheme of\r\nprotection and compensation afforded to the soldiers and sailors of\r\nthe United States and their families--a substitute for the old plan\r\nof war pensions. Under the new plan three forms of financial aid were\r\nrendered, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Allotments and Allowances._ Every enlisted man was required to\r\nallot at least $15 a month from his pay to his wife and children\r\nand other dependents. To this amount the Government added family\r\nallowances, up to a maximum of $50 a month.\r\n\r\n2. _Compensation for Death or Disability._ This applies to officers\r\nand enlisted men alike, and is the same for all ranks, but varies with\r\nthe size of the soldier’s or sailor’s family. A bachelor, without\r\ndependents, gets $30 a month for total disability incurred in the war,\r\nwhile a married man with three or more children may receive as much\r\nas $75 a month. The disabled veteran is also entitled to free medical\r\nand hospital service, artificial limbs, et cetera. In case of death\r\nresulting from injury in the line of duty, the widow and family receive\r\nmonthly allowances.\r\n\r\n3. _Government Insurance._ During the war all persons in the military\r\nand naval services were granted the privilege of taking out insurance\r\nagainst death or total disability (whether due to war service or\r\notherwise) up to the amount of $10,000, at a very low cost. This was\r\nentirely distinct from and in addition to the compensation provided\r\nas mentioned in the foregoing paragraph. The war insurance runs for a\r\nperiod of five years after the war, and may then be converted into any\r\nof the ordinary forms of insurance offered by commercial companies,\r\nwithout medical examination. Up to July 1, 1918, the Government\r\nreceived 2,579,912 applications for insurance under this novel plan,\r\nrepresenting $21,640,065,000 of insurance--an amount about equal to\r\nthat carried by all the insurance companies of the United States. In\r\nsome regiments every man was insured for $10,000, the maximum amount\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of War Risk Insurance occupies a magnificent new building in\r\nWashington and has about 15,000 employees.\r\n\r\nBesides making these liberal provisions for the relief of its disabled\r\nsoldiers and sailors, the Government has embarked upon elaborate\r\nmeasures for restoring them to health and efficiency. They are not only\r\ngiven the best medical and physical treatment known to science, but\r\nalso taught various trades and occupations, suited to their condition\r\nand natural aptitudes. During the period of treatment and training they\r\nreceive an allowance for the support of themselves and their families.\r\nThe Army and Navy, the Public Health Service, the Federal Board for\r\nVocational Education and the Bureau of War Risk Insurance all take part\r\nin this paternal enterprise.\r\n\r\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 7, No. 11, SERIAL No. 183\r\n    COPYRIGHT, 1919, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MENTOR · DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nSERIAL NUMBER 183\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNCLE SAM\r\n\r\nA statuette popular during the World War]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “REST HAVEN,” WAUKESHA, WISCONSIN\r\n\r\nDischarged soldiers, sailors and marines, patients of The Bureau of War\r\nRisk Insurance, receive free medical treatment for mental and nervous\r\ndisorders at this sanatorium]\r\n\r\nUNCLE SAM\r\n\r\n_And What He Does For His Relatives_\r\n\r\nBy PROF.

He was her Uncle Sam, the representative\r\nin human form of America, particularly of the Government at Washington,\r\nthat mid-point of the strong, and protection of the weak. Yet after all\r\nshe missed the great idea that whoever dies and whoever lives, Uncle\r\nSam is eternal; for Uncle Sam is the American people governing itself.\r\nHe is the emblem of the force and courage and resolution of the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Birth of Uncle Sam_\r\n\r\nAmong the names by which American heroes and popular figures have\r\nbeen called, how did Uncle Sam come to be adopted as the national\r\ndenominator? As well ask why Americans were called Yankees, long\r\nbefore the Revolution, or why “Yanks” has been the name applied by\r\nAllied soldiers to the forces of the United States in the European\r\nbattlefields, and has been accepted by regiments from North and South\r\nalike. As well try to run down the first use of “Brother Jonathan,” in\r\nmuch the same sense as that in which we now employ “Uncle Sam.” Learned\r\nmen and some of the unlearned have delved deep to find the origin of\r\nthe term Uncle Sam, and the significance of his out-of-style clothes.\r\n\r\nOne school of these explorers has presumed to trace Uncle Sam back to\r\nan obscure Samuel Wilson, who during the War of 1812 was engaged in a\r\ngovernment contract for beef and pork to feed the United States army.\r\nNobody mentioned this yarn until thirty years later, when Jack Frost in\r\nhis _Book of the Navy_ gave it currency, without stating where he found\r\nwhat he himself calls “a silly joke.” Frost asserts that from casks\r\nmarked “U. S.” by Samuel Wilson, the idea was taken by the soldiers,\r\nand that gradually it spread through the army and the nation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EARLY PORTRAYAL OF UNCLE SAM\r\n\r\nA reproduction of the title page of the first illustrated comic paper\r\nin the United States, 1846]\r\n\r\nThe only facts that can be ascertained on this subject are that in 1813\r\nthere was a firm of meat packers at Troy, in which Samuel Wilson was\r\na partner. Then that on September 7, 1813, the Troy _Post_ printed an\r\narticle containing the expression “Loss upon loss, and no ill luck …\r\nexcept what lights upon UNCLE SAM’S shoulders.” A note in the newspaper\r\ngoes on to say “This cant name for our government has got almost as\r\ncurrent as ‘John Bull.’ The letters ‘U. S.’ on the government wagons,\r\netc., are supposed to have given rise to it.” A month later another\r\npaper commented on the number of deserters in the army, adding “The\r\npretence is, that _Uncle Sam_, a now popular explication of the U. S.,\r\ndoes not pay well.”\r\n\r\nThree or four years later, other newspapers, who appeared to have no\r\nknowledge of Samuel Wilson, made the far more probable explanation\r\nthat the term Uncle Sam was simply taken from the letters “U. S.”\r\non soldiers’ caps and knapsacks. Even the Indians accepted the new\r\nterm, and when President Madison was at the northern front asked the\r\nprivilege “to shake hands with Uncle Sam.”[A]\r\n\r\n[A] Note--We have the word of one searcher that as early as 1807 a\r\nregiment of Light Dragoons was raised whose initials, “U. S. L. D.,” on\r\nwagons and accouterment were waggishly interpreted to mean “Uncle Sam’s\r\nLazy Dogs.”\r\n\r\nUncle Sam’s clothes, like the Quaker dress, were not invented to be\r\nhumorous, but as the fashionable costume of the period when Quakers’\r\nand Uncle Sam’s began to appear. Trousers with straps under the\r\ninsteps were still worn down to fifty years ago. In the days when the\r\nstriped cotton trousers of the French soldiers began to drive out the\r\nold-fashioned knee breeches, Uncle Sam came by his lower protection\r\nnaturally. The broad-brimmed beaver hat, till very recently, could\r\nbe seen on the heads of wealthy Quaker bankers in Philadelphia. The\r\nstar-spangled coats and correctly flag-striped trousers are of course\r\nthe inventions of later patriotic times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAFEGUARDING IMMIGRATION\r\n\r\nAsiatic Detention Quarters at Angel Island, San Francisco Bay]\r\n\r\n\r\n_What Does Uncle Sam Do for His Nephews and Nieces?_\r\n\r\nThe great thing about Uncle Sam is his dignity, activity, keenness,\r\nendless good nature and love of his countrymen. His cousin, John\r\nBull, is the beefy, sturdy, pragmatic, land-owning squire of the\r\nBritish counties, brave enough, resolute enough, but a defender of\r\nhis country, rather than its most intimate friend. Uncle Sam and the\r\npopular interest in his thousands of portraits are standing proofs of\r\nthe common sense and good temper of the American people. We like in\r\nUncle Sam what we like in our personal Uncle Ezra, or Uncle Peyton, his\r\ngenuine, affectionate, thoughtful and protecting affection for us.\r\n\r\nThe three men in American history who have most nearly corresponded to\r\nUncle Sam in their own personal relations with their fellow men were\r\nAndrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. Jackson was\r\ntesty, and sharp tempered, but he could be very genial and gallant\r\nwhen he chose. Lincoln was the Uncle Abe of the nation; in person, in\r\nspeech, in action, and above all in his great affectionate heart he was\r\nwhat we like to think Uncle Sam is. Theodore Roosevelt was not so much\r\nuncle as brother; there is only one “T. R.” in our history!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXHIBIT OF UNITED STATES BUREAU OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC\r\nCOMMERCE]\r\n\r\nIn the popular thought Uncle Sam is ourselves at our best; or rather he\r\nis ourselves gathered up into one body, one agency, one force. Uncle\r\nSam stamps his initials on the public buildings, the camps, the stores,\r\nthe guns, the ships, the uniforms, the army wagons, and the army mules.\r\nUncle Sam carries the mails, prints the greenbacks, sends the seeds,\r\ndigs the canals, lays the taxes, enlists the soldiers, fights the war\r\nand makes the peace. Uncle Sam is the national Santa Claus, the trimmer\r\nof America’s Christmas tree, the free mail-order establishment, the\r\nready subscriber to all good causes. In a way, Uncle Sam means the\r\nGovernment of the United States--more accurately he stands for the\r\nhuman side of the Government, interested in the people, eager that they\r\nshould be happy, warding off dangers immediate and far away. Uncle Sam\r\nrocked the cradle of the republic and watches over it with pride, just\r\nas the wealthy and generous uncle in ordinary family life looks after a\r\nhigh-spirited bouncing niece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEATHER KIOSK OF U. S. WEATHER BUREAU\r\n\r\nA miniature observatory for the man of the street]\r\n\r\nTo come down to more precise and commonplace terms, what does the\r\ngreat Government of the United States, centered in Washington, do\r\nfor the people of the United States? The moment we attempt to make\r\na list of his benefits we discover that they outrun the capacity of\r\nany human comparison. The United States Government is more like a\r\ntelephone exchange, with direct wires to every hamlet and household.\r\nIt is like a vast school with many class rooms in which are taught\r\nvarious branches of the same subject, namely how to make the United\r\nStates citizens happier, better and more prosperous. Out of the\r\nmany radiations from this central influence, let us select a few of\r\nthose in which the benevolent side of our Government is more clearly\r\npresented. For instance, let us see what the Government does for such\r\nmatters as education, labor, agriculture, commerce, and the carrying of\r\nintelligence, for the defense of the community, and protection of free\r\ninstitutions here and elsewhere in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUREAU OF STANDARDS, WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\nAdministration Building in the center\r\n\r\nThis Bureau is the custodian of official standards of weights and\r\nmeasures and also a national physical laboratory conducting a variety\r\nof investigations for the benefit of manufacturers and others]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uncle Sam’s Schools_\r\n\r\nFor many years Uncle Sam left to the people at large the task of\r\neducating young people, except the future officers of the United States\r\narmy and much later of the navy. These schools have been kept up,\r\nenlarged and provided with magnificent buildings; and they trained\r\nnearly all the officers in high command during the world war in both\r\narmy and navy. In the course of the war the number of cadets was\r\nmuch increased; but it was found necessary hastily to set up special\r\nofficers’ schools and training corps in various parts of the country.\r\nThe United States also takes part in the public education of the\r\nstates in a variety of ways. It has given to the states for common\r\nschools about 80 million acres of land, and for agricultural colleges\r\nand similar purposes about 15 million more. Ever since 1887 it has\r\nmade also money grants to state agricultural colleges for experiment\r\nstations; and by the recent Smith-Hughes act is preparing to spend\r\nmillions for vocational instruction, including farming. The states are\r\nobliged to put up an equal amount for the same purpose. Other bills\r\nlook forward to a larger expenditure which would aid the states to\r\nget rid of the deplorable illiteracy found in some of them. Uncle Sam\r\nmaintains schools in the dependencies--the Philippines, Hawaii, Porto\r\nRico, etc.; and the Bureau of Education in Washington is a kind of\r\ncenter and clearing house of information and activity in education of\r\nevery kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION\r\n\r\nOld Building, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nThis leading scientific establishment of the Government is also a great\r\nagency for the distribution of scientific, literary and Government\r\npublications]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FARMERS’ BULLETIN\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture issued more than twenty million copies of\r\nthese bulletins last year (1918)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uncle Sam as an Employer of Labor_\r\n\r\nBy far the largest employer of labor within the United States is\r\nUncle Sam himself, who had, about the time when America entered the\r\nwar in 1917, 520,000 employees in the civil service, besides near\r\n150,000 soldiers and sailors. Besides thus furnishing a livelihood\r\nto one person in a hundred and fifty of the whole population of the\r\nUnited States, the Government carries on a Bureau of Labor, which\r\ngets together all kinds of information about labor conditions in this\r\ncountry and in other countries. In 1916, the Government passed a\r\nspecial statute for settling the troubles between the railroad men and\r\nthe railroads, commonly called the “Adamson Bill,” under which a strike\r\nwas averted and wages were raised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOTOR EQUIPMENT FOR “STAR” POSTAL ROUTE 14233\r\n\r\nFredericksburg to Kinsale, Virginia--Two long trucks and working staff\r\nof four; Driver, Assist. Postmaster, Clerk, and Delivery Messenger]\r\n\r\nDuring the war, a National War Labor Board was set up to adjust\r\ntroubles between employers and their hands working in munitions\r\nfactories and other war industries; and many serious difficulties were\r\nsettled by this official arbitration board. Thousands of workmen and\r\nworkwomen of every degree of skill were drawn into the war service of\r\nthe Government, as clerks, as workers in factories, and in many other\r\ncapacities.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the war, the Government was much opposed to\r\nallowing its employees to join in trades unions, but when, in 1917,\r\nthe railroads and later the telegraph and telephone operatives were\r\ntransferred to Government control, they carried with them their\r\nexisting unions, and even formed some new ones. Uncle Sam therefore\r\ntakes a large responsibility for labor conditions both inside and\r\noutside of the Government service.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uncle Sam as a Farmer_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DIFFICULT POSTAL TRAIL\r\n\r\nOnly about three feet wide, and running along the Hoko River from\r\nClallam Bay to Royal, Washington]\r\n\r\nAlthough farming was the main pursuit of the American people when\r\nUncle Sam first appeared on the scene, and although 33 per cent. of\r\nthe workers in the country are today busy on farms, it was many years\r\nbefore the Government of the United States aided the agriculturalist.\r\nIt began with printed reports (which, oddly enough, were issued by the\r\nPatent Office) on improved breeds of farm animals, with attractive\r\ncolored lithographs. The immense Morrill Land Grant of 1862 was\r\nintended chiefly for agricultural education, and the students and\r\ngraduates of the resulting colleges have done much to spread a\r\nknowledge of scientific farming, such as the adaptation of crops to\r\nsoil, improvement of seeds and grains, the development of high-grade\r\ncattle and other farm animals, and the protection of fruit and other\r\ncrops from insect pests.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 was established a Department of Agriculture, with a Secretary\r\nsitting in the Cabinet; and in the thirty years that have followed\r\nthe Department has wonderfully expanded its usefulness. For instance,\r\nit has discovered the cause of the Texas cattle fever, which turned\r\nout to be a tick, and has very nearly put an end to that dangerous\r\nand destructive pest; it has found a serum to prevent hog cholera; it\r\nhas established a system for checking the ravages of tuberculosis in\r\ncattle; its Bureau of Plant Industry brings in new seeds and fruits\r\nfrom all over the world--including such valuable varieties as the Durum\r\nwheat from Russia, Siberian millet and Egyptian dates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNCLE SAM’S MAIL IN DIFFICULTIES\r\n\r\nIn Northern Minnesota]\r\n\r\nClosely allied with the work of the Department of Agriculture is the\r\nirrigation service, which is reclaiming millions of acres of land\r\notherwise useless, by furnishing it with unfailing water. The National\r\nForests are under the direction of the Department of Agriculture,\r\nwhich employs about two thousand rangers and fire look-outs.[A] The\r\nBiological Survey has successfully found methods for destroying the\r\nrats, chipmunks, mice and ground squirrels which cause losses of many\r\nmillions to the farmers. Millions of copies of printed circulars and\r\npamphlets on various phases of farming are printed. No agency of\r\nthe Government reaches so great a number of the active workers and\r\nproducers of the land.\r\n\r\n[A] See Mentor Number 165, “Reclaiming the Desert,” and Mentor Number\r\n156, “The Forest.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uncle Sam in Trade_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SEASHORE MAIL ROUTE ON THE PACIFIC COAST]\r\n\r\nBesides their agriculture, our forefathers always pushed shipping\r\nand trade. They were keen on the Indian fur trade, and produced salt\r\nmeats, grain “naval stores,” (pitch, tar and turpentine), potashes\r\nand pearl ashes, timber, and other things, and sold them to European\r\ncountries. In return they imported calicoes and “oznabrigs” (which were\r\na kind of linen) “paduasoy” (which was Italian silk), hardware, guns,\r\ntools, china, and the rich cloths, velvets and satins which Colonial\r\ngentlemen delighted to wear. When the United States came into being as\r\na Government, it paid very little attention to commerce, leaving the\r\nmerchants free to develop their trade with all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is only in recent years that Uncle Sam has realized how he can help\r\nthe merchant, the shipper and the vessel owner. Not until 1903 was\r\nthere an office at Washington charged with the duty to “promote foreign\r\nand domestic commerce.” Not till 1913 was there a distinct Department\r\nof Commerce, within which were grouped some of the most important\r\nservices rendered by the nation to its people. For example, commerce\r\nincludes such varied services as lighthouses, steamboat inspection,\r\nfisheries, navigation, and the coast survey. In addition the Department\r\nof Commerce comes very near to the complicated organization of the\r\nbusiness of the country, through its Bureau of Corporations, Bureau of\r\nStandards of Weights and Measures, and Bureau of Foreign and Domestic\r\nCommerce, as well as the Census Bureau, which collects a variety of\r\nstatistics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMEN AT WORK IN A COMMUNITY CANNING KITCHEN\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of the Department of Agriculture]\r\n\r\nDuring the war, Uncle Sam stretched out his long arm still farther into\r\nthe trade and business of the country, and appointed a Director of\r\nRailroads to take control of most of the railroad lines in the land.\r\nIt was that Board which made possible the conveyance of the enormous\r\nquantities of stores and munitions which supplied our armies in France.\r\nGoing still farther, Uncle Sam took up the ship carpenter’s axe, the\r\ncaulker’s mallet, and the riveter’s electric machine. All the ship\r\nyards in the country were brought under the control and direction of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSPECTORS OF THE BUREAU OF ANIMAL INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nInspection work in a large packing house]\r\n\r\nThe Post Office has been Uncle Sam’s peculiar interest ever since\r\nthe Federal Government was founded; and he pushes that business ever\r\nfarther and farther. The letter, the newspaper, the book and the\r\npackage, are sent flying from one of the long arms of Uncle Sam to\r\nanother, till the business has come to total over three hundred million\r\ndollars a year. The registry service, special delivery system, and\r\nespecially the parcel post, bring new conveniences, and new proofs of\r\nour Uncle’s desire to be useful. In the course of the war the whole\r\nsystem of telegraphs also was taken over. Many lines of business,\r\nespecially the newspaper and periodical publishers, the mail-order\r\nhouses, and the advertisers are dependent upon this field of Government\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INFANT MORTALITY RATES (PER 1000) ACCORDING TO FATHER’S\r\nEARNINGS\r\n\r\nCombined figures from seven cities studied by U.

Children’s Bureau\r\n\r\nThe baby death rate rises as the father’s earnings fall]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uncle Sam as a Watchman_\r\n\r\nMost of all in times of danger and distress do we turn eagerly to that\r\nmultiple of ourselves, which we call Uncle Sam. In the most peaceful\r\ndays the sailor in blue or the soldier in khaki stood behind the courts\r\nand the laws and the policemen. When rioters and anarchists raised\r\ntheir heads they knew that Uncle Sam was drawn up around the corner,\r\nand would stop them whenever they passed from noisy words to desperate\r\ndeeds. “U. S.” is the trench line which protects this country from\r\ninvasion. “U. S.” builds the forts, works out plans of harbor defence,\r\nkeeps powerful ships in commission, and raises, clothes, equips, feeds,\r\nand pays the armies which are the clenched fists of the nation. Other\r\ngovernments, state, municipal and local, offer many benefits, but Uncle\r\nSam is the only American known to foreign nations as the creator of\r\narmies and the fighter of battles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELFARE WORK FOR BABIES, WHITE AND BLACK\r\n\r\nWeighing and measuring babies. Work conducted by the U. S. Children’s\r\nBureau, Department of Labor]\r\n\r\nThe mystic two letters “U. S.” which are the emblems within the United\r\nStates of peace and protection, became known in the World War far\r\nacross the seas in many lands. Disturbed and broken nations welcome\r\noccupation by United States troops, because they have learned that\r\nUncle Sam is both strong and merciful; that he hits his enemies\r\nhard; but raises up and saves the noncombatant, the neutral and the\r\nvanquished. Never has the reputation of the United States of America\r\nstood so high as a stalwart, resolute and unflinching power which puts\r\nout its wealth like water, and enlists its man-power by millions, when\r\nwar must be fought. Never has the Uncle Sam conception of the great\r\nNorth American federation been so clear and so welcome in the minds of\r\nother peoples; what can any nation ask that is better and higher than\r\nto be hailed as the defender of civilization against the most furious\r\nblows; and at the same time as the friend, ally and protector of men of\r\ngood will wherever found throughout the world? “U. S.” to hammer the\r\nHun; “Uncle Sam” to succor the Belgians and French, to aid the Armenian\r\nand the Greek, as the friend of mankind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REBUILDING THE DISABLED SOLDIER\r\n\r\nClass in physical training, Base Hospital, Camp Pike, Arkansas]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rivers, Harbors and Parks_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISABLED SOLDIERS STUDYING AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nPreparatory to practising it on a sixty-acre farm provided next to the\r\nhospital]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the vast work of reclaiming desert lands, protecting\r\nforests, and improving rivers, harbors and canals, Uncle Sam has spent\r\nmillions of dollars in opening up to the people great natural wonder\r\nrealms of the country and putting them in order for outdoor pleasure\r\ngrounds. Four National Parks--the Yellowstone, the Yosemite, Glacier\r\nNational Park and Rainier National Park have already been treated in\r\nindividual numbers of The Mentor, and future issues will be devoted to\r\nothers of these magnificent public domains. The Grand Canyon, to which\r\na Mentor number has also been given, is not one of the National Parks,\r\nbut is a Reserve set apart for all time by the Government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOOL AND GARDEN IN ALASKA\r\n\r\nA distant outpost of the Bureau of Education]\r\n\r\nMost of the National Parks are situated in the western part of the\r\ncontinent. Through the beneficence and wisdom of Uncle Sam there have\r\nbeen preserved for the American people the prehistoric dwellings of\r\nextinct races in Arizona and Colorado. Rocky Mountain Park, Colorado,\r\nand Crater National Park, southern Oregon, attract thousands of\r\nvisitors annually. Every summer, innumerable groups of Nature lovers\r\ncamp and tramp in the Government forest parks of California. In all,\r\nthere are now (1919) sixteen National Parks in the United States and\r\nAlaska, with a total area of nearly 10,000 square miles. In 1916 a\r\nNational Park was also created in the territory of Hawaii, with an area\r\nof 75,295 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Use Your Government_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRAVELING OUTFIT OF U. S. SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS IN\r\nARCTIC ALASKA]\r\n\r\nTo many of us, perhaps, Uncle Sam’s Government may appear to consist\r\nof a vast number of men using up time and money in doing a great many\r\nthings in which we see no useful purpose whatever. Other men in the\r\nLegislative Department appear to be discussing at great length the\r\nframing of new laws, good, bad or indifferent, and we criticize them\r\naccordingly. The thought that we can capitalize our citizenship in a\r\nmost valuable material way and that we can make direct personal use of\r\nthe Government, whatever our calling in life may be, few of us have\r\never realized. We have pointed out some of the ways in which Uncle Sam\r\nhelps his relatives. Whatever your chosen work may be, whatever your\r\ninterest may be, turn to Uncle Sam and learn how valuable a friend and\r\nsupport he can be.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_SUPPLEMENTARY READING_\r\n\r\n    USE YOUR GOVERNMENT                 _By Alissa Franc_\r\n    UNCLE SAM’S MODERN MIRACLES         _By W.

As a little school girl once wrote in her essay on Ancient\r\nRome, “its origin is wrapped in antiquity.” It appears that “Uncle\r\nSam” emerged from the soil and began to materialize into definite form\r\nabout one hundred years ago. A favored theory concerning the origin\r\nof the tall, lean, Yankee figure type is that he owes his peculiar\r\nidentity to a character created by Judge Thomas Haliburton, and known\r\nin literature as “Sam Slick.” Oddly enough, the creator--if we may call\r\nhim so--of the figure that now stands for the national type, was not\r\nhimself an American. Judge Thomas Haliburton was born in Windsor, Nova\r\nScotia, in December, 1796. He was a successful lawyer, and occasionally\r\ntook a turn at literature. In 1835 there appeared in a Halifax journal\r\na series of papers which were afterwards issued in book form under\r\nthe title, “The Clock-Maker, or the Sayings and Doings of Sam Slick.”\r\nIn this and in a later book “Nature and Human Nature,” the author\r\npictured an acute, good-tempered Yankee who was a native of the state\r\nof Connecticut--the state of which Jonathan Trumbull, the original\r\n“Brother Jonathan,” was governor. Haliburton described Sam Slick as “a\r\ntall, thin man with hollow cheeks and bright, twinkling, black eyes.”\r\nAs he sold his Yankee clocks he was supposed to meet on the road a\r\n“squire” who traveled some distance with him and found entertainment\r\nin Sam’s “down-east talk and shrewd Americanisms.” In England, where\r\nthe book had a wide sale, Sam Slick came to be accepted as the symbolic\r\nAmerican in speech, appearance and thought.\r\n\r\nThe _London Times_ of November 27, 1840, said: “No modern book can give\r\nbetter insight into the politics, prejudices, manners and actions of\r\nthe inhabitants of the United States than this.” Another English critic\r\nfound Sam Slick “a knowing individual, sensible, sagacious, not without\r\ntact, and overflowing with humor.” According to Sam, “Push-on--keep\r\nmovin’--go ahead,” was the maxim of the States. He described the\r\ntypical American as “the chap with speed, wind and bottom; clear grit,\r\nginger to the backbone, spry as a fox, supple as an eel.”\r\n\r\nThe illustrators of Sam Slick made him lean, smiling, and in all\r\nrespects a contrast to the heavy-set John Bull. They put on his head\r\nthe high hat and clothed him in the long-tailed coat and striped\r\ntrousers that Uncle Sam still wears. “We call the American public\r\n‘Uncle Sam,’” declared Sam Slick to the Squire, “as you call the\r\nBritish ‘John Bull.’” Sam’s humor was called “the sunny side of common\r\nsense.”\r\n\r\n“The Clock-Maker” ran into fifty editions and was as popular in\r\nAmerica and in Canada as in England--it also had many readers in\r\nFrance. So potent was the delineation of the Yankee, Sam Slick, that\r\nit established and still influences the foreign estimate of citizens\r\nof the United States. Judge Haliburton had a distinguished career, the\r\nlatter part of which was passed in England--where he died in 1865.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe can see from the foregoing that there is some reason, then, for\r\nthe claim of certain chroniclers that “Sam Slick” was the original\r\nYankee character, and that Windsor, Nova Scotia, was the birthplace of\r\nthe oddly-costumed figure that now stands for the shrewd, benevolent,\r\nwide-awake and efficient personality that we call “Uncle Sam.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. D. Moffat\r\n\r\nEDITOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Service of Uncle Sam\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of us know that Uncle Sam means well by the hundred million members\r\nof his family, but few have any adequate appreciation of the many\r\nvaried forms in which Uncle Sam lends a helping hand. His service\r\nis apparent everywhere in city, town, village and farm--and in the\r\ngreat desert wastes and mountain heights. It is worth while to take a\r\nsweeping survey of the whole field of Uncle Sam’s helpful operations:\r\n\r\nHELPING THE FARMER. Uncle Sam supplies a wealth of information about\r\nthe planting and growing of crops, with crop estimates and statistics\r\nof agriculture. He supplies weather reports and gives helpful\r\ninformation on the control of destructive insects and birds--also on\r\nthe fostering and improving of live stock. He gives advice on forest\r\nlands and forest fire protection. He helps in building rural roads\r\nand assists in farm management and in the procuring of farm help. He\r\nadvises the farmer in marketing and in rural organization and farm\r\nfinance. He gives information concerning diseases prevalent in rural\r\ndistricts. He supplies courses of reading for farmer parents, and\r\nassists in the work of rural schools. He spends large sums of money\r\nin administration work in the Department of Agriculture to help the\r\ncondition of the farmer, the farmer’s wife and the girls and boys on\r\nthe farm. He directs their education and shows them how to improve\r\ntheir living conditions. His office of information supplies documents\r\nfull of valuable practical suggestions for the farmer.\r\n\r\nHELPING THE SETTLER. Uncle Sam reclaims desert lands and places them at\r\nthe disposal of settlers. He encourages the establishment of homesteads\r\nand conducts forest service and geological surveys to develop land and\r\nmake it valuable.\r\n\r\nHELPING THE BUSINESS MAN. Uncle Sam gives assistance and information\r\nto almost all businesses--and carries on, at enormous expense, special\r\nwork for the Mining, Fishing, Fur, Lumber and Shipping Industries. He\r\npursues scientific experiments with agricultural products and develops\r\nwater power for commercial use. He protects the business man with the\r\nFederal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission.\r\n\r\nHELPING THE WORKING MAN. In the Department of Labor a vast amount of\r\nService is devoted to securing employment for laborers, supplying\r\ninformation concerning labor conditions, pursuing practical\r\ninvestigations for the safety and health of the working men. He acts as\r\na community organizer, advising and supervising, and is a mediator in\r\ndisputes on labor questions.\r\n\r\nHELPING THE IMMIGRANT. He greets the immigrant with an intelligent and\r\ncareful scrutiny as to his health and general welfare. He opens the\r\neyes of the immigrant to his opportunities in the United States, and\r\nhelps him to get employment. He instills in him ideals of industry,\r\nintegrity, and good citizenship.\r\n\r\nHELPING THE NEGRO. Uncle Sam supplies statistics and detailed reports\r\nconcerning the education of the Negro. He gives assistance to the Negro\r\nfarmer, instruction to the Negro woman and children in home economics\r\nand in school and home gardening.\r\n\r\nHELPING IN THE HOME. Uncle Sam pursues investigations and gives\r\nadvice concerning the practical problems of the home. He is ever\r\ninspecting foods, drugs, meats and the quality of milk and water. He\r\nwill permit no foul or tainted food or drink to reach the mouth of the\r\nmother or children. He carries on an employment bureau of service,\r\ngiving information and advice. In the lives of children Uncle Sam’s\r\nhelping hand is ever to be found. He prepares publications and gives\r\ninformation and conducts courses for the education of children in all\r\nbranches of knowledge, stimulating, particularly, vocational education,\r\nin agriculture, and in the trades and industries. For the protection\r\nof children he enforces the Federal Child Labor Act, and to keep them\r\nwell and healthy he has devised enticing plans for outdoor occupation\r\nin school and home garden, that they may be sound, healthy and fit for\r\nworthy citizenship.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know anything about the management of the country; if\r\nyou want to make the most of yourself as a citizen, write to Uncle Sam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MENTOR]\r\n\r\nTHE PLAYGROUNDS OF UNCLE SAM\r\n\r\nThe National Parks at a Glance\r\n\r\nArranged chronologically in the order of their
