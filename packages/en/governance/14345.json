L. PUTNAM WEALE\r\n\r\nAuthor of _Indiscreet Letters from Peking_, etc.\r\n\r\nWith 28 Illustrations\r\n\r\nLondon: Hurst & Blackett, Ltd.\r\nPaternoster House, E.C.\r\n\r\n1918\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: President Li Yuan-Hung.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume tells everything that the student or the casual reader needs\r\nto know about the Chinese Question. It is sufficiently exhaustive to\r\nshow very clearly the new forces at work, and to bring some realisation\r\nof the great gulf which separates the thinking classes of to-day from\r\nthe men of a few years ago; whilst, at the same time, it is sufficiently\r\ncondensed not to overwhelm the reader with too great a multitude of\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nParticular attention may be devoted to an unique feature--namely, the\r\nChinese and Japanese documentation which affords a sharp contrast\r\nbetween varying types of Eastern brains. Thus, in the Memorandum of the\r\nBlack Dragon Society (Chapter VII) we have a very clear and illuminating\r\nrevelation of the Japanese political mind which has been trained to\r\nconsider problems in the modern Western way, but which remains saturated\r\nwith theocratic ideals in the sharpest conflict with the Twentieth\r\nCentury. In the pamphlet of Yang Tu (Chapter VIII) which launched the\r\nill-fated Monarchy Scheme and contributed so largely to the dramatic\r\ndeath of Yuan Shih-kai, we have an essentially Chinese mentality of the\r\nreactionary or corrupt type which expresses itself both on home and\r\nforeign issues in a naïvely dishonest way, helpful to future diplomacy.\r\nIn the Letter of Protest (Chapter X) against the revival of Imperialism\r\nwritten by Liang Ch'i-chao--the most brilliant scholar living--we have a\r\nChinese of the New or Liberal China, who in spite of a complete\r\nignorance of foreign languages shows a marvellous grasp of political\r\nabsolutes, and is a harbinger of the great days which must come again to\r\nCathay. In other chapters dealing with the monarchist plot we see the\r\nofficial mind at work, the telegraphic despatches exchanged between\r\nPeking and the provinces being of the highest diplomatic interest. These\r\ndocuments prove conclusively that although the Japanese is more\r\npractical than the Chinese--and more concise--there can be no question\r\nas to which brain is the more fruitful.\r\n\r\nCoupled with this discussion there is much matter giving an insight into\r\nthe extraordinary and calamitous foreign ignorance about present-day\r\nChina, an ignorance which is just as marked among those resident in the\r\ncountry as among those who have never visited it. The whole of the\r\nmaterial grouped in this novel fashion should not fail to bring\r\nconviction that the Far East, with its 500 millions of people, is\r\ndestined to play an important rôle in _postbellum_ history because of\r\nthe new type of modern spirit which is being there evolved. The\r\ninfluence of the Chinese Republic, in the opinion of the writer, cannot\r\nfail to be ultimately world-wide in view of the practically unlimited\r\nresources in man-power which it disposes of.\r\n\r\nIn the Appendices will be found every document of importance for the\r\nperiod under examination,--1911 to 1917. The writer desires to record\r\nhis indebtedness to the columns of _The Peking Gazette_, a newspaper\r\nwhich under the brilliant editorship of Eugene Ch'en--a pure Chinese\r\nborn and educated under the British flag--has fought consistently and\r\nvictoriously for Liberalism and Justice and has made the Republic a\r\nreality to countless thousands who otherwise would have refused to\r\nbelieve in it.\r\n\r\nPUTNAM WEALE.\r\n\r\nPEKING, June, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    I.--GENERAL INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n   II.--THE ENIGMA OF YUAN SHIH-KAI\r\n\r\n  III.--THE DREAM REPUBLIC\r\n        (From the Manchu Abdication to the dissolution of Parliament)\r\n\r\n   IV.--THE DICTATOR AT WORK\r\n        (From the Coup d'état of the 4th Nov. 1913 to the outbreak of the\r\n        World-war, 1st August, 1914)\r\n\r\n    V.--THE FACTOR OF JAPAN\r\n\r\n   VI.--THE TWENTY-ONE DEMANDS\r\n\r\n  VII.--THE ORIGIN OF THE TWENTY-ONE DEMANDS\r\n\r\n VIII.--THE MONARCHIST PLOT\r\n        1º The Pamphlet of Yang Tu\r\n\r\n   IX.--THE MONARCHY PLOT\r\n        2º Dr. Goodnow's Memorandum\r\n\r\n    X.--THE MONARCHY MOVEMENT IS OPPOSED\r\n        The Appeal of the Scholar Liang Chi-chao\r\n\r\n   XI.--THE DREAM EMPIRE\r\n        (\"The People's Voice\" and the action of the Powers)\r\n\r\n  XII.--\"THE THIRD REVOLUTION\"\r\n        The Revolt of Yunnan\r\n\r\n XIII.--\"THE THIRD REVOLUTION\" (_continued_)\r\n        Downfall and Death of Yuan Shih-kai\r\n\r\n  XIV.--THE NEW RÉGIME--FROM 1916 TO 1917\r\n\r\n   XV.--THE REPUBLIC IN COLLISION WITH REALITY: TWO TYPICAL INSTANCES OF\r\n        \"FOREIGN AGGRESSION\"\r\n\r\n  XVI.--CHINA AND THE WAR\r\n\r\n XVII.--THE FINAL PROBLEM:--REMODELLING THE POLITICO-ECONOMIC\r\n        RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA AND THE WORLD\r\n\r\n        APPENDICES--DOCUMENTS AND MEMORANDA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n  President Li Yuan-Hung\r\n\r\n  The Funeral of Yuan-Shih-kai: The Procession passing down the great\r\n  Palace Approach with the famous Ch'ien Men (Gate) in the distance\r\n\r\n  The Provincial Troops of General Chang Hsun at his Headquarters of\r\n  Hsuchowfu\r\n\r\n  The Funeral of Yuan Shih-kai: The Catafalque over the Coffin on its\r\n  way to the Railway Station\r\n\r\n  The Funeral of Yuan Shih-kai: The Procession passing down the great\r\n  Palace Approach with the famous Ch'ien Men (Gate) in the distance\r\n\r\n  An Encampment of \"The Punitive Expedition\" of 1916 on the Upper\r\n  Yangtsze (_By courtesy of Major Isaac Newell, U.S. Military Attaché_.)\r\n\r\n  Revival of the Imperialistic Worship of Heaven by Yuan Shih-kai in\r\n  1914: Scene on the Altar of Heaven, with Sacrificial Officers clothed\r\n  in costumes dating from 2,000 years ago.\r\n\r\n  A Manchu Country Fair: The figures in the foreground are all Manchu\r\n  Women and Girls\r\n\r\n  A Manchu Woman grinding Grain\r\n\r\n  Silk-reeling done in the open under the Walls of Peking\r\n\r\n  Modern Peking: A Run on a Bank\r\n\r\n  The Re-opening of Parliament on August 1st, 1916, after three years of\r\n  dictatorial rule\r\n\r\n  The Original Constitutional Drafting Committee of 1913, photographed\r\n  on the Steps of the Temple of Heaven, where the Draft was completed\r\n\r\n  A Presidential Review of Troops in the Southern Hungtung Park outside\r\n  Peking: Arrival of the President\r\n\r\n  President Li Yuan-Hung and the General Staff watching the Review\r\n\r\n  March-past of an Infantry Division\r\n\r\n  Modern Peking: The Palace Entrance lined with Troops.

With the proclamation of the\r\nRepublic, the fiction of autocratic rule had truly enough vanished; yet\r\nthe tradition survived and with it sufficient of the essential machinery\r\nof Imperialism to defeat the nominal victors until the death of Yuan\r\nShih-kai.\r\n\r\nThe movement to expel the Manchus, who had seized the Dragon Throne in\r\n1644 from the expiring Ming Dynasty, was an old one. Historians are\r\nsilent on the subject of the various secret plots which were always\r\nbeing hatched to achieve that end, their silence being due to a lack of\r\nproper records and to the difficulty of establishing the simple truth in\r\na country where rumour reigns supreme. But there is little doubt that\r\nthe famous Ko-lao-hui, a Secret Society with its headquarters in the\r\nremote province of Szechuan, owed its origin to the last of the Ming\r\nadherents, who after waging a desperate guerilla warfare from the date\r\nof their expulsion from Peking, finally fell to the low level of\r\ninciting assassinations and general unrest in the vain hope that they\r\nmight some day regain their heritage. At least, we know one thing\r\ndefinitely: that the attempt on the life of the Emperor Chia Ching in\r\nthe Peking streets at the beginning of the Nineteenth Century was a\r\nSecret Society plot and brought to an abrupt end the pleasant habit of\r\ntravelling among their subjects which the great Manchu Emperors\r\nK'ang-hsi and Ch'ien Lung had inaugurated and always pursued and which\r\nhad so largely encouraged the growth of personal loyalty to a foreign\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nFrom that day onwards for over a century no Emperor ventured out from\r\nbehind the frowning Walls of the Forbidden City, save for brief annual\r\nceremonies, such as the Worship of Heaven on the occasion of the Winter\r\nSolstice, and during the two \"flights\"--first in 1860 when Peking was\r\noccupied by an Anglo-French expedition and the Court incontinently\r\nsought sanctuary in the mountain Palaces of Jehol; and, again, in 1900,\r\nwhen with the pricking of the Boxer bubble and the arrival of the\r\nInternational relief armies, the Imperial Household was forced along the\r\nstony road to far-off Hsianfu.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this immurement was soon visible; the Manchu rule, which\r\nwas emphatically a rule of the sword, was rapidly so weakened that the\r\nemperors became no more than _rois fainéants_ at the mercy of their\r\nminister.[1] The history of the Nineteenth Century is thus logically\r\nenough the history of successive collapses. Not only did overseas\r\nforeigners openly thunder at the gateways of the empire and force an\r\ningress, but native rebellions were constant and common. Leaving minor\r\ndisturbances out of account, there were during this period two huge\r\nMahommedan rebellions, besides the cataclysmic Taiping rising which\r\nlasted ten years and is supposed to have destroyed the unbelievable\r\ntotal of one hundred million persons. The empire, torn by internecine\r\nwarfare, surrendered many of its essential prerogatives to foreigners,\r\nand by accepting the principle of extraterritoriality prepared the road\r\nto ultimate collapse.\r\n\r\nHow in such circumstances was it possible to keep alive absolutism? The\r\nanswer is so curious that we must be explicit and exhaustive.\r\n\r\nThe simple truth is that save during the period of vigour immediately\r\nfollowing each foreign conquest (such as the Mongol conquest in the\r\nThirteenth Century and the Manchu in the Seventeenth) not only has there\r\nnever been any absolutism properly so-called in China, but that apart\r\nfrom the most meagre and inefficient tax-collecting and some\r\nrough-and-ready policing in and around the cities there has never been\r\nany true governing at all save what the people did for themselves or\r\nwhat they demanded of the officials as a protection against one another.\r\nAny one who doubts these statements has no inkling of those facts which\r\nare the crown as well as the foundation of the Chinese group-system, and\r\nwhich must be patiently studied in the village-life of the country to be\r\nfitly appreciated. To be quite frank, absolutism is a myth coming down\r\nfrom the days of Kublai Khan when he so proudly built his _Khanbaligh_\r\n(the Cambaluc of Marco Polo and the forebear of modern Peking) and\r\nfilled it with his troops who so soon vanished like the snows of winter.\r\nAn elaborate pretence, a deliberate policy of make-believe, ever since\r\nthose days invested Imperial Edicts with a majesty which they have never\r\nreally possessed, the effacement of the sovereign during the Nineteenth\r\nCentury contributing to the legend that there existed in the capital a\r\nGrand and Fearful Panjandrum for whom no miracle was too great and to\r\nwhom people and officials owed trembling obedience.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the office of Emperor was never more than a\r\npolitico-religious concept, translated for the benefit of the masses\r\ninto socio-economic ordinances. These pronouncements, cast in the form\r\nof periodic homilies called Edicts, were the ritual of government; their\r\npurpose was instructional rather than mandatory; they were designed to\r\nteach and keep alive the State-theory that the Emperor was the High\r\nPriest of the Nation and that obedience to the morality of the Golden\r\nAge, which had been inculcated by all the philosophers since Confucius\r\nand Mencius flourished twenty-five centuries ago, would not only secure\r\nuniversal happiness but contribute to national greatness.\r\n\r\nThe office of Emperor was thus heavenly rather than terrestrial, and\r\nsuasion, not arms, was the most potent argument used in everyday life.\r\nThe amazing reply (_i.e._, amazing to foreigners) made by the great\r\nEmperor K'ang-hsi in the tremendous Eighteenth Century controversy\r\nbetween the Jesuit and the Dominican missionaries, which ruined the\r\nprospects of China's ever becoming Roman Catholic and which the Pope\r\nrefused to accept--that the custom of ancestor-worship was political and\r\nnot religious--was absolutely correct, _politics in China under the\r\nEmpire being only a system of national control exercised by inculcating\r\nobedience to forebears_. The great efforts which the Manchus made from\r\nthe end of the Sixteenth Century (when they were still a small\r\nManchurian Principality striving for the succession to the Dragon Throne\r\nand launching desperate attacks on the Great Wall of China) to receive\r\nfrom the Dalai Lama, as well as from the lesser Pontiffs of Tibet and\r\nMongolia, high-sounding religious titles, prove conclusively that\r\ndignities other than mere possession of the Throne were held necessary\r\nto give solidity to a reign which began in militarism and which would\r\ncollapse as the Mongol rule had collapsed by a mere Palace revolution\r\nunless an effective _moral_ title were somehow won.\r\n\r\nNor was the Manchu military Conquest, even after they had entered\r\nPeking, so complete as has been represented by historians. The Manchus\r\nwere too small a handful, even with their Mongol and Chinese\r\nauxiliaries, to do more than defeat the Ming armies and obtain the\r\nsubmission of the chief cities of China. It is well-known to students of\r\ntheir administrative methods, that whilst they reigned over China they\r\n_ruled_ only in company with the Chinese, the system in force being a\r\ndual control which, beginning on the Grand Council and in the various\r\ngreat Boards and Departments in the capital, proceeded as far as the\r\nprovincial chief cities, but stopped short there so completely and\r\nabsolutely that the huge chains of villages and burgs had their historic\r\nautonomy virtually untouched and lived on as they had always lived. The\r\nelaborate system of examinations, with the splendid official honours\r\nreserved for successful students which was adopted by the Dynasty, not\r\nonly conciliated Chinese society but provided a vast body of men whose\r\ninterest lay in maintaining the new conquest; and thus Literature, which\r\nhad always been the door to preferment, became not only one of the\r\ninstruments of government, but actually the advocate of an alien rule.\r\nWith their persons and properties safe, and their women-folk protected\r\nby an elaborate set of capitulations from being requisitioned for the\r\nharems of the invaders, small wonder if the mass of Chinese welcomed a\r\nfirm administration after the frightful disorders which had torn the\r\ncountry during the last days of the Mings.[2]\r\n\r\nIt was the foreigner, arriving in force in China after the capture of\r\nPeking and the ratification of the Tientsin Treaties in 1860, who so\r\ngreatly contributed to making the false idea of Manchu absolutism\r\ncurrent throughout the world; and in this work it was the foreign\r\ndiplomat, coming to the capital saturated with the tradition of European\r\nabsolutism, who played a not unimportant part. Investing the Emperors\r\nwith an authority with which they were never really clothed, save for\r\nceremonial purposes (principally perhaps because the Court was entirely\r\nwithdrawn from view and very insolent in its foreign intercourse) a\r\nconception of High Mightiness was spread abroad reminiscent of the awe\r\nin which Eighteenth Century nabobs spoke of the Great Mogul of India.\r\nChinese officials, quickly discovering that their easiest means of\r\ndefence against an irresistible pressure was to take refuge behind the\r\naugust name of the sovereign, played their rôle so successfully that\r\nuntil 1900 it was generally believed by Europeans that no other form of\r\ngovernment than a despotism _sans phrase_ could be dreamed of. Finding\r\nthat on the surface an Imperial Decree enjoyed the majesty of an Ukaze\r\nof the Czar, Europeans were ready enough to interpret as best suited\r\ntheir enterprises something which they entirely failed to construe in\r\nterms expressive of the negative nature of Chinese civilization; and so\r\nit happened that though the government of China had become no\r\ngovernment at all from the moment that extraterritoriality destroyed the\r\ntheory of Imperial inviolability and infallibility, the miracle of\r\nturning state negativism into an active governing element continued to\r\nwork after a fashion because of the disguise which the immense distances\r\nafforded.\r\n\r\nAdequately to explain the philosophy of distance in China, and what it\r\nhas meant historically, would require a whole volume to itself; but it\r\nis sufficient for our purpose to indicate here certain prime essentials.\r\nThe old Chinese were so entrenched in their vastnesses that without the\r\nplay of forces which were supernatural to them, _i.e._, the\r\nsteam-engine, the telegraph, the armoured war-vessel, etc., their daily\r\nlives could not be affected. Left to themselves, and assisted by their\r\nown methods, they knew that blows struck across the immense roadless\r\nspaces were so diminished in strength, by the time they reached the spot\r\naimed at, that they became a mere mockery of force; and, just because\r\nthey were so valueless, paved the way to effective compromises. Being\r\nadepts in the art which modern surgeons have adopted, of leaving wounds\r\nas far as possible to heal themselves, they trusted to time and to\r\nnature to solve political differences which western countries boldly\r\nattacked on very different principles. Nor were they wrong in their\r\nview. From the capital to the Yangtsze Valley (which is the heart of the\r\ncountry), is 800 miles, that is far more than the mileage between Paris\r\nand Berlin. From Peking to Canton is 1,400 miles along a hard and\r\ndifficult route; the journey to Yunnan by the Yangtsze river is\r\nupwards of 2,000 miles, a distance greater than the greatest march\r\never undertaken by Napoleon. And when one speaks of the Outer\r\nDominions--Mongolia, Tibet, Turkestan--for these hundreds of miles\r\nit is necessary to substitute thousands, and add thereto difficulties\r\nof terrain which would have disheartened even Roman Generals.\r\n\r\nNow the old Chinese, accepting distance as the supreme thing, had made\r\nit the starting-point as well as the end of their government. In the\r\nperfected viceregal system which grew up under the Ming Dynasty, and\r\nwhich was taken over by the Manchus as a sound and admirable governing\r\nprinciple, though they superimposed their own military system of Tartar\r\nGenerals, we have the plan that nullified the great obstacle. Authority\r\nof every kind was _delegated_ by the Throne to various distant governing\r\ncenturies in a most complete and sweeping manner, each group of\r\nprovinces, united under a viceroy, being in everything but name so many\r\nindependent linked commonwealths, called upon for matricular\r\ncontributions in money and grain but otherwise left severely alone[3].\r\nThe chain which bound provincial China to the metropolitan government\r\nwas therefore in the last analysis finance and nothing but finance; and\r\nif the system broke down in 1911 it was because financial reform--to\r\ndiscount the new forces of which the steam engine was the symbol--had\r\nbeen attempted, like military reform, both too late and in the wrong\r\nway, and instead of strengthening, had vastly weakened the authority of\r\nthe Throne.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the reform-plan which became popular after the Boxer\r\nSettlement had allowed the court to return to Peking from Hsianfu, the\r\nviceroys found their most essential prerogative, which was the control\r\nof the provincial purse, largely taken from them and handed over to\r\nFinancial Commissioners who were directly responsible to the Peking\r\nMinistry of Finance, a Department which was attempting to replace the\r\nloose system of matricular contributions by the European system of a\r\ndirectly controlled taxation every penny of which would be shown in an\r\nannual Budget. No doubt had time been vouchsafed, and had European help\r\nbeen enlisted on a large scale, this change could ultimately have been\r\nmade successful. But it was precisely time which was lacking; and the\r\nManchus consequently paid the penalty which is always paid by those who\r\ndelay until it is too late. The old theories having been openly\r\nabandoned, it needed only the promise of a Parliament completely to\r\ndestroy the dignity of the Son of Heaven, and to leave the viceroys as\r\nmere hostages in the hands of rebels. A few short weeks of rebellion was\r\nsufficient in 1911 to cause the provinces to revert to their condition\r\nof the earlier centuries when they had been vast unfettered agricultural\r\ncommunities. And once they had tasted the joys of this new independence,\r\nit was impossible to conceive of their becoming \"obedient\" again.\r\n\r\nHere another word of explanation is necessary to show clearly the\r\nprecise meaning of regionalism in China.\r\n\r\nWhat had originally created each province was the chief city in each\r\nregion, such cities necessarily being the walled repositories of all\r\nincrement. Greedy of territory to enhance their wealth, and jealous of\r\ntheir power, these provincial capitals throughout the ages had left no\r\nstone unturned to extend their influence in every possible direction and\r\nbring under their economic control as much land as possible, a fact\r\nwhich is abundantly proved by the highly diversified system of weights\r\nand measures throughout the land deliberately drawn-up to serve as\r\neconomic barriers. River-courses, mountain-ranges, climate and soil, no\r\ndoubt assisted in governing this expansion, but commercial and financial\r\ngreed was the principal force. Of this we have an exceedingly\r\ninteresting and conclusive illustration in the struggle still proceeding\r\nbetween the three Manchurian provinces, Fengtien, Kirin and\r\nHeilungchiang, to seize the lion's share of the virgin land of Eastern\r\nInner Mongolia which has an \"open frontier\" of rolling prairies. Having\r\nthe strongest provincial capital--Moukden--it has been Fengtien province\r\nwhich has encroached on the Mongolian grasslands to such an extent that\r\nits jurisdiction to-day envelops the entire western flank of Kirin\r\nprovince (as can be seen in the latest Chinese maps) in the form of a\r\nsalamander, effectively preventing the latter province from controlling\r\nterritory that geographically belongs to it. In the same way in the\r\nland-settlement which is still going on the Mongolian plateau\r\nimmediately above Peking, much of what should be Shansi territory has\r\nbeen added to the metropolitan province of Chihli. Though adjustments of\r\nprovincial boundaries have been summarily made in times past, in the\r\nmain the considerations we have indicated have been the dominant factors\r\nin determining the area of each unit.\r\n\r\nNow in many provinces where settlement is age-old, the regionalism which\r\nresults from great distances and bad communications has been greatly\r\nincreased by race-admixture. Canton province, which was largely settled\r\nby Chinese adventurers sailing down the coast from the Yangtsze and\r\nintermarrying with Annamese and the older autochthonous races, has a\r\npopulation-mass possessing very distinct characteristics, which sharply\r\nconflict with Northern traits. Fuhkien province is not only as\r\ndiversified but speaks a dialect which is virtually a foreign language.\r\nAnd so on North and West of the Yangtsze it is the same story,\r\ntemperamental differences of the highest political importance being\r\neverywhere in evidence and leading to perpetual bickerings and\r\njealousies. For although Chinese civilization resembles in one great\r\nparticular the Mahommedan religion, in that it accepts without question\r\nall adherents irrespective of racial origin, _politically_ the effect of\r\nthis regionalism has been such that up to very recent times the Central\r\nGovernment has been almost as much a foreign government in the eyes of\r\nmany provinces as the government of Japan. Money alone formed the bond\r\nof union; so long as questions of taxation were not involved, Peking was\r\nas far removed from daily life as the planet Mars.\r\n\r\nAs we are now able to see very clearly, fifty years ago--that is at the\r\ntime of the Taiping Rebellion--the old power and spell of the National\r\nCapital as a military centre had really vanished. Though in ancient days\r\nhorsemen armed with bows and lances could sweep like a tornado over the\r\nland, levelling everything save the walled cities, in the Nineteenth\r\nCentury such methods had become impossible. Mongolia and Manchuria had\r\nalso ceased to be inexhaustible reservoirs of warlike men; the more\r\nadjacent portions had become commercialized; whilst the outer regions\r\nhad sunk to depopulated graziers' lands. The Government, after the\r\ncollapse of the Rebellion, being greatly impoverished, had openly fallen\r\nto balancing province against province and personality against\r\npersonality, hoping that by some means it would be able to regain its\r\nprestige and a portion of its former wealth. Taking down the ledgers\r\ncontaining the lists of provincial contributions, the mandarins of\r\nPeking completely revised every schedule, redistributed every weight,\r\nand saw to it that the matricular levies should fall in such a way as to\r\nbe crushing. The new taxation, _likin_, which, like the income-tax in\r\nEngland, is in origin purely a war-tax, by gripping inter-provincial\r\ncommerce by the throat and rudely controlling it by the barrier-system,\r\nwas suddenly disclosed as a new and excellent way of making felt the\r\nmenaced sovereignty of the Manchus; and though the system was plainly a\r\ntwo-edged weapon, the first edge to cut was the Imperial edge; that is\r\nlargely why for several decades after the Taipings China was relatively\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nTime was also giving birth to another important development--important\r\nin the sense that it was to prove finally decisive. It would have been\r\nimpossible for Peking, unless men of outstanding genius had been living,\r\nto have foreseen that not only had the real bases of government now\r\nbecome entirely economic control, but that the very moment that control\r\nfaltered the central government of China would openly and absolutely\r\ncease to be any government at all. Modern commercialism, already\r\ninvading China at many points through the medium of the treaty-ports,\r\nwas a force which in the long run could not be denied. Every year that\r\npassed tended to emphasize the fact that modern conditions were cutting\r\nPeking more and more adrift from the real centres of power--the economic\r\ncentres which, with the single exception of Tientsin, lie from 800 to\r\n1,500 miles away. It was these centres that were developing\r\nrevolutionary ideas--_i.e._, ideas at variance with the Socio-economic\r\nprinciples on which the old Chinese commonwealth had been slowly built\r\nup, and which foreign dynasties such as the Mongol and the Manchu had\r\nnever touched. The Government of the post-Taiping period still imagined\r\nthat by making their hands lie more heavily than ever on the people and\r\nby tightening the taxation control--not by true creative work--they\r\ncould rehabilitate themselves.\r\n\r\nIt would take too long, and would weary the indulgence of the reader to\r\nestablish in a conclusive manner this thesis which had long been a\r\nsubject of inquiry on the part of political students. Chinese society,\r\nbeing essentially a society organized on a credit-co-operative system,\r\nso nicely adjusted that money, either coined or fiduciary, was not\r\nwanted save for the petty daily purchases of the people, any system\r\nwhich boldly clutched the financial establishments undertaking the\r\nmovement of _sycee_ (silver) from province to province for the\r\nsettlement of trade-balances, was bound to be effective so long as those\r\nfinancial establishments remained unshaken.\r\n\r\nThe best known establishments, united in the great group known as the\r\nShansi Bankers, being the government bankers, undertook not only all the\r\nremittances of surpluses to Peking, but controlled by an intricate\r\npass-book system the perquisites of almost every office-holder in the\r\nempire. No sooner did an official, under the system which had grown up,\r\nreceive a provincial appointment than there hastened to him a\r\nconfidential clerk of one of these accommodating houses, who in the name\r\nof his employers advanced all the sums necessary for the payment of the\r\nofficial's post, and then proceeded with him to his province so that\r\nmoiety by moiety, as taxation flowed in, advances could be paid off and\r\nthe equilibrium re-established. A very intimate and far-reaching\r\nconnection thus existed between provincial money-interests and the\r\nofficial classes. The practical work of governing China was the\r\nbalancing of tax-books and native bankers' accounts. Even the\r\n\"melting-houses,\" where _sycee_ was \"standardized\" for provincial use,\r\nwere the joint enterprises of officials and merchants; bargaining\r\ngoverning every transaction; and only when a violent break occurred in\r\nthe machinery, owing to famine or rebellion, did any other force than\r\nmoney intervene.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing exceptional in these practices, in the use of which\r\nthe old Chinese empire was merely following the precedent of the Roman\r\nEmpire. The vast polity that was formed before the time of Christ by the\r\nmilitary and commercial expansion of Rome in the Mediterranean Basin,\r\nand among the wild tribes of Northern Europe, depended very largely on\r\nthe genius of Italian financiers and tax-collectors to whom the revenues\r\nwere either directly \"farmed,\" or who \"assisted\" precisely after the\r\nChinese method in financing officials and local administrations, and in\r\nreplenishing a central treasury which no wealth could satisfy. The\r\nChinese phenomenon was therefore in no sense new; the dearth of coined\r\nmoney and the variety of local standards made the methods used economic\r\nnecessities. The system was not in itself a bad system: its fatal\r\nquality lay in its woodenness, its lack of adaptability, and in its\r\ngrowing weakness in the face of foreign competition which it could never\r\nunderstand. Foreign competition--that was the enemy destined to achieve\r\nan overwhelming triumph and dash to ruins a hoary survival.\r\n\r\nWar with Japan sounded the first trumpet-blast which should have been\r\nheeded. In the year 1894, being faced with the necessity of finding\r\nimmediately a large sum of specie for purpose of war, the native bankers\r\nproclaimed their total inability to do so, and the first great foreign\r\nloan contract was signed.[4] Little attention was attracted to what is a\r\nturning-point in Chinese history. There cannot be the slightest doubt\r\nthat in 1894 the Manchus wrote the first sentences of an abdication\r\nwhich was only formally pronounced in 1912: they had inaugurated the\r\nfinancial thraldom under which China still languishes. Within a period\r\nof forty months, in order to settle the disastrous Japanese war, foreign\r\nloans amounting to nearly fifty-five million pounds were completed. This\r\nindebtedness, amounting to nearly three times the \"visible\" annual\r\nrevenues of the country--that is, the revenues actually accounted for to\r\nPeking--was unparalleled in Chinese history. It was a gold indebtedness\r\nsubject to all sorts of manipulations which no Chinese properly\r\nunderstood. It had special political meaning and special political\r\nconsequences because the loans were virtually guaranteed by the Powers.\r\nIt was a long-drawn _coup d'état_ of a nature that all foreigners\r\nunderstood because it forged external chains.\r\n\r\nThe _internal_ significance was even greater than the external. The\r\nloans were secured on the most important \"direct\" revenues reaching\r\nPeking--the Customs receipts, which were concerned with the most vital\r\nfunction in the new economic life springing up, the steam-borne coasting\r\nand river-trade as well as the purely foreign trade. That most vital\r\nfunction tended consequently to become more and more hall-marked as\r\nforeign; it no longer depended in any direct sense on Peking for\r\nprotection. The hypothecation of these revenues to foreigners for\r\nperiods running into decades--coupled with their administration by\r\nforeigners--was such a distinct restriction of the rights of eminent\r\ndomain as to amount to a partial abrogation of sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThat this was vaguely understood by the masses is now quite certain. The\r\nBoxer movement of 1900, like the great proletarian risings which\r\noccurred in Italy in the pre-Christian era as a result of the\r\nimpoverishment and moral disorder brought about by Roman misgovernment,\r\nwas simply a socio-economic catastrophe exhibiting itself in an\r\nunexpected form. The dying Manchu dynasty, at last in open despair,\r\nturned the revolt, insanely enough, against the foreigner--that is\r\nagainst those who already held the really vital portion of their\r\nsovereignty. So far from saving itself by this act, the dynasty wrote\r\nanother sentence in its death-warrant. Economically the Manchus had been\r\nfor years almost lost; the Boxer indemnities were the last straw. By\r\nmore than doubling the burden of foreign commitments, and by placing the\r\noperation of the indemnities directly in the hands of foreign bankers by\r\nthe method of monthly quotas, payable in Shanghai, _the Peking\r\nGovernment as far back as fifteen years ago was reduced to being a\r\ngovernment at thirty days' sight, at the mercy of any shock of events\r\nwhich could be protracted over a few monthly settlements_. There is no\r\ndenying this signal fact, which is probably the most remarkable\r\nillustration of the restrictive power of money which has ever been\r\nafforded in the history of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon, however, was complex and we must be careful to\r\nunderstand its workings. A mercantile curiosity, to find the parallel\r\nfor which we must go back to the Middle Ages in Europe, when \"free\r\ncities\" such as those of the Hanseatic League plentifully\r\ndotted river and coast line, served to increase the general difficulties\r\nof a situation which no one formula could adequately cover.\r\nExtraterritoriality, by creating the \"treaty port\" in China, had been\r\nthe most powerful weapon in undermining native economics; yet at the\r\nsame time it had been the agent for creating powerful new\r\ncounter-balancing interests. Though the increasingly large groups of\r\nforeigners, residing under their own laws, and building up, under their\r\nown specially protected system of international exchange, a new and\r\nimposing edifice, had made the hovel-like nature of Chinese economics\r\nglaringly evident, the mercantile classes of the New China, being always\r\nquick to avail themselves of money-making devices, had not only taken\r\nshelter under this new and imposing edifice, but were rapidly extending\r\nit of their own accord. In brief, the trading Chinese were identifying\r\nthemselves and their major interests with the treaty-ports; they were\r\ntransferring thither their specie and their credits; making huge\r\ninvestments in land and properties, under the aegis of foreign flags in\r\nwhich they absolutely trusted. The money-interests of the country knew\r\ninstinctively that the native system was doomed and that with this doom\r\nthere would come many changes; these interests, in the way common to\r\nmoney all the world over, were insuring themselves against the\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nThe force of this--politically--became finally evident in 1911; and what\r\nwe have said in our opening sentences should now be clear. The Chinese\r\nRevolution was an emotional rising against the Peking System because it\r\nwas a bad and inefficient and retrograde system, just as much as against\r\nthe Manchus, who after all had adopted purely Chinese methods and who\r\nwere no more foreigners than Scotchmen or Irishmen are foreigners to-day\r\nin England. The Revolution of 1911 derived its meaning and its value--as\r\nwell as its mandate--not from what it proclaimed, but for what it stood\r\nfor. Historically, 1911 was the lineal descendant of 1900, which again\r\nwas the offspring of the economic collapse advertised by the great\r\nforeign loans of the Japanese war, loans made necessary because the\r\nTaipings had disclosed the complete disappearance of the only _raison\r\nd'être_ of Peking sovereignty, _i.e._ the old-time military power. The\r\nstory is, therefore, clear and well-connected and so logical in its\r\nresults that it has about it a finality suggesting the unrolling of the\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution the one decisive factor was shown to be almost at\r\nonce--money, nothing but money. The pinch was felt at the end of the\r\nfirst thirty days. Provincial remittances ceased; the Boxer quotas\r\nremained unpaid; a foreign embargo was laid upon the Customs funds. The\r\nNorthern troops, raised and trained by Yuan Shih-kai, when he was\r\nViceroy of the Metropolitan province, were, it is true, proving\r\nthemselves the masters of the Yangtsze and South China troops; yet that\r\ncircumstance was meaningless. Those troops were fighting for what had\r\nalready proved itself a lost cause--the Peking System, as well as the\r\nManchu dynasty. The fight turned more and more into a money-fight. It\r\nwas foreign money which brought about the first truce and the transfer\r\nof the so-called republican government from Nanking to Peking. In the\r\nstrictest sense of the words every phase of the settlement then arrived\r\nat was a settlement in terms of cash.[5]\r\n\r\nHad means existed for rapidly replenishing the Chinese Treasury without\r\nhaving recourse to European stockmarkets (whose actions are\r\nsemi-officially controlled when distant regions are involved) the\r\nRepublic might have fared better. But placed almost at once through\r\nforeign dictation under a species of police-control, which while\r\nnominally derived from Western conceptions, was primarily designed to\r\nrehabilitate the semblance of the authority which had been so\r\nsensationally extinguished, the Republic remained only a dream; and the\r\nworld, taught to believe that there could be no real stability until the\r\nscheme of government approximated to the conception long formed of\r\nPeking absolutism, waited patiently for the rude awakening which came\r\nwith the Yuan Shih-kai _coup d'état_ of 4th November, 1913. Thus we had\r\nthis double paradox; on the one hand the Chinese people awkwardly trying\r\nto be western in a Chinese way and failing: on the other, foreign\r\nofficials and foreign governments trying to be Chinese and making the\r\nconfusion worse confounded. It was inevitable in such circumstances\r\nthat the history of the past six years should have been the history of a\r\nslow tragedy, and that almost every page should be written over with the\r\nname of the man who was the selected bailiff of the Powers--Yuan\r\nShih-kai.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Funeral of Yuan Shih-kai: The Procession passing\r\ndown the great Palace Approach, with the famous Ch'ien Men (Gate) in the\r\ndistance.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Provincial Troops of General Chang Hsun at his\r\nHeadquarters of Hsuchowfu.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Funeral of Yuan Shih-kai: The Catafalque over the\r\nCoffin on its way to the Railway Station.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Funeral of Yuan Shih-kai: The Procession passing down\r\nthe great Palace Approach, with the famous Ch'ien Men (Gate) in the\r\ndistance.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] As there is a good deal of misunderstanding on the subject of the\r\nManchus an explanatory note is useful.\r\n\r\nThe Manchu people, who belong to the Mongol or Turanian Group, number at\r\nthe maximum five million souls. Their distribution at the time of the\r\nrevolution of 1911 was roughly as follows: In and around Peking say two\r\nmillions; in posts through China say one-half million,--or possibly\r\nthree-quarters of a million; in Manchuria Proper--the home of the\r\nrace--say two or two and a half millions. The fighting force was\r\ncomposed in this fashion: When Peking fell into their hands in 1644 as a\r\nresult of a stratagem combined with dissensions among the Chinese\r\nthemselves, the entire armed strength was reorganized in Eight Banners\r\nor Army Corps, each corps being composed of three racial divisions, (1)\r\npure Manchus, (2) Mongols who had assisted in the conquest and (3)\r\nNorthern Chinese who had gone over to the conquerors. These Eight\r\nBanners, each commanded by an \"iron-capped\" Prince, represented the\r\nauthority of the Throne and had their headquarters in Peking with small\r\ngarrisons throughout the provinces at various strategic centres. These\r\ngarrisons had entirely ceased to have any value before the 18th Century\r\nhad closed and were therefore purely ceremonial and symbolic, all the\r\nfighting being done by special Chinese corps which were raised as\r\nnecessity arose.\r\n\r\n[2] This most interesting point--the immunity of Chinese women from\r\nforced marriage with Manchus--has been far too little noticed by\r\nhistorians though it throws a flood of light on the sociological aspects\r\nof the Manchu conquest. Had that conquest been absolute it would have\r\nbeen impossible for the Chinese people to have protected their\r\nwomen-folk in such a significant way.\r\n\r\n[3] A very interesting proof--and one that has never been properly\r\nexposed--of the astoundingly rationalistic principles on which the\r\nChinese polity is founded is to be seen in the position of priesthoods\r\nin China. Unlike every other civilization in the world, at no stage of\r\nthe development of the State has it been necessary for religion in China\r\nto intervene between the rulers and the ruled, saving the people from\r\noppression. In Europe without the supernatural barrier of the Church,\r\nthe position of the common people in the Middle Ages would have been\r\nintolerable, and life, and virtue totally unprotected. Buckle, in his\r\n\"History of Civilization,\" like other extreme radicals, has failed to\r\nunderstand that established religions have paradoxically been most\r\nvaluable because of their vast secular powers, exercised under the mask\r\nof spiritual authority. Without this ghostly restraint rulers would have\r\nbeen so oppressive as to have destroyed their peoples. The two greatest\r\nmonuments to Chinese civilization, then consist of these twin facts;\r\nfirst, that the Chinese have never had the need for such supernatural\r\nrestraints exercised by a privileged body, and secondly, that they are\r\nabsolutely without any feeling of class or caste--prince and pauper\r\nmeeting on terms of frank and humorous equality--the race thus being the\r\nonly pure and untinctured democracy the world has ever known.\r\n\r\n[4] (a) This loan was the so-called 7 per cent. Silver loan of 1894 for\r\nShanghai Taels 10,000,000 negotiated by the Hongkong & Shanghai Bank. It\r\nwas followed in 1895 by a £3,000,000 Gold 6 per cent. Loan, then by two\r\nmore 6 per cent. loans for a million each in the same year, making a\r\ntotal of £6,635,000 sterling for the bare war-expenses. The Japanese war\r\nindemnity raised in three successive issues--from 1895 to 1898--of\r\n£16,000,000 each, added £48,000,000. Thus the Korean imbroglio cost\r\nChina nearly 55 millions sterling. As the purchasing power of the\r\nsovereign is eight times larger in China than in Europe, this debt\r\neconomically would mean 440 millions in England--say nearly double what\r\nthe ruinous South African war cost. It is by such methods of comparison\r\nthat the vital nature of the economic factor in recent Chinese history\r\nis made clear.\r\n\r\n[5] There is no doubt that the so-called Belgian loan, £1,800,000 of\r\nwhich was paid over in cash at the beginning of 1912, was the instrument\r\nwhich brought every one to terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ENIGMA OF YUAN SHIH-KAI\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE MAN FROM THE OPENING OF HIS CAREER IN KOREA IN 1882\r\nTO THE END OF THE REVOLUTION, 12TH FEBRUARY, 1912\r\n\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai's career falls into two clear-cut parts, almost as if it\r\nhad been specially arranged for the biographer; there is the\r\nprobationary period in Korea, and the executive in North China. The\r\nfirst is important only because of the moulding-power which early\r\ninfluences exerted on the man's character; but it is interesting in\r\nanother way since it affords glimpses of the sort of things which\r\naffected this leader's imagination throughout his life and finally\r\nbrought him to irretrievable ruin. The second-period is choke-full of\r\naction; and over every chapter one can see the ominous point of\r\ninterrogation which was finally answered in his tragic political and\r\nphysical collapse.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai's origin, without being precisely obscure, is unimportant.\r\nHe came of a Honanese family who were nothing more distinguished than\r\nfarmers possessing a certain amount of land, but not too much of the\r\nworld's possessions. The boy probably ran wild in the field at an age\r\nwhen the sons of high officials and literati were already pale and\r\nanaemic from over-much study. To some such cause the man undoubtedly\r\nowed his powerful physique, his remarkable appetite, his general\r\nroughness. Native biographers state that as a youth he failed to pass\r\nhis _hsiu-tsai_ examinations--the lowest civil service degree--because\r\nhe had spent too much time in riding and boxing and fencing. An uncle in\r\nofficial life early took charge of him; and when this relative died the\r\nyoung man displayed filial piety in accompanying the corpse back to the\r\nfamily graves and in otherwise manifesting grief. Through official\r\nconnections a place was subsequently found for him in that public\r\ndepartment under the Manchus which may be called the military\r\nintendancy, and it was through this branch of the civil service that he\r\nrose to power. Properly speaking Yuan Shih-kai was never an\r\narmy-officer; he was a military official--his highest rank later on\r\nbeing that of military judge, or better, Judicial Commissioner.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai first emerges into public view in 1882 when, as a sequel\r\nto the opening of Korea through the action of foreign Powers in forcing\r\nthe then Hermit kingdom to sign commercial treaties, China began\r\ndispatching troops to Seoul. Yuan Shih-kai, with two other officers,\r\ncommanding in all some 3,000 men, arrived from Shantung, where he had\r\nbeen in the train of a certain General Wu Chang-ching, and now encamped\r\nin the Korean capital nominally to preserve order, but in reality, to\r\nenforce the claims of the suzerain power. For the Peking Government had\r\nnever retreated from the position that Korea had been a vassal state\r\never since the Ming Dynasty had saved the country from the clutches of\r\nHideyoshi and his Japanese invaders in the Sixteenth Century. Yuan\r\nShih-kai had been personally recommended by this General Wu Chang-ching\r\nas a young man of ability and energy to the famous Li Hung Chang, who as\r\nTientsin Viceroy and High Commissioner for the Northern Seas was\r\nresponsible for the conduct of Korean affairs. The future dictator of\r\nChina was then only twenty-five years old.\r\n\r\nHis very first contact with practical politics gave him a peculiar\r\nmanner of viewing political problems. The arrival of Chinese troops in\r\nSeoul marked the beginning of that acute rivalry with Japan which\r\nfinally culminated in the short and disastrous war of 1894-95. China, in\r\norder to preserve her influence in Korea against the growing influence\r\nof Japan, intrigued night and day in the Seoul Palaces, allying herself\r\nwith the Conservative Court party which was led by the notorious Korean\r\nQueen who was afterwards assassinated. The Chinese agents aided and\r\nabetted the reactionary group, constantly inciting them to attack the\r\nJapanese and drive them out of the country.\r\n\r\nContinual outrages were the consequence. The Japanese legation was\r\nattacked and destroyed by the Korean mob not once but on several\r\noccasions during a decade which furnishes one of the most amazing\r\nchapters in the history of Asia. Yuan Shih-kai, being then merely a\r\njunior general officer under the orders of the Chinese Imperial\r\nResident, is of no particular importance; but it is significant of the\r\nman that he should suddenly come well under the limelight on the first\r\npossible occasion. On 6th December, 1884, leading 2,000 Chinese troops,\r\nand acting in concert with 3,000 Korean soldiers, he attacked the Tong\r\nKwan Palace in which the Japanese Minister and his staff, protected by\r\ntwo companies of Japanese infantry, had taken refuge owing to the\r\nthreatening state of affairs in the capital. Apparently there was no\r\nparticular plan--it was the action of a mob of soldiery tumbling into a\r\npolitical brawl and assisted by their officers for reasons which appear\r\nto-day nonsensical. The sequel was, however, extraordinary. The Japanese\r\nheld the Palace gates as long as possible, and then being desperate\r\nexploded a mine which killed numbers of Koreans and Chinese soldiery and\r\nthrew the attack into confusion. They then fought their way out of the\r\ncity escaping ultimately to the nearest sea-port, Chemulpo.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this extraordinary episode has never been made\r\npublic. The practical result was that after a period of extreme tension\r\nbetween China and Japan which was expected to lead to war, that\r\npolitical genius, the late Prince Ito, managed to calm things down and\r\narrange workable _modus vivendi_. Yuan Shih-kai, who had gone to\r\nTientsin to report in person to Li Hung Chang, returned to Seoul\r\ntriumphantly in October, 1885, as Imperial Resident. He was then\r\ntwenty-eight years old; he had come to the front, no matter by what\r\nmeans, in a quite remarkable manner.\r\n\r\nThe history of the next nine years furnishes plenty of minor incidents,\r\nbut nothing of historic importance. As the faithful lieutenant of Li\r\nHung Chang, Yuan Shih-kai's particular business was simply to combat\r\nJapanese influence and hold the threatened advance in check. He failed,\r\nof course, since he was playing a losing game; and yet he succeeded\r\nwhere he undoubtedly wished to succeed. By rendering faithful service\r\nhe established the reputation he wished to win; and though he did\r\nnothing great he retained his post right up to the act which led to the\r\ndeclaration of war in 1894. Whether he actually precipitated that war is\r\nstill a matter of opinion. On the sinking by the Japanese fleet of the\r\nBritish steamer _Kowshing_, which was carrying Chinese reinforcements\r\nfrom Taku anchorage to Asan Bay to his assistance, seeing that the game\r\nwas up, he quietly left the Korean capital and made his way overland to\r\nNorth China. That swift, silent journey home ends the period of his\r\nnovitiate.\r\n\r\nIt took him a certain period to weather the storm which the utter\r\ncollapse of China in her armed encounter with Japan brought about--and\r\nparticularly to obtain forgiveness for evacuating Seoul without orders.\r\nTechnically his offence was punishable by death--the old Chinese code\r\nbeing most stringent in such matters. But by 1896 he was back in favour\r\nagain, and through the influence of his patron Li Hung Chang, he was at\r\nlength appointed in command of the Hsiaochan camp near Tientsin, where\r\nhe was promoted and given the task of reforming a division of old-style\r\ntroops and making them as efficient as Japanese soldiery. He had already\r\nearned a wide reputation for severity, for willingness to accept\r\nresponsibility, for nepotism, and for a rare ability to turn even\r\ndisasters to his own advantage--all attributes which up to the last\r\nmoment stood him in good stead.\r\n\r\nIn the Hsiaochan camp the most important chapter of his life opens;\r\nthere is every indication that he fully realized it. Tientsin has always\r\nbeen the gateway to Peking: from there the road to high preferment is\r\neasily reached. Yuan Shih-kai marched steadily forward, taking the very\r\nfirst turning-point in a manner which stamped him for many of his\r\ncompatriots in a way which can never be obliterated.\r\n\r\nIt is first necessary to say a word about the troops of his command,\r\nsince this has a bearing on present-day politics. The bulk of the\r\nsoldiery were so-called _Huai Chun_--_i.e._, nominally troops from the\r\nHuai districts, just south of Li Hung Chang's native province Anhui.\r\nThese Kiangu men, mixed with Shantung recruits, had earned a historic\r\nplace in the favour of the Manchus owing to the part they had played in\r\nthe suppression of the Taiping Rebellion, in which great event General\r\nGordon and Li Hung Chang had been so closely associated. They and the\r\ntroops of Hunan province, led by the celebrated Marquis Tseng Kuo-fan,\r\nwere \"the loyal troops,\" resembling the Sikhs during the Indian Mutiny;\r\nthey were supposed to be true to their salt to the last man. Certainly\r\nthey gave proofs of uncustomary fidelity.\r\n\r\nIn those military days of twenty years ago Yuan Shih-kai and his\r\nhenchmen were, however, concerned with simpler problems. It was then a\r\nquestion of drill and nothing but drill. In his camp near Tientsin the\r\nfuture President of the Chinese Republic succeeded in reorganizing his\r\ntroops so well that in a very short time the Hsiaochan Division became\r\nknown as a _corps d'élite_. The discipline was so stern that there were\r\nsaid to be only two ways of noticing subordinates, either by promoting\r\nor beheading them. Devoting himself to his task Yuan Shih-kai gave\r\npromise of being able to handle much bigger problems.\r\n\r\nHis zeal soon attracted the attention of the Manchu Court. The\r\ncircumstances in Peking at that time were peculiar. The famous old\r\nEmpress Dowager, Tzu-hsi, after the Japanese war, had greatly relaxed\r\nher hold on the Emperor Kwanghsu, who though still in subjection to her,\r\nnominally governed the empire. A well-intentioned but weak man, he had\r\nsurrounded himself with advanced scholars, led by the celebrated Kang Yu\r\nWei, who daily studied with him and filled him with new doctrines,\r\nteaching him to believe that if he would only exert his power he might\r\nrescue the nation from international ignominy and make for himself an\r\nimperishable name.\r\n\r\nThe sequel was inevitable. In 1898 the oriental world was electrified by\r\nthe so-called Reform Edicts, in which the Emperor undertook to modernize\r\nChina, and in which he exhorted the nation to obey him. The greatest\r\nalarm was created in Court circles by this action; the whole vast body\r\nof Metropolitan officialdom, seeing its future threatened, flooded the\r\nPalace of the Empress Dowager with Secret Memorials praying her to\r\nresume power. Flattered, she gave her secret assent.\r\n\r\nThings marched quickly after that. The Empress, nothing loth, began\r\nmaking certain dispositions. Troops were moved, men were shifted here\r\nand there in a way that presaged action; and the Emperor, now\r\nthoroughly alarmed and yielding to the entreaties of his followers, sent\r\ntwo members of the Reform Party to Yuan Shih-kai bearing an alleged\r\nautograph order for him to advance instantly on Peking with all his\r\ntroops; to surround the Palace, to secure the person of the Emperor from\r\nall danger, and then to depose the Empress Dowager for ever from power.\r\nWhat happened is equally well-known. Yuan Shih-kai, after an exhaustive\r\nexamination of the message and messengers, as well as other attempts to\r\nsubstantiate the genuineness of the appeal, communicated its nature to\r\nthe then Viceroy of Chihli, the Imperial Clansman Jung Lu, whose\r\nintimacy with the Empress Dowager since the days of her youth has passed\r\ninto history. Jung Lu lost no time in acting. He beheaded the two\r\nmessengers and personally reported the whole plot to the Empress Dowager\r\nwho was already fully warned. The result was the so-called _coup d'état_\r\nof September, 1898, when all the Reformers who had not fled were\r\nsummarily executed, and the Emperor Kwanghsu himself closely imprisoned\r\nin the Island Palace within that portion of the Forbidden City known as\r\nthe Three Lakes, having (until the Boxer outbreak of 1900 carried him to\r\nHsianfu), as sole companions his two favourites, the celebrated\r\nodalisques \"Pearl\" and \"Lustre.\"\r\n\r\nThis is no place to enter into the controversial aspect of Yuan\r\nShih-kai's action in 1898 which has been hotly debated by partisans for\r\nmany years. For onlookers the verdict must always remain largely a\r\nmatter of opinion; certainly this is one of those matters which cannot\r\nbe passed upon by any one but a Chinese tribunal furnished with all the\r\nevidence. Those days which witnessed the imprisonment of Kwanghsu were\r\ngreat because they opened wide the portals of the Romance of History:\r\nall who were in Peking can never forget the counter-stroke; the arrival\r\nof the hordes composed of Tung Fu-hsiang's Mahommedan cavalry--men who\r\nhad ridden hard across a formidable piece of Asia at the behest of their\r\nEmpress and who entered the capital in great clouds of dust. It was in\r\nthat year of 1898 also that Legation Guards reappeared in Peking--a few\r\nfiles for each Legation as in 1860--and it was then that clear-sighted\r\nprophets saw the beginning of the end of the Manchu Dynasty.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai's reward for his share in this counter-revolution was his\r\nappointment to the governorship of Shantung province. He moved thither\r\nwith all his troops in December, 1899. Armed _cap-à-pie_ he was ready\r\nfor the next act--the Boxers, who burst on China in the Summer of 1900.\r\nThese men were already at work in Shantung villages with their\r\nincantations and alleged witchcraft. There is evidence that their\r\npropaganda had been going on for months, if not for years, before any\r\none had heard of it. Yuan Shih-kai had the priceless opportunity of\r\nstudying them at close range and soon made up his mind about certain\r\nthings. When the storm burst, pretending to see nothing but mad fanatics\r\nin those who, realizing the plight of their country, had adopted the\r\nwar-cry \"Blot out the Manchus and the foreigner,\" he struck at them\r\nfiercely, driving the whole savage horde head-long into the metropolitan\r\nprovince of Chihli. There, seduced by the Manchus, they suddenly changed\r\nthe inscription on their flags. Their sole enemy became the foreigner\r\nand all his works, and forthwith they were officially protected. Far and\r\nwide they killed every white face they could find. They tore up\r\nrailways, burnt churches and chapels and produced a general anarchy\r\nwhich could only have one end--European intervention. The man, sitting\r\non the edge of Chinese history but not yet identifying himself with its\r\nmain currents because he was not strong enough for that had once again\r\nnot judged wrongly. With his Korean experience to assist him, he had\r\nseen precisely what the end must inevitably be.\r\n\r\nThe crash in Peking, when the siege of the Legations had been raised by\r\nan international army, found him alert and sympathetic--ready with\r\nadvice, ready to shoulder new responsibilities, ready to explain away\r\neverything. The signature of the Peace Protocol of 1901 was signalized\r\nby his obtaining the viceroyalty of Chihli, succeeding the great Li Hung\r\nChang himself, who had been reappointed to his old post, but had found\r\nactive duties too wearisome. This was a marvellous success for a man but\r\nlittle over forty. And when the fugitive Court at length returned from\r\nHsianfu in 1902, honours were heaped upon him as a person particularly\r\nworthy of honour because he had kept up appearances and maintained the\r\nauthority of the distressed Throne. As if in answer to this he flooded\r\nthe Court with memorials praying that in order to restore the power of\r\nthe Dynasty a complete army of modern troops be raised--as numerous as\r\npossible but above all efficient.\r\n\r\nHis advice was listened to. From 1902 until 1907 as Minister of the Army\r\nReorganization Council--a special post he held simultaneously with that\r\nof metropolitan Viceroy--Yuan Shih-kai's great effort was concentrated\r\non raising an efficient fighting force. In those five years, despite all\r\nfinancial embarrassments, North China raised and equipped six excellent\r\nDivisions of field-troops--75,000 men--all looking to Yuan Shih-kai as\r\ntheir sole master. So much energy did he display in pushing military\r\nreorganization throughout the provinces that the Court, warned by\r\njealous rivals of his growing power, suddenly promoted him to a post\r\nwhere he would be powerless. One day he was brought to Peking as Grand\r\nCouncillor and President of the Board of Foreign Affairs, and ordered to\r\nhand over all army matters to his noted rival, the Manchu Tieh Liang.\r\nThe time had arrived to muzzle him. His last phase as a pawn had come.\r\n\r\nFew foreign diplomats calling at China's Foreign Office to discuss\r\nmatters during that short period which lasted barely a twelve-month,\r\nimagined that the square resolute-looking man who as President of the\r\nBoard gave the same energy and attention to consular squabbles as to the\r\nreorganization of a national-fighting force, was almost daily engaged in\r\na fierce clandestine struggle to maintain even his modest position.\r\nJealousy, which flourishes in Peking like the upas tree, was for ever\r\nblighting his schemes and blocking his plans. He had been brought to\r\nPeking to be tied up; he was constantly being denounced; and even his\r\nall powerful patroness, the old Empress Dowager, who owed so much to\r\nhim, suffered from constant premonitions that the end was fast\r\napproaching, and that with her the Dynasty would die.\r\n\r\nIn the Autumn of 1908 she took sick. The gravest fears quickly spread.\r\nIt was immediately reported that the Emperor Kwanghsu was also very\r\nill--an ominous coincidence. Very suddenly both personages collapsed and\r\ndied, the Empress Dowager slightly before the Emperor. There is little\r\ndoubt that the Emperor himself was poisoned. The legend runs that as he\r\nexpired not only did he give his Consort, who was to succeed him in the\r\nexercise of the nominal power of the Throne, a last secret Edict to\r\nbehead Yuan Shih-kai, but that his faltering hand described circle\r\nafter circle in the air until his followers understood the meaning. In\r\nthe vernacular the name of the great viceroy and the word for circle\r\nhave the same sound; the gesture signified that the dying monarch's last\r\nwish was revenge on the man who had failed him ten years before.\r\n\r\nAn ominous calm followed this great break with the past. It was\r\nunderstood that the Court was torn by two violent factions regarding the\r\nsuccession which the Empress Tzu-hsi had herself decided. The fact that\r\nanother long Regency had become inevitable through the accession of the\r\nchild Hsuan Tung aroused instant apprehensions among foreign observers,\r\nwhilst it was confidently predicted that Yuan Shih-kai's last days had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThe blow fell suddenly on the 2nd January, 1909. In the interval between\r\nthe death of the old Empress and his disgrace, Yuan Shih-kai was\r\nactually promoted to the highest rank in the gift of the Throne, that\r\nis, made \"Senior Guardian of the Heir Apparent\" and placed in charge of\r\nthe Imperial funeral arrangements--a lucrative appointment. During that\r\ninterval it is understood that the new Regent, brother of the Emperor\r\nKwanghsu, consulted all the most trusted magnates of the empire\r\nregarding the manner in which the secret decapitation Decree should be\r\ntreated. All advised him to be warned in time, and not to venture on a\r\ncourse of action which would be condemned both by the nation and by the\r\nPowers. Another Edict was therefore prepared simply dismissing Yuan\r\nShih-kai from office and ordering him to return to his native place.\r\n\r\nEvery one remembers that day in Peking when popular rumour declared that\r\nthe man's last hour had come. Warned on every side to beware, Yuan\r\nShih-kai left the Palace as soon as he had read the Edict of dismissal\r\nin the Grand Council and drove straight to the railway-station, whence\r\nhe entrained for Tientsin, dressed as a simple citizen. Rooms had been\r\ntaken for him at a European hotel, the British Consulate approached for\r\nprotection, when another train brought down his eldest son bearing a\r\nmessage direct from the Grand Council Chamber, absolutely guaranteeing\r\nthe safety of his life. Accordingly he duly returned to his native place\r\nin Honan province, and for two years--until the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution--devoted himself sedulously to the development of the large\r\nestate he had acquired with the fruits of office. Living like a\r\npatriarch of old, surrounded by his many wives and children, he\r\nannounced constantly that he had entirely dropped out of the political\r\nlife of China and only desired to be left in peace. There is reason to\r\nbelieve, however, that his henchmen continually reported to him the true\r\nstate of affairs, and bade him bide his time. Certain it is that the\r\nfiring of the first shots on the Yangtsze found him alert and issuing\r\nprivate orders to his followers. It was inevitable that he should have\r\nbeen recalled to office--and actually within one hundred hours of the\r\nfirst news of the outbreak the Court sent for him urgently and\r\nungraciously.\r\n\r\nFrom the 14th October, 1911, when he was appointed by Imperial Edict\r\nViceroy of Hupeh and Hunan and ordered to proceed at once to the front\r\nto quell the insurrection, until the 1st November, when he was given\r\nvirtually Supreme Power as President of the Grand Council in place of\r\nPrince Ching, a whole volume is required to discuss adequately the maze\r\nof questions involved. For the purposes of this account, however, the\r\nmatter can be dismissed very briefly in this way. Welcoming the\r\nopportunity which had at last come and determined once for all to settle\r\nmatters decisively, so far as he was personally concerned, Yuan Shih-kai\r\ndeliberately followed the policy of holding back and delaying everything\r\nuntil the very incapacity marking both sides--the Revolutionists quite\r\nas much as the Manchus--forced him, as man of action and man of\r\ndiplomacy, to be acclaimed the sole mediator and saviour of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe detailed course of the Revolution, and the peculiar manner in which\r\nYuan Shih-kai allowed events rather than men to assert their mastery has\r\noften been related and need not long detain us. It is generally conceded\r\nthat in spite of the bravery of the raw revolutionary levies, their\r\ncapacity was entirely unequal to the trump card Yuan Shih-kai held all\r\nthe while in his hand--the six fully-equipped Divisions of Field Troops\r\nhe himself had organized as Tientsin Viceroy. It was a portion of this\r\nfield-force which captured and destroyed the chief revolutionary base in\r\nthe triple city of Hankow, Hanyang and Wuchang in November, 1911, and\r\nwhich he held back just as it was about to give the _coup de grâce_ by\r\ncrossing the river in force and sweeping the last remnants of the\r\nrevolutionary army to perdition. Thus it is correct to declare that had\r\nhe so wished Yuan Shih-kai could have crushed the revolution entirely\r\nbefore the end of 1911; but he was sufficiently astute to see that the\r\nproblem he had to solve was not merely military but moral as well. The\r\nChinese as a nation were suffering from a grave complaint. Their\r\ncivilization had been made almost bankrupt owing to unresisted foreign\r\naggression and to the native inability to cope with the mass of\r\naccumulated wrongs which a superimposed and exhausted feudalism--the\r\nManchu system--had brought about. Yuan Shih-kai knew that the Boxers had\r\nbeen theoretically correct in selecting as they first did the watchword\r\nwhich they had first placed on their banners--\"blot out the Manchus and\r\nall foreign things.\" Both had sapped the old civilization to its\r\nfoundations. But the programme they had proposed was idealistic, not\r\npractical. One element could be cleared away--the other had to be\r\nendured. Had the Boxers been sensible they would have modified their\r\nprogramme to the extent of protecting the foreigners, whilst they\r\nassailed the Dynasty which had brought them so low. The Court Party, as\r\nwe have said, seduced their leaders to acting in precisely the reverse\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai was neither a Boxer, nor yet a believer in idealistic\r\nfoolishness. He had realized that the essence of successful rule in the\r\nChina of the Twentieth Century was to support the foreign point of\r\nview--nominally at least--because foreigners disposed of unlimited\r\nmonetary resources, and had science on their side. He knew that so long\r\nas he did not openly flout foreign opinion by indulging in bare-faced\r\nassassinations, he would be supported owing to the international\r\nreputation he had established in 1900. Arguing from these premises, his\r\ninstinct also told him that an appearance of legality must always be\r\nsedulously preserved and the aspirations of the nation nominally\r\nsatisfied. For this reason he arranged matters in such a manner as to\r\nappear always as the instrument of fate. For this reason, although he\r\ndestroyed the revolutionists on the mid-Yangtsze, to equalize matters,\r\non the lower Yangtsze he secretly ordered the evacuation of Nanking by\r\nthe Imperialist forces so that he might have a tangible argument with\r\nwhich to convince the Manchus regarding the root and branch reform which\r\nhe knew was necessary. That reform had been accepted in principle by the\r\nThrone when it agreed to the so-called Nineteen Fundamental Articles, a\r\ncorpus of demands which all the Northern Generals had endorsed and had\r\nindeed insisted should be the basis of government before they would\r\nfight the rebellious South in 1911. There is reason to believe that\r\nprovided he had been made _de facto_ Regent, Yuan Shih-kai would have\r\nsupported to the end a Manchu Monarchy. But the surprising swiftness of\r\nthe Revolutionary Party's action in proclaiming the Republic at Nanking\r\non the 1st January, 1912, and the support which foreign opinion gave\r\nthat venture confused him. He had already consented to peace\r\nnegotiations with the revolutionary South in the middle of December,\r\n1911, and once he was drawn into those negotiations his policy wavered,\r\nthe armistice in the field being constantly extended because he saw that\r\nthe Foreign Powers, and particularly England, were averse from further\r\ncivil war. Having dispatched a former lieutenant, Tong Shao-yi, to\r\nShanghai as his Plenipotentiary, he soon found himself committed to a\r\ncourse of action different from what he had originally contemplated.\r\nSouth China and Central China insisted so vehemently that the only\r\nsolution that was acceptable to them was the permanent and absolute\r\nelimination of the Manchu Dynasty, that he himself was half-convinced,\r\nthe last argument necessary being the secret promise that he should\r\nbecome the first President of the united Republic. In the circumstances,\r\nhad he been really loyal, it was his duty either to resume his warfare\r\nor resign his appointment as Prime Minister and go into retirement. He\r\ndid neither. In a thoroughly characteristic manner he sought a middle\r\ncourse, after having vaguely advocated a national convention to settle\r\nthe matter. By specious misrepresentation the widow of the Emperor\r\nKwanghsu--the Dowager Empress Lung Yu who had succeeded the Prince\r\nRegent Ch'un in her care of the interests of the child Emperor Hsuan\r\nTung--was induced to believe that ceremonial retirement was the only\r\ncourse open to the Dynasty if the country was to be saved from\r\ndisruption and partition. There is reason to believe that the Memorial\r\nof all the Northern Generals which was telegraphed to Peking on the 28th\r\nJanuary, 1912, and which advised abdication, was inspired by him. In any\r\ncase it was certainly Yuan Shih-kai who drew up the so-called Articles\r\nof Favourable Treatment for the Manchu House and caused them to be\r\ntelegraphed to the South, whence they were telegraphed back to him as\r\nthe maximum the Revolutionary Party was prepared to concede: and by a\r\ncurious chance the attempt made to assassinate him outside the Palace\r\nGates actually occurred on the very day he had submitted an outline of\r\nthese terms on his bended knees to the Empress Dowager and secured their\r\nqualified acceptance. The pathetic attempt to confer on him as late as\r\nthe 25th January the title of Marquess, the highest rank of nobility\r\nwhich could be given a Chinese, an attempt which was four times renewed,\r\nwas the last despairing gesture of a moribund power. Within very few\r\ndays the Throne reluctantly decreed its own abdication in three\r\nextremely curious Edicts which are worthy of study in the appendix. They\r\nprove conclusively that the Imperial Family believed that it was only\r\nabdicating its political power, whilst retaining all ancient ceremonial\r\nrights and titles. Plainly the conception of a Republic, or a People's\r\nGovernment, as it was termed in the native ideographs, was\r\nunintelligible to Peking.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai had now won everything he wished for. By securing that the\r\nImperial Commission to organize the Republic and re-unite the warring\r\nsections was placed solely in his hands, he prepared to give a type of\r\nGovernment about which he knew nothing a trial. It is interesting to\r\nnote that he held to the very end of his life that he derived his powers\r\nsolely from the Last Edicts, and in nowise from his compact with the\r\nNanking Republic which had instituted the so-called Provisional\r\nConstitution. He was careful, however, not to lay this down\r\ncategorically until many months later, when his dictatorship seemed\r\nundisputed. But from the day of the Manchu Abdication almost, he was\r\nconstantly engaged in calculating whether he dared risk everything on\r\none throw of the dice and ascend the Throne himself; and it is precisely\r\nthis which imparts such dramatic interest to the astounding story which\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE DREAM REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n(FROM THE 1st JANUARY, 1912, TO THE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo describe briefly and intelligibly the series of transactions from the\r\n1st January, 1912, when the Republic was proclaimed at Nanking by a\r\nhandful of provincial delegates, and Dr. Sun Yat Sen elected Provisional\r\nPresident, to the _coup d'état_ of 4th November, 1913, when Yuan\r\nShih-kai, elected full President a few weeks previously, after having\r\nacted as Chief Executive for twenty months, boldly broke up Parliament\r\nand made himself _de facto_ Dictator of China, is a matter of\r\nextraordinary difficulty.\r\n\r\nAll through this important period of Chinese history one has the\r\nimpression that one is in dreamland and that fleeting emotions take the\r\nplace of more solid things. Plot and counter-plot follow one another so\r\nrapidly that an accurate record of them all would be as wearisome as the\r\nBook of Chronicles itself; whilst the amazing web of financial intrigue\r\nwhich binds the whole together is so complex--and at the same time so\r\nantithetical to the political struggle--that the two stories seem to run\r\ncounter to one another, although they are as closely united as two\r\nassassins pledged to carry through in common a dread adventure. A huge\r\nagglomeration of people estimated to number four hundred millions, being\r\nleft without qualified leaders and told that the system of government,\r\nwhich had been laid down by the Nanking Provisional Constitution and\r\nendorsed by the Abdication Edicts, was a system in which every man was\r\nas good as neighbour, swayed meaninglessly to and fro, vainly seeking to\r\nregain the equilibrium which had been so sensationally lost. A litigious\r\nspirit became so universal that all authority was openly derided,\r\ncrimes of every description being so common as to force most respectable\r\nmen to withdraw from public affairs and leave a bare rump of desperadoes\r\nin power.\r\n\r\nLong embarrassed by the struggle to pay her foreign loans and\r\nindemnities, China was also virtually penniless. The impossibility of\r\narranging large borrowings on foreign markets without the open support\r\nof foreign governments--a support which was hedged round with\r\nconditions--made necessary a system of petty expedients under which\r\npractically every provincial administration hypothecated every liquid\r\nasset it could lay hands upon in order to pay the inordinate number of\r\nundisciplined soldiery who littered the countryside. The issue of\r\nunguaranteed paper-money soon reached such an immense figure that the\r\nmarket was flooded with a worthless currency which it was unable to\r\nabsorb. The Provincial leaders, being powerless to introduce\r\nimprovement, exclaimed that it was the business of the Central\r\nGovernment as representative of the sovereign people to find solutions;\r\nand so long as they maintained themselves in office they went their\r\nrespective ways with a sublime contempt for the chaos around them.\r\n\r\nWhat was this Central Government? In order successfully to understand an\r\nunparalleled situation we must indicate its nature.\r\n\r\nThe manoeuvres to which Yuan Shih-kai had so astutely lent himself from\r\nthe outbreak of the Revolution had left him at its official close\r\nsupreme in name. Not only had he secured an Imperial Commission from the\r\nabdicating Dynasty to organize a popular Government in obedience to the\r\nnational wish, but having brought to Peking the Delegates of the Nanking\r\nRevolutionary Body he had received from them the formal offer of the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements had, of course, been secretly agreed to _en bloc_\r\nbefore the fighting had been stopped and the abdication proclaimed, and\r\nwere part and parcel of the elaborate scenery which officialdom always\r\nemploys in Asia even when it is dealing with matters within the purview\r\nof the masses. They had been made possible by the so-called \"Article of\r\nFavourable Treatment\" drawn-up by Yuan Shih-kai himself, after\r\nconsultation with the rebellious South. In these Capitulations it had\r\nbeen clearly stipulated that the Manchu Imperial Family should receive\r\nin perpetuity a Civil List of $4,000,000 Mexican a year, retaining all\r\ntheir titles as a return for the surrender of their political power, the\r\nbitter pill being gilded in such fashion as to hide its real meaning,\r\nwhich alone was a grave political error.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this agreement, however, great mutual suspicion existed\r\nbetween North and South China. Yuan Shih-kai himself was unable to\r\nforget that the bold attempt to assassinate him in the Peking streets on\r\nthe 17th January, when he was actually engaged in negotiating these very\r\nterms of the Abdication, had been apparently inspired from Nanking;\r\nwhilst the Southern leaders were daily reminded by the vernacular press\r\nthat the man who held the balance of power had always played the part of\r\ntraitor in the past and would certainly do the same again in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWhen the Delegates came to Peking in February, by far the most important\r\nmatter which was still in dispute was the question of the oath of office\r\nwhich Yuan Shih-kai was called upon to take to insure that he would be\r\nfaithful to the Republic. The Delegates had been charged specifically to\r\ndemand on behalf of the seceding provinces that Yuan Shih-kai should\r\nproceed with them to Nanking to take that oath, a course of action which\r\nwould have been held tantamount by the nation to surrender on his part\r\nto those who had been unable to vanquish him in the field. It must also\r\nnot be forgotten that from the very beginning a sharp and dangerous\r\ncleavage of opinion existed as to the manner in which the powers of the\r\nnew government had been derived. South and Central China claimed, and\r\nclaimed rightly, that the Nanking Provincial Constitution was the\r\nInstrument on which the Republic was based: Yuan Shih-kai declared that\r\nthe Abdication Edicts, and not the Nanking Instrument had established\r\nthe Republic, and that therefore it lay within his competence to\r\norganize the new government in the way which he considered most fit.\r\n\r\nThe discussion which raged was suddenly terminated on the night of the\r\n29th February (1912) when without any warning there occurred the\r\nextraordinary revolt of the 3rd Division, a picked Northern corps who\r\nfor forty-eight hours plundered and burnt portions of the capital\r\nwithout any attempts at interference, there being little doubt to-day\r\nthat this manoeuvre was deliberately arranged as a means of intimidation\r\nby Yuan Shih-kai himself. Although the disorders assumed such dimensions\r\nthat foreign intervention was narrowly escaped, the upshot was that the\r\nNanking Delegates were completely cowed and willing to forget all about\r\nforcing the despot of Peking to proceed to the Southern capital. Yuan\r\nShih-kai as the man of the hour was enabled on the 10th March, 1912, to\r\ntake his oath in Peking as he had wished thus securing full freedom of\r\naction during the succeeding years.[6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Encampment of \"The Punitive Expedition\" of 1910 on the\r\nUpper Yangtsze.\r\n\r\n_By courtesy of Major Isaac Newell, U.S. Military Attaché_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Revival of the Imperialistic Worship of Heaven by Yuan\r\nShih-kai in 1914: Scene on the Altar of Heaven, with Sacrificial\r\nOfficers clothed in costumes dating from 2,000 years ago.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Manchu Country Fair: The figures in the foreground are\r\nall Manchu women and girls.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Manchu Woman grinding Grain.]\r\n\r\nIt was on this astounding basis--by means of an organized revolt--that\r\nthe Central Government was reorganized; and every act that followed\r\nbears the mark of its tainted parentage. Accepting readily as his\r\nMinisters in the more unimportant government Departments the nominees of\r\nthe Southern Confederacy (which was now formally dissolved), Yuan\r\nShih-kai was careful to reserve for his own men everything that\r\nconcerned the control of the army and the police, as well as the\r\nall-important ministry of finance. The framework having been thus\r\nerected, attention was almost immediately concentrated on the problem of\r\nfinding money, an amazing matter which would weary the stoutest reader\r\nif given in all its detail but which being part and parcel of the\r\ngeneral problem must be referred to.\r\n\r\nCertain essential features can be very rapidly exposed. We have already\r\nmade clear the purely economic nature of the forces which had sapped the\r\nfoundations of Chinese society. Primarily it had been the disastrous\r\nnature of Chinese gold-indebtedness which had given the new ideas the\r\nforce they required to work their will on the nation. And just because\r\nthe question of this gold-indebtedness had become so serious and such a\r\ndrain on the nation, some months before the outbreak of the Revolution\r\nan arrangement had been entered into with the bankers of four nations\r\nfor a Currency Loan of £10,000,000 with which to make an organized\r\neffort to re-establish internal credit. But this loan had never actually\r\nbeen floated, as a six months' safety clause had permitted a delay\r\nduring which the Revolution had come. It was therefore necessary to\r\nbegin the negotiations anew; and as the rich prizes to be won in the\r\nChinese lottery had attracted general attention in the European\r\nfinancial world through the advertisement which the Revolution had given\r\nthe country, a host of alternative loan proposals now lay at the\r\ndisposal of Peking.\r\n\r\nConsequently an extraordinary chapter of bargaining commenced. Warned\r\nthat an International Debt Commission was the goal aimed at by official\r\nfinance, Yuan Shih-kai and the various parties who made up the\r\nGovernment of the day, though disagreeing on almost every other\r\nquestion, were agreed that this danger must be fought as a common enemy.\r\nThough the Four-Power group alleged that they held the first option on\r\nall Chinese loans, money had already been advanced by a Franco-Belgian\r\nSyndicate to the amount of nearly two million pounds during the critical\r\ndays of the Abdication. Furious at the prospect of losing their\r\npercentages, the Four Power group made the confusion worse confounded by\r\nblocking all competing proposals and closing every possible door. Russia\r\nand Japan, who had hitherto not been parties to the official consortium,\r\nperceiving that participation had become a political necessity, now\r\ndemanded a place which was grudgingly accorded them; and it was in this\r\nway that the celebrated six-power Group arose.\r\n\r\nIt was round this group and the proposed issue of a £60,000,000 loan to\r\nreorganize Chinese finance that the central battle raged. The Belgian\r\nSyndicate, having been driven out of business by the financial boycott\r\nwhich the official group was strong enough to organize on the European\r\nbourses, it remained for China to see whether she could not find some\r\ncombination or some man who would be bold enough to ignore all\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nHer search was not in vain. In September (1912) a London stockbroker,\r\nMr. Birch Crisp, determined to risk a brilliant coup by negotiating by\r\nhimself a Loan of £10,000,000; and the world woke up one morning to\r\nlearn that one man was successfully opposing six governments. The\r\nrecollection of the storm raised in financial circles by this bold\r\nattempt will be fresh in many minds. Every possible weapon was brought\r\ninto play by international finance to secure that the impudence of\r\nfinancial independence should be properly checked; and so it happened\r\nthat although £5,000,000 was secured after an intense struggle it was\r\nsoon plain that the large requirements of a derelict government could\r\nnot be satisfied in this Quixotic manner. Two important points had,\r\nhowever, been attained; first, China was kept financially afloat during\r\nthe year 1912 by the independence of a single member of the London Stock\r\nExchange; secondly, using this coup as a lever the Peking Government\r\nsecured better terms than otherwise would have been possible from the\r\nofficial consortium.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the general internal situation remained deplorable. Nothing\r\nwas done for the provinces whose paper currency was depreciating from\r\nmonth to month in an alarming manner; whilst the rivalries between the\r\nvarious leaders instead of diminishing seemed to be increasing. The\r\nTutuhs, or Military Governors, acting precisely as they saw fit, derided\r\nthe authority of Peking and sought to strengthen their old position by\r\nadding to their armed forces. In the capital the old Manchu court,\r\nsafely entrenched in the vast Winter Palace from which it has not even\r\nto-day been ejected (1917) published daily the Imperial Gazette,\r\nbestowing honours and decorations on courtiers and clansmen and\r\npreserving all the old etiquette. In the North-western provinces, and in\r\nManchuria and Mongolia, the so-called Tsung She Tang, or Imperial Clan\r\nSociety, intrigued perpetually to create risings which would hasten the\r\nrestoration of the fallen House; and although these intrigues never rose\r\nto the rank of a real menace to the country, the fact that they were\r\nsurreptitiously supported by the Japanese secret service was a continual\r\nsource of anxiety. The question of Outer Mongolia was also harassing the\r\nCentral Government. The Hutuktu or Living Buddha of Urga--the chief city\r\nof Outer Mongolia--had utilized the revolution to throw off his\r\nallegiance to Peking; and the whole of this vast region had been thrown\r\ninto complete disorder--which was still further accentuated when Russia\r\non the 21st October (1912) recognized its independence. It was known\r\nthat as a pendent to this Great Britain was about to insist on the\r\nautonomy of Tibet,--a development which greatly hurt Chinese pride.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th August, 1912, the deplorable situation was well-epitomised\r\nby an extraordinary act in Peking, when General Chang Cheng-wu, one of\r\nthe \"heroes\" of the original Wuchang rising, who had been enticed to the\r\ncapital, was suddenly seized after a banquet in his honour and shot\r\nwithout trial at midnight.\r\n\r\nThis event, trivial in itself during times when judicial murders were\r\ncommon, would have excited nothing more than passing interest had not\r\nthe national sentiment been so aroused by the chaotic conditions. As it\r\nwas it served to focus attention on the general mal-administration over\r\nwhich Yuan Shih-kai ruled as provisional President. \"What is my crime?\"\r\nhad shrieked the unhappy revolutionist as he had been shot and then\r\nbayonetted to death. That query was most easily answered. His crime was\r\nthat he was not strong enough or big enough to compete against more\r\nsanguinary men, his disappearance being consequently in obedience to an\r\nuniversal law of nature. Yuan Shih-kai was determined to assert his\r\nmastery by any and every means; and as this man had flouted him he must\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nThe uproar which this crime aroused was, however, not easily appeased;\r\nand the Advisory Council, which was sitting in Peking pending the\r\nassembling of the first Parliament, denounced the Provisional President\r\nso bitterly that to show that these reproaches were ill-deserved he\r\ninvited Dr. Sun Yat-sen to the capital treating him with unparalleled\r\nhonours and requesting him to act as intermediary between the rival\r\nfactions. All such manoeuvres, however, were inspired with one\r\nobject,--namely to prove how nobody but the master of Peking could\r\nregulate the affairs of the country.\r\n\r\nStill no Parliament was assembled. Although the Nanking Provisional\r\nConstitution had stipulated that one was to meet within ten months\r\n_i.e._ before 1st November, 1912, the elections were purposely delayed,\r\nthe attention of the Central Government being concentrated on the\r\nproblem of destroying all rivals, and everything being subordinate to\r\nthis war on persons. Rascals, getting daily more and more out of hand,\r\nworked their will on rich and poor alike, discrediting by their actions\r\nthe name of republicanism and destroying public confidence--which was\r\nprecisely what suited Yuan Shih-kai. Dramatic and extraordinary\r\nincidents continually inflamed the public mind, nothing being too\r\nsingular for those remarkable days.\r\n\r\nVery slowly the problem developed, with everyone exclaiming that foreign\r\nintervention was becoming inevitable. With the beginning of 1913, being\r\nunable to delay the matter any longer, Yuan Shih-kai allowed elections\r\nto be held in the provinces. He was so badly beaten at the polls that it\r\nseemed in spite of his military power that he would be outvoted and\r\noutmanoeuvred in the new National Assembly and his authority undermined.\r\nTo prevent this a fresh assassination was decided upon. The ablest\r\nSouthern leader, Sung Chiao-jen, just as he was entraining for Peking\r\nwith a number of Parliamentarians at Shanghai, was coolly shot in a\r\ncrowded railway station by a desperado who admitted under trial that he\r\nhad been paid £200 for the job by the highest authority in the land, the\r\nevidence produced in court including telegrams from Peking which left no\r\ndoubt as to who had instigated the murder.\r\n\r\nThe storm raised by this evil measure made it appear as if no parliament\r\ncould ever assemble in Peking. But the feeling had become general that\r\nthe situation was so desperate that action had to be taken. Not only was\r\ntheir reputation at stake, but the Kuomingtang or Revolutionary Party\r\nnow knew that the future of their country was involved just as much as\r\nthe safety of their own lives; and so after a rapid consultation they\r\ndetermined that they would beard the lion in his den. Rather\r\nunexpectedly on the 7th April (1913) Parliament was opened in Peking\r\nwith a huge Southern majority and the benediction of all Radicals.[7]\r\nHopes rose with mercurial rapidity as a solution at last seemed in\r\nsight. But hardly had the first formalities been completed and Speakers\r\nbeen elected to both Houses, than by a single dramatic stroke Yuan\r\nShih-kai reduced to nought these labours by stabbing in the back the\r\nwhole theory and practice of popular government.\r\n\r\nThe method he employed was simplicity itself, and it is peculiarly\r\ncharacteristic of the man that he should have been so bluntly cynical.\r\nThough the Provisional Nanking Constitution, which was the \"law\" of\r\nChina so far as there was any law at all, had laid down specifically in\r\narticle XIX that all measures affecting the National Treasury must\r\nreceive the assent of Parliament, Yuan Shih-kai, pretending that the\r\nsmall Advisory Council which had assisted him during the previous year\r\nand which had only just been dissolved, had sanctioned a foreign loan,\r\nperemptorily ordered the signature of the great Reorganization Loan of\r\n£25,000,000 which had been secretly under negotiation all winter with\r\nthe financial agents of six Powers[8], although the rupture which had\r\ncome in the previous June as a forerunner to the Crisp loan had caused\r\nthe general public to lose sight of the supreme importance of the\r\nfinancial factor. Parliament, seeing that apart from the possibility of\r\na Foreign Debt Commission being created something after the Turkish and\r\nEgyptian models, a direct challenge to its existence had been offered,\r\nraged and stormed and did its utmost to delay the question; but the\r\nChief Executive having made up his mind shut himself up in his Palace\r\nand absolutely refused to see any Parliamentary representatives.\r\nAlthough the Minister of Finance himself hesitated to complete the\r\ntransaction in the face of the rising storm and actually fled the\r\ncapital, he was brought back by special train and forced to complete the\r\nagreement. At four o'clock in the morning on the 25th April the last\r\ndocuments were signed in the building of a foreign bank and the Finance\r\nMinister, galloping his carriage suddenly out of the compound to avoid\r\npossible bombs, reported to his master that at last--in spite of the\r\nnominal foreign control which was to govern the disbursement--a vast sum\r\nwas at his disposal to further his own ends.\r\n\r\nSafe in the knowledge that possession is nine points of the law, Yuan\r\nShih-kai now treated with derision the resolutions which Parliament\r\npassed that the transaction was illegal and the loan agreement null and\r\nvoid. Being openly backed by the agents of the Foreign Powers, he\r\nimmediately received large cash advances which enabled him to extend his\r\npower in so many directions that further argument with him seemed\r\nuseless. It is necessary to record that the Parliamentary leaders had\r\nalmost gone down on their knees to certain of the foreign Ministers in\r\nPeking in a vain attempt to persuade them to delay--as they could very\r\nwell have done--the signature of this vital Agreement for forty-eight\r\nhours so that it could be formally passed by the National Assembly, and\r\nthus save the vital portion of the sovereignty of the country from\r\npassing under the heel of one man. But Peking diplomacy is a perverse\r\nand disagreeable thing; and the Foreign Ministers of those days,\r\nalthough accredited to a government which while it had not then been\r\nformally recognized as a Republic by any Power save the United States,\r\nwas bound to be so very shortly, were determined to be reactionary and\r\nwere at heart delighted to find things running back normally to\r\nabsolutism[9]. High finance had at last got hold of everything it\r\nrequired from China and was in no mood to relax the monopoly of the salt\r\nadministration which the Loan Agreement conferred. Nor must the fact be\r\nlost sight of that of the nominal amount of £25,000,000 which had been\r\nborrowed, fully half consisted of repayments to foreign Banks and never\r\nleft Europe. According to the schedules attached to the Agreement, Annex\r\nA, comprising the Boxer arrears and bank advances, absorbed £4,317,778:\r\nAnnex B, being so-called provincial loans, absorbed a further\r\n£2,870,000: Annex C, being liabilities shortly maturing, amounted to\r\n£3,592,263: Annex D, for disbandment of troops, amounted to £3,000,000:\r\nAnnex C, to cover current administrative expenses totalled £5,500,000:\r\nwhilst Annex E which covered the reorganization of the Salt\r\nAdministration, absorbed the last £2,000,000; The bank profits on this\r\nloan alone amounted to 1¼ million pounds; whilst Yuan Shih-kai\r\nhimself was placed in possession by a system of weekly disbursements of\r\na sum roughly amounting to ten million sterling, which was amply\r\nsufficient to allow him to wreak his will on his fellow-countrymen.\r\nExasperated to the pitch of despair by this new development, the Central\r\nand Southern provinces, after a couple of months' vain argument, began\r\nopenly to arm. On the 10th July in Kiangse province on the river\r\nYangtsze the Northern garrisons were fired upon from the Hukow forts by\r\nthe provincial troops under General Li Lieh-chun and the so-called\r\nSecond Revolution commenced.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was short and inglorious. The South, ill-furnished with\r\nmunitions and practically penniless, and always confronted by the same\r\nwell-trained Northern Divisions who had proved themselves invincible\r\nonly eighteen months before fought hard for a while, but never became a\r\nserious menace to the Central Government owing to the lack of\r\nco-operation between the various Rebel forces in the field. The Kiangse\r\ntroops under General Li Lieh-chun, who numbered at most 20,000 men,\r\nfought stiffly, it is true, for a while but were unable to strike with\r\nany success and were gradually driven far back from the river into the\r\nmountains of Kiangse where their numbers rapidly melted away. The\r\nredoubtable revolutionary Huang Hsin, who had proved useful as a\r\npropagandist and a bomb-thrower in earlier days, but who was useless in\r\nserious warfare, although he assumed command of the Nanking garrison\r\nwhich had revolted to a man, and attempted a march up the Pukow railway\r\nin the direction of Tientsin, found his effort break down almost\r\nimmediately from lack of organization and fled to Japan. The Nanking\r\ntroops, although deserted by their leader, offered a strenuous\r\nresistance to the capture of the southern capital which was finally\r\neffected by the old reactionary General Chang Hsun operating in\r\nconjunction with General Feng Kuo-chang who had been dispatched from\r\nPeking with a picked force. The attack on the Shanghai arsenal which had\r\nbeen quietly occupied by a small Northern Garrison during the months\r\nsucceeding the great loan transaction, although pushed with vigour by\r\nthe South, likewise ultimately collapsed through lack of artillery and\r\nproper leadership. The navy, which was wholly Southern in its sympathies\r\nand which had been counted upon as a valuable weapon in cutting off the\r\nwhole Yangtsze Valley, was at the last moment purchased to neutrality by\r\na liberal use of money obtained from the foreign banks, under, it is\r\nsaid, the heading of administrative expenses! The turbulent city of\r\nCanton, although it also rose against the authority of Peking, had been\r\nwell provided for by Yuan Shih-kai. A border General, named Lung\r\nChi-kwang, with 20,000 semi-savage Kwangsi troops had been moved near\r\nthe city and at once attacked and overawed the garrison. Appointed\r\nMilitary Governor of the province in return for his services, this Lung\r\nChi-kwang, who was an infamous brute, for three years ruled the South\r\nwith heartless barbarity, until he was finally ejected by the great\r\nrising of 1916. Thoroughly disappointed in this and many other\r\ndirections the Southern Party was now emasculated; for the moneyed\r\nclasses had withheld their support to the end, and without money nothing\r\nis possible in China. The 1913 outbreak, after lasting a bare two\r\nmonths, ignominiously collapsed with the flight of every one of the\r\nleaders on whose heads prices were put. The road was now left open for\r\nthe last step Yuan Shih-kai had in mind, the coup against Parliament\r\nitself, which although unassociated in any direct way with the rising,\r\nhad undoubtedly maintained secret relations with the rebellious generals\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nParliament had further sinned by appointing a Special Constitutional\r\nDrafting Committee which had held its sittings behind closed doors at\r\nthe Temple of Heaven. During this drafting of the Permanent\r\nConstitution, admittance had been absolutely refused to Yuan Shih-kai's\r\ndelegates who had been sent to urge a modification of the\r\ndecentralization which had been such a characteristic of the Nanking\r\nInstrument. Such details as transpired showed that the principle of\r\nabsolute money-control was not only to be the dominant note in the\r\nPermanent Constitution, but that a new and startling innovation was\r\nbeing included to secure that a _de facto_ Dictatorship should be\r\nrendered impossible. Briefly, it was proposed that when Parliament was\r\nnot actually in session there should be left in Peking a special\r\nParliamentary Committee, charged with supervising and controlling the\r\nExecutive, and checking any usurpation of power.\r\n\r\nThis was enough for Yuan Shih-kai: he felt that he was not only an\r\nobject of general suspicion but that he was being treated with contempt.\r\nHe determined to finish with it all. He was as yet, however, only\r\nprovisional President and it was necessary to show cunning. Once more he\r\nset to work in a characteristic way. By a liberal use of money\r\nParliament was induced to pass in advance of the main body of articles\r\nthe Chapter of the Constitution dealing with the election and term of\r\noffice of the President. When that had been done the two Chambers\r\nsitting as an Electoral College, after the model of the French\r\nParliament, being partly bribed and partly terrorised by a military\r\ndisplay, were induced to elect him full President.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th October he took his final oath of office as President for a\r\nterm of five years before a great gathering of officials and the whole\r\ndiplomatic body in the magnificent Throne Room of the Winter Palace.\r\nSafe now in his Constitutional position nothing remained for him but to\r\nstrike. On the 4th November he issued an arbitrary Mandate, which\r\nreceived the counter-signature of the whole Cabinet, ordering the\r\nunseating of all the so-called Kuomingtang or Radical Senators and\r\nRepresentatives on the counts of conspiracy and secret complicity with\r\nthe July rising and vaguely referring to the filling of the vacancies\r\nthus created by new elections.[10] The Metropolitan Police rigorously\r\ncarried out the order and although no brutality was shown, it was made\r\nclear that if any of the indicted men remained in Peking their lives\r\nwould be at stake. Having made it impossible for Parliament to sit owing\r\nto the lack of quorums, Yuan Shih-kai was able to proceed with his work\r\nof reorganization in the way that best suited him; and the novel\r\nspectacle was offered of a truly Mexican situation created in the Far\r\nEast by and with the assent of the Powers. It is significant that the\r\nday succeeding this _coup d'état_ of the 4th November the agreement\r\nconceding autonomy to Outer Mongolia was signed with Russia, China\r\nsimply retaining the right to station a diplomatic representative at\r\nUrga.[11]\r\n\r\nIn spite of his undisputed power, matters however did not improve. The\r\npolice-control, judiciously mingled with assassinations, which was now\r\nput in full vigour was hardly the administration to make room for which\r\nthe Manchus had been expelled; and the country secretly chafed and\r\ncursed. But the disillusionment of the people was complete. Revolt had\r\nbeen tried in vain; and as the support which the Powers were affording\r\nto this régime was well understood there was nothing to do but to wait,\r\nsafe in the knowledge that such a situation possessed no elements of\r\npermanency.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] The defective nature of this oath of office will be patent at a\r\nglance:\r\n\r\n\"At the beginning of the Republic there are many things to be taken care\r\nof. I, Yuan Shih-kai, sincerely wish to exert my utmost to promote the\r\ndemocratic spirit, to remove the dark blots of despotism, to obey\r\nstrictly the Constitution, and to abide by the wish of the people, so as\r\nto place the country in a safe, united, strong, and firm position, and\r\nto effect the happiness and welfare of the divisions of the Chinese\r\nrace. All these wishes I will fulfil without fail. As soon as a new\r\nPresident is elected by the National Assembly I shall at once vacate my\r\npresent position. With all sincerity I take this oath before the people\r\nof China.\r\n\r\n\"Dated the tenth day of March in the First Year of the Republic of China\r\n(1912).\"\r\n\r\n(Signed) Yuan Shih-kai.\r\n\r\n[7] The Parliament of China is composed of a House of Representatives\r\nnumbering 596 members and a Senate of 274. The Representatives are\r\nelected by means of a property and educational franchise which is\r\nestimated to give about four million voters (1 per cent of the\r\npopulation) although in practice relatively few vote. The Senate is\r\nelected by the Provincial Assemblies by direct ballot. In the opinion of\r\nthe writer, the Chinese Parliament in spite of obvious shortcoming, is\r\nrepresentative of the country in its present transitional stage.\r\n\r\n[8] The American Group at the last moment dropped out of the Sextuple\r\ncombination (prior to the signature of the contract) after President\r\nWilson had made his well-known pronouncement deprecating the association\r\nof Americans in any financial undertakings which impinged upon the\r\nrights of sovereignty of a friendly Power,--which was his considered\r\nview of the manner in which foreign governments were assisting their\r\nnationals to gain control of the Salt Administration The exact language\r\nthe President used was that the conditions of the loan seemed \"to touch\r\nvery nearly the administrative independence of China itself,\" and that a\r\nloan thus obtained was \"obnoxious\" to the principles upon which the\r\nAmerican government rests. It is to be hoped that President Wilson's\r\ndictum will be universally accepted after the war and that meddling in\r\nChinese affairs will cease.\r\n\r\n[9] The United States accorded formal recognition to the Republic on the\r\nelection of the Speakers of the two Houses of Parliament: the other\r\nTreaty Powers delayed recognition until Yuan Shih-kai had been elected\r\nfull President in October. It has been very generally held that the long\r\ndelay in foreign recognition of the Republic contributed greatly to its\r\ninternal troubles by making every one doubt the reality of the Nanking\r\ntransaction. Most important, however, is the historical fact that a\r\ngroup of Powers numbering the two great leaders of democracy in\r\nEurope--England and France--did everything they could in Peking to\r\nenthrone Yuan Shih-kai as dictator.\r\n\r\n[10] According to the official lists published subsequent to the coup\r\nd'état, 98 Senators and 252 Members of the House of Representatives had\r\ntheir Parliamentary Certificates impounded by the police as a result of\r\nthe Mandates of the 4th November, and were ordered to leave the Capital.\r\nIn addition 34 Senators and 54 Members of the Lower House fled from\r\nPeking before their Certificates could be seized. Therefore the total\r\nnumber affected by the proscription was 132 Senators and 306\r\nRepresentatives. As the quorums in the case of both Houses are half the\r\ntotal membership, any further sittings were thus made impossible.\r\n\r\n[11] A full copy of this agreement will be found in the appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE DICTATOR AT WORK\r\n\r\n(FROM THE COUP D'ETAT OF THE 4TH NOVEMBER, 1913, TO THE OUTBREAK OF THE\r\nWORLD-WAR 1ST AUGUST, 1914)\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the Parliament of China effectively destroyed, and the turbulent\r\nYangtsze Valley dragooned into sullen submission, Yuan Shih-kai's task\r\nhad become so vastly simplified that he held the moment to have arrived\r\nwhen he could openly turn his hand to the problem of making himself\r\nabsolutely supreme, _de jure_ as well as _de facto_. But there was one\r\nremaining thing to be done. To drive the last nail into the coffin of\r\nthe Republic it was necessary to discredit and virtually imprison the\r\nman who was Vice-President.\r\n\r\nIt is highly characteristic that although he had received from the hero\r\nof the Wuchang Rising the most loyal co-operation--a co-operation of a\r\nvery arduous character since the Commander of the Middle Yangtsze had\r\nhad to resist the most desperate attempt? to force him over to the side\r\nof the rebellion in July, 1913, nevertheless, Yuan Shih-kai was\r\ndetermined to bring this man to Peking as a prisoner of state.\r\n\r\nIt was just the fact that General Li Yuan-hung was a national hero which\r\nimpelled the Dictator to action. In the election which had been carried\r\nout in October, 1913, by the National Assembly sitting as a National\r\nConvention, in spite of every effort to destroy his influence, the\r\npersonal popularity of the Vice-President had been such that he had\r\nreceived a large number of votes for the office of full President--which\r\nhad necessitated not one but three ballots being taken, making most\r\npeople declare that had there been no bribery or intimidation he would\r\nhave probably been elected to the supreme office in the land, and\r\nousted the ambitious usurper. In such circumstances his complete\r\nelimination was deemed an elementary necessity. To secure that end Yuan\r\nShih-kai suddenly dispatched to Wuchang--where the Vice-President had\r\nresided without break since 1911--the Minister of War, General Tuan\r\nChi-jui, with implicit instructions to deal with the problem in any way\r\nhe deemed satisfactory, stopping short of nothing should his victim\r\nprove recalcitrant.\r\n\r\nFortunately General Tuan Chi-jui did not belong to the ugly breed of men\r\nYuan Shih-kai loved to surround himself with; and although he was a\r\nloyal and efficient officer the politics of the assassin were unknown to\r\nhim. He was therefore able to convince the Vice-President after a brief\r\ndiscussion that the easiest way out of the ring of intriguers and\r\nplotters in which Yuan Shih-kai was rapidly surrounding him in Wuchang\r\nwas to go voluntarily to the capital. There at least he would be in\r\ndaily touch with developments and able to fight his own battles without\r\nfear of being stabbed in the back; since under the eye of the foreign\r\nLegations even Yuan Shih-kai was exhibiting a certain timidity. Indeed\r\nafter the outcry which General Chang Cheng-wu's judicial murder had\r\naroused he had reserved his ugliest deeds for the provinces, only small\r\nmen being done to death in Peking. Accordingly, General Li Yuan-hung\r\npacked a bag and accompanied only by an aide-de-camp left abruptly for\r\nthe capital where he arrived on the 11th December, 1913.\r\n\r\nA great sensation was caused throughout China by this sudden departure,\r\nconsternation prevailing among the officers and men of the Hupeh\r\n(Wuchang) army when the newspapers began to hint that their beloved\r\nchief had been virtually abducted. Although cordially received by Yuan\r\nShih-kai and given as his personal residence the. Island Palace where\r\nthe unfortunate Emperor Kwanghsu had been so long imprisoned by the\r\nEmpress Dowager Tsu Hsi after her _coup d'état_ of 1898, it did not take\r\nlong for General Li Yuan-hung to understand that his presence was a\r\nsource of embarrassment to the man who would be king. Being, however,\r\ngifted with an astounding fund of patience, he prepared to sit down and\r\nallow the great game which he knew would now unroll to be played to its\r\nnormal ending. What General Li Yuan-hung desired above all was to be\r\nforgotten completely and absolutely--springing to life when the hour of\r\ndeliverance finally arrived. His policy was shown to be not only\r\npsychologically accurate, but masterly in a political sense. The\r\ngreatest ally of honesty in China has always been time, the inherent\r\ndecency of the race finally discrediting scoundrelism in every period of\r\nChinese history.\r\n\r\nThe year 1914 dawned with so many obstacles removed that Yuan Shih-kai\r\nbecame more and more peremptory in his methods. In February the young\r\nEmpress Lun Yi, widow of the Emperor Kwanghsu, who two years previously\r\nin her character of guardian of the boy-Emperor Hsuan Tung, had been\r\ncajoled into sanctioning the Abdication Edicts, unexpectedly expired,\r\nher death creating profound emotion because it snapped the last link\r\nwith the past. Yuan Shih-kai's position was considerably strengthened by\r\nthis auspicious event which secretly greatly delighted him; and by his\r\norder for three days the defunct Empress lay in State in the Grand Hall\r\nof the Winter Palace and received the obeisance of countless multitudes\r\nwho appeared strangely moved by this hitherto unknown procedure. There\r\nwas now only a nine-year old boy between the Dictator and his highest\r\nambitions. Two final problems still remained to be dealt with: to give a\r\nlegal form to a purely autocratic rule, and to find money to govern the\r\ncountry. The second matter was vastly more important than the first to a\r\nman who did not hesitate to base his whole polity on the teachings of\r\nMachiavelli, legality being looked upon as only so much political\r\nwindow-dressing to placate foreign opinion and prevent intervention,\r\nwhilst without money even the semblance of the rights of eminent domain\r\ncould not be preserved. Everything indeed hinged on the question of\r\nfinding money.\r\n\r\nThere was none in China, at least none for the government. Financial\r\nchaos still reigned supreme in spite of the great Reorganization Loan of\r\n£25,000,000, which had been carefully arranged more for the purpose of\r\nwiping-out international indebtedness and balancing the books of foreign\r\nbankers than to institute a modern government. All the available specie\r\nin the country had been very quietly remitted in these troubled times by\r\nthe native merchant-guilds from every part of China to the vast emporium\r\nof Shanghai for safe custody, where a sum not far short of a hundred\r\nmillion ounces now choked the vaults of the foreign banks,--being safe\r\nfrom governmental expropriation. The collection of provincial revenues\r\nhaving been long disorganized, Yuan Shih-kai, in spite of his military\r\ndictatorship, found it impossible to secure the proper resumption of the\r\nprovincial remittances. Fresh loans became more and more sought after;\r\nby means of forced domestic issues a certain amount of cash was\r\nobtained, but the country lived from hand to mouth and everybody was\r\nunhappy. Added to this by March the formidable insurrection of the\r\n\"White Wolf\" bandits in Central China--under the legendary leadership of\r\na man who was said to be invulnerable--necessitated the mobilization of\r\na fresh army which ran into scores of battalions and which was vainly\r\nengaged for nearly half a year in rounding-up this replica of the\r\nMexican Villa. So demoralized had the army become from long licence that\r\nthis guerrilla warfare was waged with all possible slackness until a\r\nchance shot mortally wounded the chief brigand and his immense following\r\nautomatically dispersed. During six months these pests had ravaged three\r\nprovinces and menaced one of the most strongly fortified cities in\r\nAsia--the old capital of China, Hsianfu, whither the Manchu Court had\r\nfled in 1900.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile wholesale executions were carried out in the provinces with\r\nmonotonous regularity and all attempts at rising ruthlessly suppressed.\r\nIn Peking the infamous Chih Fa Chu or Military Court--a sort of Chinese\r\nStar-Chamber--was continually engaged in summarily dispatching men\r\nsuspected of conspiring against the Dictator, Even the printed word was\r\nlooked upon as seditious, an unfortunate native editor being actually\r\nflogged to death in Hankow for telling the truth about conditions in the\r\nriverine districts. These cruelties made men more and more determined to\r\npay off the score the very first moment that was possible. Although he\r\nwas increasingly pressed for ready money, Yuan Shih-kai, by the end of\r\nApril, 1914, had the situation sufficiently in hand to bring out his\r\nsupreme surprise,--a brand-new Constitution promulgated under the\r\neuphonious title of \"The Constitutional Compact.\"\r\n\r\nThis precious document, which had no more legality behind it as a\r\ngoverning instrument than a private letter, can be studied by the\r\ncurious in the appendix where it is given in full: here it is sufficient\r\nto say that no such hocuspocus had ever been previously indulged in\r\nChina. Drafted by an American legal adviser, Dr. Goodnow, who was later\r\nto earn unenviable international notoriety as the endorser of the\r\nmonarchy scheme, it erected what it was pleased to call the Presidential\r\nSystem; that is, it placed all power directly in the hands of the\r\nPresident, giving him a single Secretary of State after the American\r\nmodel and reducing Cabinet Ministers to mere Department Chiefs who\r\nreceived their instructions from the State Department but had no real\r\nvoice in the actual government. A new provincial system was likewise\r\ninvented for the provinces, the Tutuhs or Governors of the Revolutionary\r\nperiod being turned into Chiang Chun or Military Officials on the Manchu\r\nmodel and provincial control absolutely centralized in their hands,\r\nwhilst the Provincial Assemblies established under the former dynasty\r\nwere summarily abolished. The worship at the Temple of Heaven was also\r\nre-established and so was the official worship of Confucius--both\r\nImperialistic measures--whilst a brand-new ceremony, the worship of the\r\ntwo titulary Military Gods, was ordered so as to inculcate military\r\nvirtue! It was laid down that in the worship of Heaven the President\r\nwould wear the robes of the Dukes of the Chow dynasty, B.C. 1112, a\r\nnovel and interesting republican experiment. Excerpts from two Mandates\r\nwhich belong to these days throw a flood of light on the kind of\r\nreasoning which was held to justify these developments. The first\r\ndeclares:\r\n\r\n    ... \"In a Republic the Sovereign Power is vested in the people, and\r\n    the main principle is that all things should be determined in\r\n    accordance with the desires of the majority. These desires may be\r\n    embraced by two words, namely, existence and happiness. I, the\r\n    President, came from my farm because I was unable to bear the\r\n    eternal sufferings of the innocent people. I assumed office and\r\n    tried vainly to soothe the violent feelings. The greatest evil\r\n    nowadays is the misunderstanding of true principles. The Republicans\r\n    on the pretext of public interest try to attain selfish ends, some\r\n    going so far as to consider the forsaking of parents as a sign of\r\n    liberty and regarding the violation of the laws as a demonstration\r\n    of equality. I will certainly do my best to change all this.\"\r\n\r\nIn the second Mandate Yuan Shih-kai justifies the re-establishment of\r\nthe Confucian worship in a singular way, incidentally showing how\r\nutterly incomprehensible to him is the idea of representative\r\ngovernment, since he would appear to have imagined that by dispatching\r\ncircular telegrams to the provincial capitals and receiving affirmative\r\nreplies from his creatures all that is necessary in the way of a\r\nnational endorsement of high constitutional measures had been obtained.\r\n\r\n    ... \"China's devotion to Confucius began with the reign of the\r\n    Emperor Hsiaowu, of the Han dynasty, who rejected the works of the\r\n    hundred authors, making the six Confucian classics the leading\r\n    books. Confucius, born in the time of the tyranny of the nobility,\r\n    in his works declared that after war disturbances comes peace, and\r\n    with peace real tranquillity and happiness. This, therefore, is the\r\n    fountain of Republicanism. After studying the history of China and\r\n    consulting the opinions of scholars, I find that Confucius must\r\n    remain the teacher for thousands of generations. But in a Republic\r\n    the people possess sovereign power. Therefore circular telegrams\r\n    were dispatched to all the provinces to collect opinions, and many\r\n    affirmative answers have already been received. Therefore, all\r\n    colleges, schools, and public bodies are ordered to revive the\r\n    sacrificial ceremony of Confucius, which shall be carefully and\r\n    minutely ordained.\" ...\r\n\r\nWith the formal promulgation of the Constitutional Compact the situation\r\nhad become bizarre in the extreme. Although even the child-mind might\r\nhave known that powers for Constitution-making were vested solely in the\r\nNational Assembly, and that the re-division of authority which was now\r\nmade was wholly illegal, because Yuan Shih-kai as the bailiff of the\r\nPowers was able to do much as he pleased; and at a moment when Liberal\r\nEurope was on the eve of plunging into the most terrible war in history\r\nin defence of right against might, reaction and Prussianism of the most\r\nrepulsive type were passed by unnoticed in China. In a few loosely\r\ndrafted chapters not only was the governance of the country rearranged\r\nto suit a purely dictational rule, but the actual Parliament was\r\npermanently extinguished and replaced by a single Legislative Chamber\r\n(_Li Fa Yuan_) which from its very composition could be nothing but a\r\nharmless debating Society with no greater significance than a dietine of\r\none of the minor German States. Meanwhile, as there was no intention of\r\nallowing even this chamber to assemble until the last possible moment, a\r\nSenate was got together as the organ of public opinion, ten Senators\r\nbeing chosen to draft yet another Constitution which would be the final\r\none. Remarkable steps were taken a little later in the year (1914) to\r\nsecure that the succession to the dictatorship should be left in Yuan\r\nShih-kai's own hands. An elaborate ritual was contrived and officially\r\npromulgated under the title of the Presidential Succession Law on the\r\n29th December whereby the Chief Executive selected three names which\r\nwere placed in a gold box in a Stone House in the grounds of the\r\nPalace,--the gold box only to be opened when death or incapacity\r\ndeprived the nation of its self-appointed leader. For the term of the\r\npresidency was openly converted into one of ten years and made subject\r\nto indefinite renewal by this precious instrument which was the work of\r\nthe puppet senate. In case of the necessity of an election suddenly\r\narising, an Electoral College was to be formed by fifty members drawn\r\nfrom the Legislative Chamber and fifty from the Senate, the Presidential\r\ncandidates consisting of the President (if he so desired) and the three\r\nwhose names were in the gold box in the Stone House in the Palace\r\ngrounds. It is not definitely known to whom these provisions were due,\r\nbut it is known that at least they were not the work of the American\r\nadviser.\r\n\r\nHis responsibility, however, was very great; for the keynote of all this\r\nscheme, according to Dr. Goodnow[12], was \"centralization of power,\" a\r\nparrot-like phrase which has deluded better men than ever came to China\r\nand which--save as a method necessary during a state of war--should\r\nhave no place in modern politics. But it was precisely this which\r\nappealed to Yuan Shih-kai. Although as President he was _ex officio_\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, he now turned this office into\r\na direct and special organization installed within the precincts of the\r\nImperial City. The flags of this new dictatorship constantly floated\r\nover his palace, whilst scores of officers were appointed to scores of\r\ndepartments which were directly concerned with centralizing the control\r\nof every armed man in the country in the master's hands. Meanwhile in\r\norder to placate provincial commanders, a \"Palace of Generals,\" was\r\ncreated in Peking to which were brought all men it was held desirable to\r\nemasculate. Here, drawing ample salaries, they could sit in idleness the\r\nlivelong day, discussing the battles they had never fought and\r\nintriguing against one another, two occupations in which the product of\r\nthe older school of men in China excels. Provincial levies which had any\r\nmilitary virtue, were gradually disbanded, though many of the rascals\r\nand rapscallions, who were open menaces to good government were left\r\nwith arms in their hands so as to be an argument in favour of drastic\r\npolice-rule. Thus it is significant of the underlying falseness and\r\nweakness of the dictator's character that he never dared to touch the\r\ntroops of the reprobate General Chang Hsun, who had made trouble for\r\nyears, and who had nearly embroiled China in war with Japan during the\r\nso-called Second Revolution (July-August, 1913) by massacring some\r\nJapanese civilians in the streets of Nanking when the city was\r\nrecaptured. So far from disbanding his men, Chang Hsun managed\r\nconstantly to increase his army of 30,000 men on the plea that the post\r\nof Inspector-General of the Yangtsze Valley, which had been given to him\r\nas a reward for refusing to throw in his lot with the Southern rebels,\r\ndemanded larger forces. Yuan Shih-kai, although half afraid of him,\r\nfound him at various periods useful as a counterweight to other generals\r\nin the provinces; in any case he was not the man to risk anything by\r\nattempting to crush him. As he was planted with his men astride of the\r\nstrategically important Pukow railway, it was always possible to order\r\nhim at a moment's notice into the Yangtsze Valley which was thus\r\nconstantly under the menace of fire and sword.\r\n\r\nFar and wide Yuan Shih-kai now stretched his nets. He even employed\r\nAmericans throughout the United States in the capacity of press-agents\r\nin order to keep American public opinion favourable to him, hoping to\r\ninvoke their assistance against his life-enemy--Japan--should that be\r\nnecessary. The precise details of this propaganda and the sums spent in\r\nits prosecution are known to the writer; if he refrains from publishing\r\nthem it is solely for reasons of policy. England it was not necessary to\r\ndeal with in this way. Chance had willed that the British Representative\r\nin Peking should be an old friend who had known the Dictator intimately\r\nsince his Korean days; and who faithful to the extraordinary English\r\nlove of hero-worship believed that such a surprising character could do\r\nlittle wrong. British policy which has always been a somewhat variable\r\nquantity in China, owing to the spasmodic attention devoted to such a\r\ndistant problem, may be said to have been non-existent during all this\r\nperiod--a state of affairs not conducive to international happiness.\r\n\r\nSlowly the problem developed in a shiftless, irresolute way. Unable to\r\nsee that China had vastly changed, and that government by rascality had\r\nbecome a physical and moral impossibility, the Legations in Peking\r\nadopted an attitude of indifference leaving Yuan Shih-kai to wreak his\r\nwill on the people. The horde of foreign advisers who had been appointed\r\nmerely as a piece of political window-dressing, although they were\r\nallowed to do no work, were useful in running backwards and forwards\r\nbetween the Legations and the Presidential headquarters and in making\r\neach Power suppose that its influence was of increasing importance. It\r\nwas made abundantly clear that in Yuan Shih-kai's estimation the\r\nLegations played in international politics much the same rôle that\r\nprovincial capitals did in domestic politics: so long as you bound both\r\nto benevolent neutrality the main problem--the consolidation of\r\ndictatorial power--could be pushed on with as you wished. Money,\r\nhowever, remained utterly lacking and a new twenty-five million sterling\r\nloan was spoken of as inevitable--the accumulated deficit in 1914 being\r\nalone estimated at thirty-eight million pounds. But although this\r\nfinancial dearth was annoying, Chinese resources were sufficient to\r\nallow the account to be carried on from day to day. Some progress was\r\nmade in railways, building concessions being liberally granted to\r\nforeign corporations, this policy having received a great impetus from\r\nthe manner in which Dr. Sun Yat Sen had boomed the necessity for better\r\ncommunications during the short time he had ruled at a National Railway\r\nBureau in Shanghai, an office from which he had been relieved in 1913 on\r\nit being discovered that he was secretly indenting for quick-firing\r\nguns. Certain questions proved annoying and insoluble, for instance the\r\nTibetan question concerning which England was very resolute, as well as\r\nthe perpetual risings in Inner Mongolia, a region so close to Peking\r\nthat concentrations of troops were necessary. But on the whole as time\r\nwent on there was increasing indifference both among the Foreign Powers\r\nand Chinese for the extraordinary state of affairs which had been\r\nallowed to grow up.\r\n\r\nThere was one notable exception, however, Japan. Never relaxing her grip\r\non a complicated problem, watchful and active, where others were\r\nindifferent and slothful, Japan bided her time. Knowing that the hour\r\nhad almost arrived when it would be possible to strike, Japan was vastly\r\nactive behind the scenes in China long before the outbreak of the\r\nEuropean war gave her the longed for opportunity; and largely because of\r\nher the pear, which seemed already almost ripe, finally withered on the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] It is significant that Dr. Goodnow carried out all his\r\nConstitutional studies in Germany, specializing in that department known\r\nas Administrative Law which has no place, fortunately, in Anglo-Saxon\r\nconceptions of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FACTOR OF JAPAN\r\n\r\n(FROM THE OUTBREAK OF THE WORLD-WAR, 1ST AUGUST, 1914, TO THE FILING OF\r\nTHE TWENTY-ONE DEMANDS, 18TH JANUARY, 1915)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thunderclap of the European war shattered the uneasy calm in China,\r\nnot because the Chinese knew anything of the mighty issues which were to\r\nbe fought out with such desperation and valour, but because the presence\r\nof the German colony of Kiaochow on Chinese soil and the activity of\r\nGerman cruisers in the Yellow Sea brought the war to China's very doors.\r\nVaguely conscious that this might spell disaster to his own ambitious\r\nplans, Yuan Shih-kai was actually in the midst of tentative negotiations\r\nwith the German Legation regarding the retrocession of the Kiaochow\r\nterritory when the news reached him that Japan, after some rapid\r\nnegotiations with her British Ally, had filed an ultimatum on Germany,\r\nperemptorily demanding the handing-over of all those interests that had\r\nbeen forcibly acquired in Shantung province in the great leasing-year of\r\n1898.\r\n\r\nAt once Yuan Shih-kai realized that the Nemesis which had dogged his\r\nfootsteps all his life was again close behind him. In the Japanese\r\nattack on Kiaochow he foresaw a web of complications which even his\r\nunrivalled diplomacy might be unable to unravel; for he knew well from\r\nbitter experience that wherever the Japanese sets his foot there he\r\nremains. It is consequently round this single factor of Japan that the\r\nhistory of the two succeeding years revolves. From being indisputably\r\nthe central figure on the Chinese canvas, Yuan Shih-kai suddenly becomes\r\nsubordinate to the terror of Japanese intervention which hangs over him\r\nconstantly like a black cloud, and governs every move he made from the\r\n15th August, 1914, to the day of his dramatic death on the 6th June,\r\n1916. We shall attempt to write down the true explanation of why this\r\nshould have been so.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely hard to discuss the question of Japan for the benefit of\r\nan exclusively Western audience in a convincing way because Japanese\r\npolicy has two distinct facets which seem utterly contradictory, and yet\r\nwhich are in a great measure understandable if the objects of that\r\ndiplomacy are set down. Being endowed with an extraordinary capacity for\r\ntaking detached views, the Statesmen of Tokio long ago discerned the\r\nnecessity of having two independent policies--an Eastern policy for\r\nEastern Asia and a Western policy for Western nations--because East and\r\nWest are essentially antithetical, and cannot be treated (at least not\r\nyet) in precisely the same manner. Whilst the Western policy is frank\r\nand manly, and is exclusively in the hands of brilliant and attractive\r\nmen who have been largely educated in the schools of Europe and America\r\nand who are fully able to deal with all matters in accordance with the\r\ncustomary traditions of diplomacy, the Eastern policy is the work of\r\nobscurantists whose imaginations are held by the vast projects which the\r\nMilitary Party believes are capable of realization in China. There is\r\nthus a constant contradiction in the attitude of Japan which men have\r\nsought in vain to reconcile. It is for this reason that the outer world\r\nis divided into two schools of thought, one believing implicitly in\r\nJapan's _bonâ fides_, the other vulgarly covering her with abuse and\r\ndeclaring that she is the last of all nations in her conceptions of fair\r\nplay and honourable treatment. Both views are far-fetched. It is as true\r\nof Japan as it is of every other Government in the world that her\r\nactions are dictated neither by altruism nor by perfidy, but are merely\r\nthe result of the faulty working of a number of fallible brains and as\r\nregards the work of administration in Japan itself the position is\r\nequally extraordinary. Here, at the extreme end of the world, so far\r\nfrom being in any way threatened, the principle of Divine Right, which\r\nis being denounced and dismembered in Europe as a crude survival from\r\nalmost heathen days, stands untouched and still exhibits itself in all\r\nits pristine glory. A highly aristocratic Court, possessing one of the\r\nmost complicated and jealously protected hierarchies in the world, and\r\npresided over by a monarch claiming direct descent from the sacred Jimmu\r\nTenno of twenty-five hundred years ago, decrees to-day precisely as\r\nbefore, the elaborate ritual governing every move, every decision and\r\nevery agreement. There is something so engaging in this political\r\ncuriosity, something so far removed from the vast world-movement now\r\nrolling fiercely to its conclusion, that we may be pardoned for\r\ninterpolating certain capital considerations which closely affect the\r\nfuture of China and therefore cannot fail to be of public interest.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese, who owe their whole theocratic conception to the Chinese,\r\njust as they owe all their letters and their learning to them, still\r\nnominally look upon their ruler as the link between Heaven and Earth,\r\nand the central fact dominating their cosmogony. Although the vast\r\nnumber of well-educated men who to-day crowd the cities of Japan are\r\nfully conscious of the bizarre nature of this belief in an age which has\r\nturned its back on superstition, nothing has yet been done to modify it\r\nbecause--and this is the important point--the structure of Japanese\r\nsociety is such that without a violent upheaval which shall hurl the\r\nmilitary clan system irremediably to the ground, it is absolutely\r\nimpossible for human equality to be admitted and the man-god theory to\r\nbe destroyed. So long as these two features-exist; that is so long as a\r\nprivileged military caste supports and attempts to make all-powerful the\r\nman-god theory, so long will Japan be an international danger-spot\r\nbecause there will lack those democratic restraints which this war has\r\nshown are absolutely essential to secure a peaceful understanding among\r\nthe nations. It is for this reason that Japan will fail to attain the\r\nposition the art-genius and industry of her people entitle her to and\r\nmust limp behind the progress of the world unless a very radical\r\nrevision of the constitution is achieved. The disabilities which arise\r\nfrom an archaic survival are so great that they will affect China as\r\nadversely as Japan, and therefore should be universally understood.\r\n\r\nJapanese history, if stripped of its superficial aspects, has a certain\r\nremarkable quality; it seems steeped in heroic blood. The doctrine of\r\nforce, which expresses itself in its crudest forms in Europe, has always\r\nbeen in Japan a system of heroic-action so fascinating to humanity at\r\nlarge that until recent times its international significance has not\r\nbeen realized. The feudal organization of Japanese society which arose\r\nas a result of the armed conquest of the islands fifteen hundred years\r\nago, precluded centralizating measures being taken because the Throne,\r\nrelying on the virtues of Divine Ancestors rather than on any\r\nwell-articulated political theory, was weak in all except certain\r\nquasisacerdotal qualities, and forced to rely on great chieftains for\r\nthe execution of its mandates as well as for its defence. The military\r\ntitle of \"barbarian-conquering general,\" which was first conferred on a\r\ngreat clan leader eight centuries ago, was a natural enough development\r\nwhen we remember that the autochthonous races were even then not yet\r\npushed out of the main island, and were still battling with the\r\nadvancing tide of Japanese civilization which was itself composed of\r\nseveral rival streams coming from the Asiatic mainland and from the\r\nMalayan archipelagoes. This armed settlement saturates Japanese history\r\nand is responsible for the unending local wars and the glorification of\r\nthe warrior. The conception of triumphant generalship which Hideyoshi\r\nattempted unsuccessfully to carry into Korea in the Sixteenth Century,\r\nled directly at the beginning of the Seventeenth Century to the formal\r\nestablishment of the Shogunate, that military dictatorship being the\r\nresult of the backwash of the Korean adventure, and the greatest proof\r\nof the disturbance which it had brought in Japanese society. The\r\npersistence of this hereditary military dictatorship for more than two\r\nand a half centuries is a remarkable illustration of the fact that as in\r\nChina so in Japan the theocratic conception was unworkable save in\r\nprimitive times--civilization demanding organization rather than\r\nprecepts and refusing to bow its head to speechless kings. Although the\r\nRestoration of 1868 nominally gave back to the Throne all it had been\r\nforced to leave in other hands since 1603, that transfer of power was\r\nimaginary rather than real, the new military organization which\r\nsucceeded the Shogun's government being the vital portion of the\r\nRestoration. In other words, it was the leaders of Japan's conscript\r\narmies who inherited the real power, a fact made amply evident by the\r\ncrushing of the Satsuma Rebellion by these new corps whose organization\r\nallowed them to overthrow the proudest and most valorous of the Samurai\r\nand incidentally to proclaim the triumph of modern firearms.\r\n\r\nNow it is important to note that as early as 1874--that is six years\r\nafter the Restoration of the Emperor Meiji--these facts were attracting\r\nthe widest notice in Japanese society, the agitation for a Constitution\r\nand a popular assembly being very vigorously pushed. Led by the\r\nwell-known and aristocratic Itagaki, Japanese Liberalism had joined\r\nbattle with out-and-out Imperialism more than a quarter of a century\r\nago; and although the question of recovering Tariff and Judicial\r\nautonomy and revising the Foreign Treaties was more urgent in those\r\ndays, the foreign question was often pushed aside by the fierceness of\r\nthe constitutional agitation.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until 1889 that a Constitution was finally granted\r\nto the Japanese--that instrument being a gift from the Crown, and\r\nnothing more than a conditional warrant to a limited number of men to\r\nbecome witnesses of the processes of government but in no sense its\r\ncontrollers. The very first Diet summoned in 1890 was sufficient proof\r\nof that. A collision at once occurred over questions of finance which\r\nresulted in the resignation of the Ministry. And ever since those days,\r\nthat is for twenty-seven consecutive years, successive Diets in Japan\r\nhave been fighting a forlorn fight for the power which can never be\r\ntheirs save by revolution, it being only natural that Socialism should\r\ncome to be looked upon by the governing class as Nihilism, whilst the\r\nmob-threat has been very acute ever since the Tokio peace riots of 1905.\r\n\r\nNow it is characteristic of the ceremonial respect which all Japanese\r\nhave for the Throne that all through this long contest the main issue\r\nshould have been purposely obscured. The traditional feelings of\r\nveneration which a loyal and obedient people feel for a line of\r\nmonarchs, whose origin is lost in the mists of antiquity, are such that\r\nthey have turned what is in effect an ever-growing struggle against the\r\narchaic principle of divine right into a contest with clan-leaders whom\r\nthey assert are acting \"unconstitutionally\" whenever they choose to\r\nassert the undeniable principles of the Constitution. Thus to-day we\r\nhave this paradoxical situation; that although Japanese Liberalism must\r\nfrom its very essence be revolutionary, _i.e._, destructive before it\r\ncan hope to be constructive, it feigns blindness, hoping that by suasion\r\nrather than by force the principle of parliamentary government will\r\nsomehow be grafted on to the body politic and the emperors, being left\r\noutside the controversy, become content to accept a greatly modified\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nThis hope seems a vain one in the light of all history. Militarism and\r\nthe clans are by no means in the last ditch in Japan, and they will no\r\nmore surrender their power than would the Russian bureaucracy. The only\r\nargument which is convincing in such a case is the last one which is\r\never used; and the mere mention of it by so-called socialists is\r\nsufficient to cause summary arrest in Japan. Sheltering themselves\r\nbehind the Throne, and nominally deriving their latter-day dictatorship\r\nfrom the Imperial mandate, the military chiefs remain adamant, nothing\r\nhaving yet occurred to incline them to surrender any of their\r\nprivileges. By a process of adaptation to present-day conditions, a\r\nformula has now been discovered which it is hoped will serve many a long\r\nyear. By securing by extra-legal means the return of a \"majority\" in the\r\nHouse of Representatives the fiction of national support of the\r\nautocracy has been re-invigorated, and the doctrine laid down that what\r\nis good for every other advanced people in the world is bad for the\r\nJapanese, who must be content with what is granted them and never\r\nquestion the superior intelligence of a privileged caste. In the opinion\r\nof the writer, it is every whit as important for the peace of the world\r\nthat the people of Japan should govern themselves as it is for the\r\npeople of Germany to do so. The persistence of the type of military\r\ngovernment which we see to-day in Japan is harmful for all alike because\r\nit is as antiquated as Tsarism and a perpetual menace to a disarmed\r\nnation such as China. So long as that government remains, so long must\r\nJapan remain an international suspect and be denied equal rights in the\r\ncouncil-chambers of the Liberal Powers.\r\n\r\nIf the situation which arose on the 15th August, 1914, is to be\r\nthoroughly understood, it is necessary to pick up threads of\r\nChino-Japanese relations from a good many years back. First-hand\r\nfamiliarity with the actors and the scenes of at least three decades is\r\nessential to give the picture the completeness, the brilliancy of\r\ncolouring, and withal the suggestiveness inseparable from all true\r\nworks of art. For the Chino-Japanese question is primarily a work of art\r\nand not merely a piece of jejune diplomacy stretched across the years.\r\nAs the shuttle of Fate has been cast swiftly backwards and forwards, the\r\nthreads of these entwining relations have been woven into patterns\r\ninvolving the whole Far East, until to-day we have as it were a complete\r\nGobelin tapestry, magnificent with meaning, replete with action, and\r\nfull of scholastic interest.\r\n\r\nLet us follow some of the tracery. It has long been the habit to affirm\r\nthat the conflict between China and Japan had its origin in Korea, when\r\nKorea was a vassal state acknowledging the suzerainty of Peking; and\r\nthat the conflict merited ending there, since of the two protagonists\r\ncontending for empire Japan was left in undisputed mastery. This\r\nstatement, being incomplete, is dangerously false. Dating from that\r\nvital period of thirty years ago, when Yuan Shih-kai first went to Seoul\r\nas a general officer in the train of the Chinese Imperial Resident (on\r\nChina being forced to take action in protection of her interests, owing\r\nto the \"opening\" of Korea by the American Treaty of 1882) three\r\ncontestants, equally interested in the balance of land-power in Eastern\r\nAsia were constantly pitted against one another with Korea as their\r\ncommon battling-ground--Russia, China and Japan. The struggle, which\r\nended in the eclipse of the first two, merely shifted the venue from the\r\nKorean zone to the Manchurian zone; and from thence gradually extended\r\nit further and further afield until at last not only was Inner Mongolia\r\nand the vast belt of country fronting the Great Wall embraced within its\r\nscope, but the entire aspect of China itself was changed. For these\r\nimportant facts have to be noted. Until the Russian war of 1904-05 had\r\ndemonstrated the utter valuelessness of Tsarism as an international\r\nmilitary factor, Japan had been almost willing to resign herself to a\r\nsubordinate rôle in the Far East. Having eaten bitter bread as the\r\nresult of her premature attempt in 1895 (after the Korean war) to become\r\na continental power--an attempt which had resulted in the forced\r\nretrocession of the Liaotung Peninsula--she had been placed on her good\r\nbehaviour, an attitude which was admirably reflected in 1900 when her\r\nPeking Expeditionary Force proved itself so well-behaved and so gallant\r\nas to arouse the world's admiration. But the war with Russia and the\r\ncollapse of the Tsar's Manchurian adventure not only drew her back into\r\nterritory that she never hoped to see again, but placed her in\r\npossession of a ready-made railway system which carried her almost up to\r\nthe Sungari river and surrendered to her military control vast\r\ngrasslands stretching to the Khingan mountains. This Westernly march so\r\ngreatly enlarged the Japanese political horizon, and so entirely changed\r\nthe Japanese viewpoint, that the statesmen of Tokio in their excitement\r\nthrew off their ancient spectacles and found to their astonishment that\r\ntheir eyes were every whit as good as European eyes. Now seeing the\r\nworld as others had long seen it, they understood that just as with the\r\nindividuals so with nations the struggle for existence can most easily\r\nbe conducted by adopting that war-principle of Clausewitz--the restless\r\noffensive, and not by writing meaningless dispatches. Prior to the\r\nRussian war they had written to Russia a magnificent series of documents\r\nin which they had pleaded with sincerity for an equitable\r\nsettlement,--only to find that all was in vain. Forced to battle, they\r\nhad found in combat not only success but a new principle.\r\n\r\nThe discovery necessitated a new policy. During the eighties, and in a\r\nlesser degree in the nineties, Japan had apart from everything else been\r\ncontent to act in a modest and retiring way, because she wished at all\r\ncosts to avoid testing too severely her immature strength. But owing to\r\nthe successive collapses of her rivals, she now found herself not only\r\nforced to attack as the safest course of action, but driven to the view\r\nthat the Power that exerts the maximum pressure constantly and\r\nunremittedly is inevitably the most successful. This conclusion had\r\ngreat importance. For just as the first article of faith for England in\r\nAsia has been the doctrine that no Power can be permitted to seize\r\nstrategic harbours which menace her sea-communications, so did it now\r\nbecome equally true of Japan that her dominant policy became not an\r\nEastern Monroe doctrine, as shallow men have supposed, but simply the\r\nDoctrine of Maximum Pressure. To press with all her strength on China\r\nwas henceforth considered vital by every Japanese; and it is in this\r\nspirit that every diplomatic pattern has been woven since the die was\r\ncast in 1905. Until this signal fact has been grasped no useful analysis\r\ncan be made of the evolution of present conditions. Standing behind\r\nthis policy, and constantly reinforcing it, are the serried ranks of\r\nthe new democracy which education and the great increase in material\r\nprosperity have been so rapidly creating. The soaring ambition which\r\nsprings from the sea lends to the attacks developed by such a people the\r\naspect of piracies; and it is but natural. In such circumstances that\r\nfor Chinese Japan should not only have the aspect of a sea-monster but\r\nthat their country should appear as hapless Andromeda bound to a rock,\r\nalways awaiting a Perseus who never comes....\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1911 had been entirely unexpected in Japan. Whilst\r\nlarge outbreaks had been certainly counted on since the Chinese\r\nRevolutionary party had for years used Japan as an asylum and a base of\r\noperations, never had it been anticipated that the fall of an ancient\r\nDynasty could be so easily encompassed. Consequently, the abdication of\r\nthe Manchus as the result of intrigues rather than of warfare was looked\r\nupon as little short of a catastrophe because it hopelessly complicated\r\nthe outlook, broke the pattern which had been so carefully woven for so\r\nmany years, and interjected harsh elements which could not be assigned\r\nan orderly place. Not only was a well-articulated State-system suddenly\r\nconsigned to the flames, but the ruin threatened to be so general that\r\nthe balance of power throughout the Far East would be twisted out of\r\nshape. Japanese statesmen had desired a weak China, a China which would\r\nultimately turn to them for assistance because they were a kindred race,\r\nbut not a China that looked to the French Revolution for its\r\ninspiration. To a people as slow to adjust themselves to violent\r\nsurprises as are the Japanese, there was an air of desperation about the\r\nwhole business which greatly alarmed them, and made them determined at\r\nthe earliest possible moment to throw every ounce of their weight in the\r\ndirection which would best serve them by bringing matters back to their\r\noriginal starting-point. For this reason they were not only prepared in\r\ntheory in 1911 to lend armed assistance to the Manchus but would have\r\nspeedily done so had not England strongly dissented from such a course\r\nof action when she was privately sounded about the matter. Even to-day,\r\nwhen a temporary adjustment of Japanese policy has been successfully\r\narranged, it is of the highest importance for political students to\r\nremember that the dynastic influences in Tokio have never departed from\r\nthe view that the legitimate sovereignty of China remains vested in the\r\nManchu House and that everything that has taken place since 1911 is\r\nirregular and unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, however, two dissimilar circumstances demanded\r\ncaution: first, the enthusiasm which the Japanese democracy, fed by a\r\nhighly excited press, exhibited towards the Young China which had been\r\nso largely grounded in the Tokio schools and which had carried out the\r\nRevolution: secondly--and far more important--the deep, abiding and\r\nineradicable animosity which Japanese of all classes felt for the man\r\nwho had come out of the contest head and shoulders above everybody\r\nelse--Yuan Shih-kai. These two remarkable features ended by completely\r\nthrusting into the background during the period 1911-1914 every other\r\nelement in Japanese statesmanship; and of the two the second must be\r\ncounted the decisive one. Dating back to Korea, when Yuan Shih-kai's\r\nextraordinary diplomatic talents constantly allowed him to worst his\r\nJapanese rivals and to make Chinese counsels supreme at the Korean Court\r\nup to the very moment when the first shots of the war of 1894 were\r\nfired, this ancient dislike, which amounted to a consuming hatred, had\r\nbecome a fixed idea. Restrained by the world's opinion during the period\r\nprior to the outbreak of the world-war as well as by the necessity of\r\nacting financially in concert with the other Powers, it was not until\r\nAugust, 1914, that the longed-for opportunity came and that Japan\r\nprepared to act in a most remarkable way.\r\n\r\nThe campaign against Kiaochow was unpopular from the outset among the\r\nJapanese public because it was felt that they were not legitimately\r\ncalled upon to interest themselves in such a remote question as the\r\nbalance of power among European nations, which was what British warfare\r\nagainst Germany seemed to them to be. Though some ill-will was felt\r\nagainst Germany for the part played by her in the intervention of 1895,\r\nit must not be forgotten that just as the Japanese navy is the child of\r\nthe British navy, so is the Japanese army the child of the German\r\narmy--and that Japanese army chiefs largely control Japan. These men\r\nwere averse from \"spoiling their army\" in a contest which did not\r\ninterest them. There was also the feeling abroad that England by\r\ncalling upon her Ally to carry out the essential provisions of her\r\nAlliance had shown that she had the better part of a bargain, and that\r\nshe was exploiting an old advantage in a way which could not fail to\r\nreact adversely on Japan's future world's relationships. Furthermore, it\r\nis necessary to underline the fact that official Japan was displeased by\r\nthe tacit support an uninterested British Foreign Office had\r\nconsistently given to the Yuan Shih-kai régime. That the Chinese\r\nexperiment was looked upon in England more with amusement than with\r\nconcern irritated the Japanese--more particularly as the British Foreign\r\nOffice was issuing in the form of White Papers documents covering Yuan\r\nShih-kai's public declarations as if they were contributions to\r\ncontemporary history. Thus in the preceding year (1913) under the\r\nnomenclature of \"affairs in China\" the text of a _démenti_ regarding the\r\nPresident of China's Imperial aspirations had been published,--a\r\ndocument which Japanese had classified as a studied lie, and as an act\r\nof presumption because its working showed that its author intended to\r\nkeep his back turned on Japan. The Dictator had declared:--\r\n\r\n    ... From my student days, I, Yuan Shih-kai, have admired the\r\n    example of the Emperors Yao and Shun, who treated the empire as a\r\n    public trust, and considered that the record of a dynasty in history\r\n    for good or ill is inseparably bound up with the public spirit or\r\n    self-seeking by which it has been animated. On attaining middle age\r\n    I grew more familiar with foreign affairs, was struck by the\r\n    admirable republican system in France and America, and felt that\r\n    they were a true embodiment of the democratic precepts of the\r\n    ancients. When last year the patriotic crusade started in Wuchang\r\n    its echoes went forth into all the provinces, with the result that\r\n    this ancient nation with its 2,000 years of despotism adopted with\r\n    one bound the republican system of government.\r\n\r\n    It was my good fortune to see this glorious day at my life's late\r\n    eve; I cherished the hope that I might dwell in the seclusion of my\r\n    own home and participate in the blessings of an age of peace.\r\n\r\n    But once again my fellow-countrymen honoured me with the pressing\r\n    request that I should again assume a heavy burden, and on the day on\r\n    which the Republic was proclaimed I announced to the whole nation\r\n    that never again should a monarchy be permitted in China. At my\r\n    inauguration I again took this solemn oath in the sight of heaven\r\n    above and earth beneath. Yet of late ignorant persons in the\r\n    provinces have fabricated wild rumours to delude men's minds, and\r\n    have adduced the career of the First Napoleon on which to base their\r\n    erroneous speculations. It is best not to inquire as to their\r\n    motives; in some cases misconception may be the cause, in others\r\n    deliberate malice.\r\n\r\n    The Republic has now been proclaimed for six months; so far there\r\n    is no prospect of recognition from the Powers, while order is far\r\n    from being restored in the provinces. Our fate hangs upon a hair;\r\n    the slightest negligence may forfeit all. I, who bear this arduous\r\n    responsibility, feel it my bounden duty to stand at the helm in the\r\n    hope of successfully breasting the wild waves.\r\n\r\n    But while those in office are striving with all their might to\r\n    effect a satisfactory solution, spectators seem to find a difficulty\r\n    in maintaining a generous forbearance. They forget that I, who have\r\n    received this charge from my countrymen, cannot possibly look\r\n    dispassionately on when the fate of the nation is in the balance. If\r\n    I were aware that the task was impossible and played a part of easy\r\n    acquiescence, so that the future of the Republic might become\r\n    irreparable, others might not reproach me, but my own conscience\r\n    would never leave me alone.\r\n\r\n    My thoughts are manifest in the sight of high heaven. But at this\r\n    season of construction and dire crisis how shall these mutual\r\n    suspicions find a place? Once more I issue this announcement; if\r\n    you, my fellow countrymen, do indeed place the safety of China\r\n    before all other considerations, it behooves you to be large-minded.\r\n    Beware of lightly heeding the plausible voice of calumny, and of\r\n    thus furnishing a medium for fostering anarchy. If evilly disposed\r\n    persons, who are bent on destruction, seize the excuse for sowing\r\n    dissension to the jeopardy of the situation, I, Yuan Shih-kai, shall\r\n    follow the behest of my fellow-countrymen in placing such men beyond\r\n    the pale of humanity.\r\n\r\n    A vital issue is involved. It is my duty to lay before you my\r\n    inmost thought, so that suspicion may be dissipated. Those who know\r\n    have the right to impose their censure. It is for public opinion to\r\n    take due notice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Silk-reeling done in the open under the Walls of Peking.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern Peking: A Run on a Bank.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Re-opening of Parliament on August 1st, 1916, after\r\nthree years of dictatorial rule.]\r\n\r\nMoreover Yuan Shih-kai had also shown in his selection and use of\r\nforeign Advisers, that he was determined to proceed in such a manner as\r\nto advertise his suspicion and enmity of Japan. After the Coup d'état of\r\nthe 4th November, 1913, and the scattering of Parliament, it was an\r\nAmerican Adviser who was set to work on the new \"Constitution\"; and\r\nalthough a Japanese, Dr. Ariga, who was in receipt of a princely salary,\r\naided and abetted this work, his endorsement of the dictatorial rule was\r\nlooked upon as traitorous by the bulk of his countrymen. Similarly, it\r\nwas perfectly well-known that Yuan Shih-kai was spending large sums of\r\nmoney in Tokio in bribing certain organs of the Japanese Press and in\r\nattempting to win adherents among Japanese members of Parliament.\r\nRemarkable stories are current which compromise very highly-placed\r\nJapanese but which the writer hesitates to set down in black and white\r\nas documentary proof is not available. In any case, be this as it may,\r\nit was felt in Tokio that the time had arrived to give a proper\r\ndefinition to the relations between the two states,--the more so as Yuan\r\nShih-kai, by publicly proclaiming a small war-zone in Shantung within\r\nthe limits of which the Japanese were alone permitted to wage war\r\nagainst the Germans, had shown himself indifferent to the majesty of\r\nJapan. The Japanese having captured Kiaochow by assault before the end\r\nof 1914 decided to accept the view that a _de facto_ Dictatorship\r\nexisted in China. Therefore on the 18th of January, 1915, the Japanese\r\nMinister, Dr. Hioki, personally served on Yuan Shih-kai the now famous\r\nTwenty-one Demands, a list designed to satisfy every present and future\r\nneed of Japanese policy and to reduce China to a state of vassalage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTY-ONE DEMANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the press of the world gave a certain prominence at the time to\r\nthe astounding _démarche_ with which we now have to deal, there was such\r\npersistent mystery about the matter and so many official _démentis_\r\naccompanied every publication of the facts that even to this day the\r\nnature of the assault which Japan delivered on China is not adequately\r\nrealized, nor is the narrow escape assigned its proper place in\r\nestimates of the future. Briefly, had there not been publication of the\r\nfacts and had not British diplomacy been aroused to action there is\r\nlittle doubt that Japan would have forced matters so far that Chinese\r\nindependence would now be virtually a thing of the past. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, China in her hour of need found many who were willing to\r\nsuccour her; with the result that although she lost something in these\r\nnegotiations, Japan nevertheless failed in a very signal fashion to\r\nattain her main objective. The Pyrrhic victory which she won with her\r\neleventh hour ultimatum will indeed in the end cost her more than would\r\nhave a complete failure, for Chinese suspicion and hostility are now so\r\ndeep-seated that nothing will ever completely eradicate them. It is\r\ntherefore only proper that an accurate record should be here\r\nincorporated of a chapter of history which has much international\r\nimportance; and if we invite close attention to the mass of documents\r\nthat follow it is because we hold that an adequate comprehension of them\r\nis essential to securing the future peace of the Far East. Let us first\r\ngive the official text of the original Demands:\r\n\r\n    JAPAN'S ORIGINAL TWENTY-ONE DEMANDS\r\n\r\n    Translations of Documents Handed to the President, Yuan Shih-kai, by\r\n    Mr. Hioki, the Japanese Minister, on January 18th, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUP I\r\n\r\n    The Japanese Government and the Chinese Government being desirous of\r\n    maintaining the general peace in Eastern Asia and further\r\n    strengthening the friendly relations and good neighbourhood existing\r\n    between the two nations agree to the following articles:--\r\n\r\n    Article 1. The Chinese Government engages to give full assent to all\r\n    matters upon which the Japanese Government may hereafter agree with\r\n    the German Government relating to the disposition of all rights,\r\n    interests and concessions, which Germany, by virtue of treaties or\r\n    otherwise, possesses in relation to the Province of Shantung.\r\n\r\n    Article 2. The Chinese Government engages that within the Province\r\n    of Shantung and along its coast no territory or island will be ceded\r\n    or leased to a third Power under any pretext.\r\n\r\n    Article 3. The Chinese Government consents to Japan's building a\r\n    railway from Chefoo or Lungkow to join the Kiaochou-Tsinanfu\r\n    railway.\r\n\r\n    Article 4. The Chinese Government engages, in the interest of trade\r\n    and for the residence of foreigners, to open by herself as soon as\r\n    possible certain important cities and towns in the Province of\r\n    Shantung as Commercial Ports. What places shall be opened are to be\r\n    jointly decided upon in a separate agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUP II\r\n\r\n    The Japanese Government and the Chinese Government, since the\r\n    Chinese Government has always acknowledged the special position\r\n    enjoyed by Japan in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia,\r\n    agree to the following articles:--\r\n\r\n    Article 1. The two Contracting Parties mutually agree that the term\r\n    of lease of Port Arthur and Dalny and the term of lease of the South\r\n    Manchurian Railway and the Antung-Mukden Railway shall be extended\r\n    to the period of 99 years.\r\n\r\n    Article 2. Japanese subjects in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner\r\n    Mongolia shall have the right to lease or own land required either\r\n    for erecting suitable buildings for trade and manufacture or for\r\n    farming.\r\n\r\n    Article 3. Japanese subjects shall be free to reside and travel in\r\n    South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia and to engage in business\r\n    and in manufacture of any kind whatsoever.\r\n\r\n    Article 4. The Chinese Government agrees to grant to Japanese\r\n    subjects the right of opening the mines in South Manchuria and\r\n    Eastern Inner Mongolia. As regards what mines are to be opened, they\r\n    shall be decided upon jointly.\r\n\r\n    Article 5. The Chinese Government agrees that in respect of the\r\n    (two) cases mentioned herein below the Japanese Government's consent\r\n    shall be first obtained before action is taken:--\r\n\r\n    (a) Whenever permission is granted to the subject of a third Power\r\n    to build a railway or to make a loan with a third Power for the\r\n    purpose of building a railway in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner\r\n    Mongolia.\r\n\r\n    (b) Whenever a loan is to be made with a third Power pledging the\r\n    local taxes of South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia as\r\n    security.\r\n\r\n    Article 6. The Chinese Government agrees that if the Chinese\r\n    Government employs political, financial or military advisers or\r\n    instructors in South Manchuria or Eastern Inner Mongolia, the\r\n    Japanese Government shall first be consulted.\r\n\r\n    Article 7. The Chinese Government agrees that the control and\r\n    management of the Kirin-Changchun Railway shall be handed over to\r\n    the Japanese Government for a term of 99 years dating from the\r\n    signing of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUP III\r\n\r\n    The Japanese Government and the Chinese Government, seeing that\r\n    Japanese financiers and the Hanyehping Co. have close relations with\r\n    each other at present and desiring that the common interests of the\r\n    two nations shall be advanced, agree to the following articles:--\r\n\r\n    Article 1. The two Contracting Parties mutually agree that when the\r\n    opportune moment arrives the Hanyehping Company shall be made a\r\n    joint concern of the two nations and they further agree that without\r\n    the previous consent of Japan, China shall not by her own act\r\n    dispose of the rights and property of whatsoever nature of the said\r\n    Company nor cause the said Company to dispose freely of the same.\r\n\r\n    Article 2. The Chinese Government agrees that all mines in the\r\n    neighbourhood of those owned by the Hanyehping Company shall not be\r\n    permitted, without the consent of the said Company, to be worked by\r\n    other persons outside of the said Company; and further agrees that\r\n    if it is desired to carry out any undertaking which, it is\r\n    apprehended, may directly or indirectly affect the interests of the\r\n    said Company, the consent of the said Company shall first be\r\n    obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUP IV\r\n\r\n    The Japanese Government and the Chinese Government with the object\r\n    of effectively preserving the territorial integrity of China agree\r\n    to the following special articles:--\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government engages not to cede or lease to a third Power\r\n    any harbour or bay or island along the coast of China.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUP V\r\n\r\n    Article 1. The Chinese Central Government shall employ influential\r\n    Japanese advisers in political, financial and military affairs.\r\n\r\n    Article 2. Japanese hospitals, churches and schools in the interior\r\n    of China shall be granted the right of owning land.\r\n\r\n    Article 3. Inasmuch as the Japanese Government and the Chinese\r\n    Government have had many cases of dispute between Japanese and\r\n    Chinese police to settle cases which caused no little\r\n    misunderstanding, it is for this reason necessary that the police\r\n    departments of important places (in China) shall be jointly\r\n    administered by Japanese and Chinese or that the police departments\r\n    of these places shall employ numerous Japanese, so that they may at\r\n    the same time help to plan for the improvement of the Chinese Police\r\n    Service.\r\n\r\n    Article 4. China shall purchase from Japan a fixed amount of\r\n    munitions of war (say 50% or more) of what is needed by the Chinese\r\n    Government or that there shall be established in China a\r\n    Sino-Japanese jointly worked arsenal. Japanese technical experts are\r\n    to be employed and Japanese material to be purchased.\r\n\r\n    Article 5. China agrees to grant to Japan the right of constructing\r\n    a railway connecting Wuchang with Kiukiang and Nanchang, another\r\n    line between Nanchang and Hanchow, and another between Nanchang and\r\n    Chaochou.\r\n\r\n    Article 6. If China needs foreign capital to work mines, build\r\n    railways and construct harbour-works (including dock-yards) in the\r\n    Provinces of Fukien, Japan shall be first consulted.\r\n\r\n    Article 7. China agrees that Japanese subjects shall have the right\r\n    of missionary propaganda in China.[13]\r\n\r\nThe five groups into which the Japanese divided their demands possess a\r\nremarkable interest not because of their sequence, or the style of their\r\nphraseology, but because every word reveals a peculiar and very\r\nilluminating chemistry of the soul. To study the original Chinese text\r\nis to pass as it were into the secret recesses of the Japanese brain,\r\nand to find in that darkened chamber a whole world of things which\r\nadvertise ambitions mixed with limitations, hesitations overwhelmed by\r\naudacities, greatnesses succumbing to littlenesses, and vanities having\r\nthe appearance of velleities. Given an intimate knowledge of Far Eastern\r\npolitics and Far Eastern languages, only a few minutes are required to\r\nre-write the demands in the sequence in which they were originally\r\nconceived as well as to trace the natural history of their genesis.\r\nUnfortunately a great deal is lost in their official translation, and\r\nthe menace revealed in the Chinese original partly cloaked: for by\r\ntransferring Eastern thoughts into Western moulds, things that are like\r\nnails in the hands of soft sensitive Oriental beings are made to appear\r\nto the steel-clad West as cold-blooded, evolutionary necessities which\r\nmay be repellent but which are never cruel. The more the matter is\r\nstudied the more convinced must the political student be that in this\r\naffair of the 18th January we have an international _coup_ destined to\r\nbecome classic in the new text-books of political science. All the way\r\nthrough the twenty-one articles it is easy to see the desire for action,\r\nthe love of accomplished facts, struggling with the necessity to observe\r\nthe conventions of a stereotyped diplomacy and often overwhelming those\r\nconventions. As the thoughts thicken and the plot develops, the effort\r\nto mask the real intention lying behind every word plainly breaks down,\r\nand a growing exultation rings louder and louder as if the coveted\r\nChinese prize were already firmly grasped. One sees as it were the\r\nJapanese nation, released from bondage imposed by the Treaties which\r\nhave been binding on all nations since 1860, swarming madly through the\r\nbreached walls of ancient Cathay and disputing hotly the spoils of\r\nage-old domains.\r\n\r\nGroup I, which deals with the fruits of victory in Shantung, has little\r\nto detain us since events which have just unrolled there have already\r\ntold the story of those demands. In Shantung we have a simple and\r\neasily-understood repeated performance of the history of 1905 and the\r\nsettlement of the Russo-Japanese War. Placed at the very head of the\r\nlist of demands, though its legitimate position should be after\r\nManchuria, obviously the purpose of Group I is conspicuously to call\r\nattention to the fact that Japan had been at war with Germany, and is\r\nstill at war with her. This flourish of trumpets, after the battle is\r\nover, however, scarcely serves to disguise that the fate of Shantung,\r\nfollowing so hard on the heels of the Russian débâcle in Manchuria, is\r\nthe great moral which Western peoples are called upon to note. Japan,\r\ndetermined as she has repeatedly announced to preserve the peace of the\r\nOrient by any means she deems necessary, has found the one and only\r\nformula that is satisfactory--that of methodically annexing everything\r\nworth fighting about.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. The insertion of a special preamble to Group II, which\r\ncovers not only South Manchuria but Eastern Inner Mongolia as well, is\r\nan ingenious piece of work since it shows that the hot mood of conquest\r\nsuitable for Shantung must be exchanged for a certain judicial\r\ndetachment. The preamble undoubtedly betrays the guiding hand of\r\nViscount Kato, the then astute Minister of Foreign Affairs, who\r\nsaturated in the great series of international undertakings made by\r\nJapan since the first Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1902, clearly believes\r\nthat the stately Elizabethan manner which still characterizes British\r\nofficial phrasing is an admirable method to be here employed. The\r\npreamble is quite English; it is so English that one is almost lulled\r\ninto believing that one's previous reasoning has been at fault and that\r\nJapan is only demanding what she is entitled to. Yet study Group II\r\nclosely and subtleties gradually emerge. By boldly and categorically\r\nplacing Eastern Inner Mongolia on precisely the same footing as Southern\r\nManchuria--though they have nothing in common--the assumption is made\r\nthat the collapse in 1908 of the great Anglo-American scheme to run a\r\nneutral railway up the flank of Southern Manchuria to Northern Manchuria\r\n(the once celebrated Chinchow-Aigun scheme), coupled with general\r\nagreement with Russia which was then arrived at, now impose upon China\r\nthe necessity of publicly resigning herself to a Japanese overlordship\r\nof that region. In other words, the preamble of Group II lays down that\r\nEastern Inner Mongolia has become part and parcel of the Manchurian\r\nQuestion because Japan has found a parallel for what she is doing in the\r\nacts of European Powers.\r\n\r\nThese things, however, need not detain us. Not that Manchuria or the\r\nadjoining Mongolian plain is not important; not that the threads of\r\ndestiny are not woven thickly there. For it is certain that the vast\r\nregion immediately beyond the Great Wall of China is the Flanders of the\r\nFar East--and that the next inevitable war which will destroy China or\r\nmake her something of a nation must be fought on that soil just as two\r\nother wars have been fought there during the past twenty years. But this\r\ndoes not belong to contemporary politics; it is possibly an affair of\r\nthe Chinese army of 1925 or 1935. Some day China will fight for\r\nManchuria if it is impossible to recover it in any other way,--nobody\r\nneed doubt that. For Manchuria is absolutely Chinese--people must\r\nremember. No matter how far the town-dwelling Japanese may invade the\r\ncountry during the next two or three decades, no matter what large\r\nalien garrisons may be planted there, the Chinese must and will remain\r\nthe dominant racial element, since their population which already\r\nnumbers twenty-five millions is growing at the rate of half a million a\r\nyear, and in a few decades will equal the population of a first-class\r\nEuropean Power.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach Group III we touch matters that are not only immediately\r\nvital but quite new in their type of audacity and which every one can\r\nto-day understand since they are politico-industrial. Group III, as it\r\nstands in the original text, is _simply the plan for the conquest of the\r\nmineral wealth of the Yangtsze Valley_ which mainly centres round Hankow\r\nbecause the vast alluvial plains of the lower reaches of this greatest\r\nof rivers were once the floor of the Yellow Sea, the upper provinces of\r\nHupeh, Hunan, Kiangsi being the region of prehistoric forests clothing\r\nthe coasts, which once looked down upon the slowly-receding waste of\r\nwaters, and which to-day contain all the coal and iron. Hitherto every\r\none has always believed that the Yangtsze Valley was _par excellence_\r\nthe British sphere in China; and every one has always thought that that\r\nbelief was enough. It is true that political students, going carefully\r\nover all published documents, have ended their search by declaring that\r\nthe matter certainly required further elucidation. To be precise, this\r\nso-called British sphere is not an _enclave_ at all in the proper sense;\r\nindeed it can only seem one to those who still believe that it is still\r\npossible to pre-empt provinces by ministerial declarations. The Japanese\r\nhave been the first to dare to say that the preconceived general belief\r\nwas stupid. They know, of course, that it was a British force which\r\ninvaded the Yangtsze Valley seventy-five years ago, and forced the\r\nsignature of the Treaty of Nanking which first opened China to the\r\nworld's trade; but they are by no means impressed with the rights which\r\nthat action has been held to confer, since the mineral resources of this\r\nregion are priceless in their eyes and must somehow be won.\r\n\r\nThe study of twenty years of history proves this assumption to be\r\ncorrect. Ever since 1895, Japan has been driving wedges into the\r\nYangtsze Valley of a peculiar kind to form the foundations for her\r\nsweeping claims of 1915. Thus after the war with China in 1894-95, she\r\nopened by her Treaty of Peace four ports in the Yangtsze Valley region,\r\nSoochow, Hangchow, Chungking and Shasi; that is, at the two extreme ends\r\nof the valley she established politico-commercial _points d'appui_ from\r\nwhich to direct her campaign. Whilst the proximity of Soochow and\r\nHangchow to the British stronghold of Shanghai made it difficult to\r\ncarry out any \"penetration\" work at the lower end of the river save in\r\nthe form of subsidized steam-shipping, the case was different in Hunan\r\nand Hupeh provinces. There she was unendingly busy, and in 1903 by a\r\nfresh treaty she formally opened to trade Changsha, the capital of the\r\nturbulent Hunan province. Changsha for years remained a secret centre\r\npossessing the greatest political importance for her, and serving as a\r\nfocus for most varied activities involving Hunan, Hupeh, and Kiangsi, as\r\nwell as a vast hinterland. The great Tayeh iron-mines, although entirely\r\nChinese-owned, were already being tapped to supply iron-ore for the\r\nJapanese Government Foundry at Wakamatsu on the island of Kiushiu. The\r\nrich coal mines of Pinghsiang, being conveniently near, supplied the\r\ngreat Chinese Government arsenal of Hanyang with fuel; and since Japan\r\nhad very little coal or iron of her own, she decided that it would be\r\nbest to embrace as soon as possible the whole area of interests in one\r\ncategorical demand--that is, to claim a dominant share in the Hanyang\r\narsenal, the Tayeh iron-mines and the Pinghsiang collieries.[14] By\r\nlending money to these enterprises, which were grouped together under\r\nthe name of Hanyehping, she had early established a claim on them which\r\nshe turned at the psychological moment into an international question.\r\n\r\nWe can pass quickly by Group IV which is of little importance, except to\r\nsay that in taking upon herself, without consultation with the senior\r\nally, the duty of asking from China a declaration concerning the future\r\nnon-leasing of harbours and islands, Japan has attempted to assume a\r\nprotectorship of Chinese territory which does not belong to her\r\nhistorically. It is well also to note that although Japan wished it to\r\nappear to the world that this action was dictated by her desire to\r\nprevent Germany from acquiring a fresh foothold in China after the war,\r\nin reality Group IV was drafted as a general warning to the nations, one\r\npoint being that she believed that the United States was contemplating\r\nthe reorganization of the Foochow Arsenal in Fuhkien province, and that\r\nas a corollary to that reorganization would be given the lease of an\r\nadjoining harbour such as Santuao.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, until we reach Group V that the real purpose of the\r\nJapanese demands becomes unalterably clear, for in this Group we have\r\nseven sketches of things designed to serve as the _coup de grâce_. Not\r\nonly is a new sphere--Fuhkien province--indicated; not only is the\r\nmid-Yangtsze, from the vicinity of Kiukiang, to serve as the terminus\r\nfor a system of Japanese railways, radiating from the great river to the\r\ncoasts of South China; but the gleaming knife of the Japanese surgeon is\r\nto aid the Japanese teacher in the great work of propaganda; the\r\nJapanese monk and the Japanese policeman are to be dispersed like\r\nskirmishers throughout the land; Japanese arsenals are to supply all the\r\nnecessary arms, or failing that a special Japanese arsenal is to be\r\nestablished; Japanese advisers are to give the necessary advice in\r\nfinance, in politics, in every department--foreshadowing a complete and\r\nall embracing political control. Never was a more sweeping programme of\r\nsupervision presented, and small wonder if Chinese when they learnt of\r\nthis climax exclaimed that the fate of Korea was to be their own.\r\n\r\nFor a number of weeks after the presentation of these demands everything\r\nremained clothed in impenetrable mystery, and despite every effort on\r\nthe part of diplomatists reliable details of what was occurring could\r\nnot be obtained. Gradually, however, the admission was forced that the\r\nsecrecy being preserved was due to the Japanese threat that publicity\r\nwould be met with the harshest reprisals; and presently the veil was\r\nentirely lifted by newspaper publication and foreign Ambassadors began\r\nmaking inquiries in Tokio. The nature and scope of the Twenty-one\r\nDemands could now be no longer hidden; and in response to the growing\r\nindignation which began to be voiced by the press and the pressure which\r\nBritish diplomacy brought to bear, Japan found it necessary to modify\r\nsome of the most important items. She had held twenty-four meetings at\r\nthe Chinese Foreign Office, and although the Chinese negotiators had\r\nbeen forced to give way in such matters as extending the \"leasing\"\r\nperiods of railways and territories in Manchuria and in admitting the\r\nJapanese right to succeed to all German interests and rights in Shantung\r\n(Group I and II), in the essential matters of the Hanyehping concessions\r\n(Group III) and the noxious demands of Group V China had stood\r\nabsolutely firm, declining even to discuss some of the items.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Japanese diplomacy was forced to restate and re-group the\r\nwhole corpus of the demands. On the 26th April, acting under direct\r\ninstructions from Tokio, the Japanese Minister to Peking presented a\r\nrevised list for renewed consideration, the demands being expanded to\r\ntwenty-four articles (in place of the original twenty-one largely\r\nbecause discussion had shown the necessity of breaking up into smaller\r\nunits some of the original articles). Most significant, however, is the\r\nfact that Group V (which in its original form was a more vicious assault\r\non Chinese sovereignty than the Austrian Ultimatum to Serbia of June,\r\n1914), was so remodelled as to convey a very different meaning, the\r\ngroup heading disappearing entirely and an innocent-looking exchange of\r\nnotes being asked for. It is necessary to recall that, when taxed with\r\nmaking Demands which were entirely in conflict with the spirit of the\r\nAnglo-Japanese Alliance, the Japanese Government through its ambassadors\r\nabroad had categorically denied that they had ever laid any such Demands\r\non the Chinese Government. It was claimed that there had never been\r\ntwenty-one Demands, as the Chinese alleged, but only fourteen, _the\r\nseven items of Group V being desiderata which it was in the interests of\r\nChina to endorse but which Japan had no intention of forcing upon her_.\r\nThe writer, being acquainted from first to last with everything that\r\ntook place in Peking from the 18th January to the filing of the Japanese\r\nultimatum of the 7th May, has no hesitation in stigmatizing this\r\nstatement as false. The whole aim and object of these negotiations was\r\nto force through Group V. Japan would have gladly postponed _sine die_\r\nthe discussion of all the other Groups had China assented to provisions\r\nwhich would have made her independence a thing of the past. Every\r\nChinese knew that, in the main, Group V was simply a repetition of the\r\nmeasures undertaken in Korea after the Russo-Japanese war of 1905 as a\r\nforerunner to annexation; and although obviously in the case of China no\r\nsuch rapid surgery could be practised, the endorsement of these measures\r\nwould have meant a virtual Japanese Protectorate. Even a cursory study\r\nof the text that follows will confirm in every particular these capital\r\ncontentions:\r\n\r\n    JAPAN'S REVISED DEMANDS\r\n\r\n    Japan's Revised Demands on China, twenty-four in all, presented\r\n    April 26, 1915.\r\n\r\n    _Note on original text_:\r\n\r\n    [The revised list of articles is a Chinese translation of the\r\n    Japanese text. It is hereby declared that when a final decision is\r\n    reached, there shall be a revision of the wording of the text.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUP I\r\n\r\n    The Japanese Government and the Chinese Government, being desirous\r\n    of maintaining the general peace in Eastern Asia and further\r\n    strengthening the friendly relations and good neighbourhood existing\r\n    between the two nations, agree to the following articles:--\r\n\r\n    Article 1. The Chinese Government engages to give full assent to all\r\n    matters upon which the Japanese Government may hereafter agree with\r\n    the German Government, relating to the disposition of all rights,\r\n    interests and concessions, which Germany, by virtue of treaties or\r\n    otherwise, possesses in relation to the Province of Shantung.\r\n\r\n    Article 2. (Changed into an exchange of notes.)\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government declares that within the Province of Shantung\r\n    and along its coast no territory or island will be ceded or leased\r\n    to any Power under any pretext.\r\n\r\n    Article 3. The Chinese Government consents that as regards the\r\n    railway to be built by China herself from Chefoo or Lungkow to\r\n    connect with the Kiaochow-Tsinanfu Railway, if Germany is willing to\r\n    abandon the privilege of financing the Chefoo-Weihsien line, China\r\n    will approach Japanese capitalists to negotiate for a loan.\r\n\r\n    Article 4. The Chinese Government engages, in the interest of trade\r\n    and for the residence of foreigners, to open by China herself as\r\n    soon as possible certain suitable places in the Province of Shantung\r\n    as Commercial Ports.\r\n\r\n    (Supplementary Exchange of Notes)\r\n\r\n    The places which ought to be opened are to be chosen and the\r\n    regulations are to be drafted, by the Chinese Government, but the\r\n    Japanese Minister must be consulted before making a decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUP II\r\n\r\n    The Japanese Government and the Chinese Government, with a view to\r\n    developing their economic relations in South Manchuria and Eastern\r\n    Inner Mongolia, agree to the following articles:--\r\n\r\n    Article 1. The two contracting Powers mutually agree that the term\r\n    of lease of Port Arthur and Dalny and the terms of the South\r\n    Manchuria Railway and the Antung-Mukden Railway shall be extended to\r\n    99 years.\r\n\r\n    (Supplementary Exchange of Notes)\r\n\r\n    The term of lease of Port Arthur and Dalny shall expire in the 86th\r\n    year of the Republic or 1997. The date for restoring the South\r\n    Manchurian Railway to China shall fall due in the 91st year of the\r\n    Republic or 2002. Article 12 in the original South Manchurian\r\n    Railway Agreement stating that it may be redeemed by China after 36\r\n    years after the traffic is opened is hereby cancelled. The term of\r\n    the Antung-Mukden Railway shall expire in the 96th year of the\r\n    Republic or 2007.\r\n\r\n    Article 2. Japanese subjects in South Manchuria may lease or\r\n    purchase the necessary land for erecting suitable buildings for\r\n    trade and manufacture or for prosecuting agricultural enterprises.\r\n\r\n    Article 3. Japanese subjects shall be free to reside and travel in\r\n    South Manchuria and to engage in business and manufacture of any\r\n    kind whatsoever.\r\n\r\n    Article 3a. The Japanese subjects referred to in the preceding two\r\n    articles, besides being required to register with the local\r\n    authorities passports which they must procure under the existing\r\n    regulations, shall also submit to police laws and ordinances and tax\r\n    regulations, which are approved by the Japanese consul. Civil and\r\n    criminal cases in which the defendants are Japanese shall be tried\r\n    and adjudicated by the Japanese consul; those in which the\r\n    defendants are Chinese shall be tried and adjudicated by Chinese\r\n    Authorities. In either case an officer can be deputed to the court\r\n    to attend the proceedings. But mixed civil cases between Chinese and\r\n    Japanese relating to land shall be tried and adjudicated by\r\n    delegates of both nations conjointly in accordance with Chinese law\r\n    and local usage. When the judicial system in the said region is\r\n    completely reformed, all civil and criminal cases concerning\r\n    Japanese subjects shall be tried entirely by Chinese law courts.\r\n\r\n    Article 4. (Changed to an exchange of notes.)\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government agrees that Japanese subjects shall be\r\n    permitted forthwith to investigate, select, and then prospect for\r\n    and open mines at the following places in South Manchuria, apart\r\n    from those mining areas in which mines are being prospected for or\r\n    worked; until the Mining Ordinance is definitely settled methods at\r\n    present in force shall be followed.\r\n\r\n    PROVINCE OF FENG-TIEN\r\n\r\n    |Locality               |District                   |Mineral\r\n    |                       |                           |\r\n    |Niu Hsin T'ai          |Pen-hsi                    |Coal\r\n    |Tien Shih Fu Kou       |Pen-hsi                    |Coal\r\n    |Sha Sung Kang          |Hai-lung                   |Coal\r\n    |T'ieh Ch'ang           |Tung-hua                   |Coal\r\n    |Nuan Ti Tang           |Chin                       |Coal\r\n    |An Shan Chan region    |From Liaoyang to Pen-hsi   |Iron\r\n\r\n    PROVINCE OF KIRIN\r\n\r\n    (Southern portion)\r\n\r\n    |Sha Sung Kang          |Ho-lung                    |Coal and Iron\r\n    |Kang Yao               |Chi-lin (Kirin)            |Coal\r\n    |Chia P'i Kou           |Hua-tien                   |Gold\r\n\r\n    Article 5. (Changed to an exchange of notes.)\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government declares that China will hereafter provide\r\n    funds for building railways in South Manchuria; if foreign capital\r\n    is required, the Chinese Government agrees to negotiate for the loan\r\n    with Japanese capitalists first.\r\n\r\n    Article 5a. (Changed to an exchange of notes.)\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government agrees that hereafter, when a foreign loan is\r\n    to be made on the security of the taxes of South Manchuria (not\r\n    including customs and salt revenue on the security of which loans\r\n    have already been made by the Central Government), it will negotiate\r\n    for the loan with Japanese capitalists first.\r\n\r\n    Article 6. (Changed to an exchange of notes.)\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government declares that hereafter if foreign advisers\r\n    or instructors on political, financial, military or police matters,\r\n    are to be employed in South Manchuria, Japanese will be employed\r\n    first.\r\n\r\n    Article 7. The Chinese Government agrees speedily to make a\r\n    fundamental revision of the Kirin-Changchun Railway Loan Agreement,\r\n    taking as a standard the provisions in railroad loan agreements made\r\n    heretofore between China and foreign financiers. If, in future, more\r\n    advantageous terms than those in existing railway loan agreements\r\n    are granted to foreign financiers, in connection with railway loans,\r\n    the above agreement shall again be revised in accordance with\r\n    Japan's wishes.\r\n\r\n    All existing treaties between China and Japan relating to Manchuria\r\n    shall, except where otherwise provided for by this Convention,\r\n    remain in force.\r\n\r\n    1. The Chinese Government agrees that hereafter when a foreign loan\r\n    is to be made on the security of the taxes of Eastern Inner\r\n    Mongolia, China must negotiate with the Japanese Government first.\r\n\r\n    2. The Chinese Government agrees that China will herself provide\r\n    funds for building the railways in Eastern Inner Mongolia; if\r\n    foreign capital is required, she must negotiate with the Japanese\r\n    Government first.\r\n\r\n    3. The Chinese Government agrees, in the interest of trade and for\r\n    the residence of foreigners, to open by China herself, as soon as\r\n    possible, certain suitable places in Eastern Inner Mongolia as\r\n    Commercial Ports. The places which ought to be opened are to be\r\n    chosen, and the regulations are to be drafted, by the Chinese\r\n    Government, but the Japanese Minister must be consulted before\r\n    making a decision.\r\n\r\n    4. In the event of Japanese and Chinese desiring jointly to\r\n    undertake agricultural enterprises and industries incidental\r\n    thereto, the Chinese Government shall give its permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUP III\r\n\r\n    The relations between Japan and the Hanyehping Company being very\r\n    intimate, if those interested in the said Company come to an\r\n    agreement with the Japanese capitalists for co-operation, the\r\n    Chinese Government shall forthwith give its consent thereto. The\r\n    Chinese Government further agrees that, without the consent of the\r\n    Japanese capitalists, China will not convert the Company into a\r\n    state enterprise, nor confiscate it, nor cause it to borrow and use\r\n    foreign capital other than Japanese.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUP IV\r\n\r\n    China to give a pronouncement by herself in accordance with the\r\n    following principle:--\r\n\r\n    No bay, harbour, or island along the coast of China may be ceded or\r\n    leased to any Power.\r\n\r\n    Notes to be Exchanged\r\n\r\n    A\r\n\r\n    As regards the right of financing a railway from Wuchang to connect\r\n    with the Kiu-kiang-Nanchang line, the Nanchang-Hangchow railway, and\r\n    the Nanchang-Chaochow railway, if it is clearly ascertained that\r\n    other Powers have no objection, China shall grant the said right to\r\n    Japan.\r\n\r\n    B\r\n\r\n    As regards the rights of financing a railway from Wuchang to connect\r\n    with the Kiu-kiang-Nanchang railway, a railway from Nanchang to\r\n    Hangchow and another from Nanchang to Chaochow, the Chinese\r\n    Government shall not grant the said right to any foreign Power\r\n    before Japan comes to an understanding with the other Power which is\r\n    heretofore interested therein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Original Constitutional Drafting Committee of 1913,\r\nphotographed on the steps of the Temple of Heaven, where the Draft was\r\ncompleted.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Presidential Review of Troops in the Southern Hungtung\r\nPark outside Peking: Arrival of the President.]\r\n\r\n    NOTES TO BE EXCHANGED\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government agrees that no nation whatever is to be\r\n    permitted to construct, on the coast of Fukien Province, a dockyard,\r\n    a coaling station for military use, or a naval base; nor to be\r\n    authorized to set up any other military establishment. The Chinese\r\n    Government further agrees not to use foreign capital for setting up\r\n    the above mentioned construction or establishment.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Lu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1. The Chinese Government, shall, whenever, in future, it considers\r\n    this step necessary, engage numerous Japanese advisers.\r\n\r\n    2. Whenever, in future, Japanese subjects desire to lease or\r\n    purchase land in the interior of China for establishing schools or\r\n    hospitals, the Chinese Government shall forthwith give its consent\r\n    thereto.\r\n\r\n    3. When a suitable opportunity arises in future, the Chinese\r\n    Government will send military officers to Japan to negotiate with\r\n    Japanese military authorities the matter of purchasing arms or that\r\n    of establishing a joint arsenal.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hioki, the Japanese Minister, stated as follows:--\r\n\r\n    As relates to the question of the right of missionary propaganda the\r\n    same shall be taken up again for negotiation in future.\r\n\r\nAn ominous silence followed the delivery of this document. The Chinese\r\nForeign Office had already exhausted itself in a discussion which had\r\nlasted three months, and pursuant to instructions from the Presidential\r\nPalace prepared an exhaustive Memorandum on the subject. It was\r\nunderstood by now that all the Foreign Offices in the world were\r\ninteresting themselves very particularly in the matter; and that all\r\nwere agreed that the situation which had so strangely developed was very\r\nserious. On the 1st May, proceeding by appointment to the Waichiaopu\r\n(Foreign Office) the Japanese Minister had read to him the following\r\nMemorandum which it is very necessary to grasp as it shows how\r\nsolicitous China had become of terminating the business before there was\r\nan open international break. It will also be seen that this Memorandum\r\nwas obviously composed for purpose of public record, the fifth group\r\nbeing dealt with in such a way as to fix upon Japan the guilt of having\r\nconcealed from her British Ally matters which conflicted vitally with\r\nthe aims and objects of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance Treaty.\r\n\r\n    MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n    Read by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to Mr. Hioki, the Japanese\r\n    Minister, at a Conference held at Wai Chiao Pu, May 1, 1915.\r\n\r\n    The list of demands which the Japanese Government first presented to\r\n    the Chinese Government consists of five groups, the first relating\r\n    to Shantung, the second relating to South Manchuria and Eastern\r\n    Inner Mongolia, the third relating to Hanyehping Company, the fourth\r\n    asking for non-alienation of the coast of the country, and the fifth\r\n    relating to the questions of national advisers, national police,\r\n    national arms, missionary propaganda, Yangtsze Valley railways, and\r\n    Fukien Province. Out of profound regard for the intentions\r\n    entertained by Japan, the Chinese Government took these momentous\r\n    demands into grave and careful consideration and decided to\r\n    negotiate with the Japanese Government frankly and sincerely what\r\n    were possible to negotiate. This is a manifestation to Japan of the\r\n    most profound regard which the Chinese Government entertains for the\r\n    relations between the two nations.\r\n\r\n    Ever since the opening of the negotiations China has been doing her\r\n    best to hasten their progress holding as many as three conferences a\r\n    week. As regards the articles in the second group, the Chinese\r\n    Government being disposed to allow the Japanese Government to\r\n    develop the economic relations of the two countries in South\r\n    Manchuria, realizing that the Japanese Government attaches\r\n    importance to its interests in that region, and wishing to meet the\r\n    hope of Japan, made a painful effort, without hesitation, to agree\r\n    to the extension of the 25-year lease of Port Arthur and Dalny, the\r\n    36-year period of the South Manchurian Railway and the 15-year\r\n    period of the Antung-Mukden Railway, all to 99 years; and to abandon\r\n    its own cherished hopes to regain control of these places and\r\n    properties at the expiration of their respective original terms of\r\n    lease. It cannot but be admitted that this is a most genuine proof\r\n    of China's friendship for Japan.\r\n\r\n    As to the right of opening mines in South Manchuria, the Chinese\r\n    Government has already agreed to permit Japanese to work mines\r\n    within the mining areas designated by Japan. China has further\r\n    agreed to give Japan a right of preference in the event of borrowing\r\n    foreign capital for building railways or of making a loan on the\r\n    security of the local taxes in South Manchuria. The question of\r\n    revising the arrangement for the Kirin-Changchun Railway has been\r\n    settled in accordance with the proposal made by Japan. The Chinese\r\n    Government has further agreed to employ Japanese first in the event\r\n    of employing foreign advisers on political, military, financial and\r\n    police matters.\r\n\r\n    Furthermore, the provision about the repurchase period in the South\r\n    Manchurian Railway was not mentioned in Japan's original proposal.\r\n    Subsequently, the Japanese Government alleging that its meaning was\r\n    not clear, asked China to cancel the provision altogether. Again,\r\n    Japan at first demanded the right of Japanese to carry on farming in\r\n    South Manchuria, but subsequently she considered the word \"farming\"\r\n    was not broad enough and asked to replace it with the phrase\r\n    \"agricultural enterprises.\" To these requests the Chinese\r\n    Government, though well aware that the proposed changes could only\r\n    benefit Japan, still acceded without delay. This, too, is a proof of\r\n    China's frankness and sincerity towards Japan.\r\n\r\n    As regards matters relating to Shantung the Chinese Government has\r\n    agreed to a majority of the demands.\r\n\r\n    The question of inland residence in South Manchuria is, in the\r\n    opinion of the Chinese Government, incompatible with the treaties\r\n    China had entered into with Japan and other Powers, still the\r\n    Chinese Government did its best to consider how it was possible to\r\n    avoid that incompatibility. At first, China suggested that the\r\n    Chinese Authorities should have full rights of jurisdiction over\r\n    Japanese settlers. Japan declined to agree to it. Thereupon China\r\n    reconsidered the question and revised her counter-proposal five or\r\n    six times, each time making some definite concession, and went so\r\n    far to agree that all civil and criminal cases between Chinese and\r\n    Japanese should be arranged according to existing treaties. Only\r\n    cases relating to land or lease contracts were reserved to be\r\n    adjudicated by Chinese Courts, as a mark of China's sovereignty over\r\n    the region. This is another proof of China's readiness to concede as\r\n    much as possible.\r\n\r\n    Eastern Inner Mongolia is not an enlightened region as yet, and the\r\n    conditions existing there are entirely different from those\r\n    prevailing in South Manchuria. The two places, therefore, cannot be\r\n    considered in the same light. Accordingly, China agreed to open\r\n    commercial marts first, in the interests of foreign trade.\r\n\r\n    The Hanyehping Company mentioned in the third group is entirely a\r\n    private company, and the Chinese Government is precluded from\r\n    interfering with it and negotiating with another government to make\r\n    any disposal of the same as the Government likes, but having regard\r\n    for the interests of the Japanese capitalists, the Chinese\r\n    Government agreed that whenever, in future, the said company and the\r\n    Japanese capitalists should arrive at a satisfactory arrangement for\r\n    co-operation, China will give her assent thereto. Thus the interests\r\n    of the Japanese capitalists are amply safeguarded.\r\n\r\n    Although the demand in the fourth group asking for a declaration not\r\n    to alienate China's coast is an infringement of her sovereign\r\n    rights, yet the Chinese Government offered to make a voluntary\r\n    pronouncement so far as it comports with China's sovereign rights.\r\n    Thus, it is seen that the Chinese Government, in deference to the\r\n    wishes of Japan, gave a most serious consideration even to those\r\n    demands, which gravely affect the sovereignty and territorial rights\r\n    of China as well as the principle of equal opportunity and the\r\n    treaties with foreign Powers. All this was a painful effort on the\r\n    part of the Chinese Government to meet the situation--a fact of\r\n    which the Japanese Government must be aware.\r\n\r\n    As regards the demands in the fifth group, they all infringe China's\r\n    sovereignty, the treaty rights of other Powers or the principle of\r\n    equal opportunity. Although Japan did not indicate any difference\r\n    between this group and the preceding four in the list which she\r\n    presented to China in respect to their character, the Chinese\r\n    Government, in view of their palpably objectionable features,\r\n    persuaded itself that these could not have been intended by Japan as\r\n    anything other than Japan's mere advice to China. Accordingly China\r\n    has declared from the very beginning that while she entertains the\r\n    most profound regard for Japan's wishes, she was unable to admit\r\n    that any of these matters could be made the subject of an\r\n    understanding with Japan. Much as she desired to pay regard to\r\n    Japan's wishes, China cannot but respect her own sovereign rights\r\n    and the existing treaties with other Powers. In order to be rid of\r\n    the seed for future misunderstanding and to strengthen the basis of\r\n    friendship, China was constrained to iterate the reasons for\r\n    refusing to negotiate on any of the articles in the fifth group, yet\r\n    in view of Japan's wishes China has expressed her readiness to state\r\n    that no foreign money was borrowed to construct harbour work in\r\n    Fukien Province. Thus it is clear that China went so far as to see a\r\n    solution for Japan of a question that really did not admit of\r\n    negotiation. Was there, then, evasion, on the part of China?\r\n\r\n    Now, since the Japanese Government has presented a revised list of\r\n    demands and declared at the same time, that it will restore the\r\n    leased territory of Kiaochow, the Chinese Government reconsiders the\r\n    whole question and herewith submits a new reply to the friendly\r\n    Japanese Government.\r\n\r\n    In this reply the unsettled articles in the first group are stated\r\n    again for discussion.\r\n\r\n    As regards the second group, those articles which have already been\r\n    initialled are omitted. In connection with the question of inland\r\n    residence the police regulation clause has been revised in a more\r\n    restrictive sense. As for the trial of cases relating to land and\r\n    lease contracts the Chinese Government now permits the Japanese\r\n    Consul to send an officer to attend the proceedings.\r\n\r\n    Of the four demands in connection with that part of Eastern Inner\r\n    Mongolia which is within the jurisdiction of South Manchuria and the\r\n    Jehol intendency, China agrees to three.\r\n\r\n    China, also, agrees to the article relating to the Hanyehping\r\n    Company as revised by Japan.\r\n\r\n    It is hoped that the Japanese Government will appreciate the\r\n    conciliatory spirit of the Chinese Government in making this final\r\n    concession and forthwith give her assent thereto.\r\n\r\n    There is one more point. At the beginning of the present\r\n    negotiations it was mutually agreed to observe secrecy but\r\n    unfortunately a few days after the presentation of the demands by\r\n    Japan an Osaka newspaper published an \"Extra\" giving the text of the\r\n    demands. The foreign and the Chinese press has since been paying\r\n    considerable attention to this question and frequently publishing\r\n    pro-Chinese or pro-Japanese comments in order to call forth the\r\n    World's conjecture--a matter which the Chinese Government deeply\r\n    regrets.\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government has never carried on any newspaper campaign\r\n    and the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly declared\r\n    this to the Japanese Minster.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, the Chinese Government wishes to express its hope\r\n    that the negotiations now pending between the two countries will\r\n    soon come to an end and whatever misgivings foreign countries\r\n    entertain toward the present situation may be quickly dispelled.\r\n\r\nThe Peking Government, although fully aware of the perils now\r\nconfronting it, had dared to draft a complete reply to the revised\r\nDemands and had reduced Japanese redundancy to effective limits. Not\r\nonly were various articles made more compact, but the phraseology\r\nemployed conveyed unmistakably, if in a somewhat subtle way, that China\r\nwas not a subordinate State treating with a suzerain. Moreover, after\r\ndealing succinctly and seriously with Groups I, II and III, the Chinese\r\nreply terminates abruptly, the other points in the Japanese List being\r\nleft entirely unanswered. It is important to seize these points in the\r\ntext that follows.\r\n\r\n    CHINA'S REPLY TO REVISED DEMANDS\r\n\r\n    China's Reply of May 1, 1915, to the Japanese Revised Demands of\r\n    April 26, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUP I\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government and the Japanese Government, being desirous\r\n    of maintaining the general peace in Eastern Asia and further\r\n    strengthening the friendly relations and good neighbourhood existing\r\n    between the two nations, agree to the following articles:--\r\n\r\n    Article I. The Chinese Government declares that they will give full\r\n    assent to all matters upon which the Japanese and German Governments\r\n    may hereafter mutually agree, relating to the disposition of all\r\n    interests, which Germany, by virtue of treaties or recorded cases,\r\n    possesses in relation to the Province of Shantung.\r\n\r\n    The Japanese Government declares that when the Chinese Government\r\n    give their assent to the disposition of interests above referred to,\r\n    Japan will restore the leased territory of Kiaochow to China; and\r\n    further recognize the right of the Chinese Government to participate\r\n    in the negotiations referred to above between Japan and Germany.\r\n\r\n    Article 2. The Japanese Government consents to be responsible for\r\n    the indemnification of all losses occasioned by Japan's military\r\n    operation around the leased territory of Kiaochow. The customs,\r\n    telegraphs and post offices within the leased territory of Kiaochow\r\n    shall, prior to the restoration of the said leased territory to\r\n    China, be administered as heretofore for the time being. The\r\n    railways and telegraph lines erected by Japan for military purposes\r\n    are to be removed forthwith. The Japanese troops now stationed\r\n    outside the original leased territory of Kiaochow are now to be\r\n    withdrawn first, those within the original leased territory are to\r\n    be withdrawn on the restoration of the said leased territory to\r\n    China.\r\n\r\n    Article 3. (Changed to an exchange of notes.)\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government declares that within the Province of Shantung\r\n    and along its coast no territory or island will be ceded or leased\r\n    to any Power under any pretext.\r\n\r\n    Article 4. The Chinese Government consent that as regards the\r\n    railway to be built by China herself from Chefoo or Lungkow to\r\n    connect with the Kiaochow-Tsinanfu railway, if Germany is willing to\r\n    abandon the privilege of financing the Chefoo-Weihsien line, China\r\n    will approach Japanese capitalists for a loan.\r\n\r\n    Article 5. The Chinese Government engage, in the interest of trade\r\n    and for the residence of foreigners, to open by herself as soon as\r\n    possible certain suitable places in the Province of Shantung as\r\n    Commercial Ports.\r\n\r\n    (Supplementary Exchange of Notes)\r\n\r\n    The places which ought to be opened are to be chosen, and the\r\n    regulations are to be drafted by the Chinese Government, but the\r\n    Japanese Minister must be consulted before making a decision.\r\n\r\n    Article 6. If the Japanese and German Governments are not able to\r\n    come to a definite agreement in future in their negotiations\r\n    respecting transfer, etc., this provisional agreement contained in\r\n    the foregoing articles shall be void.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUP II[15]\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government and the Japanese Government, with a view to\r\n    developing their economic relations in South Manchuria, agree to the\r\n    following articles:--\r\n\r\n    Article 2. Japanese subjects in South Manchuria may, by arrangement\r\n    with the owners, lease land required for erecting suitable buildings\r\n    for trade and manufacture or agricultural enterprises.\r\n\r\n    Article 3. Japanese subjects shall be free to reside and travel in\r\n    South Manchuria and to engage in business and manufacture of any\r\n    kind whatsoever.\r\n\r\n    Article 3a. The Japanese subjects referred to in the preceding two\r\n    articles, besides being required to register with the local\r\n    authorities passports which they must procure under the existing\r\n    regulations, shall also observe police rules and regulations and pay\r\n    taxes in the same manner as Chinese. Civil and criminal cases shall\r\n    be tried and adjudicated by the authorities of the defendant\r\n    nationality and an officer can be deputed to attend the proceedings.\r\n    But all cases purely between Japanese subjects and mixed cases\r\n    between Japanese or Chinese, relating to land or disputes arising\r\n    from lease contracts, shall be tried and adjudicated by Chinese\r\n    Authorities and the Japanese Consul may also depute an officer to\r\n    attend the proceedings. When the judicial system in the said\r\n    Province is completely reformed, all the civil and criminal cases\r\n    concerning Japanese subjects shall be tried entirely by Chinese law\r\n    courts.\r\n\r\n    RELATING TO EASTERN INNER MONGOLIA\r\n\r\n    (To be Exchanged by Notes)\r\n\r\n    1. The Chinese Government declare that China will not in future\r\n    pledge the taxes, other than customs and salt revenue of that part\r\n    of Eastern Inner Mongolia under the jurisdiction of South Manchuria\r\n    and Jehol Intendency, as security for raising a foreign loan.\r\n\r\n    2. The Chinese Government declare that China will herself provide\r\n    funds for building the railways in the part of Eastern Inner\r\n    Mongolia under the jurisdiction of South Manchuria and the Jehol\r\n    Intendency; if foreign capital is required, China will negotiate\r\n    with Japanese capitalists first, provided this does not conflict\r\n    with agreements already concluded with other Powers.\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government agree, in the interest of trade and for the\r\n    residence of foreigners, to open by China herself certain suitable\r\n    places in that part of Eastern Inner Mongolia under the jurisdiction\r\n    of South Manchurian and the Jehol Intendency, as Commercial Marts.\r\n\r\n    The regulations for the said Commercial Marts will be made in\r\n    accordance with those of other Commercial Marts opened by China\r\n    herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GROUP III\r\n\r\n    The relations between Japan and the Hanyehping Company being very\r\n    intimate, if the said Company comes to an agreement with the\r\n    Japanese capitalists for co-operation, the Chinese Government shall\r\n    forthwith give their consent thereto. The Chinese Government further\r\n    declare that China will not convert the company into a state\r\n    enterprise, nor confiscate it, nor cause it to borrow and use\r\n    foreign capital other than Japanese.\r\n\r\n    Letter to be addressed by the Japanese Minister to the Chinese\r\n    Minister of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n    Excellency: I have the honour to state that a report has reached me\r\n    that the Chinese Government have given permission to foreign nations\r\n    to construct, on the coast of Fukien Province, dock-yards, coaling\r\n    stations for military use, naval bases and other establishments for\r\n    military purposes; and further, that the Chinese Government are\r\n    borrowing foreign capital for putting up the above-mentioned\r\n    constructions or establishments. I shall be much obliged if the\r\n    Chinese Government will inform me whether or not these reports are\r\n    well founded in fact.\r\n\r\n    Reply to be addressed by the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs to\r\n    the Japanese Minister.\r\n\r\n    Excellency: I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your\r\n    Excellency's Note of.... In reply I beg to state that the Chinese\r\n    Government have not given permission to foreign Powers to construct,\r\n    on the coast of Fukien Province, dock-yards, coaling stations for\r\n    military use, naval bases or other establishments for military\r\n    purposes; nor do they contemplate to borrow foreign capital for\r\n    putting up such constructions or establishments.\r\n\r\nWithin forty-eight hours of this passage-at-arms of the 1st May it was\r\nunderstood in Peking that Japan was meditating a serious step. That\r\nvague feeling of unrest which so speedily comes in capitals when\r\nnational affairs reach a crisis was very evident, and the word\r\n\"ultimatum\" began to be whispered. It was felt that whilst China had\r\nheld to her rights to the utmost and had received valuable indirect\r\nsupport from both England and the United States, the world-situation was\r\nsuch that it would be difficult to prevent Japan from proceeding to\r\nextremities. Accordingly there was little real surprise when on the 7th\r\nMay Japan filed an ultimatum demanding a satisfactory reply within 48\r\nhours to her Revised Demands--failing which those steps deemed necessary\r\nwould be taken. A perusal of the text of the Ultimatum will show an\r\ninteresting change in the language employed. Coaxing having failed, and\r\nJapan being _now convinced that so long as she did not seek to annex the\r\nrights of other Foreign Powers in China open opposition could not be\r\noffered to her_, states her case very defiantly. One significant point,\r\nhowever, must be carefully noted--that she agrees \"to detach Group V\r\nfrom the present negotiations and to discuss it separately in the\r\nfuture.\" It is this fact which remains the sword of Damocles hanging\r\nover China's head; and until this sword has been flung back into the\r\nwaters of the Yellow Sea the Far Eastern situation will remain perilous.\r\n\r\n    JAPAN'S ULTIMATUM TO CHINA\r\n\r\n    Japan's Ultimatum delivered by the Japanese Minister to the Chinese\r\n    Government, on May 7th, 1915.\r\n\r\n    The reason why the Imperial Government opened the present\r\n    negotiations with the Chinese Government is first to endeavour to\r\n    dispose of the complications arising out of the war between Japan\r\n    and China, and secondly to attempt to solve those various questions\r\n    which are detrimental to the intimate relations of China and Japan\r\n    with a view to solidifying the foundation of cordial friendship\r\n    subsisting between the two countries to the end that the peace of\r\n    the Far East may be effectually and permanently preserved. With this\r\n    object in view, definite proposals were presented to the Chinese\r\n    Government in January of this year, and up to to-day as many as\r\n    twenty-five conferences have been held with the Chinese Government\r\n    in perfect sincerity and frankness.\r\n\r\n    In the course of the negotiation the Imperial Government have\r\n    consistently explained the aims and objects of the proposals in a\r\n    conciliatory spirit, while on the other hand the proposals of the\r\n    Chinese Government, whether important or unimportant, have been\r\n    attended to without any reserve.\r\n\r\n    It may be stated with confidence that no effort has been spared to\r\n    arrive at a satisfactory and amicable settlement of those questions.\r\n\r\n    The discussion of the entire corpus of the proposals was practically\r\n    at an end at the twenty-fourth conference; that is on the 17th of\r\n    the last month. The Imperial Government, taking a broad view of the\r\n    negotiation and in consideration of the points raised by the Chinese\r\n    Government, modified the original proposals with considerable\r\n    concessions and presented to the Chinese Government on the 26th of\r\n    the same month the revised proposals for agreement, and at the same\r\n    time it was offered that, on the acceptance of the revised\r\n    proposals, the Imperial Government would, at a suitable opportunity,\r\n    restore, with fair and proper conditions, to the Chinese Government\r\n    the Kiaochow territory, in the acquisition of which the Imperial\r\n    Government had made a great sacrifice.\r\n\r\n    On the 1st of May, the Chinese Government delivered the reply to the\r\n    revised proposals of the Japanese Government, which is contrary to\r\n    the expectations of the Imperial Government. The Chinese Government\r\n    not only did not give a careful consideration to the revised\r\n    proposals but even with regard to the offer of the Japanese\r\n    Government to restore Kiaochow to the Chinese Government the latter\r\n    did not manifest the least appreciation for Japan's good will and\r\n    difficulties.\r\n\r\n    From the commercial and military point of view Kiaochow is an\r\n    important place, in the acquisition of which the Japanese Empire\r\n    sacrificed much blood and money, and, after the acquisition the\r\n    Empire incurs no obligation to restore it to China. But with the\r\n    object of increasing the future friendly relations of the two\r\n    countries, they went to the extent of proposing its restoration, yet\r\n    to their great regret, the Chinese Government did not take into\r\n    consideration the good intention of Japan and manifest appreciation\r\n    of her difficulties. Furthermore, the Chinese Government not only\r\n    ignored the friendly feelings of the Imperial Government in offering\r\n    the restoration of Kiaochow Bay, but also in replying to the revised\r\n    proposals they even demanded its unconditional restoration; and\r\n    again China demanded that Japan should bear the responsibility of\r\n    paying indemnity for all the unavoidable losses and damages\r\n    resulting from Japan's military operations at Kiaochow; and still\r\n    further in connection with the territory of Kiaochow China advanced\r\n    other demands and declared that she has the right of participation\r\n    at the future peace conference to be held between Japan and Germany.\r\n    Although China is fully aware that the unconditional restoration of\r\n    Kiaochow and Japan's responsibility of indemnification for the\r\n    unavoidable losses and damages can never be tolerated by Japan yet\r\n    she purposely advanced these demands and declared that this reply\r\n    was final and decisive.\r\n\r\n    Since Japan could not tolerate such demands the settlement of the\r\n    other questions, however compromising it may be, would not be to her\r\n    interest. The consequence is that the present reply of the Chinese\r\n    Government is, on the whole, vague and meaningless.\r\n\r\n    Furthermore, in the reply of the Chinese Government to the other\r\n    proposals in the revised list of the Imperial Government, such as\r\n    South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia, where Japan particularly\r\n    has geographical, commercial, industrial and strategic relations, as\r\n    recognized by all the nations, and made more remarkable in\r\n    consequence of the two wars in which Japan was engaged the Chinese\r\n    Government overlooks these facts and does not respect Japan's\r\n    position in that place. The Chinese Government even freely altered\r\n    those articles which the Imperial Government, in a compromising\r\n    spirit, have formulated in accordance with the statement of the\r\n    Chinese Representatives thereby making the statements of the\r\n    Representatives an empty talk; and on seeing them conceding with the\r\n    one hand and withholding with the other it is very difficult to\r\n    attribute faithfulness and sincerity to the Chinese authorities.\r\n\r\n    As regards the articles relating to the employment of advisers, the\r\n    establishment of schools, and hospitals, the supply of arms and\r\n    ammunition and the establishment of arsenals and railway concessions\r\n    in South China in the revised proposals they were either proposed\r\n    with the proviso that the consent of the Power concerned must be\r\n    obtained, or they are merely to be recorded in the minutes in\r\n    accordance with the statements of the Chinese delegates, and thus\r\n    they are not in the least in conflict either with Chinese\r\n    sovereignty or her treaties with the Foreign Powers, yet the Chinese\r\n    Government in their reply to the proposals, alleging that these\r\n    proposals are incompatible with their sovereign rights and treaties\r\n    with Foreign Powers, defeat the expectations of the Imperial\r\n    Government. However, in spite of such attitude of the Chinese\r\n    Government, the Imperial Government, though regretting to see that\r\n    there is no room for further negotiations, yet warmly attached to\r\n    the preservation of the peace of the Far East, is still hoping for a\r\n    satisfactory settlement in order to avoid the disturbance of the\r\n    relations.\r\n\r\n    So in spite of the circumstances which admitted no patience, they\r\n    have reconsidered the feelings of the Government of their\r\n    neighbouring country and, with the exception of the article relating\r\n    to Fukien which is to be the subject of an exchange of notes as has\r\n    already been agreed upon by the Representatives of both nations,\r\n    will undertake to detach the Group V from the present negotiation\r\n    and discuss it separately in the future. Therefore the Chinese\r\n    Government should appreciate the friendly feelings of the Imperial\r\n    Government by immediately accepting without any alteration all the\r\n    articles of Group I, II, III, and IV and the exchange of notes in\r\n    connection with Fukien province in Group V as contained in the\r\n    revised proposals presented on the 26th of April.\r\n\r\n    The Imperial Government hereby again offer their advice and hope\r\n    that the Chinese Government, upon this advice, will give a\r\n    satisfactory reply by 6 o'clock P.M. on the 9th day of May. It is\r\n    hereby declared that if no satisfactory reply is received before or\r\n    at the specified time, the Imperial Government will take steps they\r\n    may deem necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n    EXPLANATORY NOTE\r\n\r\n    Accompanying Ultimatum delivered to the Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\n    by the Japanese Minister, May 7th, 1915.\r\n\r\n    1. With the exception of the question of Fukien to be arranged by an\r\n    exchange of notes, the five articles postponed for later negotiation\r\n    refer to (a) the employment of advisers, (b) the establishment of\r\n    schools and hospitals, (c) the railway concessions in South China,\r\n    (d) the supply of arms and ammunition and the establishment of\r\n    arsenals and (e) right of missionary propaganda.\r\n\r\n    2. The acceptance by the Chinese Government of the article relating\r\n    to Fukien may be either in the form as proposed by the Japanese\r\n    Minister on the 26th of April or in that contained in the Reply of\r\n    the Chinese Government of May 1st. Although the Ultimatum calls for\r\n    the immediate acceptance by China of the modified proposals\r\n    presented on April 26th, without alteration but it should be noted\r\n    that it merely states the principle and does not apply to this\r\n    article and articles 4 and 5 of this note.\r\n\r\n    3. If the Chinese Government accept all the articles as demanded in\r\n    the Ultimatum the offer of the Japanese Government to restore\r\n    Kiaochow to China, made on the 26th of April, will still hold good.\r\n\r\n    4. Article 2 of Group II relating to the lease or purchase of land,\r\n    the terms \"lease\" and \"purchase\" may be replaced by the terms\r\n    \"temporary lease\" and \"perpetual lease\" or \"lease on consultation,\"\r\n    which means a long-term lease with its unconditional renewal.\r\n\r\n    Article 4 of Group II relating to the approval of police laws and\r\n    Ordinances and local taxes by the Japanese Council may form the\r\n    subject of a secret agreement.\r\n\r\n    5. The phrase \"to consult with the Japanese Government\" in\r\n    connection with questions of pledging the local taxes for raising\r\n    loans and the loans for the construction of railways, in Eastern\r\n    Inner Mongolia, which is similar to the agreement in Manchuria\r\n    relating to the matters of the same kind, may be replaced by the\r\n    phrase \"to consult with the Japanese capitalists.\"\r\n\r\n    The article relating to the opening of trade marts in Eastern Inner\r\n    Mongolia in respect to location and regulations, may, following\r\n    their precedent set in Shantung, be the subject of an exchange of\r\n    notes.\r\n\r\n    6. From the phrase \"those interested in the Company\" in Group III of\r\n    the revised list of demands, the words \"those interested in\" may be\r\n    deleted.\r\n\r\n    7. The Japanese version of the Formal Agreement and its annexes\r\n    shall be the official text or both the Chinese and Japanese shall be\r\n    the official texts.\r\n\r\nWhilst it would be an exaggeration to say that open panic followed the\r\nfiling of this document, there was certainly very acute alarm,--so much\r\nso that it is to-day known in Peking that the Japanese Legation cabled\r\nurgently to Tokio that even better terms could be obtained if the matter\r\nwas left to the discretion of the men on the spot. But the Japanese\r\nGovernment had by now passed through a sufficiently anxious time itself,\r\nbeing in possession of certain unmistakable warnings regarding what was\r\nlikely to happen after a world-peace had come,--if matters were pressed\r\ntoo far. Consequently nothing more was done, and on the following day\r\nChina signified her acceptance of the Ultimatum in the following terms.\r\n\r\n    _Reply of the Chinese Government to the Ultimatum of the Japanese\r\n    Government, delivered to the Japanese Minister by the Minister of\r\n    Foreign Affairs on the 8th of May, 1915._\r\n\r\n    On the 7th of this month, at three o'clock P.M. the Chinese\r\n    Government received an Ultimatum from the Japanese Government\r\n    together with an Explanatory Note of seven articles. The Ultimatum\r\n    concluded with the hope that the Chinese Government by six o'clock\r\n    P.M. on the 9th of May will give a satisfactory reply, and it is\r\n    hereby declared that if no satisfactory reply is received before or\r\n    at the specified time, the Japanese Government will take steps she\r\n    may deem necessary.\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government with a view to preserving the peace of the\r\n    Far East hereby accepts, with the exception of those five articles\r\n    of Group V postponed for later negotiation, all the articles of\r\n    Group I, II, III, and IV and the exchange of notes in connection\r\n    with Fukien Province in Group V as contained in the revised\r\n    proposals presented on the 26th of April, and in accordance with the\r\n    Explanatory Note of seven articles accompanying the Ultimatum of the\r\n    Japanese Government with the hope that thereby all the outstanding\r\n    questions are settled, so that the cordial relationship between the\r\n    two countries may be further consolidated. The Japanese Minister is\r\n    hereby requested to appoint a day to call at the Ministry of Foreign\r\n    Affairs to make the literary improvement of the text and sign the\r\n    Agreement as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThus ended one of the most extraordinary diplomatic negotiations ever\r\nundertaken in Peking.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Refers to preaching Buddhism.\r\n\r\n[14] The reader will observe, that the expression \"Hanyehping\r\nenterprises\" is compounded by linking together characters denoting the\r\ntriple industry.\r\n\r\n[15] Six articles found in Japan's Revised Demands are omitted here as\r\nthey had already been initialled by the Chinese Foreign Minister and the\r\nJapanese Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE TWENTY-ONE DEMANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key to this remarkable business was supplied by a cover sent\r\nanonymously to the writer during the course of these negotiations with\r\nno indication as to its origin. The documents which this envelope\r\ncontained are so interesting that they merit attention at the hands of\r\nall students of history, explaining as they do the psychology of the\r\nDemands as well as throwing much light on the manner in which the\r\nworld-war has been viewed in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe first document is purely introductory, but is none the less\r\ninteresting. It is a fragment, or rather a _précis_ of the momentous\r\nconversation which took place between Yuan Shih-kai and the Japanese\r\nMinister when the latter personally served the Demands on the Chief\r\nExecutive and took the opportunity to use language unprecedented even in\r\nthe diplomatic history of Peking.\r\n\r\nThe _précis_ begins in a curious way. After saying that \"the Japanese\r\nMinister tried to influence President Yuan Shih-kai with the following\r\nwords,\" several long lines of asterisks suggest that after reflection\r\nthe unknown chronicler had decided, for political reasons of the highest\r\nimportance, to allow others to guess how the \"conversation\" opened. From\r\nthe context it seems absolutely clear that the excised words have to\r\ndeal with the possibility of the re-establishment of the Empire in\r\nChina--a very important conclusion in view of what followed later in the\r\nyear. Indeed there is no reason to doubt that the Japanese Envoy\r\nactually told Yuan Shih-kai that as he was already virtually Emperor it\r\nlay within his power to settle the whole business and to secure his\r\nposition at one blow. In any case the _précis_ begins with these\r\nilluminating sentences:\r\n\r\n    ... Furthermore, the Chinese revolutionists are in close touch and\r\n    have intimate relations with numerous irresponsible Japanese, some\r\n    of whom have great influence and whose policy is for strong\r\n    measures. Our Government has not been influenced by this policy, but\r\n    if your Government does not quickly agree to these stipulations, it\r\n    will be impossible to prevent some of our irresponsible people from\r\n    inciting the Chinese revolutionists to create trouble in China.\r\n\r\n    The majority of the Japanese people are also opposed to President\r\n    Yuan and Yuan's Government. They all declare that the President\r\n    entertains anti-Japanese feeling and adopts the policy of\r\n    \"befriending the Far\" (Europe and America) and \"antagonizing the\r\n    Near\" (Japan). Japanese public opinion is therefore exceedingly\r\n    hostile.\r\n\r\n    Our Government has all along from first to last exerted its best\r\n    efforts to help the Chinese Government, and if the Chinese\r\n    Government will speedily agree to these stipulations it will have\r\n    thus manifested its friendship for Japan.\r\n\r\n    The Japanese people will then be able to say that the President\r\n    never entertained anti-Japanese feelings, or adopted the policy of\r\n    \"befriending the Far and antagonizing the Near.\" Will not this then\r\n    be indeed a bonâ fide proof of our friendly relations?\r\n\r\n    The Japanese Government also will then be inclined to render\r\n    assistance to President Yuan's Government whenever it is\r\n    necessary....\r\n\r\nWe are admittedly living in a remarkable age which is making waste paper\r\nof our dearest principles. But in all the welter which the world war has\r\nmade it would be difficult to find anything more extraordinary than\r\nthese few paragraphs. Japan, through her official representative, boldly\r\ntears down the veil hiding her ambitions, and using the undoubted menace\r\nwhich Chinese revolutionary activities then held for the Peking\r\nGovernment, declares in so many words that unless President Yuan\r\nShih-kai bows his head to the dictation of Tokio, the duel which began\r\nin Seoul twenty-five years ago would be openly resumed.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the \"conversation\" is the principal document in\r\nthe dossier. This is nothing less than an exhaustive Memorandum, divided\r\ninto two sections, containing the policy advocated by the Japanese\r\nsecret society, called the Black Dragon Society, which is said to have\r\nassumed that name on account of the members (military officers) having\r\nstudied the situation in the Heilungchiang (or \"Black Dragon\") province\r\nof Manchuria. The memorandum is the most remarkable document dealing\r\nwith the Far East which has come to light since the famous Cassini\r\nConvention was published in 1896. Written presumably late in the autumn\r\nof 1914 and immediately presented to the Japanese Government, it may\r\nundoubtedly be called the fulminate which exploded the Japanese mine of\r\nthe 18th January, 1915. It shows such sound knowledge of\r\nworld-conditions, and is so scientific in its detachment that little\r\ndoubt can exist that distinguished Japanese took part in its drafting.\r\nIt can therefore be looked upon as a genuine expression of the highly\r\neducated Japanese mind, and as such cannot fail to arouse serious\r\nmisgivings. The first part is a general review of the European War and\r\nthe Chinese Question: the second is concerned with the Defensive\r\nAlliance between China and Japan, which is looked upon as the one goal\r\nof all Japanese Diplomacy.\r\n\r\n    PART I. THE EUROPEAN WAR AND THE CHINESE QUESTION\r\n\r\n    The present gigantic struggle in Europe has no parallel in history.\r\n    Not only will the equilibrium of Europe be affected and its effect\r\n    felt all over the globe, but its results will create a New Era in\r\n    the political and social world. Therefore, whether or not the\r\n    Imperial Japanese Government can settle the Far Eastern Question and\r\n    bring to realization our great Imperial policy depends on our being\r\n    able to skilfully avail ourselves of the world's general trend of\r\n    affairs so as to extend our influence and to decide upon a course of\r\n    action towards China which shall be practical in execution. If our\r\n    authorities and people view the present European War with\r\n    indifference and without deep concern, merely devoting their\r\n    attention to the attack on Kiaochow, neglecting the larger issues of\r\n    the war, they will have brought to nought our great Imperial policy,\r\n    and committed a blunder greater than which it can not be conceived.\r\n    We are constrained to submit this statement of policy for the\r\n    consideration of our authorities, not because we are fond of\r\n    argument but because we are deeply anxious for our national welfare.\r\n\r\n    No one at present can foretell the outcome of the European War. If\r\n    the Allies meet with reverses and victory shall crown the arms of\r\n    the Germans and Austrians, German militarism will undoubtedly\r\n    dominate the European Continent and extend southward and eastward to\r\n    other parts of the world. Should such a state of affairs happen to\r\n    take place the consequences resulting therefrom will be indeed great\r\n    and extensive. On this account we must devote our most serious\r\n    attention to the subject. If, on the other hand, the Germans and\r\n    Austrians should be crushed by the Allies, Germany will be deprived\r\n    of her present status as a Federated State under a Kaiser. The\r\n    Federation will be disintegrated into separate states, and Prussia\r\n    will have to be content with the status of a second-rate Power.\r\n    Austria and Hungary, on account of this defeat, will consequently be\r\n    divided. What their final fate shall be, no one would now venture\r\n    to predict. In the meantime Russia will annex Galicia and the\r\n    Austrian Poland: France will repossess Alsace and Lorraine: Great\r\n    Britain will occupy the German Colonies in Africa and the South\r\n    Pacific; Servia and Montenegro will take Bosnia, Herzegovina and a\r\n    certain portion of Austrian Territory; thus making such great\r\n    changes in the map of Europe that even the Napoleonic War in 1815\r\n    could not find a parallel.\r\n\r\n    When these events take place, not only will Europe experience great\r\n    changes, but we should not ignore the fact that they will occur also\r\n    in China and in the South Pacific. After Russia has replaced Germany\r\n    in the territories lost by Germany and Austria, she will hold a\r\n    controlling influence in Europe, and, for a long time to come, will\r\n    have nothing to fear from her western frontier. Immediately after\r\n    the war she will make an effort to carry out her policy of expansion\r\n    in the East and will not relax that effort until she has acquired a\r\n    controlling influence in China. At the same time Great Britain will\r\n    strengthen her position in the Yangtsze Valley and prohibit any\r\n    other country from getting a footing there. France will do likewise\r\n    in Yunnan province using it as her base of operations for further\r\n    encroachments upon China and never hesitate to extend her\r\n    advantages. We must therefore seriously study the situation\r\n    remembering always that the combined action of Great Britain,\r\n    Russia, and France will not only affect Europe but that we can even\r\n    foresee that it will also affect China.\r\n\r\n    Whether this combined action on the part of England, France and\r\n    Russia is to terminate at the end of the war or to continue to\r\n    operate, we can not now predict. But after peace in Europe is\r\n    restored, these Powers will certainly turn their attention to the\r\n    expansion of their several spheres of interest in China, and, in the\r\n    adjustment, their interests will most likely conflict with one\r\n    another. If their interests do not conflict, they will work jointly\r\n    to solve the Chinese Question. On this point we have not the least\r\n    doubt. If England, France and Russia are actually to combine for the\r\n    coercion of China, what course is to be adopted by the Imperial\r\n    Japanese Government to meet the situation? What proper means shall\r\n    we employ to maintain our influence and extend our interests within\r\n    this ring of rivalry and competition? It is necessary that we bear\r\n    in mind the final results of the European War and forestall the\r\n    trend of events succeeding it so as to be able to decide upon a\r\n    policy towards China and determine the action to be ultimately\r\n    taken. If we remain passive, the Imperial Japanese Government's\r\n    policy towards China will lose that subjective influence and our\r\n    diplomacy will be checked for ever by the combined force of the\r\n    other Powers. The peace of the Far East will be thus endangered and\r\n    even the existence of the Japanese Empire as a nation will no doubt\r\n    be imperilled. It is therefore our first important duty at this\r\n    moment to enquire of our Government what course is to be adopted to\r\n    face that general situation after the war? What preparations are\r\n    being made to meet the combined pressure of the Allies upon China?\r\n    What policy has been followed to solve the Chinese Question? When\r\n    the European War is terminated and peace restored we are not\r\n    concerned so much with the question whether it be the Dual\r\n    Monarchies or the Triple Entente which emerge victorious but\r\n    whether, in anticipation of the future expansion of European\r\n    influence in the Continents of Europe and Asia, the Imperial\r\n    Japanese Government should or should not hesitate to employ force to\r\n    check the movement before this occurrence. Now is the most opportune\r\n    moment for Japan to quickly solve the Chinese Question. Such an\r\n    opportunity will not occur for hundreds of years to come. Not only\r\n    is it Japan's divine duty to act now, but present conditions in\r\n    China favour the execution of such a plan. We should by all means\r\n    decide and act at once. If our authorities do not avail themselves\r\n    of this rare opportunity, great difficulty will surely be\r\n    encountered in future in the settlement of this Chinese Question.\r\n    Japan will be isolated from the European Powers after the war, and\r\n    will be regarded by them with envy and jealousy just as Germany is\r\n    now regarded. Is it not then a vital necessity for Japan to solve at\r\n    this very moment the Chinese Question?\r\n\r\nNo one--not even those who care nothing for politics--can deny that\r\nthere is in this document an astounding disclosure of the mental\r\nattitude of the Japanese not only towards their enemies but towards\r\ntheir friends as well. They trust nobody, befriend nobody, envy nobody;\r\nthey content themselves with believing that the whole world may in the\r\nnot distant future turn against them. The burden of their argument\r\nswings just as much against their British ally as against Germany and\r\nAustria; and the one and only matter which preoccupies Japanese who make\r\nit their business to think about such things is to secure that Japan\r\nshall forestall Europe in seizing control of China. It is admitted in so\r\nmany words that it is too early to know who is to triumph in the\r\ngigantic European struggle; it is also admitted that Germany will\r\nforever be the enemy. At the same time it is expected, should the issue\r\nof the struggle be clear-cut and decisive in favour of the Allies, that\r\na new three-Power combination formed by England, France and Russia may\r\nbe made to operate against Japan. Although the alliance with England,\r\ntwice renewed since 1902, should occupy as important a place in the Far\r\nEast as the _Entente_ between England and France occupies in Europe, not\r\none Japanese in a hundred knows or cares anything about such an\r\narrangement; and even if he has knowledge of it, he coolly assigns to\r\nhis country's major international commitment a minimum and constantly\r\ndiminishing importance. In his view the British Alliance is nothing but\r\na piece of paper which may be consumed in the great bonfire now shedding\r\nsuch a lurid light over the world. What is germane to the matter is his\r\nown plan, his own method of taking up arms in a sea of troubles. The\r\nsecond part of the Black Dragon Society's Memorandum, pursuing the\r\nargument logically and inexorably and disclosing traces of real\r\npolitical genius, makes this unalterably clear.\r\n\r\nHaving established clearly the attitude of Japan towards the world--and\r\nmore particularly towards the rival political combinations now locked\r\ntogether in a terrible death-struggle, this second part of the\r\nMemorandum is concerned solely with China and can be broken into two\r\nconvenient sections. The first section is constructive--the plan for the\r\nreconstruction of China is outlined in terms suited to the Japanese\r\ngenius. This part begins with an illuminating piece of rhetoric.\r\n\r\n    PART II. THE CHINESE QUESTION AND THE DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE\r\n\r\n    It is a very important matter of policy whether the Japanese\r\n    Government, in obedience to its divine mission, shall solve the\r\n    Chinese Question in a heroic manner by making China voluntarily rely\r\n    upon Japan. To force China to such a position there is nothing else\r\n    for the Imperial Japanese Government to do but to take advantage of\r\n    the present opportunity to seize the reins of political and\r\n    financial power and to enter by all means into a defensive alliance\r\n    with her under secret terms as enumerated below:\r\n\r\n    _The Secret Terms of the Defensive Alliance_\r\n\r\n    The Imperial Japanese Government, with due respect for the\r\n    Sovereignty and Integrity of China and with the object and hope of\r\n    maintaining the peace of the Far East, undertakes to share the\r\n    responsibility of co-operating with China to guard her against\r\n    internal trouble and foreign invasion and China shall accord to\r\n    Japan special facilities in the matter of China's National Defence,\r\n    or the protection of Japan's special rights and privileges and for\r\n    these objects the following treaty of Alliance is to be entered into\r\n    between the two contracting parties:\r\n\r\n    1. When there is internal trouble in China or when she is at war\r\n    with another nation or nations, Japan shall send her army to render\r\n    assistance, to assume the responsibility of guarding Chinese\r\n    territory and to maintain peace and order in China.\r\n\r\n    2. China agrees to recognize Japan's privileged position in South\r\n    Manchuria and Inner Mongolia and to cede the sovereign rights of\r\n    these regions to Japan to enable her to carry out a scheme of local\r\n    defence on a permanent basis.\r\n\r\n    3. After the Japanese occupation of Kiaochow, Japan shall acquire\r\n    all the rights and privileges hitherto enjoyed by the Germans in\r\n    regard to railways, mines and all other interests, and after peace\r\n    and order is restored in Tsingtao, the place shall be handed back to\r\n    China to be opened as an International Treaty port.\r\n\r\n    4. For the maritime defence of China and Japan, China shall lease\r\n    strategic harbours along the coast of the Fukien province to Japan\r\n    to be converted into naval bases and grant to Japan in the said\r\n    province all railway and mining rights.\r\n\r\n    5. For the reorganization of the Chinese army China shall entrust\r\n    the training and drilling of the army to Japan.\r\n\r\n    6. For the unification of China's firearms and munitions of war,\r\n    China shall adopt firearms of Japanese pattern, and at the same time\r\n    establish arsenals (with the help of Japan) in different strategic\r\n    points.\r\n\r\n    7. With the object of creating and maintaining a Chinese Navy, China\r\n    shall entrust the training of her navy to Japan.\r\n\r\n    8. With the object of reorganizing her finances and improving the\r\n    methods of taxation, China shall entrust the work to Japan, and the\r\n    latter shall elect competent financial experts who shall act as\r\n    first-class advisers to the Chinese Government.\r\n\r\n    9. China shall engage Japanese educational experts as educational\r\n    advisers and extensively establish schools in different parts of the\r\n    country to teach Japanese so as to raise the educational standard of\r\n    the country.\r\n\r\n    10. China shall first consult with and obtain the consent of Japan\r\n    before she can enter into an agreement with another Power for making\r\n    loans, the leasing of territory, or the cession of the same.\r\n\r\n    From the date of the signing of this Defensive Alliance, Japan and\r\n    China shall work together hand-in-hand. Japan will assume the\r\n    responsibility of safeguarding Chinese territory and maintaining the\r\n    peace and order in China. This will relieve China of all future\r\n    anxieties and enable her to proceed energetically with her reforms,\r\n    and, with a sense of territorial security, she may wait for her\r\n    national development and regeneration. Even after the present\r\n    European War is over and peace is restored China will absolutely\r\n    have nothing to fear in the future of having pressure brought\r\n    against her by the foreign powers. It is only thus that permanent\r\n    peace can be secured in the Far East.\r\n\r\n    But before concluding this Defensive Alliance, two points must first\r\n    be ascertained and settled, (1) Its bearing on the Chinese\r\n    Government. (2) Its bearing on those Powers having intimate\r\n    relations with and great interests in China.\r\n\r\n    In considering its effect on the Chinese Government, Japan must try\r\n    to foresee whether the position of China's present ruler Yuan\r\n    Shih-kai shall be permanent or not; whether the present Government's\r\n    policy will enjoy the confidence of a large section of the Chinese\r\n    people; whether Yuan Shih-kai will readily agree to the Japanese\r\n    Government's proposal to enter into a treaty of alliance with us.\r\n    These are points to which we are bound to give a thorough\r\n    consideration. Judging by the attitude hitherto adopted by Yuan\r\n    Shih-kai we know he has always resorted to the policy of expediency\r\n    in his diplomatic dealings, and although he may now outwardly show\r\n    friendliness towards us, he will in fact rely upon the influence of\r\n    the different Powers as the easiest check against us and refuse to\r\n    accede to our demands. Take for a single instance, his conduct\r\n    towards us since the Imperial Government declared war against\r\n    Germany and his action will then be clear to all. Whether we can\r\n    rely upon the ordinary friendly methods of diplomacy to gain our\r\n    object or not it does not require much wisdom to decide. After the\r\n    gigantic struggle in Europe is over, leaving aside America which\r\n    will not press for advantage, China will not be able to obtain any\r\n    loans from the other Powers. With a depleted treasury, without means\r\n    to pay the officials and the army, with local bandits inciting the\r\n    poverty-stricken populace to trouble, with the revolutionists\r\n    waiting for opportunities to rise, should an insurrection actually\r\n    occur while no outside assistance can be rendered to quell it we are\r\n    certain it will be impossible for Yuan Shih-kai, single-handed, to\r\n    restore order and consolidate the country. The result will be that\r\n    the nation will be cut up into many parts beyond all hope of remedy.\r\n    That this state of affairs will come is not difficult to foresee.\r\n    When this occurs, shall we uphold Yuan's Government and assist him\r\n    to suppress the internal insurrection with the certain assurance\r\n    that we could influence him to agree to our demands, or shall we\r\n    help the revolutionists to achieve a success and realize our object\r\n    through them? This question must be definitely decided upon this\r\n    very moment so that we may put it into practical execution. If we do\r\n    not look into the future fate of China but go blindly to uphold\r\n    Yuan's Government, to enter into a Defensive Alliance with China,\r\n    hoping thus to secure a complete realization of our object by\r\n    assisting him to suppress the revolutionists, it is obviously a\r\n    wrong policy. Why? Because the majority of the Chinese people have\r\n    lost all faith in the tottering Yuan Shih-kai who is discredited and\r\n    attacked by the whole nation for having sold his country. If Japan\r\n    gives Yuan the support, his Government, though in a very precarious\r\n    state, may possibly avoid destruction. Yuan Shih-kai belongs to that\r\n    school of politicians who are fond of employing craftiness and\r\n    cunning. He may be friendly to us for a time, but he will certainly\r\n    abandon us and again befriend the other Powers when the European war\r\n    is at an end. Judging by his past we have no doubt as to what he\r\n    will do in the future. For Japan to ignore the general sentiment of\r\n    the Chinese people and support Yuan Shih-kai with the hope that we\r\n    can settle with him the Chinese Question is a blunder indeed.\r\n    Therefore in order to secure the permanent peace of the Far East,\r\n    instead of supporting a Chinese Government which can neither be long\r\n    continued in power nor assist in the attainment of our object, we\r\n    should rather support the 400,000,000 Chinese people to renovate\r\n    their corrupt Government, to change its present form, to maintain\r\n    peace and order in the land and to usher into China a new era of\r\n    prosperity so that China and Japan may in fact as well as in name be\r\n    brought into the most intimate and vital relations with each other.\r\n    China's era of prosperity is based on the China-Japanese Alliance\r\n    and this Alliance is the foundational power for the repelling of the\r\n    foreign aggression that is to be directed against the Far East at\r\n    the conclusion of the European war. This alliance is also the\r\n    foundation-stone of the peace of the world. Japan therefore should\r\n    take this as the last warning and immediately solve this question.\r\n    Since the Imperial Japanese Government has considered it imperative\r\n    to support the Chinese people, we should induce the Chinese\r\n    revolutionists, the Imperialists and other Chinese malcontents to\r\n    create trouble all over China. The whole country will be thrown into\r\n    disorder and Yuan's Government will consequently be overthrown. We\r\n    shall then select a man from amongst the most influential and most\r\n    noted of the 400,000,000 of Chinese and help him to organize a new\r\n    form of Government and to consolidate the whole country. In the\r\n    meantime our army must assist in the restoration of peace and order\r\n    in the country, and in the protection of the lives and properties of\r\n    the people, so that they may gladly tender their allegiance to the\r\n    new Government which will then naturally confide in and rely upon\r\n    Japan. It is after the accomplishment of only these things that we\r\n    shall without difficulty gain our object by the conclusion of a\r\n    Defensive Alliance with China.\r\n\r\n    For us to incite the Chinese revolutionists and malcontents to rise\r\n    in China we consider the present to be the most opportune moment.\r\n    The reason why these men cannot now carry on an active campaign is\r\n    because they are insufficiently provided with funds. If the Imperial\r\n    Government can take advantage of this fact to make them a loan and\r\n    instruct them to rise simultaneously, great commotion and disorder\r\n    will surely prevail all over China. We can intervene and easily\r\n    adjust matters.\r\n\r\n    The progress of the European War warns Japan with greater urgency of\r\n    the imperative necessity of solving this most vital of questions.\r\n    The Imperial Government cannot be considered as embarking on a rash\r\n    project. This opportunity will not repeat itself for our benefit. We\r\n    must avail ourselves of this chance and under no circumstances\r\n    hesitate. Why should we wait for the spontaneous uprising of the\r\n    revolutionists and malcontents? Why should we not think out and lay\r\n    down a plan beforehand? When we examine into the form of Government\r\n    in China, we must ask whether the existing Republic is well suited\r\n    to the national temperament and well adapted to the thoughts and\r\n    aspirations of the Chinese people. From the time the Republic of\r\n    China was established up to the present moment, if what it has\r\n    passed through is to be compared to what it ought to be in the\r\n    matter of administration and unification, we find disappointment\r\n    everywhere. Even the revolutionists themselves, the very ones who\r\n    first advocated the Republican form of government, acknowledge that\r\n    they have made a mistake. The retention of the Republican form of\r\n    Government in China will be a great future obstacle in the way of a\r\n    Chino-Japanese Alliance. And why must it be so? Because, in a\r\n    Republic the fundamental principles of government as well as the\r\n    social and moral aims of the people are distinctly different from\r\n    that of a Constitutional Monarchy. Their laws and administration\r\n    also conflict. If Japan act as a guide to China and China models\r\n    herself after Japan, it will only then be possible for the two\r\n    nations to solve by mutual effort the Far East Question without\r\n    differences and disagreements. Therefore to start from the\r\n    foundation for the purpose of reconstructing the Chinese\r\n    Government, of establishing a Chino-Japanese Alliance, of\r\n    maintaining the permanent peace of the Far East and of realizing the\r\n    consummation of Japan's Imperial policy, we must take advantage of\r\n    the present opportunity to alter China's Republican form of\r\n    Government into a Constitutional Monarchy which shall necessarily be\r\n    identical, in all its details, to the Constitutional Monarchy of\r\n    Japan, and to no other. This is really the key and first principle\r\n    to be firmly held for the actual reconstruction of the form of\r\n    Government in China. If China changes her Republican form of\r\n    Government to that of a Constitutional Monarchy, shall we, in the\r\n    selection of a new ruler, restore the Emperor Hsuan T'ung to his\r\n    throne or choose the most capable man from the Monarchists or select\r\n    the most worthy member from among the revolutionists? We think,\r\n    however, that it is advisable at present to leave this question to\r\n    the exigency of the future when the matter is brought up for\r\n    decision. But we must not lose sight of the fact that to actually\r\n    put into execution this policy of a Chino-Japanese Alliance and the\r\n    transformation of the Republic of China into a Constitutional\r\n    Monarchy, is, in reality, the fundamental principle to be adopted\r\n    for the reconstruction of China.\r\n\r\n    We shall now consider the bearing of this Defensive Alliance on the\r\n    other Powers. Needless to say, Japan and China will in no way impair\r\n    the rights and interests already acquired by the Powers. At this\r\n    moment it is of paramount importance for Japan to come to a special\r\n    understanding with Russia to define our respective spheres in\r\n    Manchuria and Mongolia so that the two countries may co-operate with\r\n    each other in the future. This means that Japan after the\r\n    acquisition of sovereign rights in South Manchuria and Inner\r\n    Mongolia will work together with Russia after her acquisition of\r\n    sovereign rights in North Manchuria and Outer Mongolia to maintain\r\n    the status quo, and endeavour by every effort to protect the peace\r\n    of the Far East. Russia, since the outbreak of the European War, has\r\n    not only laid aside all ill-feelings against Japan, but has adopted\r\n    the same attitude as her Allies and shown warm friendship for us. No\r\n    matter how we regard the Manchurian and Mongolian Questions in the\r\n    future she is anxious that we find some way of settlement. Therefore\r\n    we need not doubt but that Russia, in her attitude towards this\r\n    Chinese Question, will be able to come to an understanding with us\r\n    for mutual co-operation.\r\n\r\n    The British sphere of influence and interest in China is centred in\r\n    Tibet and the Yangtsze Valley. Therefore if Japan can come to some\r\n    satisfactory arrangement with China in regard to Tibet and also give\r\n    certain privileges to Great Britain in the Yangtsze Valley, with an\r\n    assurance to protect those privileges, no matter how powerful Great\r\n    Britain might be, she will surely not oppose Japan's policy in\r\n    regard to this Chinese Question. While this present European War is\r\n    going on Great Britain has never asked Japan to render her\r\n    assistance. That her strength will certainly not enable her to\r\n    oppose us in the future need not be doubted in the least.\r\n\r\n    Since Great Britain and Russia will not oppose Japan's policy\r\n    towards China, it can readily be seen what attitude France will\r\n    adopt in regard to the subject. What Japan must now somewhat reckon\r\n    with is America. But America in her attitude towards us regarding\r\n    our policy towards China has already declared the principle of\r\n    maintaining China's territorial integrity and equal opportunity and\r\n    will be satisfied, if we, do not impair America's already acquired\r\n    rights and privileges. We think America will also have no cause for\r\n    complaint. Nevertheless America has in the East a naval force which\r\n    can be fairly relied upon, though not sufficiently strong to be\r\n    feared. Therefore in Japan's attitude towards America there is\r\n    nothing really for us to be afraid of.\r\n\r\n    Since China's condition is such on the one hand and the Powers'\r\n    relation towards China is such on the other hand, Japan should avail\r\n    herself in the meantime of the European War to definitely decide\r\n    upon a policy towards China, the most important move being the\r\n    transformation of the Chinese Government to be followed up by\r\n    preparing for the conclusion of the Defensive Alliance. The\r\n    precipitate action on the part of our present Cabinet in acceding to\r\n    the request of Great Britain to declare war against Germany without\r\n    having definitely settled our policy towards China has no real\r\n    connection with our future negotiations with China or affect the\r\n    political condition in the Far East. Consequently all intelligent\r\n    Japanese, of every walk of life throughout the land, are very deeply\r\n    concerned about the matter.\r\n\r\n    Our Imperial Government should now definitely change our dependent\r\n    foreign policy which is being directed by others into an independent\r\n    foreign policy which shall direct others, proclaiming the same with\r\n    solemn sincerity to the world and carrying it out with\r\n    determination. If we do so, even the gods and spirits will give way.\r\n    These are important points in our policy towards China and the\r\n    result depends on how we carry them out. Can our authorities firmly\r\n    make up their mind to solve this Chinese Question by the actual\r\n    carrying out of this fundamental principle? If they show\r\n    irresolution while we have this heaven-conferred chance and merely\r\n    depend on the good will of the other Powers, we shall eventually\r\n    have greater pressure to be brought against the Far East after the\r\n    European War is over, when the present equilibrium will be\r\n    destroyed. That day will then be too late for us to repent of our\r\n    folly. We are therefore impelled by force of circumstances to urge\r\n    our authorities to a quicker sense of the situation and to come to a\r\n    determination.\r\n\r\nThe first point which leaps out of this extraordinarily frank\r\ndisquisition is that the origin of the Twenty-one Demands is at last\r\ndisclosed. A perusal of the ten articles forming the basis of the\r\nDefensive alliance proposed by the Black Dragon Society, allows us to\r\nunderstand everything that occurred in Peking in the spring of 1915. As\r\nfar back as November, 1914, it was generally rumoured in Peking that\r\nJapan had a surprise of an extraordinary nature in her diplomatic\r\narchives, and that it would be merely a matter of weeks before it was\r\nsprung. Comparing this elaborate memorandum of the Black Dragon Society\r\nwith the original text of the Twenty-one Demands it is plain that the\r\nproposed plan, having been handed to Viscount Kato, had to be passed\r\nthrough the diplomatic filters again and again until all gritty matter\r\nhad been removed, and an appearance of innocuousness given to it. It is\r\nfor this reason that the defensive alliance finally emerges as five\r\ncompact little \"groups\" of demands, with the vital things directly\r\naffecting Chinese sovereignty labelled _desiderata_, so that Japanese\r\nambassadors abroad could leave very warm assurances at every Foreign\r\nOffice that there was nothing in what Japan desired which in any way\r\nconflicted with the Treaty rights of the Powers in China. The air of\r\nmystery which surrounded the whole business from the 18th January to the\r\n7th May--the day of the ultimatum--was due to the fact that Japan\r\nattempted to translate the conspiracy into terms of ordinary\r\nintercourse, only to find that in spite of the \"filtering\" the\r\natmosphere of plotting could not be shaken off or the political threat\r\nadequately hidden. There is an arresting piece of psychology in this.\r\n\r\nThe conviction expressed in the first portion of the Memorandum that\r\nbankruptcy was the rock on which the Peking administration must sooner\r\nor later split, and that the moment which Japan must seize is the\r\noutbreak of insurrections, is also highly instructive in view of what\r\nhappened later. Still more subtle is the manner in which the ultimate\r\nsolution is left open: it is consistently admitted throughout the mass\r\nof reasoning that there is no means of knowing whether suasion or force\r\nwill ultimately be necessary. Force, however, always beckons to Japan\r\nbecause that is the simplest formula. And since Japan is the\r\nself-appointed defender of the dumb four hundred millions, her influence\r\nwill be thrown on the side of the populace in order \"to usher into China\r\na new era of prosperity\" so that China and Japan may in fact as well as\r\nin name be brought into the most intimate and vital relations with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe object of the subsidized insurrections is also clearly stated; it is\r\nto alter China's republican form of government into a Constitutional\r\nMonarchy which shall necessarily be identical in all its details to the\r\nConstitutional Monarchy of Japan and to no other. Who the new Emperor is\r\nto be is a point left in suspense, although we may here again recall\r\nthat in 1912 in the midst of the revolution Japan privately sounded\r\nEngland regarding the advisability of lending the Manchus armed\r\nassistance, a proposal which was immediately vetoed. But there are other\r\nthings: nothing is forgotten in the Memorandum. Russia is to be\r\nspecially placated, England to be specially negotiated with, thus\r\nincidentally explaining Japan's recent attitude regarding the Yangtsze\r\nRailways. Japan, released from her dependent foreign policy, that is\r\nfrom a policy which is bound by conventions and treaties which others\r\nrespect, can then carry out her own plans without fear of molestation.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings us to the two last documents of the dossier--the method\r\nof subsidizing and arranging insurrections in China when and wherever\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe first document is a detailed agreement between the Revolutionary\r\nParty and various Japanese merchants. Trained leaders are to be used in\r\nthe provinces South of the Yellow River, and the matter of result is so\r\nsystematized that the agreement specifies the amount of compensation to\r\nbe paid for every Japanese killed on active service; it declares that\r\nthe Japanese will deliver arms and ammunition in the districts of\r\nJihchow in Shantung and Haichow in Kiangsu; and it ends by stating that\r\nthe first instalment of cash, Yen 400,000, had been paid over in\r\naccordance with the terms of the agreement. The second document is an\r\nadditional loan agreement between the interested parties creating a\r\nspecial \"trading\" corporation, perhaps satirically named \"The Europe and\r\nAsia Trading Company,\" which in a consideration of a loan of half a\r\nmillion yen gives Japanese prior rights over all the mines of China.\r\n\r\n    ALLEGED SECRET AGREEMENT MADE BETWEEN SUN WEN (SUN YAT SEN) AND THE\r\n    JAPANESE\r\n\r\n    In order to preserve the peace in the Far East, it is necessary for\r\n    China and Japan to enter into an offensive and defensive alliance\r\n    whereby in case of war with any other nation or nations Japan shall\r\n    supply the military force while China shall be responsible for the\r\n    finances. It is impossible for the present Chinese Government to\r\n    work hand in hand with the Japanese Government nor does the Japanese\r\n    Government desire to co-operate with the former. Consequently\r\n    Japanese politicians and merchants who have the peace of the Far\r\n    East at heart are anxious to assist China in her reconstruction. For\r\n    this object the following Agreement is entered into by the two\r\n    parties:\r\n\r\n    1. Before an uprising is started, Terao, Okura, Tseji Karoku and\r\n    their associates shall provide the necessary funds, weapons and\r\n    military force, but the funds so provided must not exceed 1,500,000\r\n    yen and rifles not to exceed 100,000 pieces.\r\n\r\n    2. Before the uprising takes place the loan shall be temporarily\r\n    secured by 10,000,000 yen worth of bonds to be issued by Sun Wen\r\n    (Sun Yat Sen). It shall however, be secured afterwards by all the\r\n    movable properties of the occupied territory. (See Article 14 of\r\n    this Agreement.)\r\n\r\n    3. The funds from the present loan and military force to be provided\r\n    are for operations in the provinces South of the Yellow River, viz.:\r\n    Yunnan, Kweichow, Hunan, Hupeh, Szechuan, Kiangsi, Anhuei, Kiangsu\r\n    Chekiang, Fukien, Kwangsi and Kwangtung. If it is intended to invade\r\n    the Northern provinces North of the Yellow River, Tseji Karoku and\r\n    his associates shall participate with the revolutionists in all\r\n    deliberations connected with such operations.\r\n\r\n    4. The Japanese volunteer force shall be allowed from the date of\r\n    their enrolment active service pay in accordance with the\r\n    regulations of the Japanese army. After the occupation of a place,\r\n    the two parties will settle the mode of rewarding the meritorious\r\n    and compensating the family of the killed, adopting the most\r\n    generous practice in vogue in China and Japan. In the case of the\r\n    killed, compensation for each soldier shall, at the least, be more\r\n    than 1,000 yen.\r\n\r\n    5. Wherever the revolutionary army might be located the Japanese\r\n    military officers accompanying these expeditions shall have the\r\n    right to advise a continuation or cessation of operations.\r\n\r\n    6. After the revolutionary army has occupied a region and\r\n    strengthened its defences, all industrial undertakings and railway\r\n    construction and the like, not mentioned in the Treaties with other\r\n    foreign Powers, shall be worked with joint capital together with the\r\n    Japanese.\r\n\r\n    7. On the establishment of a new Government in China, all Japan's\r\n    demands on China shall be recognized by the new Government as\r\n    settled and binding.\r\n\r\n    8. All Japanese Military Officers holding the rank of Captain or\r\n    higher ranks engaged by the Chinese revolutionary army shall have\r\n    the privilege of being continued in their employment with a limit as\r\n    to date and shall have the right to ask to be thus employed.\r\n\r\n    9. The loan shall be paid over in three instalments. The first\r\n    instalment will be 400,000 yen, the second instalment ... yen and\r\n    the third instalment ... yen. After the first instalment is paid\r\n    over, Okura who advances the loan shall have the right to appoint\r\n    men to supervise the expenditure of the money.\r\n\r\n    10. The Japanese shall undertake to deliver all arms and ammunition\r\n    in the Districts of Jih Chao and Haichow (in Shantung and Kiangsu,\r\n    South of Kiaochow).\r\n\r\n    11. The payment of the first instalment of the loan shall be made\r\n    not later than three days after the signing of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n    12. All the employed Japanese Military officers and Japanese\r\n    volunteers are in duty bound to obey the orders of the Commander of\r\n    the revolutionary army.\r\n\r\n    13. The Commander of the revolutionary army shall have the right to\r\n    send back to Japan those Japanese military officers and Japanese\r\n    volunteers who disobey his orders and their passage money shall not\r\n    be paid if such decision meets with the approval of three or more of\r\n    the Japanese who accompany the revolutionary force.\r\n\r\n    14. All the commissariat departments in the occupied territory must\r\n    employ Japanese experts to co-operate in their management.\r\n\r\n    15. This Agreement takes effect immediately it is signed by the two\r\n    parties.\r\n\r\n    The foregoing fifteen articles have been discussed several times\r\n    between the two parties and signed by them in February. The first\r\n    instalment of 400,000 yen has been paid according to the terms of\r\n    this Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LOAN AGREEMENT MADE BETWEEN THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY REPRESENTED BY\r\n    CHANG YAO-CHING AND HIS ASSOCIATES OF THE FIRST PART AND KAWASAKI\r\n    KULANOSKE OF THE SECOND PART\r\n\r\n    1. The Europe and Asia Trading Company undertakes to raise a loan of\r\n    500,000 yen. After the Agreement is signed and sealed by the\r\n    contracting parties the Japanese Central Bank shall hand over 3/10\r\n    of the loan as the first instalment. When Chang Yao-Ching and his\r\n    associates arrive at their proper destination the sum of 150,000 yen\r\n    shall be paid over as the second instalment. When final arrangements\r\n    are made the third and last instalment of 200,000 yen shall be paid.\r\n\r\n    2. When money is to be paid out, the Europe and Asia Trading Company\r\n    shall appoint supervisors. Responsible individuals of the\r\n    contracting parties shall jointly affix their seals (to the cheques)\r\n    before money is drawn for expenditure.\r\n\r\n    3. The Europe and Asia Trading Company shall secure a volunteer\r\n    force of 150 men, only retired officers of the Japanese army to be\r\n    eligible.\r\n\r\n    4. On leaving Japan the travelling expenses and personal effects of\r\n    the volunteers shall be borne by themselves. After reaching China,\r\n    Chang Yao-Ching and his associates shall give the volunteers the pay\r\n    of officers of the subordinate grade according to the established\r\n    regulations of the Japanese army.\r\n\r\n    5. If a volunteer is wounded while on duty Chang Yao-Ching and his\r\n    associates shall pay him a provisional compensation of not exceeding\r\n    1,000 yen. When wounded seriously a provisional compensation of\r\n    5,000 yen shall be paid as well as a life pension in accordance with\r\n    the rules of the Japanese army. If a volunteer meets with an\r\n    accident, thus losing his life, an indemnity of 50,000 yen shall be\r\n    paid to his family.\r\n\r\n    6. If a volunteer is not qualified for duty Chang Yao-Ching and his\r\n    associates shall have the power to dismiss him. All volunteers are\r\n    subject to the orders of Chang Yao-Ching and his associates and to\r\n    their command in the battlefields.\r\n\r\n    7. When volunteers are required to attack a certain selected place\r\n    it shall be their duty to do so. But the necessary expenses for the\r\n    undertaking shall be determined beforehand by both parties after\r\n    investigating into existing conditions.\r\n\r\n    8. The volunteer force shall be organized after the model of the\r\n    Japanese army. Two Japanese officers recommended by the Europe and\r\n    Asia Trading Company shall be employed.\r\n\r\n    9. The Europe and Asia Trading Company shall have the power to\r\n    dispose of the public properties in the places occupied by the\r\n    volunteer force.\r\n\r\n    10. The Europe and Asia Trading Company shall have the first\r\n    preference for working the mines in places occupied and protected by\r\n    the volunteer force.\r\n\r\nAnd here ends this extraordinary collection of papers. Is fiction mixed\r\nwith fact--are these only \"trial\" drafts, or are they real documents\r\nsigned, sealed, and delivered? The point seems unimportant. The thing of\r\nimportance is the undoubted fact that assembled and treated in the way\r\nwe have treated them they present a complete and arresting picture of\r\nthe aims and ambitions of the ordinary Japanese; of their desire to push\r\nhome the attack to the last gasp and so to secure the infeodation of\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MONARCHIST PLOT\r\n\r\nTHE PAMPHLET OF YANG TU\r\n\r\n\r\nA shiver of impotent rage passed over the country when the nature and\r\nacceptance of the Japanese Ultimatum became generally known. The\r\nChinese, always an emotional people, responding with quasi-feminine\r\nvolubility to oppressive acts, cried aloud at the ignominy of the\r\ndiplomacy which had so cruelly crucified them. One and all declared that\r\nthe day of shame which had been so harshly imposed upon them would never\r\nbe forgotten and that Japan would indeed pay bitterly for her policy of\r\nextortion.\r\n\r\nTwo movements were started at once: one to raise a National Salvation\r\nFund to be applied towards strengthening the nation in any way the\r\ngovernment might decide; the other, to boycott all Japanese articles of\r\ncommerce. Both soon attained formidable proportions. The nation became\r\ndeeply and fervently interested in the double-idea; and had Yuan\r\nShih-kai possessed true political vision there is little doubt that by\r\nresponding to this national call he might have ultimately been borne to\r\nthe highest pinnacles of his ambitions without effort on his part. His\r\noldest enemies now openly declared that henceforth he had only to work\r\nhonourably and whole-heartedly in the nation's interest to find them\r\nsupporting him, and to have every black mark set against his name wiped\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances what did he do? His actions form one of the most\r\nincredible and, let it be said, contemptible chapters of contemporary\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the origins of the Twenty-one Demands we have already\r\ndiscussed the hints the Japan Representative had officially made when\r\npresenting his now famous Memorandum. Briefly Yuan Shih-kai had been\r\ntold in so many words that since he was already autocrat of all the\r\nChinese, he had only to endorse the principle of Japanese guidance in\r\nhis administration to find that his Throne would be as good as publicly\r\nand solidly established. Being saturated with the doleful diplomacy of\r\nKorea, and seeing in these proposals a mere trap, Yuan Shih-kai, as we\r\nhave shown, had drawn back in apparent alarm. Nevertheless the words\r\nspoken had sunk in deep, for the simple and excellent reason that ever\r\nsince the _coup d'état_ of the 4th November, 1913, the necessity of\r\n\"consolidating\" his position by something more permanent than a display\r\nof armed force had been a daily subject of conversation in the bosom of\r\nhis family. The problem, as this misguided man saw it, was simply by\r\nmeans of an unrivalled display of cunning to profit by the Japanese\r\nsuggestion, and at the same time to leave the Japanese in the lurch.\r\n\r\nHis eldest son, an individual of whom it has been said that he had\r\nabsorbed every theory his foreign teachers had taught him without being\r\ncapable of applying a single one, was the leader in this family\r\nintrigue. The unhappy victim of a brutal attempt to kill him during the\r\nRevolution, this eldest son had been for years semi-paralyzed: but\r\nbrooding over his disaster had only fortified in him the resolve to\r\nsucceed his father as legitimate Heir. Having saturated himself in\r\nNapoleonic literature, and being fully aware of how far a bold leader\r\ncan go in times of emergency, he daily preached to his father the\r\nnecessity of plucking the pear as soon as it was ripe. The older man,\r\nbeing more skilled and more cautious in statecraft than this youthful\r\nvisionary, purposely rejected the idea so long as its execution seemed\r\nto him premature. But at last the point was reached when he was\r\npersuaded to give the monarchy advocates the free hand they solicited,\r\nbeing largely helped to this decision by the argument that almost\r\nanything in China could be accomplished under cover of the war,--_so\r\nlong as vested foreign interests were not jeopardized_.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this decision, very shortly after the 18th January,\r\nthe dictator's lieutenants had begun to sound the leaders of public\r\nopinion regarding the feasibility of substituting for the nominal\r\nRepublic a Constitutional Monarchy. Thus, in a highly characteristic\r\nway, all through the tortuous course of the Japanese negotiations, to\r\nwhich he was supposed to be devoting his sole attention in order to save\r\nhis menaced fatherland, Yuan Shih-kai was assisting his henchmen to\r\nindoctrinate Peking officialdom with the idea that the salvation of the\r\nState depended more on restoring on a modified basis the old empire than\r\nin beating off the Japanese assault. It was his belief that if some\r\nscholar of national repute could be found, who would openly champion\r\nthese ideas and urge them with such persuasiveness and authority that\r\nthey became accepted as a Categorical Imperative, the game would be as\r\ngood as won, the Foreign Powers being too deeply committed abroad to pay\r\nmuch attention to the Far East. The one man who could have produced that\r\nresult in the way Yuan Shih-kai desired to see it, the brilliant\r\nreformer Liang Chi-chao, famous ever since 1898, however, obstinately\r\nrefused to lend himself to such work; and, sooner than be involved in\r\nany way in the plot, threw up his post of Minister of Justice and\r\nretired to the neighbouring city of Tientsin from which centre he was\r\ndestined to play a notable part.\r\n\r\nThis hitch occasioned a delay in the public propaganda, though not for\r\nlong. Forced to turn to a man of secondary ability, Yuan Shih-kai now\r\ninvoked the services of a scholar who had been known to be his secret\r\nagent in the Old Imperial Senate under the Manchus--a certain Yang\r\nTu--whose constant appeals in that chamber had indeed been the means of\r\nforcing the Manchus to summon Yuan Shih-kai back to office to their\r\nrescue on the outbreak of the Wuchang rebellion in 1911. After very\r\nlittle discussion everything was arranged. In the person of this\r\nex-Senator, whose whole appearance was curiously Machiavellian and\r\ndecadent, the neo-imperialists at last found their champion.\r\n\r\nEvents now moved quickly enough. In the Eastern way, very few weeks\r\nafter the Japanese Ultimatum, a society was founded called the Society\r\nfor the Preservation of Peace (_Chou An Hui_) and hundreds of\r\naffiliations opened in the provinces. Money was spent like water to\r\nsecure adherents, and when the time was deemed ripe the now famous\r\npamphlet of Yang Tu was published broadcast, being in everybody's hands\r\nduring the idle summer month of August. This document is so remarkable\r\nas an illustration of the working of that type of Chinese mind which\r\nhas assimilated some portion of the facts of the modern world and yet\r\nremains thoroughly reactionary and illogical, that special attention\r\nmust be directed to it. Couched in the form of an argument between two\r\nindividuals--one the inquirer, the other the expounder--it has something\r\nof the Old Testament about it both in its blind faith and in its\r\ninsistence on a few simple essentials. It embodies everything essential\r\nto an understanding of the old mentality of China which has not yet been\r\ncompletely destroyed. From a literary standpoint it has also much that\r\nis valuable because it is so naïve; and although it is concerned with\r\nsuch a distant region of the world as China its treatment of modern\r\npolitical ideas is so bizarre and yet so acute that it will repay study.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, for some time, that the significance of this\r\npamphlet was generally understood. It was such an amazing departure from\r\nold precedents for the Peking Government to lend itself to public\r\npropaganda as a revolutionary weapon that the mind of the people refused\r\nto credit the fatal turn things were taking. But presently when it\r\nbecame known that the \"Society for the Preservation of Peace\" was\r\nactually housed in the Imperial City and in daily relations with the\r\nPresident's Palace; and that furthermore the Procurator-General of\r\nPeking, in response to innumerable memorials of denunciation, having\r\nattempted to proceed against the author and publishers of the pamphlet,\r\nas well as against the Society, had been forced to leave the capital\r\nunder threats against his life, the document was accepted at its\r\nface-value. Almost with a gasp of incredulity China at last realized\r\nthat Yuan Shih-kai had been seduced to the point of openly attempting to\r\nmake himself Emperor. From those August days of 1915 until the 6th June\r\nof the succeeding year, when Fate had her own grim revenge, Peking was\r\ngiven up to one of the most amazing episodes that has ever been\r\nchronicled in the dramatic history of the capital. It was as if the old\r\ncity walls, which had looked down on so much real drama, had determined\r\nto lend themselves to the staging of an unreal comedy. For from first to\r\nlast the monarchy movement had something unreal about it, and might have\r\nbeen the scenario of some vast picture-play. It was acting pure and\r\nsimple--acting done in the hope that the people might find it so\r\nadmirable that they would acclaim it as real, and call the Dictator\r\ntheir King. But it is time to turn to the arguments of Yang Tu and allow\r\na Chinese to picture the state of his country:\r\n\r\n    A DEFENCE OF THE MONARCHICAL MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n    PART I\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko (or \"the stranger\"): Since the establishment of the Republic\r\n    four years have passed, and upon the President depends the\r\n    preservation of order at home and the maintenance of prestige\r\n    abroad. I suppose that after improving her internal administration\r\n    for ten or twenty years, China will become a rich and prosperous\r\n    country, and will be able to stand in the front rank with western\r\n    nations.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: No! No! If China does not make any change in the form of\r\n    government there is no hope for her becoming strong and rich; there\r\n    is even no hope for her having a constitutional government. I say\r\n    that China is doomed to perish.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: Why so?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: The republican form of government is responsible. The\r\n    Chinese people are fond of good names, but they do not care much\r\n    about the real welfare of the nation. No plan to save the country is\r\n    possible. The formation of the Republic as a result of the first\r\n    revolution has prevented that.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: Why is it that there is no hope of China's becoming strong?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: The people of a republic are accustomed to listen to the\r\n    talk of equality and freedom which must affect the political and\r\n    more especially the military administration. In normal circumstances\r\n    both the military and student classes are required to lay great\r\n    emphasis upon unquestioned obedience and respect for those who hold\r\n    high titles. The German and Japanese troops observe strict\r\n    discipline and obey the orders of their chiefs. That is why they are\r\n    regarded as the best soldiers in the world. France and America are\r\n    in a different position. They are rich but not strong. The sole\r\n    difference is that Germany and Japan are ruled by monarchs while\r\n    France and America are republics. Our conclusion therefore is that\r\n    no republic can be strong.\r\n\r\n    But since the French and American peoples possess general education\r\n    they are in a position to assume responsibility for the good\r\n    government of their nations which they keep in good order. On that\r\n    account, although these republics are not strong in dealing with the\r\n    Powers, they can maintain peace at home. China, however, is unlike\r\n    these countries, for her standard of popular education is very low.\r\n    Most of the Chinese soldiers declare as a commonplace: \"We eat the\r\n    imperial food and we must therefore serve the imperial master.\" But\r\n    now the Imperial family is gone, and for it has been substituted an\r\n    impersonal republic, of which they know nothing whatsoever. These\r\n    soldiers are now law-abiding because they have awe-inspiring and\r\n    respectful feelings for the man at the head of the state. But as the\r\n    talk of equality and freedom has gradually influenced them, it has\r\n    become a more difficult task to control them. As an example of this\r\n    corrupt spirit, the commanders of the Southern troops formerly had\r\n    to obey their subordinate officers and the subordinate officers had\r\n    to obey their soldiers. Whenever there was an important question to\r\n    be discussed, the soldiers demanded a voice and a share in the\r\n    solution. These soldiers were called the republican army. Although\r\n    the Northern troops have not yet become so degenerate, still they\r\n    never hesitate to disobey the order of their superiors whenever they\r\n    are ordered to proceed to distant localities. Now we have come to\r\n    the point when we are deeply satisfied if the army of the Republic\r\n    does not openly mutiny! We cannot expect any more from them save to\r\n    hope that they will not mutiny and that they will be able to\r\n    suppress internal disturbances. In the circumstances there is no use\r\n    talking about resistance of a foreign invasion by these soldiers. As\r\n    China, a republic, is situated between two countries, Japan and\r\n    Russia, both of which have monarchical governments, how can we\r\n    resist their aggression once diplomatic conversations begin? From\r\n    this it is quite evident that there is nothing which can save China\r\n    from destruction. Therefore I say there is no hope of China becoming\r\n    strong.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: But why is it that there is no hope of China ever becoming\r\n    rich?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: People may not believe that while France and America are\r\n    rich China must remain poor. Nevertheless, the reason why France and\r\n    America are rich is that they were allowed to work out their own\r\n    salvation without foreign intervention for many years, and that at\r\n    the same time they were free from internal disturbances. If any\r\n    nation wishes to become rich, it must depend upon industries for its\r\n    wealth. Now, what industries most fear is disorder and civil war.\r\n    During the last two years order has been restored and many things\r\n    have returned to their former state, but our industrial condition is\r\n    the same as under the Manchu Dynasty. Merchants who lost their\r\n    capital during the troublous times and who are now poor have no way\r\n    of retrieving their losses, while those who are rich are unwilling\r\n    to invest their money in industrial undertakings, fearing that\r\n    another civil war may break out at any moment, since they take the\r\n    recent abortive second revolution as their warning. In future, we\r\n    shall have disquietude every few years; that is whenever the\r\n    president is changed. Then our industrial and commercial condition\r\n    will be in a still worse condition. If our industries are not\r\n    developed, how can we expect to be strong? Take Mexico as a warning.\r\n    There is very little difference between that country and China,\r\n    which certainly cannot be compared with France and America.\r\n    Therefore I say there is no hope for China ever becoming rich.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: Why is it that you say there is no hope for China having a\r\n    Constitutional Government?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: A true republic must be conducted by many people possessing\r\n    general education, political experience and a certain political\r\n    morality. Its president is invested with power by the people to\r\n    manage the general affairs of the state. Should the people desire to\r\n    elect Mr. A their president to-day and Mr. B to-morrow, it does not\r\n    make much difference; for the policy of the country may be changed\r\n    together with the change of the president without there being any\r\n    danger of disorder or chaos following such change. We have a very\r\n    different problem to solve in China. The majority of our people do\r\n    not know what the republic is, nor do they know anything about a\r\n    Constitution nor have they any true sense of equality and freedom.\r\n    Having overthrown the Empire and established in its place a republic\r\n    they believe that from now on they are subservient to no one, and\r\n    they think they can do as they please. Ambitious men hold that any\r\n    person may be president, and if they cannot get the presidency by\r\n    fair means of election they are prepared to fight for it with the\r\n    assistance of troops and robbers. The second revolution is an\r\n    illustration of this point. From the moment that the Emperor was\r\n    deposed, the centralization of power in the government was\r\n    destroyed; and no matter who may be at the head of the country, he\r\n    cannot restore peace except by the re-establishment of the monarchy.\r\n    So at the time when the republic was formed, those who had\r\n    previously advocated Constitutional Government turned into\r\n    monarchists. Although we have a Provisional Constitution now and we\r\n    have all kinds of legislative organs, which give to the country an\r\n    appearance of a constitutional government, China has a\r\n    constitutional government in name only and is a monarchy in spirit.\r\n    Had the government refrained from exercising monarchical power\r\n    during the last four years, the people could not have enjoyed one\r\n    day of peace. In short, China's republic must be governed by a\r\n    monarchy through a constitutional government. If the constitutional\r\n    government cannot govern the republic, the latter cannot remain. The\r\n    question of constitutional government is therefore very important,\r\n    but it will take ten or twenty years before it can be solved.\r\n\r\n    Look at the people of China to-day! They know that something\r\n    terrible is going to come sooner or later. They dare not think of\r\n    the future. The corrupt official lines his pocket with unrighteous\r\n    money, preparing to flee to foreign countries or at least to the\r\n    Foreign Settlements for safety. The cautious work quietly and do not\r\n    desire to earn merit but merely try to avoid giving offence. The\r\n    scholars and politicians are grandiloquent and discourse upon their\r\n    subjects in a sublime vein, but they are no better than the corrupt\r\n    officials. As for our President, he can remain at the head of the\r\n    State for a few years. At most he may hold office for several\r\n    terms,--or perhaps for his whole life. Then questions must arise as\r\n    to who shall succeed him; how to elect his successor; how many\r\n    rivals will there be; whether their policies will be different from\r\n    his, etc., etc. He personally has no idea regarding the solution of\r\n    these questions. Even if the president is a sagacious and capable\r\n    man he will not be able to make a policy for the country or fix a\r\n    Constitution which will last for a hundred years. Because of this he\r\n    is driven merely to adopt a policy so as to maintain peace in his\r\n    own country and to keep the nation intact so long as he may live. In\r\n    the circumstances such a president can be considered the best\r\n    executive head we can have. Those who are worshippers of the\r\n    constitutional government cannot do more than he does. Here we find\r\n    the reason for the silence of the former advocates of a\r\n    constitutional administration. They have realized that by the\r\n    formation of the republic the fundamental problem of the country has\r\n    been left unsolved. In this wise it happens that the situation is\r\n    something like this. Whilst the country is governed by an able\r\n    president, the people enjoy peace and prosperity. But once an\r\n    incapable man assumes the presidency, chaos will become the order of\r\n    the day, a state of affairs which will finally lead to the overthrow\r\n    of the president himself and the destruction of the country. In such\r\n    circumstances, how can you devise a general policy for the country\r\n    which will last for a hundred years? I say that there is no hope for\r\n    China establishing a truly constitutional government.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: In your opinion there is no hope for China becoming strong\r\n    and rich or for her acquiring a constitutional government. She has\r\n    no choice save ultimately to disappear. And yet is there no plan\r\n    possible whereby she may be saved?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: If China wishes to save herself from ultimate disappearance\r\n    from the face of the earth, first of all she must get rid of the\r\n    republic. Should she desire wealth and strength, she must adopt a\r\n    constitutional government. Should she want constitutional government\r\n    she must first establish a monarchy.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: How is it that should China desire wealth and strength she\r\n    must first adopt the constitutional form of government?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: Wealth and strength is the object of the country, and a\r\n    constitutional government is the means to realizing this object. In\r\n    the past able rulers could accomplish their purpose without a\r\n    constitutional government. We refer to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty\r\n    and Emperor Tai Chung of the Tang Dynasty. However, when these able\r\n    rulers died their system of administration died with them. This\r\n    contention can be supported by numerous historical instances; but\r\n    suffice to say that in China as well as in Europe, the lack of a\r\n    constitutional government has been the cause of the weakness of most\r\n    of the nations in ancient times. Japan was never known as a strong\r\n    nation until she adopted a constitutional government. The reason is\r\n    this: when there is no constitutional government, the country cannot\r\n    continue to carry out a definite policy.\r\n\r\n    Within comparatively recent times there was born in Europe the\r\n    constitutional form of government. European nations adopted it, and\r\n    they became strong. The most dangerous fate that can confront a\r\n    nation is that after the death of an able ruler the system of\r\n    administration he has established disappears with him; but this the\r\n    constitutional form of government is able to avert. Take for\r\n    instance William I. of Germany who is dead but whose country\r\n    continues to this day strong and prosperous. It is because of\r\n    constitutional government. The same is true of Japan, which has\r\n    adopted constitutional government and which is becoming stronger and\r\n    stronger every day. The change of her executive cannot affect her\r\n    progress in respect of her strength. From this it is quite clear\r\n    that constitutional government is a useful instrument for building\r\n    up a country. It is a government with a set of fixed laws which\r\n    guard the actions of both the people and the president none of whom\r\n    can overstep the boundary as specified in the laws. No ruler,\r\n    whether be he a good man or a bad man, can change one iota of the\r\n    laws. The people reap the benefit of this in consequence. It is easy\r\n    to make a country strong and rich but it is difficult to establish a\r\n    constitutional government. When a constitutional government has been\r\n    established, everything will take care of itself, prosperity\r\n    following naturally enough. The adoption of a constitutional\r\n    government at the present moment can be compared to the problem of a\r\n    derailed train. It is hard to put the train back on the track, but\r\n    once on the track it is very easy to move the train. What we should\r\n    worry about is not how to make the country rich and prosperous, but\r\n    how to form a genuine constitutional government. Therefore I say\r\n    that if China desires to be strong and prosperous, she should first\r\n    of all adopt the constitutional form of government.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: I do not understand why it is that a monarchy should be\r\n    established before the constitutional form of government can be\r\n    formed?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: Because if the present system continues there will be\r\n    intermittent trouble. At every change of the president there will be\r\n    riot and civil war. In order to avert the possibility of such awful\r\n    times place the president in a position which is permanent. It\r\n    follows that the best thing is to make him Emperor. When that bone\r\n    of contention is removed, the people will settle down to business\r\n    and feel peace in their hearts, and devote their whole energy and\r\n    time to the pursuit of their vocations. It is logical to assume that\r\n    after the adoption of the monarchy they will concentrate their\r\n    attention on securing a constitutional government which they know is\r\n    the only salvation for their country. As for the Emperor, knowing\r\n    that he derives his position from the change from a republic, and\r\n    filled with the desire of pacifying the people, he cannot help\r\n    sanctioning the formation of the constitutional form of government\r\n    which in addition, will insure to his offspring the continuation of\r\n    the Throne. Should he adopt any other course, he will be exposed to\r\n    great personal danger. If he is broadminded, he will further\r\n    recognize the fact that if no constitutional form of government is\r\n    introduced, his policy will perish after his death. Therefore I say\r\n    that before the adoption of the constitutional form of government, a\r\n    monarchy should be established. William I. of Germany and the\r\n    Emperor Meiji of Japan both tried the constitutional form of\r\n    government and found it a success.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: Please summarize your discussion.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: In short, the country cannot be saved except through the\r\n    establishment of a constitutional form of government. No\r\n    constitutional government can be formed except through the\r\n    establishment of a monarchy. The constitutional form of government\r\n    has a set of fixed laws, and the monarchy has a definite head who\r\n    cannot be changed, in which matters lies the source of national\r\n    strength and wealth.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: What you have said in regard to the adoption of the\r\n    constitutional monarchy as a means of saving the country from\r\n    dismemberment is quite true, but I would like to have your opinion\r\n    on the relative advantages and disadvantages of a republic and a\r\n    monarchy, assuming that China adopts the scheme of a monarchy.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: I am only too glad to give you my humble opinion on this\r\n    momentous question.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: You have said that China would be devastated by contending\r\n    armies of rival leaders trying to capture the presidency. At what\r\n    precise moment will that occur?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: The four hundred million people of China now rely upon the\r\n    President alone for the protection of their lives and property. Upon\r\n    him likewise falls the burden of preserving both peace and the\r\n    balance of power in the Far East. There is no time in the history of\r\n    China that the Head of the State has had to assume such a heavy\r\n    responsibility for the protection of life and property and for the\r\n    preservation of peace in Asia; and at no time in our history has the\r\n    country been in greater danger than at the present moment. China can\r\n    enjoy peace so long as His Excellency Yuan Shih-kai remains the\r\n    President, and no longer. Should anything befall the President,\r\n    every business activity will at once be suspended, shops will be\r\n    closed, disquietude will prevail, people will become panic-stricken,\r\n    the troops uncontrollable, and foreign warships will enter our\r\n    harbours. European and American newspapers will be full of special\r\n    dispatches about the complicated events in China, and martial law\r\n    will be declared in every part of the country. All this will be due\r\n    to the uncertainty regarding the succession to the presidency.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the first section of this long and extraordinary\r\npamphlet how the author develops his argument. One of his major premises\r\nis the inherent unruliness of Republican soldiery,--the armies of\r\nrepublics not to be compared with the armed forces of monarchies,--and\r\nconsequently constituting a perpetual menace to good government. Passing\r\non from this, he lays down the proposition that China cannot hope to\r\nbecome rich so long as the fear of civil war is ever-present; and that\r\nwithout a proper universal education a republic is an impossibility. The\r\nexercise of monarchical power in such circumstances can only be called\r\nan inevitable development,--the one goal to be aimed at being the\r\nsubstitution of Constitutional Government for the dictatorial rule. The\r\nauthor deals at great length with the background to this idea, playing\r\non popular fears to reinforce his casuistry. For although constitutional\r\ngovernment is insisted upon as the sole solution, he speedily shows that\r\nthis constitutionalism will depend more on the benevolence of the\r\ndictator than on the action of the people. And should his advice be not\r\nheeded, when Fortune wills that Yuan Shih-kai's rule shall end, chaos\r\nwill ensue owing to the \"uncertainty\" regarding the succession.\r\n\r\nHere the discussion reaches its climax--for the demand that salvation be\r\nsought by enthroning Yuan Shih-kai now becomes clear and unmistakable.\r\nLet the author speak for himself.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: But it is provided in the Constitutional Compact that a\r\n    president must be selected from among the three candidates whose\r\n    names are now kept in a golden box locked in a stone room. Do you\r\n    think this provision is not sufficient to avert the terrible times\r\n    which you have just described?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: The provision you have mentioned is useless. Can you find\r\n    any person who is able to be at the head of the state besides His\r\n    Excellency Yuan Shih-kai? The man who can succeed President Yuan\r\n    must enjoy the implicit confidence of the people and must have\r\n    extended his influence all over the country and be known both at\r\n    home and abroad. He must be able to maintain order, and then no\r\n    matter what the constitution provides, he will be unanimously\r\n    elected President. He must also be able to assure himself that the\r\n    two other candidates for the presidency have no hope for success in\r\n    the presidential campaign. The provision in the constitution, as\r\n    well as the golden casket in which the names of the three candidates\r\n    are kept which you have mentioned, are nothing but nominal measures.\r\n    Moreover there is no man in China who answers the description of a\r\n    suitable, successor which I have just given. Here arises a difficult\r\n    problem; and what has been specified in the Constitutional Compact\r\n    is a vain attempt to solve it. It is pertinent to ask why the\r\n    law-makers should not have made the law in such a way that the\r\n    people could exercise their free choice in the matter of the\r\n    presidential successor? The answer is that there is reason to fear\r\n    that a bad man may be elected president by manipulations carried out\r\n    with a masterly hand, thereby jeopardizing the national welfare.\r\n    This fear has influenced the constitution-makers to settle upon\r\n    three candidates from among whom the president must be elected. Then\r\n    it may be asked why not fix upon one man instead of upon three since\r\n    you have already deprived the people of part of their freedom? The\r\n    answer is that: there is not a single man whose qualifications are\r\n    high enough to be the successor. As it is, three candidates of equal\r\n    qualifications are put forward for the people to their selection. No\r\n    matter how one may argue this important question from the legal\r\n    point of view, there is the fact that the law makers fixed upon\r\n    three candidates for the presidency, believing that we do not\r\n    possess a suitable presidential successor. The vital question of the\r\n    day setting aside all paper talk, is whether or not China has a\r\n    suitable man to succeed President Yuan Shih-kai. Whether or not the\r\n    constitutional compact can be actually carried out in future I do\r\n    not know; but I do know that that instrument will eventually become\r\n    ineffective.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: I desire a true picture of the chaos which you have hinted\r\n    will ensue in this country. Can you tell me anything along that\r\n    line?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: In a time of confusion, the soldiers play the most\r\n    important part, virtuous and experienced and learned statesmen being\r\n    unable to cope with the situation. The only qualification which a\r\n    leader at such a time needs to possess is the control of the\r\n    military, and the ability to suppress Parliament. Should such a\r\n    person be made the president, he cannot long hold his enviable post\r\n    in view of the fact that he cannot possess sufficient influence to\r\n    control the troops of the whole country. The generals of equal rank\r\n    and standing will not obey each other, while the soldiers and\r\n    politicians, seeing a chance in these differences for their\r\n    advancement, will stir up their feelings and incite one another to\r\n    fight. They will fight hard among themselves. The rebels, who are\r\n    now exiles in foreign lands, taking advantage of the chaos in China,\r\n    will return in very little time to perpetrate the worst crimes known\r\n    in human history. The royalists who are in retirement will likewise\r\n    come out to fish in muddy waters. Persons who have the\r\n    qualifications of leaders will be used as tools to fight for the\r\n    self-aggrandizement of those who use them. I do not wish to mention\r\n    names, but I can safely predict that more than ten different parties\r\n    will arise at the psychological moment. Men who will never be\r\n    satisfied until they become president, and those who know they\r\n    cannot get the presidency but who are unwilling to serve others,\r\n    will come out one after another. Confusion and disturbance will\r\n    follow with great rapidity. Then foreign countries which have\r\n    entertained wild ambitions, availing themselves of the distressful\r\n    situation in China will stir up ill-feelings among these parties and\r\n    so increase the disturbances. When the proper time comes, various\r\n    countries, unwilling to let a single country enjoy the privilege of\r\n    controlling China, will resort to armed intervention. In consequence\r\n    the eastern problem will end in a rupture of the international\r\n    peace. Whether China will be turned at that time into a battleground\r\n    for the Chinese people or for the foreign Powers I cannot tell you.\r\n    It is too dreadful to think of the future which is enshrouded in a\r\n    veil of mystery. However, I can tell you that the result of this\r\n    awful turmoil will be either the slicing of China like a melon or\r\n    the suppression of internal trouble with foreign assistance which\r\n    will lead to dismemberment. As to the second result some explanation\r\n    is necessary. After foreign countries have helped us to suppress\r\n    internal disturbances, they will select a man of the type of Li Wang\r\n    of Korea, who betrayed his country to Japan, and make him Emperor of\r\n    China. Whether this man will be the deposed emperor or a member of\r\n    the Imperial family or the leader of the rebel party, remains to be\r\n    seen. In any event he will be a figurehead in whose hand will not be\r\n    vested political, financial and military power, which will be\r\n    controlled by foreigners. All the valuable mines, various kinds of\r\n    industries and our abundant natural resources will likewise be\r\n    developed by others. China will thus disappear as a nation. In\r\n    selecting a man of the Li Wang type, the aforesaid foreign countries\r\n    will desire merely to facilitate the acquisition of China's\r\n    territory. But there can be easily found such a man who bears\r\n    remarkable resemblance to Li Wang, and who will be willing to make a\r\n    treaty with the foreigners whereby he unpatriotically sells his\r\n    country in exchange for a throne which he can never obtain or keep\r\n    without outside assistance. His procedure will be something like\r\n    this: He will make an alliance with a foreign nation by which the\r\n    latter will be given the power to carry on foreign relations on\r\n    behalf of his country. In the eyes of foreigners, China will have\r\n    been destroyed, but the people will continue deceived and made to\r\n    believe that their country is still in existence. This is the first\r\n    step. The second step will be to imitate the example of Korea and\r\n    make a treaty with a certain power, whereby China is annexed and the\r\n    throne abolished. The imperial figurehead then flees to the foreign\r\n    country where he enjoys an empty title. Should you then try to make\r\n    him devise means for regaining the lost territory it will be too\r\n    late. For China will have been entirely destroyed by that time. This\r\n    is the second procedure in the annexation of Chinese territory. The\r\n    reason why that foreign country desires to change the republic into\r\n    the monarchy is to set one man on the throne and make him witness\r\n    the whole process of annexation of his country, thereby simplifying\r\n    the matter. When that time has come, the people will not be\r\n    permitted to make any comment upon the form of government suitable\r\n    for China, or upon the destruction of their country. The rebels who\r\n    raised the standard of the republic have no principles and if they\r\n    now find that some other tactics will help to increase their power\r\n    they will adopt these tactics. China's republic is doomed, no matter\r\n    what happens. If we do not change it ourselves, others will do it\r\n    for us. Should we undertake the change ourselves we can save the\r\n    nation: otherwise there is no hope for China to remain a nation. It\r\n    is to be regretted that our people now assume an attitude of\r\n    indifference, being reluctant to look forward to the future, and\r\n    caring not what may happen to them and their country. They are\r\n    doomed to become slaves after the loss of their national\r\n    independence.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: I am very much frightened by what you have said. You have\r\n    stated that the adoption of a constitutional monarchy can avert such\r\n    terrible consequences; but is there not likely to be disturbance\r\n    during the change of the republic to monarchy, since such\r\n    disturbance must always accompany the presidential election?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: No comparison can be formed between these two things. There\r\n    may be tumult during the change of the form of government, but it\r\n    will be better in comparison with the chaos that will some day ensue\r\n    in the republic. There is no executive head in the country when a\r\n    republic endeavours to select a presidential successor. At such a\r\n    time, the ambitious try to improve their future, while the patriotic\r\n    are at a loss now to do anything which will assist in the\r\n    maintenance of order. Those who are rebellious rise in revolt while\r\n    those who are peace-loving are compelled by circumstances to join\r\n    their rank and file. Should the form of government be transformed\r\n    into a monarchical one, and should the time for change of the head\r\n    of the state come, the successor having already been provided for,\r\n    that will be well-known to the people. Those who are patriotic will\r\n    exert their utmost to preserve peace, and as result the\r\n    heir-apparent can peacefully step on the throne. There are persons\r\n    who will contend for the office of the President, but not for the\r\n    throne. Those who contend for the office of President do not commit\r\n    any crime, but those who try to seize the throne are rebels. Who\r\n    dares to contend for the Throne?\r\n\r\n    At the time of the change of the president in a republic, ambitious\r\n    persons arise with the intention of capturing this most honourable\r\n    office, but not so when the emperor is changed. Should there be a\r\n    body of persons hostile to the heir-apparent, that body must be very\r\n    small. Therefore I say that the enemies of a succeeding Emperor are\r\n    a few, whilst there are many in the case of a presidential\r\n    successor. This is the first difference.\r\n\r\n    Those who oppose the monarchy are republican enthusiasts or persons\r\n    who desire to make use of the name of the republic for their own\r\n    benefit. These persons will raise trouble even without the change of\r\n    the government. They do not mind disturbing the peace of the country\r\n    at the present time when the republic exists. It is almost certain\r\n    that at the first unfurling of the imperial flags they will at once\r\n    grasp such an opportune moment and try to satisfy their ambition.\r\n    Should they rise in revolt at the time when the Emperor is changed\r\n    the Government, supported by the loyal statesmen and officials,\r\n    whose interests are bound up with the welfare of the imperial family\r\n    and whose influence has spread far and wide, will be able to deal\r\n    easily with any situation which may develop. Therefore I declare\r\n    that the successor to the throne has more supporters while the\r\n    presidential successor has few. This is the second difference\r\n    between the republic and the constitutional monarchy.\r\n\r\n    Why certain persons will contend for the office of the President can\r\n    be explained by the fact that there is not a single man in the\r\n    country whose qualifications are above all the others. Succession to\r\n    the throne is a question of blood-relation with the reigning\r\n    Emperor, and not a question of qualifications. The high officials\r\n    whose qualifications are unusually good are not subservient to\r\n    others but they are obedient to the succeeding Emperor, because of\r\n    their gratitude for what the imperial family has done for them, and\r\n    because their well-being is closely associated with that of the\r\n    imperial household. I can cite an historical incident to support my\r\n    contention. Under the Manchu Dynasty, at one time General Chu\r\n    Chung-tang was entrusted with the task of suppressing the Mohammedan\r\n    rebellion. He appointed General Liu Sung San generalissimo. Upon the\r\n    death of General Liu, Chu Chung-tang appointed his subordinate\r\n    officers to lead the army but the subordinate officers competed for\r\n    power. Chu Chung-tang finally made the step-son of General Liu the\r\n    Commander-in-Chief and the officers and soldiers all obeyed his\r\n    order as they did his father's. But it may be mentioned that this\r\n    young man was not more able than any of his father's subordinate\r\n    commanders. Nevertheless prestige counted. He owed his success to\r\n    his natural qualification, being a step-son to General Liu. So is\r\n    the case with the emperor whose successor nobody dares openly to\r\n    defy--to say nothing of actually disputing his right to the throne.\r\n    This is the third difference between the republic and the monarchy.\r\n\r\n    I will not discuss the question: as to whether there being no\r\n    righteous and able heir-apparent to succeed his Emperor-father,\r\n    great danger may not confront the nation. However, in order to\r\n    provide against any such case, I advocate that the formation of a\r\n    constitutional government should go hand in hand with the\r\n    establishment of the monarchy. At first it is difficult to establish\r\n    and carry out a constitutional government, but once it is formed it\r\n    will be comparatively easy. When the constitutional government has\r\n    been established, the Emperor will have to seek his fame in such\r\n    useful things as the defence of his country and the conquest of his\r\n    enemy. Everything has to progress, and men possessing European\r\n    education will be made use of by the reigning family. The first\r\n    Emperor will certainly do all he can to capture the hearts of the\r\n    people by means of adopting and carrying out in letter as well as in\r\n    spirit constitutional government. The heir-apparent will pay\r\n    attention to all new reforms and new things. Should he do so, the\r\n    people will be able to console themselves by saying that they will\r\n    aways be the people of a constitutional monarchy even after the\r\n    succession to the throne of the heir-apparent. When the time comes\r\n    for the heir-apparent to mount the throne the people will extend to\r\n    him their cordial welcome, and there will be no need to worry about\r\n    internal disturbances.\r\n\r\n    Therefore, I conclude that the successor to the presidential chair\r\n    has to prevent chaos by wielding the monarchical power, while the\r\n    new emperor can avert internal disquietude forever by means of his\r\n    constitutional government. This is the fourth difference between the\r\n    republic and the monarchy. These four differences are accountable\r\n    for the fact that there will not be as much disturbance at the time\r\n    of the change of emperors as at the time when the president is\r\n    changed.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: I can understand what you have said with regard to the\r\n    advantages and disadvantages of the republic and the monarchy, but\r\n    there are many problems connected with the formation of a\r\n    constitutional monarchy which we have to solve. Why is it that the\r\n    attempt to introduce constitutional government during the last years\r\n    of the Manchu Dynasty proved a failure?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: The constitutional government of the Manchu Dynasty was one\r\n    in name only, and as such the forerunner of the revolution of 1911.\r\n    Towards the end of the Manchu Dynasty, the talk of starting a\r\n    revolution to overthrow the imperial régime was in everybody's\r\n    mouth, although the constitutional party endeavoured to accomplish\r\n    something really useful. At that time His Excellency Yuan Shih-kai\r\n    was the grand chancellor, and realizing the fact that nothing except\r\n    the adoption of a constitutional government could save the throne of\r\n    the Manchus, he assumed the leadership of the constitutional party,\r\n    which surpassed in strength the revolutionary party as a result of\r\n    his active support. The people's hearts completely turned to the\r\n    constitutional party for salvation, while the revolutionary party\r\n    lost that popular support which it had formerly enjoyed. Then it\r\n    seemed that the imperial household would soon adopt the\r\n    constitutional monarchy and the threatening revolution could be\r\n    averted. Unfortunately, the elaborate plans of His Excellency Yuan\r\n    Shih-kai regarding the adoption of the constitutional government\r\n    were not carried out by the imperial household. A great change took\r\n    place: His Excellency retired to his native province; and after\r\n    losing this powerful leader the constitutional party was pitilessly\r\n    shattered. A monarchist party suddenly made its appearance on the\r\n    political arena to assist the imperial family, which pretended to do\r\n    its very best for the development of a constitutional government,\r\n    but secretly exerted itself to the utmost for the possession and\r\n    retention of the real power. This double-dealing resulted in\r\n    bringing about the revolution of 1911. For instance, when the people\r\n    cried for the convening of a parliament, the imperial family said\r\n    \"No.\" The people also failed to secure the abolition of certain\r\n    official organs for the imperialists. They lost confidence in the\r\n    Reigning House, and simultaneously the revolutionary party raised\r\n    its banner and gathered its supporters from every part of the\r\n    country. As soon as the revolt started at Wuchang the troops all\r\n    over the country joined in the movement to overthrow the Manchu\r\n    Dynasty. The members of the Imperial Senate, most of whom were\r\n    members of the constitutional party, could not help showing their\r\n    sympathy with the revolutionists. At last the imperial household\r\n    issued a proclamation containing Nineteen Articles--a veritable\r\n    _magna charta_--but it was too late. The constitutional government\r\n    which was about to be formed was thus laid aside. What the imperial\r\n    family did was the mere organization of an advisory council. A\r\n    famous foreign scholar aptly remarked: \"A false constitutional\r\n    government will eventually result in a true revolution.\" In trying\r\n    to deceive the people by means of a false constitutional government\r\n    the imperial house encompassed its own destruction. Once His\r\n    Excellency Yuan Shih-kai stated in a memorial to the throne that\r\n    there were only two alternatives: to give the people a\r\n    constitutional government or to have them revolt. What happened\r\n    afterwards is a matter of common knowledge. Therefore I say that the\r\n    government which the imperial family attempted to form was not a\r\n    constitutional government.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: Thank you for your discussion of the attempt of the imperial\r\n    household to establish a constitutional government; but how about\r\n    the Provisional Constitution, the parliament and the cabinet in the\r\n    first and second years of the Republic? The parliament was then so\r\n    powerful that the government was absolutely at its mercy, thereby\r\n    disturbing the peaceful condition of the country. The people have\r\n    tasted much of the bitterness of constitutional government. Should\r\n    you mention the name of constitutional government again they would\r\n    be thoroughly frightened. Is that true?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: During the first and second years of the Republic, in my\r\n    many conversations with the members of the Kuo Ming Tang, I said\r\n    that the republic could not form an efficient method of control, and\r\n    that there would be an over centration of power through the adoption\r\n    of monarchical methods of ruling, knowing as well as I did the\r\n    standards of our people. When the members of the Kuo Ming Tang came\r\n    to draw up the Provisional Constitution they purposely took\r\n    precisely the opposite course of action and ignored my suggestion.\r\n    It may, however, be mentioned that the Provisional Constitution made\r\n    in Nanking was not so bad, but after the government was removed to\r\n    Peking, the Kuo Ming Tang people tied the hand and foot of the\r\n    government by means of the Cabinet System and other restrictions\r\n    with the intention of weakening the power of the central\r\n    administration in order that they might be able to start another\r\n    revolution. From the dissolution of the Nanking government to the\r\n    time of the second revolution they had this one object in view,\r\n    namely to weaken the power of the central administration so that\r\n    they could contend for the office of the president by raising\r\n    further internal troubles in China. Those members of the Kuo Ming\r\n    Tang who made the constitution know as well as I that China's\r\n    republic must be governed through a monarchical administration; and\r\n    therefore the unreasonable restrictions in the Provisional\r\n    Constitution were purposely inserted.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: What is the difference between the constitutional government\r\n    which you have proposed and the constitutional government which the\r\n    Manchu Dynasty intended to adopt?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: The difference lies in the proper method of procedure and in\r\n    honesty of purpose, which are imperative if constitutional\r\n    government expects to be successful.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: What do you mean by the proper method of procedure?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: The Provisional Constitution made in Nanking, which was\r\n    considered good, is not suitable for insertion in the future\r\n    constitution, should a constitutional monarchy be established. In\r\n    making a constitution for the future constitutional monarchy we have\r\n    to consult the constitutions of the monarchies of the world. They\r\n    can be divided into three classes which are represented by England,\r\n    Prussia and Japan. England is advanced in its constitutional\r\n    government, which has been in existence for thousands of years,\r\n    (_sic_) and is the best of all in the world. The English king enjoys\r\n    his empty title and the real power of the country is exercised by\r\n    the parliament, which makes all the laws for the nation. As to\r\n    Prussia, the constitutional monarchy was established when the people\r\n    started a revolution. The ruler of Prussia was compelled to convene\r\n    a parliament and submitted to that legal body a constitution.\r\n    Prussia's constitution was made by its ruler together with the\r\n    parliament. Its constitutional government is not so good as the\r\n    English. As to the Japanese constitutional monarchy, the Emperor\r\n    made a constitution and then convened a parliament. The\r\n    constitutional power of the Japanese people is still less than that\r\n    of the Prussian people. According to the standard of our people we\r\n    cannot adopt the English constitution as our model, for it is too\r\n    advanced. The best thing for us to do is to adopt part of the\r\n    Prussian and part of the Japanese in our constitution-making. As our\r\n    people are better educated now than ever before, it is decidedly\r\n    unwise entirely to adopt the Japanese method, that is, for the\r\n    Emperor to make a constitution without the approval of the\r\n    parliament and then to convoke a legislative body. In the\r\n    circumstances China should adopt the Prussian method as described\r\n    above with some modifications, which will be very suitable to our\r\n    conditions. As to the contents of the constitution we can copy such\r\n    articles as those providing the right for the issue of urgent orders\r\n    and appropriation of special funds, etc., from the Japanese\r\n    Constitution, so that the power of the ruler can be increased\r\n    without showing the slightest contempt for the legislative organ. I\r\n    consider that this is the proper method of procedure for the\r\n    formation of a constitutional monarchy for China.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: Can I know something about the contents of our future\r\n    constitution in advance?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: If you want to know them in detail I recommend you to read\r\n    the Constitutions of Prussia and Japan. But I can tell you this\r\n    much. Needless to say that such stipulations as articles\r\n    guaranteeing the rights of the people and the power of the\r\n    parliament will surely be worked into the future constitution. These\r\n    are found in almost every constitution in the world. But as the\r\n    former Provisional Constitution has so provided that the power of\r\n    the parliament is unlimited, while that of the president is very\r\n    small, the Chief Executive, besides conferring decorations and\r\n    giving Orders of Merit, having almost nothing to do without the\r\n    approval of the Senate, it is certain that nothing will be taken\r\n    from that instrument for the future constitution. Nor will the\r\n    makers of the future constitution take anything from the nineteen\r\n    capitulations offered by the Manchu Government, which gave too much\r\n    power to the legislative organ. According to the Nineteen Articles\r\n    the Advisory Council was to draw up the constitution, which was to\r\n    be ratified by the parliament; the Premier being elected by the\r\n    parliament; whilst the use of the army and navy required the\r\n    parliament's sanction; the making of treaties with foreign countries\r\n    have likewise to be approved by the parliament, etc., etc. Such\r\n    strict stipulations which are not even known in such an advanced\r\n    country in matters constitutional as England were extorted from the\r\n    imperial family by the advisory council. Therefore it is most\r\n    unlikely that the makers of the future constitution will take any\r\n    article from the nineteen capitulations of \"confidence.\" They will\r\n    use the Constitutions of Japan and Prussia as joint model and will\r\n    always have in their mind the actual conditions of this country and\r\n    the standard of the people. In short, they will copy some of the\r\n    articles in the Japanese constitution, and adopt the Prussian method\r\n    of procedure for the making of the constitution.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: What do you mean by honesty?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hu: It is a bad policy to deceive the people. Individually the\r\n    people are simple, but they cannot be deceived collectively. The\r\n    Manchu Government committed an irretrievable mistake by promising\r\n    the people a constitutional government but never carrying out their\r\n    promise. This attitude on the part of the then reigning house\r\n    brought about the first revolution. As the standard of our people at\r\n    the present time is not very high, they will be satisfied with less\r\n    power if it is properly given to them. Should any one attempt to\r\n    deceive them his cause will finally be lost. I do not know how much\r\n    power the people and the parliament will get in the constitutional\r\n    monarchy, but I would like to point out here that it is better to\r\n    give them less power than to deceive them. If they are given less\r\n    power, and if they want more, they will contend for it. Should the\r\n    government deem it advisable to give them a little more, well and\r\n    good. Should they be unfit for the possession of greater power, the\r\n    government can issue a proclamation giving the reasons for not\r\n    complying with their request, and they will not raise trouble\r\n    knowing the true intention of the government. However, honesty is\r\n    the most important element in the creation of a constitutional\r\n    monarchy. It is easy and simple to practise it. The parliament must\r\n    have the power to decide the laws and fix the budgets. Should its\r\n    decision be too idealistic or contrary to the real welfare of the\r\n    country, the Government can explain its faults and request it to\r\n    reconsider its decision. Should the parliament return the same\r\n    decision, the Government can dissolve it and convoke another\r\n    parliament. In so doing the Government respects the parliament\r\n    instead of despising it. But what the parliament has decided should\r\n    be carried out strictly by the Government, and thus we will have a\r\n    real constitutional Government. It is easy to talk but difficult to\r\n    act, but China like all other countries has to go through the\r\n    experimental stage and face all kinds of difficulties before a\r\n    genuine constitutional government can be evolved. The beginning is\r\n    difficult but once the difficulty is over everything will go on\r\n    smoothly. I emphasize that it is better to give the people less\r\n    power at the beginning than to deceive them. Be honest with them is\r\n    my policy.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko: I thank you very much for what you have said. Your\r\n    discussion is interesting and I can understand it well. The proper\r\n    method of procedure and honesty of purpose which you have mentioned\r\n    will tend to wipe out all former corruption.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ko, or the stranger, then departed.\r\n\r\nOn this note the pamphleteer abruptly ends. Having discussed _ad\r\nnauseam_ the inadequacy of all existing arrangements, even those made by\r\nYuan Shih-kai himself, to secure a peaceful succession to the\r\npresidency; and having again insisted upon the evil part soldiery cannot\r\nfail to play, he introduces a new peril, the certainty that the foreign\r\nPowers will set up a puppet Emperor unless China solves this problem\r\nherself, the case of Korea being invoked as an example of the fate of\r\ndivided nations. Fear of Japan and the precedent of Korea, being\r\nfamiliar phenomena, are given a capital position in all this debate,\r\nbeing secondary only to the crucial business of ensuring the peaceful\r\nsuccession to the supreme office. The transparent manner in which the\r\nhistory of the first three years of the Republic is handled in order to\r\ndrive home these arguments will be very apparent. A fit crown is put on\r\nthe whole business by the final suggestion that the Constitutional\r\nGovernment of China under the new empire must be a mixture of the\r\nPrussian and Japanese systems, Yang Tu's last words being that it is\r\nbest to be honest with the people!\r\n\r\nNo more damning indictment of Yuan Shih-kai's régime could possibly have\r\nbeen penned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE MONARCHY PLOT\r\n\r\nTHE MEMORANDUM OF DR. GOODNOW\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this extraordinary pamphlet was soon accepted by Chinese\r\nsociety as a semi-official warning of what was coming, it alone was not\r\nsufficient to launch a movement which to be successful required the\r\nbenign endorsement of foreign opinion. The Chinese pamphleteer had dealt\r\nwith the emotional side of the case: it was necessary to reinforce his\r\narguments with an appeal which would be understood by Western statesmen\r\nas well as by Eastern politicians. Yuan Shih-kai, still pretending to\r\nstand aside, had kept his attention concentrated on this very essential\r\nmatter; for, as we have repeatedly pointed out, he never failed to\r\nunderstand the superlative value of foreign support in all his\r\nenterprises,--that support being given an exaggerated value by the\r\npublic thanks to China's reliance on foreign money. Accordingly, as if\r\nstill unconvinced, he now very naïvely requested the opinion of his\r\nchief legal adviser, Dr. Goodnow, an American who had been appointed to\r\nhis office through the instrumentality of the Board of the Carnegie\r\nInstitute as a most competent authority on Administrative Law.\r\n\r\nEven in this most serious matter the element of comedy was not lacking.\r\nDr. Goodnow had by special arrangement returned to Peking at the\r\npsychological moment; for having kicked his heels during many weary\r\nmonths in the capital, he had been permitted in 1914 to take up the\r\nappointment of President of an American University on condition that he\r\nwould be available for legal \"advice\" whenever wanted. The Summer\r\nvacation gave him the opportunity of revisiting in the capacity of a\r\ntransient adviser the scenes of his former idleness; and the\r\nholiday-task set him by his large-hearted patron was to prove in as few\r\nfolios as possible that China ought to be a Monarchy and not a\r\nRepublic--a theme on which every schoolboy could no doubt write with\r\nfluency. Consequently Dr. Goodnow, arming himself with a limited amount\r\nof paper and ink, produced in very few days the Memorandum which\r\nfollows,--a document which it is difficult to speak of dispassionately\r\nsince it seems to have been deliberately designed to play into the hands\r\nof a man who was now openly set on betraying the trust the nation\r\nreposed in him, and who was ready to wade through rivers of blood to\r\nsatisfy his insensate ambition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: President Li Yuan-Hung and the General Staff watching the\r\nReview.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: March-past of an Infantry Division.]\r\n\r\nNothing precisely similar to this Goodnow Memorandum has ever been seen\r\nbefore in the history of Asia: it was the ultramodern spirit impressed\r\ninto the service of mediaeval minds. In any other capital of the world\r\nthe publication of such a subversive document, following the Yang Tu\r\npamphlet, would have led to riot and tumult. In China, the home of\r\npacifism, the politicians and people bowed their heads and bided their\r\ntime. Even foreign circles in China were somewhat nonplussed by the\r\ninsouciance displayed by the peripatetic legal authority; and the\r\nMemorandum was for many days spoken of as an unnecessary\r\nindiscretion.[16] Fastening at once on the point to which Yang Tu had\r\nascribed such importance--the question of succession--Dr. Goodnow in his\r\narguments certainly shows a detachment from received principles which\r\nhas an old-world flavour about it, and which has damned him for ever in\r\nthe eyes of the rising generation in China. The version which follows is\r\nthe translation of the Chinese translation, the original English\r\nMemorandum having been either mislaid or destroyed; and it is best that\r\nthis argument should be carefully digested before we add our comments.\r\n\r\n    DR. GOODNOW'S MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n    A country must have a certain form of government, and usually the\r\n    particular form of government of a particular country is not the\r\n    result of the choice of the people of that country. There is not any\r\n    possibility even for the most intellectual to exercise any mental\r\n    influence over the question. Whether it be a monarchy or republic,\r\n    it cannot be the creation of human power except when it is suitable\r\n    to the historical, habitual, social and financial conditions of that\r\n    country. If an unsuitable form of government is decided upon, it may\r\n    remain for a short while, but eventually a system better suited will\r\n    take its place.\r\n\r\n    In short, the form of government of a country is usually the natural\r\n    and only result of its circumstances. The reasons for such an\r\n    outcome are many, but the principal one is Force. If we study the\r\n    monarchical countries we will find that usually a dynasty is created\r\n    by a person who is capable of controlling the force of the entire\r\n    country and overthrowing other persons opposed to him, working\r\n    towards his goal with an undaunted spirit. If this man is capable of\r\n    ruling the nation and if he is a rare genius of the day, and the\r\n    conditions of the country are suited for a monarchical government,\r\n    he as a rule creates a new dynasty and his descendants inherit the\r\n    same from generation to generation.\r\n\r\n    If this is so, then the solution of a difficult position of a\r\n    country is to be found in a monarchy rather than a republic. For on\r\n    the death of a monarch no doubt exists as to who shall succeed him,\r\n    and there is no need of an election or other procedure. Englishmen\r\n    say, \"The King is dead, Long live the King.\" This expresses the\r\n    point. But in order to attain this point it is necessary that the\r\n    law of succession be definitely defined and publicly approved;\r\n    otherwise there will not be lacking, on the death of the monarch,\r\n    men aspiring to the throne; and as no one is qualified to settle the\r\n    dispute for power, internal disturbance will be the result.\r\n\r\n    Historically speaking no law of succession is so permanently\r\n    satisfactory as that used by the nations of Europe. According to\r\n    this system the right of succession belongs to the eldest son of the\r\n    monarch, or failing him, the nearest and eldest male relative. The\r\n    right of succession, however, may be voluntarily surrendered by the\r\n    rightful successor if he so desires; thus if the eldest son declines\r\n    to succeed to the throne the second son takes his place. This is the\r\n    rule of Europe.\r\n\r\n    If instead of this law of a succession a system is adopted by which\r\n    the successor is chosen by the monarch from among his sons or\r\n    relatives without any provision being made for the rights of the\r\n    eldest son, disturbance will be the inevitable result. There will\r\n    not be a few who would like to take possession of the throne and\r\n    they will certainly plot in the very confines of the palace,\r\n    resulting in an increase of the sufferings of an aged monarch; and,\r\n    even if the disaster of civil war be avoided, much dispute will\r\n    arise owing to the uncertainty of the successor--a dangerous\r\n    situation indeed.\r\n\r\n    Such is the lesson we learn from history. The conclusion is,\r\n    speaking from the viewpoint of the problem of transmission of power,\r\n    that the superiority of the monarchical system over the republican\r\n    system is seen in the law of succession,--that is the eldest son of\r\n    the ruler should succeed to the throne.\r\n\r\n    Leaving out the nations of ancient times, the majority of countries\r\n    in Europe and Asia have adopted the monarchical system. There are,\r\n    however, exceptions such as _Wen-ni-shih_ (Venice) and Switzerland,\r\n    which adopted the republican form of government; but they are in the\r\n    minority while most of the great nations of the world have adopted\r\n    the monarchical form of government.\r\n\r\n    During the recent century and a half the attitude of Europe has\r\n    undergone a sudden change and the general tendency is to discredit\r\n    monarchism and adopt republicanism. The one great European power\r\n    which first attempted to make a trial of republicanism is Great\r\n    Britain. In the Seventeenth Century a revolution broke out in\r\n    England and King Charles I. was condemned to death by Parliament and\r\n    executed as a traitor to the nation. A republic was established and\r\n    the administration was called republican with Cromwell as regent,\r\n    _i.e._ President. Cromwell was able to control the power of\r\n    government because at the head of the revolutionary army he defeated\r\n    the King. This English republic, however, only existed for a few\r\n    years and was finally defeated in turn. The reason was that the\r\n    problem of succession after the death of Cromwell was difficult to\r\n    solve. Cromwell had a desire to place his son in his place as regent\r\n    after his death, but as the English people were then unsuited for a\r\n    republic and his son had not the ability to act as chief executive,\r\n    the republic of England suddenly disappeared. The British people\r\n    then abandoned the republican system and readopted the monarchical\r\n    system. Thus Charles II., the son of Charles I., was made King not\r\n    only with the support of the army but also with the general consent\r\n    of the country.\r\n\r\n    The second European race which attempted to have a republic was the\r\n    American. In the Eighteenth Century the United States of America was\r\n    established in consequence of the success of a revolution. But the\r\n    American revolution was not at first intended to overthrow the\r\n    monarchy. What it sought to do was to throw off the yoke of the\r\n    monarchy and become independent. The revolution, however, succeeded\r\n    and the circumstances were such that there was no other alternative\r\n    but to have a republic: for there was no royal or Imperial\r\n    descendant to shoulder the responsibilities of the state. Another\r\n    factor was the influence of the advocates of republicanism who came\r\n    to America in the previous century from England and saturated the\r\n    minds of the Americans with the ideas of republicanism. The minds of\r\n    the American people were so imbued with the ideas of republicanism\r\n    that a republican form of government was the ideal of the entire\r\n    race. Had General Washington--the leader of the revolutionary\r\n    army--had the desire to become a monarch himself he would probably\r\n    have been successful. But Washington's one aim was to respect\r\n    republicanism and he had no aspiration to become King. Besides he\r\n    had no son capable of succeeding him on the throne. Consequently on\r\n    the day independence was won, the republican form of government was\r\n    adopted without hesitation, and it has survived over a hundred\r\n    years.\r\n\r\n    There is no need to ask whether the result of the establishment of\r\n    the American Republic has been good or bad. The republican form of\r\n    government is really the making of the United States of America.\r\n    But it should be remembered that long before the establishment of\r\n    the republic, the American people had already learned the good laws\r\n    and ordinances of England, and the constitution and parliamentary\r\n    system of England had been long in use in America for over a hundred\r\n    years. Therefore the change in 1789 from a colony into a Republic\r\n    was not a sudden change from a monarchy to a republic. Thorough\r\n    preparations had been made and self-government was well practiced\r\n    before the establishment of the republic. Not only this, but the\r\n    intellectual standard of the American people was then already very\r\n    high; for ever since the beginning of American history attention was\r\n    given to universal education. No youth could be found who could not\r\n    read, and the extent of education can thus be gauged.\r\n\r\n    Soon after the formation of the American Republic, the French\r\n    Republic followed in her footsteps. Now in France a monarchical\r\n    government was in existence before the declaration of independence,\r\n    and the supreme power of administration was in the hands of the\r\n    King. The people, having never participated in the administration\r\n    and lacking experience in self-government, made a poor experiment of\r\n    the republican system which they suddenly set up. The result was\r\n    that for many years disorder reigned, and the tyranny of the\r\n    military governments held sway one after another. After the defeat\r\n    of Napoleon, the monarchical system was restored as a result of the\r\n    intervention of other Powers. The second revolution in 1830 again\r\n    resulted in the restoration of the monarchy but the power of the\r\n    common people was considerably increased. The monarchy was again\r\n    overthrown in 1848 and a Republic formed in its stead--the nephew of\r\n    Napoleon was then made President. This President, however, once more\r\n    discarded republicanism and set up a monarchy for himself. It was\r\n    not until after the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 that Napoleon III.\r\n    was overthrown and the final Republic established which has lived\r\n    for half a century now, there being every likelihood of its\r\n    continuing in its present form.\r\n\r\n    Indeed the Republic of France has every prospect of being permanent,\r\n    but the permanency is only the result of a hundred years' political\r\n    revolution. For a hundred years the foundations were being laid by\r\n    means of an energetic and persistent campaign of education, which\r\n    increased the political knowledge of the people. The people were\r\n    also allowed to participate in political affairs, and so gained\r\n    experience in self-government. This is why the French Republic is a\r\n    success. Then in France and America they have found a solution for\r\n    the difficult problem of the nation, that is the problem of\r\n    succession of the government in power. The President of France is\r\n    elected by the Parliament while the President of America is elected\r\n    by the people. The people of these two countries are all experienced\r\n    in self-government as a result of participation in political\r\n    affairs. Furthermore, for the last fifty years these two countries\r\n    have all laid emphasis on universal education by having an extensive\r\n    system of schools, subsidized by the Government. The intellectual\r\n    standard of these two peoples is therefore fairly high.\r\n\r\n    As a result of the examples set up by France and America, at the\r\n    end of the Eighteenth Century the Spanish colonies in Central and\r\n    South America also declared their independence one after the other.\r\n    The conditions then prevailing in those countries were somewhat\r\n    similar to those of America. When their independence was declared,\r\n    it seemed that the republican system was best suited to their\r\n    condition. For on the one hand there was no imperial house to direct\r\n    the people, on the other hand the Republic of North America was a\r\n    good example to follow. Public opinion was at that time unanimous\r\n    that since the republican form of government was the ideal form, it\r\n    was suitable for any country and any people. The idea thus quickly\r\n    spread and almost every country became a republic. The independence\r\n    of these countries, however, was secured only at the cost of a hard\r\n    struggle and once the spirit of rebellion was aroused it became\r\n    difficult to suppress in a short while. And since education was not\r\n    then universal the intellect of the people was low. What they were\r\n    expert in was in autocratic methods. No task is harder than to\r\n    establish a republic in a country, the intelligence of whose people\r\n    is low. These republics, therefore, reaped no good results although\r\n    they tried to retain republicanism unnaturally. The consequence is\r\n    that the republics of Central and South America have been a living\r\n    drama of continuous internal disturbance. One after another their\r\n    military leaders have grasped the power of administration.\r\n    Occasionally there has been peace but this peace has only been\r\n    secured by the iron hand of one or two powerful men holding the\r\n    power. Such powerful men, however, seldom pay any attention to\r\n    educational matters, and one never hears of their establishing any\r\n    schools. As to the people under them, they are not allowed to\r\n    participate in political affairs by which their experience in\r\n    politics may be ripened. The result is, on the man in power becoming\r\n    sick or dying--and the iron rule relaxed--that those who wish to\r\n    usurp the power of the state rise at once; and as the satisfactory\r\n    solution of the problem of succession cannot be found, those\r\n    undertakings which have made progress during the time of peace are\r\n    swept away without a single exception. In extreme cases the\r\n    disturbances continue to such an extent that the country falls into\r\n    a state of anarchy. Thus the social and financial factors of the\r\n    whole country are trodden on and destroyed under foot.\r\n\r\n    The conditions now prevailing in Mexico have been many times\r\n    duplicated in other republics in Central and South America. For this\r\n    can be the only result from adopting the republican form of\r\n    government where the political and financial conditions are\r\n    unsuited. Diaz, a military leader, once held the power of state in\r\n    his own hand, and when he became the President of Mexico it looked\r\n    as if the political problem was solved thereby. Diaz, however, did\r\n    not push education but instead oppressed the people and did not\r\n    allow them to participate in politics. When he was advanced in age\r\n    and his influence decreased, he lost entire control once the banner\r\n    of rebellion was raised. Ever since the overthrow of Diaz, military\r\n    leaders of that country have been fighting one another and the\r\n    disturbance is developing even to-day. In the present circumstances\r\n    there is no other means to solve the political problem of Mexico\r\n    except by intervention from abroad. (_Sic._)\r\n\r\n    Among the republics of Central and South America, however, there are\r\n    some which have made fairly good progress, the most prominent of\r\n    which are Argentina, Chili, and Peru. For some time there was\r\n    disorder in the first two republics immediately after the adoption\r\n    of the republican system, but later peace was gradually restored and\r\n    the people have been enjoying peace. As regards Peru, although some\r\n    disturbances have occurred since the establishment of the republican\r\n    government, the life of the Republic as a whole has been peaceful.\r\n    All of these three countries, however, developed constitutional\r\n    government with the utmost vigour. Even as far back as in the\r\n    earlier part of the Nineteenth Century Argentina and Chili were\r\n    already endeavouring to excel each other in their progress, and as\r\n    for Peru, its people were encouraged even while under the Imperial\r\n    régime, to participate in political affairs. The success of these\r\n    three republics is, therefore, not a mere chance happening.\r\n\r\n    The study of the experiences of these republics of Central and South\r\n    America and the history of France and the United States brings\r\n    forward two points which we should carefully consider:--\r\n\r\n    1. In order to make a satisfactory solution of the problem of\r\n    succession to the chief executive in a republican country, it is\r\n    necessary that the country be in possession of an extensive system\r\n    of schools; that the intellect of its people has been brought up to\r\n    a high standard by means of a patient process of universal\r\n    education; and that they be given a chance to participate in\r\n    political affairs for the purpose of gaining the needed experience,\r\n    before the republican form can be adopted without harm;\r\n\r\n    2. It is certain that the adoption of a republican form of\r\n    government in a country where the people are low in intellect and\r\n    lack experience and knowledge in political affairs, will not yield\r\n    any good result. For as the position of the President is not\r\n    hereditary, and consequently the problem of succession cannot be\r\n    satisfactorily solved, the result will be a military dictatorship.\r\n    It might be possible to have a short-lived peace but such a period\r\n    of peace is usually intermingled with periods of disturbances,\r\n    during which the unduly ambitious people may rise and struggle with\r\n    each other for the control of power, and the disaster which will\r\n    follow will be irremediable.\r\n\r\n    This is not all. The present tendency is that the European and other\r\n    western Powers will not tolerate the existence of a military\r\n    government in the world; for experience shows that the result of\r\n    military government is anarchy. Now this is of vital importance to\r\n    the interests of the European Powers. Since their financial\r\n    influence has extended so far, their capital as well as their\r\n    commercial undertakings of all branches and sorts have reached every\r\n    corner of the world, they will not hesitate to express their views\r\n    for the sake of peace, as to the system of government a country\r\n    should adopt, although they have no right to interfere with the\r\n    adoption of a form of government by another nation. For unless this\r\n    is done they cannot hope to get the due profit on the capital they\r\n    have invested. If this view is carried to the extreme, the political\r\n    independence of a nation may be interfered with or even the\r\n    Government may be replaced with some other organ. If such steps are\r\n    necessary to attain their views the Powers will not scruple to take\r\n    them. Therefore no nation will be allowed hereafter to choose its\r\n    own form of government if that results in constant revolution, as in\r\n    the case of South America in the last century. The Governments of\r\n    the future should, therefore, carefully consider the system to be\r\n    adopted for the maintenance of peace; otherwise control by\r\n    foreigners will be unavoidable.\r\n\r\n    We will now proceed to consider what significance these points\r\n    reviewed above have for the political conditions of China. China,\r\n    owing to the folly of an absolute monarchical system, has neglected\r\n    the education of the masses, whose intellectual attainments have\r\n    been consequently of a low standard. Then, there is the additional\r\n    fact that the people have never had a voice in the doings of their\r\n    government. Therefore they have not the ability to discuss politics.\r\n    Four years ago the absolute monarchy was suddenly changed into a\r\n    Republic. This movement was all too sudden to expect good results.\r\n    If the Manchus had not been an alien race, which the country wished\r\n    to overthrow, the best step which could then have been adopted was\r\n    to retain the Emperor and gradually lead him to a constitutional\r\n    government. What the Commissioners on Constitutional Government\r\n    suggested was quite practical if carried out gradually until\r\n    perfection was reached. Unfortunately the feeling of alien control\r\n    was bitter to the people and the maintenance of the throne was an\r\n    utter impossibility. Thus the monarchy was overthrown and the\r\n    adoption of a republican system was the only alternative.\r\n\r\n    Thus we see that China has during the last few years been\r\n    progressing in constitutional government. The pioneering stage of\r\n    the process was, however, not ideal. The results could have been\r\n    much better if a person of royal blood, respected by the people, had\r\n    come out and offered his service. Under the present conditions China\r\n    has not yet solved the problem of the succession to the Presidency.\r\n    What provisions we have now are not perfect. If the President should\r\n    one day give up his power the difficulties experienced by other\r\n    nations will manifest themselves again in China. The conditions in\r\n    other countries are similar to those obtaining in China and the\r\n    dangers are also the same. It is quite within the bounds of\r\n    possibility that the situation might threaten China's independence\r\n    if internal disturbance should occur in connection with this problem\r\n    and not be immediately put down.\r\n\r\n    What attitude then should those who have the good of the nation at\r\n    heart, take under the present circumstances? Should they advocate\r\n    the continuance of the Republic or suggest a change for a monarchy?\r\n    It is difficult to answer these questions. But I have no doubt in\r\n    saying that the monarchical system is better suited to China than\r\n    the republican system. For, if China's independence is to be\r\n    maintained, the government should be constitutional, and in\r\n    consideration of China's conditions as well as her relations with\r\n    other Powers, it will be easier to form a constitutional government\r\n    by adopting a monarchy than a Republic.\r\n\r\n    However, it must be remembered that in order to secure the best\r\n    results from changing the Republic into a Monarchy not a single one\r\n    of the following points can be dispensed with:\r\n\r\n    1. Such a change must not arouse the opposition of the Chinese\r\n    people or the Foreign Powers, which will cause the disturbances so\r\n    energetically suppressed by the Republican Government to appear\r\n    again in China. For the peace now prevailing in the country should\r\n    be maintained at any price so that no danger may come therefrom.\r\n\r\n    2. If the law of succession be not definitely defined in such a way\r\n    that it will leave no doubts as to the proper successor, no good can\r\n    come from the change from Republic to Monarchy. I have said enough\r\n    about the necessity of not allowing the monarch to choose his own\r\n    successor. Although the power of an Emperor is greater than that of\r\n    a President, when the majority of the people know nothing, it is\r\n    more respected by the people. But the reason for such a change will\r\n    not be valid if the change is brought about merely to add to the\r\n    power of the chief executive without the question of succession\r\n    being definitely settled. For the definiteness about succession is\r\n    the most prominent point of superiority of the monarchical system\r\n    over the republican system.\r\n\r\n    3 If the Government should fail to make provisions for the\r\n    development of the constitutional government, no permanent benefit\r\n    will result from the change of a republic into a monarchy. For if\r\n    China wishes to occupy a suitable place among the world powers, the\r\n    patriotism of her people must be made to grow so that the government\r\n    will be more than strong enough to cope with outside aggression. The\r\n    patriotism of the people will not grow if they are not allowed to\r\n    participate in political affairs, and without the hearty assistance\r\n    of the people no government can become strong. For the reason why\r\n    the people will assist the government is because they feel they are\r\n    a part of the government. Therefore the government should make the\r\n    people realize that the government is the organ which aims at\r\n    bringing blessing to the people, and make the people understand that\r\n    they have the right to superintend the government before the\r\n    government can achieve great things.\r\n\r\n    Every one of the points mentioned above are indispensable for the\r\n    change of the Republic into a monarchy. Whether the necessary\r\n    conditions are present must be left to those who know China well and\r\n    are responsible for her future progress. If these conditions are all\r\n    present then I have no doubt that the change of the form of the\r\n    government will be for the benefit of China.\r\n\r\nThe first illuminating point, as we have already said, to leap up and\r\nlock attention to the exclusion of everything else in this memorandum,\r\nis that the chief difficulty which perplexes Dr. Goodnow is not the\r\nconsolidation of a new government which had been recognized by all the\r\nTreaty Powers only two years previously but the question of _succession_\r\nto the supreme office in the land, a point which had already been fully\r\nprovided for in the one chapter of the Permanent Constitution which had\r\nbeen legally passed prior to the _Coup d'état_ of the 4th November,\r\n1913. But Yuan Shih-kai's first care after that _coup d'état_ had been\r\nto promulgate with the assistance of Dr. Goodnow and others, a bogus\r\nLaw, resting on no other sanction than his personal volition, with an\r\nelaborate flummery about three candidates whose names were to be\r\ndeposited in the gold box in the Stone House in the gardens of the\r\nPalace. Therefore since the provisional nature of this prestidigitation\r\nhad always been clear, the learned doctor's only solution is to\r\nrecommend the overthrow of the government; the restoration of the Empire\r\nunder the name of Constitutional Monarchy; and, by means of a fresh plot\r\nto do in China what all Europe has long been on the point of abandoning,\r\nnamely, to substitute Family rule for National rule.\r\n\r\nNow had these suggestions been gravely made in any country but China by\r\na person officially employed it is difficult to know what would have\r\nhappened. Even in China had an Englishman published or caused to be\r\npublished--especially after the repeated statements Yuan Shih-kai had\r\ngiven out that any attempt to force the sceptre on him would cause him\r\nto leave the country and end his days abroad[17]--that Englishman, we\r\nsay, would have been liable under the Orders in Council to summary\r\nimprisonment, the possibility of tumult and widespread internal\r\ndisturbances being sufficient to force a British Court to take action.\r\nWhat are the forces which brought an American to say things which an\r\nEnglishman would not dare to say--that in 1915 there was a sanction for\r\na fresh revolutionary movement in China? First, an interpretation of\r\nhistory so superficial, combined with such an amazing suppression of\r\ncontemporary political thought, that it is difficult to believe that the\r\nrequirements of the country were taken in the least bit seriously;\r\nsecondly, in the comparisons made between China and the Latin republics,\r\na deliberate scouting of the all-important racial factor; and, lastly, a\r\ntotal ignorance of the intellectual qualities which are by far the most\r\noutstanding feature of Chinese civilization.\r\n\r\nDr. Goodnow's method is simplicity itself. In order to prove the\r\nsuperiority of Monarchism over Republicanism--and thus deliberately\r\nignoring the moral of the present cataclysmic war--he ransacks the\r\ndust-laden centuries. The English Commonwealth, which disappeared nearly\r\nthree hundred years ago, is brought forward as an example of the dangers\r\nwhich beset a republic, though it is difficult to see what relation an\r\nexperiment made before the idea of representative government had been\r\neven understood bears to our times. But there is worse. The statement is\r\ndeliberately made that the reason for the disappearance of that\r\nCommonwealth was \"that the problem of succession after the death of\r\nCromwell was difficult to solve.\" English historians would no doubt have\r\nnumerous remarks to offer on this strange untruth which dismisses a\r\nremarkably interesting chapter of history in the most misleading way,\r\nand which tells Chinese political students nothing about the complete\r\nfailure which military government--not republicanism--must always have\r\namong the Anglo-Saxon peoples and which is the sole reason why\r\nCromwellism disappeared. Even when treating the history of his own\r\ncountry Dr. Goodnow seems to take pleasure in being absurd. For he says:\r\n\"The mind of the American people was so imbued with the idea of\r\nrepublicanism that a republican form of government was the ideal of the\r\nwhole race\"; then adding as if to refute his own statements, \"Had\r\nGeneral Washington--the leader of the revolutionary army--had the desire\r\nto become a monarch he would probably have been successful.\" We do not\r\nknow how Americans will like this kind of interpretation of their\r\nhistory; but at least they will not fail to note what dismal results it\r\nhastened on in China. With the experimental Eighteenth Century French\r\nRepublic; with the old Spanish Colonies of Central and South America;\r\nand above all with Mexico, Dr. Goodnow deals in the same vein. Vast\r\nmovements, which can be handled only tentatively even in exhaustive\r\nessays are dismissed in misleading sentences framed so as to serve as\r\nmere introduction to the inevitable climax--the Chinese Constitutional\r\nMonarchy of 1915 with Yuan Shih-kai as Emperor.\r\n\r\nYet this is not all. As if in alarm at the very conclusions he so\r\npurposely reaches, at the end of his Memorandum he reduces these\r\nconclusions to naught by stating that three impossible conditions are\r\nnecessary to consummate the Restoration of the Monarchy in China, (1) no\r\nopposition should be aroused, (2) the law of succession must be properly\r\nsettled, (3) Full provision must be made for the development of\r\nConstitutional Government. That these conditions were known to be\r\nimpossible, everyone in the Far East had long admitted. Had Dr. Goodnow\r\npaid the slightest attention to the course of history in China he would\r\nhave known (a) that any usurpation of the Throne would infallibly lead\r\nto rebellion in China and intervention on the part of Japan, (b) that\r\nYuan Shih-kai's power was purely personal and as such could not be\r\ntransmitted to any son by any means known to the human intellect, (c)\r\nthat all Yuan Shih-kai's sons were worthless, the eldest son being\r\nsemi-paralyzed, (d) that constitutional government and the Eastern\r\nconception of kingship, which is purely theocratic, are so antithetical\r\nthat they cannot possibly co-exist, any re-establishment of the throne\r\nbeing _ipso facto_ the re-establishment of a theocracy, (e) that\r\nalthough he so constantly speaks of the low political knowledge of the\r\npeople, the Chinese have had a most complete form of local\r\nself-government from the earliest times, the political problem of the\r\nday being simply to gather up and express these local forms in some\r\ncentralized system: (f) the so-called non-patriotism of the Chinese is\r\nnon-existent and is an idea which has been spread abroad owing to the\r\ncomplete foreign misunderstanding of certain basic facts--for instance\r\nthat under the Empire foreign affairs were the sole concern of the\r\nEmperors, provincial China prior to 1911 being a socio-economic\r\nconfederation resembling mediaeval contrivances such as the Hanseatic\r\nLeague--a provincial confederation not concerning itself with any matter\r\nwhich lay outside its everyday economic life, such as territorial\r\noverlordship or frontier questions or the regulation of sea-port\r\nintercourse etc., because such matters were meaningless. It was only\r\nwhen foreign encroachment in the _post_-Japanese war period (_i.e._\r\nafter 1895) carried problems from the fringes of the Empire into the\r\neconomic life of the people that their pride was touched and that in\r\nspite of \"their lack of experience and knowledge in political affairs\"\r\nthey suddenly displayed a remarkable patriotic feeling, the history of\r\nChina during the past two decades being only comprehensible when this\r\ncapital contention, namely the reality of Chinese patriotism, is given\r\nthe central place.\r\n\r\nIt is useless, however, to pursue the subject: we have said enough to\r\ndisclose the utter levity of those who should have realized from the\r\nfirst that the New China is a matter of life and death to the people,\r\nand that the first business of the foreigner is to uphold the new\r\nbeliefs. The Goodnow Memorandum, immediately it was published, was put\r\nto precisely those base uses which any one with an elementary knowledge\r\nof China might have foreseen: it was simply exploited in an unscrupulous\r\nway, its recommendations being carried out in such a manner as to\r\nincrease one's contempt for the men who were pushing the monarchist plot\r\nwith any means that they could seize hold of, and who were not averse\r\nfrom making responsible foreigners their tools.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] It is perhaps of importance to note that Dr. Goodnow carried out\r\nall his studies in Germany.\r\n\r\n[17] The most widely-quoted statement on this subject is the remarkable\r\ninterview, published in the first week of July, 1915, throughout the\r\nmetropolitan press, between President Yuan Shih-kai and General Feng\r\nKuo-chang, commanding the forces on the lower Yangtsze. This statement\r\nwas telegraphed by foreign correspondents all over the world. Referring\r\nto the many rumours afloat that titles of nobility would be revived as a\r\nprecursor to the monarchy the President declared that even if he seized\r\nthe Throne that would not increase his powers, whilst as for\r\ntransmitting the Imperial Yellow to his sons none were fitted for that\r\nhonour which would mean the collapse of any new dynasty. Here General\r\nFeng Kuo-chang interrupted with the remark that the people of South\r\nChina would not oppose such a change ultimately, though they thought it\r\nwas too early to talk about it just now. Thereupon the President's\r\nfeatures became stern and he declared in a heightened voice: \"You and\r\nothers seem still to believe that I harbour secret ambitions. I affirm\r\npositively that when I sent my sons to study in England, I privately\r\nordered the purchase of a small estate there as a possible home. If the\r\npeople of China insist upon my accepting the sceptre I shall leave this\r\ncountry and spend the remaining days of my life abroad.\" This interview,\r\nso far from being denied, has been affirmed to the present writer as\r\nbeing substantially correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE MONARCHY MOVEMENT IS OPPOSED\r\n\r\nTHE APPEAL OF THE SCHOLAR LIANG CH'I-CHAO\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already referred in several places to the extraordinary rôle\r\nscholarship and the literary appeal play in the governance of China. It\r\nis necessary to go back to the times of the birth of the Roman Empire,\r\nand to invoke the great figure of Cicero, to understand how greatly the\r\nvoice of men of recognized intellectual qualities influences the nation.\r\nLiang Ch'i-chao, a man of some forty-five years, had long been\r\ndistinguished for his literary attainments and for the skill with which,\r\nthough unversed in any Western language, he had expounded the European\r\ntheory and practice of government to his fellow-countrymen. To his brain\r\nis due the coining of many exact expressions necessary for parliamentary\r\ngovernment, his mentality having grown with the modern growth of China\r\nand adapted itself rather marvellously to the requirements of the\r\nTwentieth Century. A reformer of 1898--that is one of the small devoted\r\nband of men who under Kang Yu Wei almost succeeded in winning over the\r\nill-fated Emperor Kwang Hsu to carrying out a policy of modernizing the\r\ncountry in the teeth of fierce mandarin opposition, he possessed in his\r\narmoury every possible argument against the usurpation Yuan Shih-kai\r\nproposed to practise. He knew precisely where to strike--and with what\r\nstrength; and he delivered himself over to his task with whole-hearted\r\nfervour. It having become known that he was engaged in preparing this\r\nbrief for the people of China, every influence was brought to bear to\r\nprevent such a disastrous publication. Influential deputations were sent\r\nto him to implore him to remember the parlous international situation\r\nChina found herself in,--a situation which would result in open\r\ndisaster if subjected to the strain of further discords. For a time he\r\nhesitated launching his counter-stroke. But at length the Republican\r\nParty persuaded him to deal the tyrant the needed blow; and his now\r\nfamous accusation of the Chief Executive was published.\r\n\r\nIts effect was immediate and very far-reaching. Men understood that\r\narmed revolt was in the air. The almost Biblical fervour which pervades\r\nthis extraordinary document shows an unusual sense of moral outrage. The\r\nmasterly analysis of the Diaz régime in Mexico coupled with the manner\r\nin which--always pretending to be examining the conduct of the\r\nMexican--he stabs at Yuan Shih-kai, won the applause of a race that\r\ndelights in oblique attacks and was ample proof that great trouble was\r\nbrewing. The document was read in every part of China and everywhere\r\napproved. Although it suffers from translation, the text remains\r\nsingularly interesting as a disclosure of the Chinese mentality; whilst\r\nthe exhaustive examination of political terms it contains shows that\r\nsome day Chinese will carry their inventive genius into fields they have\r\nhitherto never openly invaded. Especially interesting is it to contrast\r\nthe arguments of such a man with those of a decadent such as Yang Tu.\r\n\r\n    FROM REPUBLIC TO MONARCHY\r\n\r\n    Before I proceed with my argument I wish to make plain two points.\r\n    One is that I am not one of those reformers whose ears are their\r\n    brains, and who are intoxicated with the doctrine of republicanism.\r\n    I have, therefore, no partiality for the republican form of\r\n    government nor any bias for or against other forms of government.\r\n    This can be proved by my literary work during the last ten years.\r\n    The second point is that I am not one of the veteran conservatives\r\n    who lay so much stress on the importance of having a dynasty. For\r\n    such are the thoughts of men who only seek to adjust themselves to\r\n    existing conditions. If one wishes to consider the present situation\r\n    of the country without bias or prejudice he must disregard the rise\r\n    or fall of any particular family. Only those who bear in mind these\r\n    two points can read my argument with real understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. THE QUESTION OF KUO-TI\r\n\r\n    Some time ago I said that, as political students, we should only\r\n    care for _Cheng-ti_, _i.e._, the form of government and not for\r\n    _Kuo-ti_, _i.e._, the form of state. Do not call this trifling with\r\n    words, for it is a principle which all critics of politics should\r\n    follow and never depart from. The reason is that critics of politics\r\n    should not, because they cannot, influence the question of _Kuo-ti_.\r\n    They should not influence the question of _Kuo-ti_ because so long\r\n    as the question of _Kuo-ti_ remains unsettled the major portion of\r\n    the administration remains at a stand-still. Thus there will be no\r\n    political situation properly so called and there will be no\r\n    political questions to discuss (here the term political means really\r\n    administrative). If a critic of politics, therefore, interfere with\r\n    the question of _Kuo-ti_, he will be leading the nation into a\r\n    condition of political instability, thus undermining the ground on\r\n    which the people stand. Such critics can be likened unto a man\r\n    trying to enter a house without ascending the steps or crossing a\r\n    river without a boat.\r\n\r\n    They cannot influence the question of _Kuo-ti_. The force which\r\n    drives and steers the change of one form of State or _vice versa_ is\r\n    generally not derived from mere politics. If the time is not ripe,\r\n    then no amount of advocacy on the part of critics can hasten it. If\r\n    the time is ripe, nothing the critics say can prevent it. He who\r\n    indulges himself in the discussion of the problem of\r\n    _Kuo-ti_--_i.e._, the form of States, as a political student, is\r\n    ignorant of his own limitations and capacity. This is as true of the\r\n    active politicians as of the critics; for the first duty of an\r\n    active politician is to seek for the improvement and progress of the\r\n    administration of the existing foundation of government. A step\r\n    beyond this line is revolution and intrigue, and such cannot be the\r\n    attitude of a right-minded active politician or statesman. This is\r\n    looking at it from the negative side.\r\n\r\n    From the positive, that is, the progressive point of view, there is\r\n    also a boundary. Such actions under one form of government are\r\n    political activities, and under the opposite form of government are\r\n    also political activities. But these are not questions of political\r\n    principle. For only when a man sacrifices the ideals which he has\r\n    advocated and cherished during the whole of his life does the\r\n    question of principle arise. Therefore the great principle of\r\n    looking to the actual state of administration of the form of\r\n    government and leaving the mere form of state in the background is a\r\n    principle that is applicable under all circumstances and should be\r\n    followed by all critics of politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. THE ARGUMENT AGAINST CHANGE\r\n\r\n    No form of government is ideal. Its reason of existence can only be\r\n    judged by what it has achieved. It is the height of folly to rely on\r\n    theoretical conclusions as a basis for artificial arbitration as to\r\n    what should be accepted and what discarded. Mere folly, however, is\r\n    not to be seriously condemned. But the danger and harm to the\r\n    country will be unmeasurable if a person has prejudiced views\r\n    respecting a certain form of government and in order to prove the\r\n    correctness of his prejudiced views, creates artificially a\r\n    situation all by himself. For this reason my view has always been\r\n    not to oppose any form of government. But I am always opposed to\r\n    any one who engages in a propaganda in favour of a form of\r\n    government other than the one under which we actually live. In the\r\n    past I opposed those who tried to spread the republican form of\r\n    government while the country was under monarchical government, and\r\n    the arguments I advanced in support of my views were written in no\r\n    fewer than 200,000 words. Even so late as the ninth month after the\r\n    outbreak of the Revolution I issued a pamphlet entitled \"The Problem\r\n    of the Building of the New China,\" which was my last attempt to\r\n    express my views respecting the maintenance of the old form of\r\n    government.\r\n\r\n    What obligations had I to the then Imperial House? Did it not heap\r\n    persecution and humiliation on me to the utmost of its power and\r\n    resources? I would have been an exile even to this day had it not\r\n    been for the Revolution. Further, I was no child and I was fully\r\n    aware of the disappointment which the then Government caused in the\r\n    minds of the people. Yet I risked the opposition of the whole\r\n    country and attempted to prolong the life of the dying dynasty. I\r\n    had no other view in mind except that there would be some\r\n    possibility of our hope being realized if the whole nation would\r\n    unite in efforts to improve the administration under the then\r\n    existing form of government. I believed that because the people were\r\n    not educated for a change. But if the status of the country should\r\n    be changed before the people are educated and accustomed to the new\r\n    order of things, the danger and hardship during the transitional\r\n    period of several years would be incalculable. In certain\r\n    circumstances this might lead to the destruction of the nation. Even\r\n    if we are spared the tragedy of national extinction, the losses\r\n    sustained by the retarding of the progress of the administration\r\n    would be unredeemable. It is painful to recall past experiences; but\r\n    if my readers will read once more my articles in the _Hsin Min Tung\r\n    Pao_ during the years 1905 and 1906 they will see that all the\r\n    sufferings which the Republic has experienced bear out the\r\n    predictions made then. The different stages of the sinister\r\n    development have been unfolding themselves one by one just as I said\r\n    they would. It was unfortunate that my words were not heeded\r\n    although I wept and pleaded. Such has been the consequence of the\r\n    change of the state of the country--a change of _Kuo-ti_.\r\n\r\n    Yet before we have hardly ceased panting, this talk of a second\r\n    change is on us. I am not in a position to say exactly how this talk\r\n    had its beginning. Ostensibly it was started by the remarks of Dr.\r\n    Goodnow. But I am unable to say whether Dr. Goodnow actually gave\r\n    out such a view or for what purpose he expressed such a view. From\r\n    what he told the representative of a Peking newspaper he never\r\n    expressed the views attributed to him. Be this as it may, I cannot\r\n    help having my doubts. All Dr. Goodnow is alleged to have said\r\n    bearing on the merits of the monarchical and republican system of\r\n    government as an abstract subject of discussion, such as the\r\n    necessity of the form of state (_Kuo-ti_) being suited to the\r\n    general conditions of the country and the lessons we should learn\r\n    from the Central and South American republics, are really points of\r\n    a very simple nature and easily deduced. How strange that among all\r\n    this large number of politicians and scholars, who are as numerous\r\n    as the trees in the forest and the perch in the stream, should have\r\n    failed for all these years to notice these simple points; and now\r\n    suddenly make a fetish of them because they have come out of the\r\n    mouth of a foreigner. Is it because no one except a foreign doctor\r\n    can discover such facts? Why even a humble learner like myself,\r\n    though not so learned even to the extent of one ten-thousandth part\r\n    of his knowledge, more than ten years ago anticipated what the good\r\n    doctor has said; and I said much more and in much more comprehensive\r\n    terms. I have no desire to talk about my work, but let my readers\r\n    glance through the copies of the _Hsin Min Tsung Pao, Yin Ping Shih\r\n    Wen Chi_, the \"Fight between Constitutional Advocates\" and\r\n    \"Revolutionary Advocates,\" the \"Question of the Building of the New\r\n    China,\" etc., etc. My regret is that my eyes are not blue and my\r\n    hair not brown, and hence my words were not acceptable to the\r\n    nation!\r\n\r\n\r\n    III. RES JUDICATA\r\n\r\n    I do not say that the merits or otherwise of the republican system\r\n    should not be discussed, but the time for such a discussion has\r\n    passed. The most opportune time for such a discussion was in 1911\r\n    when the Revolution had just begun; but since then further\r\n    discussions should not be tolerated. There might have been some\r\n    excuse if this subject had been brought up for discussion when the\r\n    second revolution broke out at Hukow on the Yangtsze river or before\r\n    the President was formally inaugurated, or before the Powers\r\n    formally recognized the Republic; but the excuse even then would\r\n    have been a weak one. Where were you then, advocates of monarchy?\r\n    Could you not at that time have brought out an essay by one of the\r\n    great scholars of the world as a subject for discussion? Could you\r\n    not have cited the cases of American republics as a warning for us\r\n    that these republics were by no means peaceful? Yet at that time\r\n    when the heroes of discretion were daily pushing the progress of the\r\n    republican cause, stating that republicanism was the panacea for all\r\n    the world's administrations and that republicanism was not a new\r\n    factor in Chinese history, a humble and ignorant man like myself,\r\n    then a stranger in a foreign land, was burdened with the fear of the\r\n    unsuitability of the republican system to China and wrote articles\r\n    in support of his own views and wept till his eyes were dry.\r\n\r\n    Do you not realize that the State is a thing of great importance and\r\n    should not be disturbed carelessly? How can you then experiment with\r\n    it and treat it as if you were putting a chest into a dead hole,\r\n    saying \"Let me place it here for the moment and I will see to it\r\n    later.\" The status of the State can be likened to marriage between\r\n    man and woman. The greatest care should be taken during courtship.\r\n    The lady should then exercise care to see that the man whom she is\r\n    taking to be a life companion is worthy of her. During this period\r\n    it is the duty of her relatives and friends to point out to her any\r\n    danger or misunderstanding even to the extent of offending her\r\n    feelings. But if you leave her alone at this stage when there is\r\n    plenty of time to change her course, and--what is more--urge her to\r\n    tie the knot despite incompatibility, what right have you afterwards\r\n    to make the impudent suggestion to the wife that her husband is not\r\n    a man to whom she should cling for life? Is such a course a\r\n    charitable way of doing things?\r\n\r\n    If indeed the republican cause is enough to cause the destruction of\r\n    the nation then you, the advocates of monarchy, have placed the\r\n    country in a position from which she has no hope of ever coming out\r\n    independent. You are the men who--to the best of your\r\n    ability--inculcated and pressed the adoption of the republican\r\n    cause. The proverb says, \"If now, why not then?\" How many days can a\r\n    person live that you, not satisfied with one great sin, are again to\r\n    commit another. It is not long since the Republic was first\r\n    established; yet you, the veterans of republicanism, are the leaders\r\n    to-day in advocating the overthrow of the Republic. Yes. It is\r\n    indeed strange that I, a man who once opposed the republican cause,\r\n    should now be opposing you. Nothing is stranger and nothing is so\r\n    fateful.\r\n\r\n    But our modern critics say we prefer a constitutional monarchy to an\r\n    autocratic republic. Now whether we are constitutional or not is a\r\n    question concerning the administration, while the question whether\r\n    we are republican or not is a question concerning the form or status\r\n    of the country. We have always held that the question of _Kuo-ti_ is\r\n    above discussion and that what we should consider is the actual\r\n    condition of administration. If the administration (government) is\r\n    constitutional, then it matters not whether the country is a\r\n    Republic or a Monarchy. If the government is not constitutional then\r\n    neither a republic nor a monarchy will avail. There is no connexion,\r\n    therefore, between the question of _Kuo-ti_ and the question of\r\n    _Cheng-ti_. It is an absurd idea to say that in order to improve the\r\n    administration we must change the _Kuo-ti_--the status or form of\r\n    the country--as a necessity. If this idea is to be entertained for a\r\n    single moment the changes even in constitutional countries will be\r\n    endless. But the curious paradox is that in former days the critics\r\n    said that only a republic, not a monarchy, could be constitutional;\r\n    whereas, the critics now say that a monarchy, not a republic, can\r\n    alone be constitutional!\r\n\r\n\r\n    IV. THE PRESIDENT AND THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n    Let me therefore lay down a simple definition of what a Constitution\r\n    is before discussing whether the contentions of the critics are\r\n    reasonable. My opponents will agree with me that the main principle\r\n    of a constitutional government is that the legislative organ should\r\n    always balance the executive and that the exercising of the\r\n    administrative power is always limited to a certain extent. They\r\n    will also agree that the most important point of a so-called\r\n    constitutional monarchy is that the monarch should act as a\r\n    figurehead, and that the establishment of a responsible cabinet is\r\n    an indispensable accompaniment. If these simple principles are\r\n    recognized then we must put up the theory for discussion. Let us\r\n    then raise the question who shall be the monarch. In plain words, is\r\n    the person in our mind the President? or any other person? (In view\r\n    of the repeated declarations of the President that he will never\r\n    consent to become an Emperor, this suggestion on my part is a gross\r\n    insult to his character, but I crave to excuse myself as this is\r\n    only mere speculation and supposition.) What shall we do with the\r\n    President if we find another man? The President, having so long\r\n    borne the burdens of the State, will certainly be only too willing\r\n    to vacate his post to live in retirement as far as his own person is\r\n    concerned, but can we imagine that the country will allow the\r\n    President to retire? If not, then are we going to ask the President\r\n    to form a responsible cabinet under a figurehead monarch? Even if we\r\n    take it for granted that the President, out of love for the country,\r\n    would be willing to sacrifice his own principles and yield to the\r\n    wish of the country, it will be dangerous indeed if he--a person on\r\n    whom the whole nation depends--is placed in the path of parliament.\r\n    Therefore the contention that a constitutional monarchy will be\r\n    attained if a person other than the President be made a monarch is\r\n    false and baseless.\r\n\r\n    Shall we then make the present President a monarch? Of course the\r\n    President will not consent to this. But leaving this aside let us\r\n    suppose that the President, in consideration of the permanent\r\n    welfare of the country, is willing to sacrifice everything to\r\n    satisfy the wish of the people, do we expect that he will become a\r\n    mere figurehead? A figurehead monarch is, to adapt the saying of the\r\n    west, a fat porker, a guinea-pig, that is, good as an expensive\r\n    ornament. Will it be wise to place so valuable a personage in so\r\n    idle a position at a time when the situation is so extremely\r\n    critical?\r\n\r\n    Even if we are willing to suffer the President to become a\r\n    figurehead it will remain a question whether a responsible cabinet\r\n    can ever be formed. I do not say that the President will not allow a\r\n    responsible cabinet to exist under him. My contention is that there\r\n    is no one, within my knowledge, who commands respect enough and is\r\n    capable of taking over the responsibilities of President Yuan. For\r\n    who can replace the Great President in coping with our numerous\r\n    difficulties? If we select an ordinary man and make him bear the\r\n    great burdens, we will find that in addition to his lack of ability\r\n    rendering him unequal to the occasion, his lack of dominating\r\n    influence will disqualify him from exercising authority. It was for\r\n    the purpose of meeting the requirements of the existing conditions\r\n    that the Cabinet system was changed into a Presidential system--an\r\n    excellent substitution for a weakened administration. Conditions in\r\n    the next two or three years will not be very much different from\r\n    what they are now. Therefore, the contention that the administration\r\n    will be changed overnight for the better after a change in the form\r\n    of the State is, if not a wicked untruth to deceive the common\r\n    people, the ridiculous absurdity of a bookworm. Thus the theory that\r\n    a constitutional monarchy will immediately follow, if the President\r\n    consents to become a monarch, is also fallacious.\r\n\r\n    Can it be possible that those who are now holding up the\r\n    constitutional principle as a shield for their monarchical views\r\n    have a different definition for the term \"constitution\"? The Ching\r\n    (Manchu) Dynasty considered itself as possessing a constitution in\r\n    its last days. Did we recognize it as such? Let me also ask the\r\n    critics what guarantee they have to offer that the constitution will\r\n    be put into effect without hindrance as soon as the form of State is\r\n    changed. If they cannot give any definite guarantee, then what they\r\n    advocate is merely an absolute monarchy and not a constitutional\r\n    monarchy. As it is not likely to be a constitutional monarchy, we\r\n    may safely assume that it will be an imperial autocracy. I cannot\r\n    regard it as a wise plan if, owing to dislike of its defects, the\r\n    Republic should be transformed into an Imperial autocracy. Owing to\r\n    various unavoidable reasons, it is excusable in spite of violent\r\n    opposition to adopt temporarily autocratic methods in a republican\r\n    country. But if the plan proposed by present-day critics be put into\r\n    effect, that on the promise of a constitution we should agree to the\r\n    adoption of a monarchy, then the promise must be definitely made to\r\n    the country at the time of transition that a constitutional\r\n    government will become an actuality. But if, after the promise is\r\n    made, existing conditions are alleged to justify the continuance of\r\n    autocratic methods, I am afraid the whole country will not be so\r\n    tolerant towards the Chief Executive. To assume outwardly the rôle\r\n    of constitutional government, but in reality to rule in an\r\n    unconstitutional manner, was the cause of the downfall of the Ching\r\n    Dynasty. The object lesson is not obscure. Let us take warning by\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    V. FALLACIES OF THE MONARCHISTS\r\n\r\n    If, on the other hand, the present-day critics are really in earnest\r\n    for a constitution, then I am unable to understand why they believe\r\n    that this cannot be secured under the Republic but must be obtained\r\n    in a roundabout way by means of a monarchy. In my view the real\r\n    hindrances to the adoption of a constitution at the present day in\r\n    China are the existing conditions, viz. the attitude of the\r\n    officials and the traditions and intellectual standards of the\r\n    people. But these hindrances have not resulted from the adoption of\r\n    republicanism. Therefore they cannot be expected to disappear with\r\n    the disappearance of the Republic. For instance, from the President\r\n    downward to the minor official of every official organ in the\r\n    capital or in the provinces, every one inclines to be independent of\r\n    the law, and considers it convenient to deal with affairs as he\r\n    pleases. This is the greatest obstacle to constitutional government.\r\n    Now has that anything to do with the change or not of the form of\r\n    State? Again, the absence, on the part of the people, of interest in\r\n    political affairs, of knowledge of politics, of political morality\r\n    and strength, and their inability to organize proper political\r\n    parties to make use of an inviolable parliament, are also hindrances\r\n    to the attainment of a constitution. Now what have these things to\r\n    do with a change in the form of the States? If I were to go on\r\n    naming such hindrances one by one, I should count my fingers many\r\n    times over and I should not be through. Yet it is quite plain that\r\n    not a single one of these hindrances can be attributed to\r\n    republicanism.\r\n\r\n    To say that what we cannot get under the republic can be secured\r\n    immediately upon accepting a monarchical régime, or to say that\r\n    what can be secured under a monarchical régime can never be secured\r\n    in a republican period is beyond the understanding of a stupid man\r\n    like myself, although I have searched my brain for a valid reason.\r\n\r\n    My view is that if China is really in earnest for a constitution,\r\n    the President should set the example himself by treating the\r\n    Constitutional Compact as sacredly inviolable and compel his\r\n    subordinates to do the same. Every letter of the compact should be\r\n    carried out and no attempt should be made to step beyond its limits.\r\n\r\n    Meantime give the people as many opportunities as possible to\r\n    acquaint themselves with political affairs, and do not stifle the\r\n    aspirations of the people or weaken their strength or damp their\r\n    interest or crush their self-respect. Then within a few years we\r\n    shall be rewarded with results. If, instead of doing all these\r\n    things, we vainly blame the form of State, we are, as Chu Tse says,\r\n    like a boat that blames the creek for its curves.\r\n\r\n    The most powerful argument of those who advocate a change to a\r\n    monarchy is that there is every possibility of disturbance at the\r\n    time of a Presidential election. This is a real danger. It is for\r\n    this reason that ten years ago I did not dare to associate myself\r\n    with the advocates of republicanism. If the critics want to attack\r\n    me on this point to support of their contentions, I advise them not\r\n    to write another article but to reprint my articles written some\r\n    time ago, which, I think, will be more effective. Fortunately,\r\n    however, we have discovered a comparatively effective remedy. For,\r\n    according to the latest President Election Law, the term of the\r\n    President is to all intents and purposes a term for life. It is\r\n    therefore impossible for such dangers to appear during the life of\r\n    the President. What concerns us is therefore what will happen after\r\n    the departure of the present President for another world. This, of\r\n    course, is a question that we do not wish to touch upon; but since\r\n    every one, even the patriarchs, must die some day, let us face the\r\n    matter openly. If Heaven blesses China and allows the Great\r\n    President to devote himself to the country for ten or more\r\n    years--during which he will be able to assert the authority of the\r\n    government, cleanse officialdom, store-up strength, consolidate the\r\n    country, and banish all hidden dangers--then there will be nothing\r\n    to choose between a republic or a monarchy. If, on the other hand,\r\n    Heaven should not be pleased so to favour us and takes away our\r\n    Great President before he is half through with his great task, then\r\n    the fate of China is sealed. No changes in the form of State will\r\n    avail under any circumstances. Therefore the question whether China\r\n    will be left in peace or not depends entirely on the length of years\r\n    the Great President will live and what he will be able to accomplish\r\n    in his lifetime. Whether the country is ruled as a republic or a\r\n    monarchy, the consequences will be the same.\r\n\r\n    Do you still doubt my words? Let me go deeper into the analysis. The\r\n    difference between a republic and a monarchy lies only in the\r\n    methods of succession of the head of the nation. It is evident that\r\n    although a certain law of succession may be made during the lifetime\r\n    of the Head, it cannot take effect until his death; and whether or\r\n    not the effect thus intended will come up to expectations will\r\n    depend on two factors: (1) whether or not the merits and personal\r\n    influence of the predecessor will continue effective after his\r\n    death, and (2) whether or not there will be unscrupulous and\r\n    insubordinate claimants at the death of the Head, and, if any, the\r\n    number of such men and whether the point of dispute they raise be\r\n    well-founded. If these are taken as the basis for discerning the\r\n    future we will arrive at the same conclusion whether the country be\r\n    a republic or a monarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    VI. THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION LAW\r\n\r\n    The Presidential Election Law, however, provides that the successor\r\n    should be nominated by his predecessor, and the name of the\r\n    successor so nominated is to be locked in the golden box in the\r\n    stone strong-room. The President may now, on the one hand, multiply\r\n    his merits and strengthen his personal influence so that the whole\r\n    country will gladly bow to his wishes to the extent that even after\r\n    his death they will not want to disobey his last wish, and on the\r\n    other hand, the President may quietly ascertain the likely causes\r\n    which would produce dissension, and take suitable steps to prevent\r\n    and be rid of them. If the seed of dissension is in the ordinances,\r\n    then alter the ordinances so that they may not be used as a tool by\r\n    possible claimants. If the seed of dissension is in a person then\r\n    cultivate that man, lead him to righteousness, place him in a\r\n    suitable position so that he may be protected from temptation.\r\n    Meanwhile let the President carefully select his successor on whom\r\n    he may eventually lay the responsibilities of State (according to\r\n    the Presidential Election Law the President is at liberty to suggest\r\n    any one he likes, his own son or some one else). Let the nominee be\r\n    placed in a responsible position so as to bring him to public\r\n    notice. Give him real authority so that he may establish his\r\n    influence. Place his name at the head of other men of little\r\n    consequence in the golden box. Then there will be absolutely no\r\n    ground for dispute when the time comes to open the box.\r\n\r\n    If every President will do likewise this system can be used without\r\n    fear of a break for hundreds of years. Otherwise we will have only\r\n    the Imperial system on paper to rely on for assistance, which is not\r\n    even to be thought of. A glance through the pages of Chinese history\r\n    will show the numerous cases in the reign of Emperors when princes\r\n    fought in the very confines of the Emperor's palace while the corpse\r\n    of their royal father lay unburied in the hall. Thus it is seen that\r\n    the hidden cause of the safety or otherwise of the country does not\r\n    lie with the mere formality of a constitution either in a republic\r\n    or a monarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    VII. THE CASE OF DIAZ, THE DICTATOR\r\n\r\n    The critics bring up the example of Mexico where live rivals have\r\n    been struggling with each other for the presidency, and the internal\r\n    confusion of the Central and South American republics as well as\r\n    Portugal, as an unquestionable proof of their contention that a\r\n    republic is not so good as a monarchy. I imagine that the idea of\r\n    these critics is that all these disturbances can be avoided if all\r\n    these republics were changed into monarchies. Let me tell them that\r\n    Diaz ruled over Mexico for thirty years, and only died as an exile\r\n    in May last (I am not quite sure of the exact month). If indeed the\r\n    struggle in Mexico was a fight for succession then the fight should\r\n    not have begun until this year. And indeed if it were necessary to\r\n    have a monarch to avoid the disturbance, and supposing that Diaz,\r\n    thirty years ago, had a man like Dr. Goodnow to make the suggestion,\r\n    and men like the Chou An Hui to spread it, and suppose that Diaz\r\n    boldly took the advice and set up an Imperial system for himself,\r\n    would Mexico then have a peace that would last as long as the ages?\r\n\r\n    If Diaz had assumed the throne I am positive he would long ago have\r\n    been an exile in a foreign country before his imperial system could\r\n    have come into effect or he himself become the proud founder of a\r\n    new dynasty. What he would have held as an imperial charter would\r\n    have become a mere scrap of paper. If he could not prevent rebellion\r\n    even during his lifetime how can we expect an empty Imperial system\r\n    to prevent it after his death. Even a child can see this. The\r\n    disturbances in Mexico were unavoidable no matter under a republic\r\n    or a monarchy. The reason? It is because Diaz, under the mask of a\r\n    republic, actually played the rôle of a despot. During all the\r\n    thirty years he held office he never devoted himself to the\r\n    strengthening of the fundamental things of State, but diligently\r\n    strengthened his own position. He massed an enormous number of\r\n    troops for his own protection so that he might overawe the people.\r\n    For fear that the troops might become arrogant and insubordinate, he\r\n    provoked disagreement among them in order that he might play them\r\n    round his fingers. He banished all those who opposed him, relying on\r\n    force alone. In dealing with those who were really patriotic, he\r\n    either corrupted their character by buying them with silver or\r\n    removed them by assassination. He was a vainglorious man and spent\r\n    money like water. From the foreign capitalists he borrowed in a most\r\n    indiscriminate manner, while on the Mexican people he levied all\r\n    sorts of cruel taxes. Thus the strength of the people was drained\r\n    and the resources of the country were exhausted, creating a position\r\n    over which he eventually had no control whatever. Ten years ago I\r\n    wrote an article in the _Hsin Min Tsung Pao_ remarking that Diaz was\r\n    a matchless fraud. I said then that a nation-wide calamity would\r\n    befall Mexico after his death and that the Mexican nation would be\r\n    reduced to a mere shadow. (My friend Mr. Tang Chio-tun also wrote an\r\n    article, before the internal strife in Mexico broke out, on the same\r\n    subject and in an even more comprehensive way.) Luckily for Diaz he\r\n    ruled under the mask of republicanism, for only by so doing did he\r\n    manage to usurp and keep the presidential chair for thirty years. He\r\n    would long ago have disappeared had he attempted to assume the rôle\r\n    of an emperor. This is also true of the other republics of Central\r\n    and South America. Their presidents almost without a single\r\n    exception used military force as a stepping-stone to the\r\n    presidential chair. We have yet to see the last military aspirant.\r\n    The unsuitability of the country to the republican system is of\r\n    course one of the reasons but I cannot agree with those who say that\r\n    this is the only reason.\r\n\r\n    As to Portugal it is true that the change from the monarchy to\r\n    republic has not stopped internal disturbance; but is it not a fact\r\n    that Portugal became a republic as a result of internal disturbance\r\n    and was it not during the existence of the monarch that the\r\n    disturbance started? It is ridiculous to suppose that a republic\r\n    will surely court disturbance while a monarchy will surely ensure\r\n    peace and order. Is not Persia a monarchy? Is not Turkey a monarchy?\r\n    Is not Russia a monarchy?\r\n\r\n    Read their history in recent decades and see how many years of peace\r\n    they have had. There have been no election of presidents in these\r\n    countries. Why then such unrest?\r\n\r\n    Again, why was the state of affairs during the Sixteen States of the\r\n    Five Dynasty-Period and the Ten States of the Five Successions as\r\n    deplorably miserable and disastrous as the state of affairs now\r\n    prevailing in Mexico, although there was no election of Presidents\r\n    then? In quoting objective facts as illustrations the critic should\r\n    not allow his choice to be dictated by his personal like or dislike.\r\n    Otherwise he will not be deceiving others than himself. Soberly\r\n    speaking, any form of state is capable of either ensuring a\r\n    successful government or causing rebellion. And nine cases out of\r\n    ten the cause of rebellion lies in the conditions of the\r\n    administration and not in the form of state. It cannot be denied,\r\n    however, that the chances of rebellion and dissension are more\r\n    frequent and easier when the form of state does not suit the\r\n    conditions of the people. That is why I did not advocate\r\n    republicanism; and even now I am not a blind believer in\r\n    republicanism. In this I agree with you, the Chou An Hui people.\r\n\r\n    The reason why I have not decided to advocate boldly a change in the\r\n    form of state is because for years my heart has been burdened with\r\n    an unspeakable sorrow and pain, believing that ever since the\r\n    mistake made in 1911 the hope for China's future has dwindled to\r\n    almost nothing. On one hand I have been troubled with our inability\r\n    to make the Republic a success, and on the other I have been\r\n    worrying over the fact that it would be impossible to restore the\r\n    monarchy. The situation has so worked on my troubled mind that at\r\n    times I seemed to be beside myself. But as the whole country seemed\r\n    to be already in a state of desperation I have come to the\r\n    conclusion that it would not do any good to add pain to sorrow.\r\n    Therefore, instead of uttering pessimistic views I have been\r\n    speaking words of encouragement to raise our spirits. In this,\r\n    however, I have exhausted my own strength. My friend, Mr. Hsu Fo-su,\r\n    told me some five or six years ago that it was impossible for China\r\n    to escape a revolution, and as a result of the revolution could not\r\n    escape from becoming a republic, and by becoming a republic China\r\n    would be bound to disappear as a nation. I have been meditating on\r\n    these words of ill-omen and sought to help the country to escape\r\n    from his prediction but I have not yet found the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n    VIII. \"DIVINITY DOTH HEDGE A KING\"\r\n\r\n    Now my friends, you have stated in a worthy manner the reasons why\r\n    the republican form of state cannot assist China to maintain her\r\n    existence; now let me state why it is impossible to restore the\r\n    monarchical system. The maintenance of the dignity of a monarch\r\n    depends on a sort of mystical, historical, traditional influence or\r\n    belief. Such an influence was capable of producing unconsciously and\r\n    spontaneously a kind of effect to assist directly or indirectly in\r\n    maintaining order and imparting blessing to the country. In this\r\n    lies the value of a monarchy. But dignity is a thing not to be\r\n    trifled with. Once it is trodden down it can never rise again. We\r\n    carve wood or mould clay into the image of a person and call it a\r\n    god (idol). Place it in a beautiful temple, and seat it in a\r\n    glorious shrine and the people will worship it and find it\r\n    miraculously potent. But suppose some insane person should pull it\r\n    down, tread it under foot and throw it into a dirty pond and suppose\r\n    some one should discover it and carry it back to its original sacred\r\n    abode, you will find the charm has gone from it. Ever since the days\r\n    of monarchical government the people have looked on the monarch with\r\n    a sort of divine reverence, and never dared to question or criticize\r\n    his position. After a period of republicanism, however, this\r\n    attitude on the part of the common people has been abruptly\r\n    terminated with no possibility of resurrection. A survey of all the\r\n    republics of the world will tell us that although a large number of\r\n    them suffered under republican rule, not a single one succeeded in\r\n    shaking itself free of the republican fetters. Among the world\r\n    republics only France has had her monarchical system revived twice\r\n    after the republic was first inaugurated. The monarchy, however,\r\n    disappeared almost immediately. Thus we may well understand how\r\n    difficult it is for a country to return to its monarchical state\r\n    after a republican régime. It may be said that China has had only a\r\n    short experience of the republican régime; but it must also be\r\n    remembered that the situation has been developing for more than ten\r\n    years and in actual existence for about four years. During the\r\n    period of development the revolutionists denounced the monarch in\r\n    most extravagant terms and compared him to the devil. Their aim was\r\n    to kill the mystic belief of the people in the Emperor; for only by\r\n    diminishing the dignity of the monarch could the revolutionary cause\r\n    make headway. And during and after the change all the official\r\n    documents, school text-books, press views and social gossip have\r\n    always coupled the word monarch with reprobation. Thus for a long\r\n    while this glorious image has been lying in the dirty pond! Leaving\r\n    out the question that it is difficult to restore the monarchy at the\r\n    present day, let us suppose that by arbitrary method we do succeed\r\n    in restoring it. You will then find that it will be impossible for\r\n    it to regain in former dignity and influence.\r\n\r\n    Turning to another aspect, the most natural course would seem to be\r\n    a revival of the last dynasty. It might have been possible for a\r\n    Charles II and Louis XVIII of China to appear again, if not for the\r\n    hatred of racial domination. But since the last dynasty was Manchu\r\n    this is out of the question. If a new dynasty were set up it would\r\n    require many years of hard labour and a great deal of organizing to\r\n    succeed. Even then only a few have succeeded in this way in\r\n    prolonging their dynasties by actually convincing the people of\r\n    their merits. Therefore for several years I have been saying to\r\n    myself that it would be easier to strengthen the country and place\r\n    it on a sounder basis if it were possible for us to return to our\r\n    monarchical state. And to revive the monarchical government there\r\n    are two ways.\r\n\r\n    One is that after thoroughly reforming the internal administration\r\n    under the leadership of the present Great President, that is, when\r\n    all the neglected affairs of the country have been well attended to,\r\n    every family in the land made happy and prosperous, the army\r\n    well-trained and all the necessary bitterness \"eaten,\" the\r\n    President, when a suitable opportunity presented itself, should have\r\n    the rare fortune to gain a decisive victory over a foreign foe; then\r\n    his achievements would be such that the millions of people would\r\n    compel him to ascend the throne, and so he would hand his sceptre on\r\n    to his descendants for endless ages.\r\n\r\n    The second possibility is that after a second great internal\r\n    disturbance, resulting in the whole country being thrown into a\r\n    state of utter confusion and cut up into small independent states,\r\n    the President should suppress them and unite the country into one\r\n    empire. We will, of course, not pray for the second possibility to\r\n    come about as then there will be little left of the Chinese people.\r\n    And no one can be certain whether the person who shall succeed in\r\n    suppressing the internal strife will be a man of our own race or\r\n    not. Thus the result will not differ very much from national\r\n    extinction. As to the first possibility, we know that an exceedingly\r\n    capable man is now in a most powerful position; let him be given\r\n    time and he will soon show himself to be a man of success. Does not\r\n    the last ray of hope for China depend on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n    IX. THE UNRIPE PEAR\r\n\r\n    This is why I say we should not deliberately create trouble for the\r\n    Republic at this time to add to the worries of the Great President\r\n    so that he might devote his puissant thoughts and energies to the\r\n    institution of great reforms. Then our final hope will be satisfied\r\n    some day. But what a year and what a day we are now living in? The\r\n    great crisis (_Note: The reference is to the Japanese demands_) has\r\n    just passed and we have not yet had time for a respite. By the\r\n    pressure of a powerful neighbour we have been compelled to sign a\r\n    \"certain\" Treaty. Floods, drought, epidemics and locusts visit our\r\n    country and the land is full of suffering while robbers plunder the\r\n    people. In ancient times this would have been a day for the Imperial\r\n    Court to remove their ornaments and live in humiliation. What do the\r\n    people of our day mean by advising and urging the President to\r\n    ascend the throne? To pluck the fruit before it is ripe, injures the\r\n    roots of the tree; and to force the premature birth of a child kills\r\n    the mother. If the last \"ray of hope\" for China should be\r\n    extinguished by the failure of a premature attempt to force matters,\r\n    how could the advocates of such a premature attempt excuse\r\n    themselves before the whole country? Let the members of the Chou An\r\n    Hui meditate on this point.\r\n\r\n    The Odes say, \"The people are tired. Let them have a respite.\" In\r\n    less than four years' time from the 8th moon of the year Hsin Hai we\r\n    have had many changes. Like a bolt from the blue we had the Manchu\r\n    Constitution, then \"the Republic of Five Races,\" then the\r\n    Provisional President, then the formal Presidency, then the\r\n    Provisional Constitution was promulgated, then it was suddenly\r\n    amended, suddenly the National Assembly was convoked, suddenly it\r\n    was dissolved, suddenly we had a Cabinet System, suddenly it was\r\n    changed to a Presidential System, suddenly it was a short-term\r\n    Presidency, suddenly it was a life-term Presidency, suddenly the\r\n    Provisional Constitution was temporarily placed in a legal position\r\n    as a Permanent Constitution, suddenly the drafting of the Permanent\r\n    Constitution was pressed. Generally speaking the average life of\r\n    each new system has been less than six months, after which a new\r\n    system quite contrary to the last succeeded it. Thus the whole\r\n    country has been at a loss to know where it stood and how to act;\r\n    and thus the dignity and credit of the Government in the eyes of the\r\n    people have been lowered down to the dust. There are many subjects\r\n    respecting internal and diplomatic affairs which we can profitably\r\n    discuss. If you wish to serve the country in a patriotic way you\r\n    have many ways to do so. Why stir the peaceful water and create a\r\n    sea of troubles by your vain attempt to excite the people and sow\r\n    seeds of discord for the State?\r\n\r\n\r\n    X. THE ASSEVERATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n    One or two points more, and I am finished. These will be in the\r\n    nature of a straight talk to the Chou An Hui. The question I would\r\n    ask in plain words is, who is the person you have in your mind as\r\n    the future Emperor? Do you wish to select a person other than the\r\n    Great President? You know only too well that the moment the\r\n    President relieves his shoulder of the burdens of State the country\r\n    will be thrown into confusion. If you entertain this plot with the\r\n    deliberation of a person bent upon the destruction of the country,\r\n    then the four hundred million of people will not excuse you.\r\n\r\n    Is the man you have in mind the present President? Heaven and earth\r\n    as well as all living creatures in China and other lands know what\r\n    the President swore to when he took the oath of office as President.\r\n    Rumours have indeed been circulated, but whenever they reached the\r\n    ears of the President he has never hesitated to express his\r\n    righteous mind, saying that no amount of pressure could compel him\r\n    to change his determination. All officials who have come into close\r\n    contact with the President have heard such sentiments from the lips\r\n    of the President on not a few occasions. To me his words are still\r\n    ringing in my ears. General Feng Kuo-chang has conveyed to me what\r\n    he was told by the President. He says that the President has\r\n    prepared a \"few rooms\" in England, and that if the people would not\r\n    spare him he would flee to the refuge he has prepared. Thus we may\r\n    clearly see how determined the President is. Can it be possible that\r\n    you have never heard of this and thus raise this extraordinary\r\n    subject without any cause? If the situation should become such that\r\n    the President should be compelled to carry out his threat and desert\r\n    the Palace, what would you say and do then?\r\n\r\n    Or, perhaps, you are measuring the lordly conduct of a gentleman\r\n    with the heart of a mean man, saying to yourself that what the\r\n    President has been saying cannot be the truth, but, as Confucius has\r\n    said, \"say you are not but make a point to do it,\" and that, knowing\r\n    that he would not condemn you, you have taken the risk. If so, then\r\n    what do you take the President for? To go back on one's words is an\r\n    act despised by a vagabond. To suggest such an act as being capable\r\n    of the President is an insult, the hideousness of which cannot be\r\n    equalled by the number of hairs on one's head. Any one guilty of\r\n    such an insult should not be spared by the four hundred million of\r\n    people.\r\n\r\n\r\n    XI. THE CHOU AN HUI AND THE LAW\r\n\r\n    Next let me ask if you have read the Provisional Constitution, the\r\n    Provisional Code, the Meeting and Association Law, the Press\r\n    Regulations, the various mandates bearing on the punishment of\r\n    persons who dare conspire against the existing form of state? Do you\r\n    not know that you, as citizens of the Republic, must in duty bound\r\n    observe the Constitution and obey the laws and mandates? Yet you\r\n    have dared openly to call together your partisans and incite a\r\n    revolution (the recognized definition in political science for\r\n    revolution is \"to change the existing form of state\"). As the\r\n    Judiciary have not been courageous enough to deal with you since you\r\n    are all so closely in touch with the President, you have become\r\n    bolder still and carry out your sinister scheme in broad daylight. I\r\n    do not wish to say what sort of peace you are planning for China;\r\n    but this much I know, that the law has been violated by you to the\r\n    last letter. I will be silent if you believe that a nation can be\r\n    governed without law. Otherwise tell me what you have got to say?\r\n\r\n    It is quite apparent that you will not be satisfied with mere\r\n    shouting and what you aim at is the actual fulfilment of your\r\n    expectations. That is, you wish that once the expected monarchy is\r\n    established it may continue for ever. Now by what principle can such\r\n    a monarchy continue for ever, except that the laws and orders of\r\n    that dynasty be obeyed, and obeyed implicitly by all, from the Court\r\n    down to the common people? For one to adopt methods that violate the\r\n    law while engaged in creating a new dynasty is like a man, who, to\r\n    secure a wife, induces the virtuous virgin to commit fornication\r\n    with him, on the plea that as a marriage will be arranged\r\n    preservation of her virtue need not be insisted upon. Can such a man\r\n    blame his wife for immorality after marriage? If, while still\r\n    citizens of a republican country, one may openly and boldly call\r\n    meetings and organize societies for the overthrow of the Republic,\r\n    who shall say that we may not in due time openly and boldly call\r\n    meetings and organize societies for the overthrow of the monarchy?\r\n    What shall you say if in future there should be another foreign\r\n    doctor to suggest another theory and another society to engage in\r\n    another form of activity? The Odes have it, \"To prevent the monkey\r\n    from climbing a tree is like putting mud on a man in the mire.\" For\r\n    a person to adopt such methods while engaged in the making of a\r\n    dynasty is the height of folly. Mencius says, \"a Chuntse when\r\n    creating a dynasty aims at things that can be handed down as good\r\n    examples.\" Is it not the greatest misfortune to set up an example\r\n    that cannot be handed down as a precedent? The present state of\r\n    affairs is causing me no small amount of anxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n    XII. A POSTSCRIPT\r\n\r\n    A copy of Yang Tu's pamphlet, \"Constitutional Monarchy or the\r\n    Salvation of China\" reached me after I had finished writing the\r\n    above discussion. On a casual glance through it I alighted upon the\r\n    following passage: \"What is known as a constitutional country is a\r\n    country which has definite laws and in which no one, from the ruler\r\n    down to the common people, can take any action that is not permitted\r\n    by law. Good men cannot do good outside of the bounds of law;\r\n    neither can bad men do evil in violation of it.\" This is indeed a\r\n    passage that breathes the very spirit of constitutionalism. Let us\r\n    ask Mr. Yang if the activities of the Chou An Hui, of which he is\r\n    the President, are acts within the bounds of law? Mr. Yang is a good\r\n    man. It is therefore possible for him to believe that he is not\r\n    doing evil in violation of the law; but has he not at least been\r\n    doing good outside of the bounds of law? If an advocate of\r\n    constitutional monarchy is capable of doing such unlawful acts, we\r\n    may easily imagine what sort of a constitutional monarchy he\r\n    advocates; and we may also easily imagine what the fate of his\r\n    constitutional monarchy will be.\r\n\r\n    Mencius says, \"Am I argumentative? I cannot help it.\" Who would have\r\n    thought that a man, who cares not for the question of the form of\r\n    state like myself and who opposed you--Mr. Yang Tu--during your\r\n    first campaign for the change in the form of State--you were a\r\n    Republican then--would be opposing you again now that you are\r\n    engaged in advocating another change in the form of state? A change\r\n    in the form of government is a manifestation of progress while a\r\n    change in the status of the State is a sign of revolution. The path\r\n    of progress leads to further progress, but the path of revolution\r\n    leads to more revolution. This is a fact proved by theory as well as\r\n    actual experience. Therefore a man who has any love for his country,\r\n    is afraid to mention revolution; and as for myself I am always\r\n    opposed to revolution. I am now opposing your theory of monarchical\r\n    revolution, just as I once opposed your theory of republican\r\n    revolution, in the same spirit, and I am doing the same duty. My\r\n    belief is that since the country is now in a most weakened state, we\r\n    may yet fail even if we do all we can at all times to nurse its\r\n    wound and gather up its scattered strength. How can any one devote\r\n    his time and energy to the discussion of a question of no importance\r\n    such as the form of state, and so obstruct the progress of the\r\n    administration? But this is not all. The whole country is now\r\n    stirred up to an excited state and is wondering how long this\r\n    ever-changing situation is going to stop. The loss caused by this\r\n    state of affairs, though unnoticed, is incalculable. In the Odes,\r\n    it is written \"Alas! my brethren. Befriended of the countrymen. No\r\n    one wants rebellion. What has no parents?\" Let the critics remember\r\n    this--let them remember.\r\n\r\n    Some will say to me that a revolution is an unavoidable thing. Of\r\n    all things only the facts cannot be undone. Why then should I bother\r\n    myself especially as my last effort fell on deaf ears. This I\r\n    realize; but it is not my nature to abandon what is my conviction.\r\n    Therefore, although aware of the futility of my words, I cannot\r\n    refrain from uttering them all the same. Chu Yuan drowned himself in\r\n    the Pilo and Chia Sheng died from his horse. Ask them why they did\r\n    these things, they will say they did not know. Once I wrote a piece\r\n    of poetry containing the following lines:\r\n\r\n        \"Ten years after you will think of me,\r\n        The country is excited. To whom shall I speak?\"\r\n\r\n    I have spoken much in my life, and all my words have become subjects\r\n    for meditation ten years after they were uttered. Never, however,\r\n    have any of my words attracted the attention of my own countrymen\r\n    before a decade has spent itself. Is it a misfortune for my words or\r\n    a misfortune to the Country? My hope is that there will be no\r\n    occasion for the country to think of my present words ten years\r\n    hence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE DREAM EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\"THE PEOPLE'S VOICE,\" AND THE ACTION OF THE POWERS (FROM SEPTEMBER TO\r\nDECEMBER, 1915)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of Liang Ch'i-chao's appeal was noticeable at once: there\r\nwere ominous mutterings among all the great class of \"intellectuals\" who\r\nform such a remarkable element throughout the country. Nevertheless\r\nthere were no overt acts attempted against the authority of Peking.\r\nAlthough literary and liberal China was now thoroughly convinced that\r\nthe usurpation which Yuan Shih-kai proposed to practise would be a\r\nnational disgrace and lead to far-reaching complications, this force\r\nwere too scattered and too much under the power of the military to\r\ntender at once any active opposition as would have been the case in\r\nWestern countries. Yuan Shih-kai, measuring this situation very\r\naccurately, and aware that he could easily become an object of popular\r\ndetestation if the people followed the lead of the scholars, decided to\r\nplace himself outside and beyond the controversy by throwing the entire\r\nresponsibility on the Tsan Cheng Yuan, the puppet Senate he had erected\r\nin place of the parliament destroyed by his _coup d'état_ of the 4th\r\nNovember, 1913. In a message issued to that body on the 6th September,\r\n1915, he declared that although in his opinion the time was\r\ninappropriate for making any change in the form of State, the matter\r\ndemanded the most careful and serious consideration which he had no\r\ndoubt would be given to it. If a change of so momentous a character as\r\nwas now being publicly advocated were decided in too great a haste it\r\nmight create grave complications: therefore the opinion of the nation\r\nshould be consulted by the method of the ballot. And with this _nunc\r\ndimittis_ he officially washed his hands of a plot in which he had been\r\nthe prime mover.\r\n\r\nThe Senate now openly delivered itself over to the accomplishment of the\r\nscheme which had been broached by Yang Tu, the monarchist pamphleteer.\r\nAlthough this individual still posed as the leader of the movement, in\r\nreality he was nothing but the tool of a remarkable man, one Liang\r\nShih-yi, famous throughout the country as the most unscrupulous and\r\nadroit politician the Revolution had thrown up. This person, who is\r\nknown to have been gravely implicated in many assassinations, and who\r\nwas the instrument used in 1912 by Yuan Shih-kai to persuade the Manchu\r\nImperial Family to abdicate, had in a brief four years accumulated a\r\nvast fortune by the manipulations he had indulged in as Director-General\r\nof The Bank of Communications, an institution which, because it disposed\r\nof all the railway receipts, was always in funds even when the Central\r\nTreasury itself was empty. By making himself financially indispensable\r\nto Yuan Shih-kai he had become recognized as the power behind the\r\nThrone; for although, owing to foreign clamour, he had been dismissed\r\nfrom his old office of Chief Secretary to the President (which he had\r\nutilized to effect the sale of offices far and wide) he was a daily\r\nvisitor to the Presidential Palace and his creatures daily pulled all\r\nthe numerous strings.\r\n\r\nThe scheme now adopted by the Senate was to cause the provinces to flood\r\nPeking with petitions, sent up through the agency of \"The Society for\r\nthe Preservation of Peace,\" demanding that the Republic be replaced by\r\nthat form of government which the people alone understood, the name\r\nConstitutional Monarchy being selected merely as a piece of political\r\nwindow-dressing to please the foreign world. A vast amount of organizing\r\nhad to be done behind the scenes before the preliminaries were\r\ncompleted: but on the 6th October the scheme was so far advanced that in\r\nresponse to \"hosts of petitions\" the Senate, sitting in its capacity of\r\nLegislative Chamber (_Li Fa Yuan_) passed a so-called King-making bill\r\nin which elaborate regulations were adopted for referring the question\r\nunder discussion to a provincial referendum. According to this naïve\r\ndocument the provinces were to be organized into electoral colleges, and\r\nthe votes of the electors, after being recorded, were to be sent up\r\nto Peking for scrutiny. Some attempt was made to follow Dr. Goodnow's\r\nadvice to secure as far as possible that the various classes of the\r\ncommunity should be specially represented: and provision was therefore\r\nmade in the voting for the inclusion of \"learned scholars,\" Chambers of\r\nCommerce, and \"oversea merchants,\" whose votes were to be directly\r\nrecorded by their special delegates. To secure uniformly satisfactory\r\nresults, the whole election was placed absolutely and without\r\nrestriction in the hands of the high provincial authorities, who were\r\ninvited to bestow on the matter their most earnest attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern Peking: The Palace Entrance lined with Troops.\r\nNote the New-type Chinese Policeman in foreground.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Premier General Tuan Chi-jui, Head of the Cabinet\r\nwhich decided to declare war on Germany.]\r\n\r\nIn a Mandate, issued in response to this Bill, Yuan Shih-kai merely\r\nlimits himself to handing over the control of the elections and voting\r\nto the local authorities, safe in the knowledge that every detail of the\r\nplot had been carefully worked out in advance. By this time the fact\r\nthat a serious and dangerous movement was being actively pushed had been\r\nwell-impressed on the Peking Legations, and some anxiety was publicly\r\nmanifested. It was known that Japan, as the active enemy of Yuan\r\nShih-kai, could not remain permanently silent: and on the 28th October\r\nin association with Great Britain and Russia, she indeed made official\r\ninquiries at the Chinese Foreign Office regarding the meaning of the\r\nmovement. She was careful, however, to declare that it was her\r\nsolicitude for the general peace that alone dictated her action.[18]\r\nNevertheless, her warning had an unmistakable note about it and\r\noccasioned grave anxiety, since the ultimatum of the previous May in\r\nconnection with the Twenty-one Demands had not been forgotten. At the\r\nbeginning of November the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs, replying\r\nverbally to these representations, alleged that the movement had gone\r\ntoo far for it to be stopped and insisted that no apprehensions need be\r\nfelt by the Foreign Powers regarding the public safety. Dissatisfied by\r\nthis reply all the Entente Powers, now including France and Italy,\r\nrenewed their representations, receiving a few days later a formal Note\r\nin which absolute guarantees were given that law and order would be\r\nsedulously preserved. Baffled by this firmness, and conscious that\r\nfurther intervention in such matter would be fraught with grave\r\ndifficulties, the Entente Powers decided to maintain a watchful attitude\r\nbut to do no more publicly. Consequently events marched forward so\r\nrapidly that by December the deed was done, and Yuan Shih-kai had\r\napparently been elected unanimously Emperor of China by the provincial\r\nballot.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this extraordinary business was only made public\r\nmonths later with the outbreak of the Yunnan rebellion and the secession\r\nof the Southern provinces. In a remarkable publication, entitled\r\nsatirically \"The People's Will,\" the Southern Republican Party, which\r\nnow possessed access to all the confidential archives of the provinces,\r\npublished in full the secret instructions from Peking which had brought\r\nabout this elaborate comedy. Though considerations of space prevent all\r\ndocuments being included in our analysis, the salient ones are here\r\ntextually quoted so as to exhibit in its proper historical light the\r\ncharacter of the chief actor, and the _régime_ the Powers had\r\nsupported--until they were forced by Japan to be more honest. These\r\ndocuments, consisting mainly of telegraphic dispatches sent from Peking\r\nto the provinces, do more to explain the working of the Government of\r\nChina than a dozen treatises; for they drag into the garish light of day\r\nthe most secret Yamen machinery and show precisely how it is worked.\r\n\r\nThe play was set in motion by a circular code telegram sent out on the\r\n30th August by Tuan Chih-kuei, Governor of Moukden and one of Yuan\r\nShih-kai's most trusted lieutenants, the device of utilizing a centre\r\nother than the capital to propagate revolutionary ideas being a\r\nfamiliar one and looked upon as a very discreet procedure. This initial\r\ntelegram is a document that speaks for itself:\r\n\r\n    CODE TELEGRAM DATED AUGUST 30, 1915, FROM TUAN CHI-KUEI, MILITARY\r\n    GOVERNOR OF MOUKDEN, ET ALIA, CONTAINING INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRESENTING\r\n    PETITIONS TO PEKING IN THE NAME OF THE CITIZENS OF THE PROVINCES\r\n\r\n    To the Military and Civil Governors of the Provinces:--\r\n\r\n    (To be deciphered personally with the Council of State Code)\r\n\r\n    The proposal of changing the form of the State into a monarchy\r\n    having been unanimously agreed to by the provinces, the first step\r\n    to be taken has now to be decided. We propose that petitions be sent\r\n    in the name of the citizens of the respective provinces to the\r\n    Senate acting in the capacity of Legislative Chamber, so as to\r\n    demonstrate the wish of the people to have a monarchy. The acting\r\n    Legislative Chamber will then decide upon the course to be adopted.\r\n\r\n    The plan suggested is for each province to send in a separate\r\n    petition, the draft of which will be made in Peking and wired to the\r\n    respective provinces in due course. If you approve, you will insert\r\n    your name as well as those of the gentry and merchants of the\r\n    province who agree to the draft. These petitions are to be presented\r\n    one by one to the Legislative Chamber, as soon as it is convoked. At\r\n    all events, the change in the form of the State will have to be\r\n    effected under the colour of carrying out the people's will.\r\n\r\n    As leading members of political and military bodies, we should wait\r\n    till the opportune moment arrives when we will give collateral\r\n    support to the movement. Details of the plan will be made known to\r\n    you from time to time.\r\n\r\nThis method of circular telegrams, which had been inherited from the\r\nlast days of the Manchus, and vastly extended during the\r\n_post_-revolutionary period, was now to be used to the very utmost in\r\nindoctrinating the provinces with the idea that not only was the\r\nRepublic doomed but that prompt steps must be taken to erect the\r\nConstitutional Monarchy by use of fictitious legal machinery so that it\r\nshould not be said that the whole enterprise was a mere plot.\r\nAccordingly, on the 10th September, as a sequel to the telegram we have\r\njust quoted, an enormous circular message of several thousand words was\r\nsent in code from Peking to all the Military and Civil Governors in the\r\nprovinces instructing them precisely how to act in order to throw a\r\ncloak over the nefarious deed. After explaining the so-called \"Law on\r\nthe General Convention of the Citizens' Representatives\" (_i.e._\r\nnational referendum) the following illuminating sentences occur which\r\nrequire no comment showing as they do what apt pupils reactionary\r\nChinese are in the matter of ballot-fraud.\r\n\r\n    ... (1) The fact that no fewer than one hundred petitions for a\r\n    change in the form of State have been received from people residing\r\n    in all parts of the country shows that the people are of one mind\r\n    concerning this matter. Hence the words in the \"General Convention\r\n    Law\": \"to be decided by the General Convention of the Citizens'\r\n    Representatives,\" refer to nothing more than the formal approval of\r\n    the Convention and are by no means intended to give room for\r\n    discussion of any kind. Indeed, it was never intended that the\r\n    citizens should have any choice between a republic and a monarchy.\r\n    For this reason at the time of voting all the representatives must\r\n    be made unanimously to advocate a change of the Republic into a\r\n    Monarchy.\r\n\r\n    It behooves you, therefore, prior to the election and voting,\r\n    privately to search for such persons as are willing to express the\r\n    people's will in the sense above indicated. You will also make the\r\n    necessary arrangements beforehand, and devise every means to have\r\n    such persons elected, so that there may be no divergence of opinion\r\n    when the time arrives for putting the form of the State to the vote.\r\n\r\n    (2) Article 2 provides: \"The citizens' representatives shall be\r\n    elected by separate ballot signed by the person voting. The person\r\n    who obtains the greatest number of votes cast shall be declared\r\n    elected.\"\r\n\r\n    The citizens' representatives, though nominally elected by the\r\n    electors, are really appointed beforehand by you acting in the\r\n    capacity of Superintendent of Election. The principle of separate\r\n    signed ballot is adopted in this article with the object of\r\n    preventing the voters from casting their votes otherwise than as\r\n    directed, and of awakening in them a sense of responsibility for\r\n    their votes....\r\n\r\nThese admirable principles having been officially laid down by Peking,\r\nit is not hard to understand that the Military and Civil Governors in\r\nthe provinces, being anxious to retain their posts and conciliate the\r\ngreat personage who would be king, gave the problem their most earnest\r\nattention, and left no stone unturned to secure that there should be no\r\nawkward contretemps. On the 28th September, the Peking Government, being\r\nnow entirely surrendered into the hands of the plotters, thought it\r\nadvisable to give the common people a direct hint of what was coming, by\r\nsending circular instructions regarding the non-observance of the\r\nRepublican anniversary (10th October). The message in question is so\r\nfrankly ingenuous that it merits inclusion in this singular _dossier_:\r\n\r\n    CODE TELEGRAM DATED SEPTEMBER 26, 1915, FROM THE COUNCIL OF STATE TO\r\n    THE MILITARY AND CIVIL GOVERNORS OF THE PROVINCES RESPECTING THE\r\n    NON-OBSERVANCE OF THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n    To the Military and Civil Governors and the Military Commissioners\r\n    of the Provinces and the Intendant of Shanghai:--\r\n\r\n    (Code Telegram)\r\n\r\n    Now that a monarchical form of government has been advocated, the\r\n    National Anniversary in commemoration of the Republic should, of\r\n    course, be observed with least possible display, under the pretext\r\n    either of the necessity for economy owing to the impoverished\r\n    condition of the people, or of the advisability of celebrating the\r\n    occasion quietly so as to prevent disturbances arising in\r\n    consequence of the many rumours now afloat. In this way public peace\r\n    and order may be maintained on the one hand, money and trouble saved\r\n    on the other. How to put this suggestion into practice will be left\r\n    to your discretion.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) COUNCIL OF STATE.\r\n\r\nBy October such progress had been made in Peking in the general work of\r\norganizing this _coup d'état_ that, as we have seen, the Senate had\r\npassed on the 6th of that month the so-called \"King-making Bill.\" The\r\nvery next day, so that nothing should be left in doubt, the following\r\ncircular telegram was dispatched to all the provinces:\r\n\r\n    CODE TELEGRAM DATED OCTOBER 7, 1915, FROM CHU CHI-CHUN, MINISTER OF\r\n    THE INTERIOR, ET ALIA, DEVISING PLANS FOR NOMINATING YUAN SHIH-KAI\r\n    AS EMPEROR\r\n\r\n    To the Military and Civil Governors of the Provinces:--\r\n\r\n    (To be deciphered with the Hua Code)\r\n\r\n    Our telegram of the 12th ult. must have reached you by this time.\r\n\r\n    The Administrative Council, at a meeting held on the 4th inst.,\r\n    passed the Bill for a General Convention of the Citizens'\r\n    Representatives. Article 12 of the Bill was amended so as to contain\r\n    the following clause:--\"The Superintendent of Election may, in case\r\n    of necessity, delegate his functions to the several district\r\n    magistrates.\" This will soon be communicated officially to the\r\n    provinces. You are therefore requested to make the necessary\r\n    preparations beforehand in accordance with the instructions\r\n    contained in our telegram of the 29th September.\r\n\r\n    We propose that the following steps be taken after the votes have\r\n    been duly polled:--\r\n\r\n    (1) After the form of the state has been put to the vote, the\r\n    result should be reported to the sovereign (meaning Yuan Shih-kai)\r\n    and to the Administrative Council in the name of the General\r\n    Convention of the Citizens' Representatives.\r\n\r\n    (2) In the telegrams to be sent by the General Convention of the\r\n    Citizens' Representatives for nominating the emperor, the following\r\n    words should be specifically used: \"We respectfully nominate the\r\n    present President Yuan Shih-kai as Emperor of the Chinese Empire.\"\r\n\r\n    (3) The telegrams investing the Administrative Council with general\r\n    powers to act on behalf of the General Convention of the Citizens'\r\n    Representatives should be dispatched in the name of the General\r\n    Convention of the Citizens of the Provinces.\r\n\r\n    The drafts of the dispatches under the above-mentioned three heads\r\n    will be wired to you beforehand. As soon as the votes are cast,\r\n    these are to be shown to the representatives, who will sign them\r\n    after perusal. Peking should be immediately informed by telegram.\r\n\r\n    As for the telegrams to be sent by the commercial, military, and\r\n    political bodies, they should bear as many signatures as possible,\r\n    and be wired to the Central Government within three days after the\r\n    voting.\r\n\r\n    When the enthronement is promulgated by edict, letters of\r\n    congratulation from the General Convention of the Citizens'\r\n    Representatives, as well as from the commercial, military, and\r\n    political bodies, will also have to be sent in. You are therefore\r\n    requested to draw up these letters in advance.\r\n\r\n    This is specially wired for your information beforehand. The details\r\n    will be communicated by letter.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary circumstances it would have been thought that sufficiently\r\nimplicit instructions had already been given to permit leaving the\r\nmatter in the hands of the provincial authorities. Great anxiety,\r\nhowever, was beginning to reign in Peking owing to continual rumours\r\nthat dangerous opposition, both internal and external, was developing.\r\nIt was therefore held necessary to clinch the matter in such a way that\r\nno possible questions should be raised later. Accordingly, before the\r\nend of October--and only two days before the \"advice\" was tendered by\r\nJapan and her Allies,--the following additional instructions were\r\ntelegraphed wholesale to the provinces, being purposely designed to make\r\nit absolutely impossible for any slip to occur between cup and lip. The\r\ncareful student will not fail to notice in these remarkable messages\r\nthat as the game develops, all disguise is thrown to the four winds, and\r\nthe central and only important point, namely the prompt election and\r\nenthronement of Yuan Shih-kai as Emperor, insisted on with almost\r\nindecent directness, every possible precaution being taken to secure\r\nthat end:\r\n\r\n    CODE TELEGRAM DATED OCTOBER 26, 1915, FROM CHU CHI-CHUN, MINISTER OF\r\n    THE INTERIOR, ET ALIA, RESPECTING THE NOMINATION OF YUAN SHIH-KAI AS\r\n    EMPEROR\r\n\r\n    To the Military and Civil Governors of the Provinces:--\r\n\r\n    (To be deciphered with the Hua Code)\r\n\r\n    Your telegram of the 24th inst. came duly to hand.\r\n\r\n    After the form of the state has been put to the vote, the nomination\r\n    of Yuan Shih-kai as emperor should be made forthwith without further\r\n    voting. You should address the representatives and tell them that a\r\n    monarchy having been decided on, not even a single day should pass\r\n    without an emperor; that the citizens' representatives present\r\n    should nominate Yuan Shih-kai as the Great Emperor of the Chinese\r\n    Empire; and that if they are in favour of the proposal, they should\r\n    signify their assent by standing up. This done, the text of the\r\n    proposed letter of nomination from the citizens should be handed to\r\n    the representatives for their signatures; after which you should\r\n    again address them to the effect that in all matters concerning the\r\n    nomination and the petition for immediate enthronement, they may, in\r\n    the name of the citizens' representatives, invest the acting\r\n    Legislative Council with general powers to act on their behalf and\r\n    to do the necessary things until their petition is granted. The text\r\n    (already prepared) of the proposed telegram from the citizens'\r\n    representatives to the acting Legislative Council should then be\r\n    shown to the representatives for approval. Whereupon three separate\r\n    telegrams are to be drawn up: one giving the number of votes in\r\n    favour of a change in the form of the state, one containing the\r\n    original text of the letter of nomination, and the third concerning\r\n    the vesting of the acting Legislative Council with general powers to\r\n    act on behalf of the citizens' representatives. These should be sent\r\n    officially to the acting Legislative Council in the name of the\r\n    citizens' representatives. You should at the same time wire to the\r\n    President all that has taken place. The votes and the letter of\r\n    nomination are to be forwarded to Peking in due course.\r\n\r\n    As for the exact words to be inserted in the letter of nomination,\r\n    they have been communicated to you in our telegram of the 23rd inst.\r\n    These characters, forty-five in all, must on no account be altered.\r\n    The rest of the text is left to your discretion.\r\n\r\n    We may add that since the letter of nomination and the vesting of\r\n    the acting Legislative Council with general powers to act on behalf\r\n    of the citizens' representatives are matters which transgress the\r\n    bounds of the law, you are earnestly requested not to send to the\r\n    National Convention Bureau any telegraphic enquiry concerning them,\r\n    so that the latter may not find itself in the awkward position of\r\n    having to reply.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this telegram had been dispatched the longfeared action\r\non the part of Japan had been taken and a new situation had been\r\ncreated. The Japanese \"advice\" of the 28th October was in fact a\r\nveritable bombshell playing havoc with the house of cards which had been\r\nso carefully erected. But the intrigue had gone so far, and the prizes\r\nto be won by the monarchical supporters were so great that nothing could\r\ninduce them to retrace their footsteps. For a week and more a desperate\r\nstruggle went on behind the scenes in the Presidential Palace, since\r\nYuan Shih-kai was too astute a man not to understand that a most\r\nperilous situation was being rapidly created and that if things went\r\nwrong he would be the chief victim. But family influences and the voice\r\nof the intriguers proved too strong for him, and in the end he gave his\r\nreluctant consent to a further step. The monarchists, boldly acting on\r\nthe principle that possession is nine points of the law, called upon the\r\nprovinces to anticipate the vote and to substitute the title of Emperor\r\nfor that of President in all government documents and petitions so that\r\nmorally the question would be _chose jugée_.\r\n\r\n    CODE TELEGRAM DATED NOVEMBER 7, 1915, FROM CHU CHI-CHUN, MINISTER OF\r\n    THE INTERIOR, ET ALIA, ENJOINING A STRONG ATTITUDE TOWARDS\r\n    INTERFERENCE ON THE PART OF A CERTAIN FOREIGN POWER\r\n\r\n    To the Military and Civil Governors of the Provinces:--\r\n\r\n    (To be deciphered personally with the Council of State Code)\r\n\r\n    A certain foreign power, under the pretext that the Chinese people\r\n    are not of one mind and that troubles are to be apprehended, has\r\n    lately forced England and Russia to take part in tendering advice to\r\n    China. In truth, all foreign nations know perfectly well that there\r\n    will be no trouble, and they are obliged to follow the example of\r\n    that power. If we accept the advice of other Powers concerning our\r\n    domestic affairs and postpone the enthronement, we should be\r\n    recognizing their right to interfere. Hence action should under no\r\n    circumstance be deferred. When all the votes of the provinces\r\n    unanimously recommending the enthronement shall have reached Peking,\r\n    the Government will, of course, ostensibly assume a wavering and\r\n    compromising attitude, so as to give due regard to international\r\n    relations. The people, on the other hand, should show their firm\r\n    determination to proceed with the matter at all costs, so as to let\r\n    the foreign powers know that our people are of one mind. If we can\r\n    only make them believe that the change of the republic into a\r\n    monarchy will not in the least give rise to trouble of any kind, the\r\n    effects of the advice tendered by Japan will _ipso facto_ come to\r\n    nought.\r\n\r\n    At present the whole nation is determined to nominate Yuan Shih-kai\r\n    Emperor. All civil and military officers, being the natural leaders\r\n    of the people, should accordingly give effect to the nomination. If\r\n    this can be done without friction, the confidence of both Chinese\r\n    and foreigners in the Government will be greatly strengthened. This\r\n    is why we suggested to you in a previous telegram the necessity of\r\n    immediately substituting the title of \"Emperor\" for \"President.\" We\r\n    trust you will concur in our suggestion and carry it out without\r\n    delay.\r\n\r\n    We may add that this matter should be treated as strictly\r\n    confidential.\r\n\r\n    A reply is requested.\r\n\r\n    (Signed)\r\n\r\nThe die now being cast all that was left to be done was to rush through\r\nthe voting in the Provinces. Obsequious officials returned to the use of\r\nthe old Imperial phraseology and Yuan Shih-kai, even before his\r\n\"election,\" was memorialized as though he were the legitimate successor\r\nof the immense line of Chinese sovereigns who stretch back to the\r\nmythical days of Yao and Shun (2800 B.C.). The beginning of December saw\r\nthe voting completed and the results telegraphed to Peking; and on the\r\n11th December, the Senate hastily meeting, and finding that \"the\r\nNational Convention of Citizens\" had unanimously elected Yuan Shih-kai\r\nEmperor, formally offered him the Throne in a humble petition. Yuan\r\nShih-kai modestly refused: a second petition was promptly handed to him,\r\nwhich he was pleased to accept in the following historic document:\r\n\r\n    YUAN SHIH-KAI'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE IMPERIAL THRONE\r\n\r\n    The prosperity and decline of the country is a part of the\r\n    responsibility of every individual, and my love for the country is\r\n    certainly not less than that of others. But the task imposed on me\r\n    by the designation of the millions of people is of extraordinary\r\n    magnitude. It is therefore impossible for one without merit and\r\n    without virtue like myself to shoulder the burdens of State involved\r\n    in the enhancing of the welfare of the people, the strengthening of\r\n    the standing of the country, the reformation of the administration\r\n    and the advancement of civilization. My former declaration was,\r\n    therefore, the expression of a sincere heart and not a mere\r\n    expression of modesty. My fear was such that I could not but utter\r\n    the words which I have expressed. The people, however, have viewed\r\n    with increasing impatience that declaration and their expectation of\r\n    me is now more pressing than ever. Thus I find myself unable to\r\n    offer further argument just as I am unable to escape the position.\r\n    The laying of a great foundation is, however, a thing of paramount\r\n    importance and it must not be done in a hurry. I, therefore, order\r\n    that the different Ministries and Bureaux take concerted action in\r\n    making the necessary preparations in the affairs in which they are\r\n    concerned; and when that is done, let the same be reported to me\r\n    for promulgation. Meanwhile all our citizens should go on peacefully\r\n    in their daily vocations with the view to obtain mutual benefit. Let\r\n    not your doubts and suspicions hinder you in your work. All the\r\n    officials should on their part be faithful at their posts and\r\n    maintain to the best of their ability peace and order in their\r\n    localities, so that the ambition of the Great President to work for\r\n    the welfare of the people may thus be realized. Besides forwarding\r\n    the memorial of the principal representatives of the Convention of\r\n    the Representatives of Citizens and that of the provinces and\r\n    special administrative area to the Cheng Shih Tang and publishing\r\n    the same by a mandate, I have the honour to notify the acting Li Fan\r\n    Yuan as the principal representatives of the Convention of the\r\n    Representatives of Citizens, to this effect.\r\n\r\nCautious to the end, it will be seen that Yuan Shih-kai's very\r\nacceptance is so worded as to convey the idea that he is being forced to\r\na course of action which is against his better instincts. There is no\r\nword of what came to be called the Grand Ceremony, _i.e._ the\r\nenthronement. That matter is carefully left in abeyance and the\r\ngovernment departments simply told to make the necessary preparations.\r\nThe attitude of Peking officialdom is well-illustrated in a circular\r\ntelegram dispatched to the provinces three days later, the analysis of\r\nJapan's relationship to the Entente Powers being particularly revealing.\r\nThe obsequious note which pervades this document is also particularly\r\nnoticeable and shows how deeply the canker of sycophancy had now eaten\r\nin.\r\n\r\n    CODE TELEGRAM DATED DECEMBER 14, 1915, FROM THE OFFICE OF\r\n    COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE LAND AND NAVAL FORCES, RESPECTING CHINA'S\r\n    ATTITUDE TOWARDS FOREIGN NATIONS\r\n\r\n    To the Military and Civil Governors of the Provinces:--\r\n\r\n    (To be deciphered with the Hua Code)\r\n\r\n    On the 11th inst. the acting Legislature Council submitted a\r\n    memorial to the Emperor, reporting on the number of votes cast by\r\n    the people in favour of a monarchy and the letters of nomination of\r\n    Yuan Shih-kai as Emperor received from all parts of the country, and\r\n    begged that he would ascend the Throne at an early date. His Majesty\r\n    was, however, so modest as to decline. The Council presented a\r\n    second memorial couched in the most entreating terms, and received\r\n    an order to the effect that all the ministries and departments were\r\n    to make the necessary preparations for the enthronement. The details\r\n    of this decision appeared in the Presidential Orders of the past few\r\n    days, so need not be repeated now.\r\n\r\n    The people are unanimously of the opinion that in a republic the\r\n    foundation of the state is very apt to be shaken and the policy of\r\n    the government to be changed; and that consequently there is no\r\n    possibility of enjoying everlasting peace and prosperity, nor any\r\n    hope for the nation to become powerful. Now that the form of the\r\n    state has been decided in favour of a monarchy and the person who is\r\n    to sit on the Throne agreed upon, the country is placed on a secure\r\n    basis, and the way to national prosperity and strength is thus\r\n    paved.\r\n\r\n    Being the trustworthy ministers and, as it were, the hands and feet\r\n    of His Majesty, we are united to him by more ties than one. On this\r\n    account we should with one mind exert our utmost efforts in\r\n    discharging our duty of loyalty to the country. This should be the\r\n    spirit which guides us in our action at the beginning of the new\r\n    dynasty. As for the enthronement, it is purely a matter of ceremony.\r\n    Whether it takes place earlier or later is of no moment. Moreover\r\n    His Majesty has always been modest, and does everything with\r\n    circumspection. We should all appreciate his attitude.\r\n\r\n    So far as our external relations are concerned, a thorough\r\n    understanding must be come to with the foreign nations, so that\r\n    recognition of the new régime may not be delayed and diplomatic\r\n    intercourse interrupted. Japan, has, in conjunction with the Entente\r\n    Powers, tendered advice to postpone the change of the Republic into\r\n    an empire. As a divergence of opinion exists between Japan and the\r\n    Entente Powers, the advice is of no great effect. Besides, the\r\n    Elders and the Military Party in Japan are all opposed to the action\r\n    taken by their Government. Only the press in Tokio has spread all\r\n    sorts of threatening rumours. This is obviously the upshot of\r\n    ingenious plots on the part of irresponsible persons. If we postpone\r\n    the change we shall be subject to foreign interference, and the\r\n    country will consequently cease to exist as an independent state. On\r\n    the other hand, if we proclaim the enthronement forthwith, we shall\r\n    then be flatly rejecting the advice,--an act which, we apprehend,\r\n    will not be tolerated by Japan. As a result, she will place\r\n    obstacles in the way of recognition of the new order of things.\r\n\r\n    Since a monarchy has been decided to be the future form of the\r\n    state, and His Majesty has consented to accept the Throne, the\r\n    change may be said to be an accomplished fact. There is no question\r\n    about it. All persons of whatever walk of life can henceforth\r\n    continue their pursuits without anxiety. In the meantime we will\r\n    proceed slowly and surely with the enthronement, as it involves many\r\n    ceremonies and diplomatic etiquette. In this way both our domestic\r\n    and our foreign policies will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n    We hope you will comprehend our ideas and treat them as strictly\r\n    confidential.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) Office of the Commander-in-Chief of the Land and Naval\r\n    Force.\r\n\r\nAfter this one last step remained to be taken--it was necessary to burn\r\nall the incriminating evidence. On the 21st December, the last circular\r\ntelegram in connection with this extraordinary business was dispatched\r\nfrom Peking, a delightful naïveté being displayed regarding the\r\npossibility of certain letters and telegrams having transgressed the\r\nbounds of the law. All such delinquencies are to be mercifully wiped out\r\nby the simple and admirable method of invoking the help of the\r\nkitchen-fires. And in this appropriate way does the monster-play end.\r\n\r\n    CODE TELEGRAM DATED DECEMBER 21, 1915, FROM THE NATIONAL CONVENTION\r\n    BUREAU, ORDERING THE DESTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS CONNECTED WITH THE\r\n    ELECTIONS\r\n\r\n    To the Military and Civil Governors of the Provinces, the Military\r\n    Commissioners at Foochow and Kweiyang; the Military Commandants at\r\n    Changteh, Kweihuating, and Kalgan; and the Commissioner of Defence\r\n    at Tachienlu:--(To be deciphered with the Hua Code)\r\n\r\n    The change in the form of the state is now happily accomplished.\r\n    This is due not only to the unity of the people's minds, but more\r\n    especially to the skill with which, in realizing the object of\r\n    saving the country, you have carried out the propaganda from the\r\n    beginning, managed affairs according to the exigencies of the\r\n    occasions, and adapted the law to suit the circumstances. The people\r\n    have, to be sure, become tired of the Republic; yet unless you had\r\n    taken the lead, they would not have dared to voice their sentiments.\r\n    We all appreciate your noble efforts.\r\n\r\n    Ever since the monarchical movement was started, the people as well\r\n    as the high officials in the different localities have repeatedly\r\n    petitioned for the change, a fact which proves that the people's\r\n    will is in favour of it. In order to enable the people to express\r\n    their will through a properly constituted organ, the General\r\n    Convention of the Citizens' Representatives has been created.\r\n\r\n    Since the promulgation of the Law on the Organization of the\r\n    Citizens' Representatives, we, who are devoted to the welfare of the\r\n    state, desire to see that the decisions of that Convention do not\r\n    run counter to the wishes of the people. We are so anxious about the\r\n    matter that we have striven so to apply the law to meet the\r\n    circumstances as to carry out our designs. It is out of patriotic\r\n    motives that we have adopted the policy of adhering to the law,\r\n    whenever possible, and, at the same time, of yielding to expediency,\r\n    whenever necessary. During the progress of this scheme there may\r\n    have been certain letters and telegrams, both official and private,\r\n    which have transgressed the bounds of the law. They will become\r\n    absolutely useless after the affair is finished.' Moreover, no\r\n    matter how carefully their secrets may have been guarded, still they\r\n    remain as permanent records which might compromise us; and in the\r\n    event of their becoming known to foreigners, we shall not escape\r\n    severe criticism and bitter attacks, and, what is worse, should they\r\n    be handed down as part of the national records, they will stain the\r\n    opening pages of the history of the new dynasty. The Central\r\n    Government, after carefully considering the matter, has concluded\r\n    that it would be better to sort out and burn the documents so as to\r\n    remove all unnecessary records and prevent regrettable consequences.\r\n    For these reasons you are hereby requested to sift out all\r\n    telegrams, letters, and dispatches concerning the change in the form\r\n    of the state, whether official or private, whether received from\r\n    Peking or the provinces (excepting those required by law to be filed\r\n    on record), and cause the same to be burnt in your presence. As for\r\n    those which have already been communicated to the local officials,\r\n    you are likewise requested to order them to be returned immediately;\r\n    to commit them to the flames; and to report to this Bureau for\r\n    future reference the total number of documents so destroyed.\r\n\r\n    The present change in the form of the state constitutes the most\r\n    glorious episode of our national history. Not only is this far\r\n    superior to the succession of dynasties by right of conquest or in\r\n    virtue of voluntary transfer (as in the days of Yao and Shun), but\r\n    it compares favourably with all the peaceful changes that have taken\r\n    place in western politics. Everything will be perfect if whatever\r\n    mars it (meaning the documents) is done away with.\r\n\r\n    All of you have acquired greatness in founding the dynasty. You will\r\n    doubtless concur with us, and will, we earnestly hope, lose no time\r\n    in cautiously and secretly carrying out our request.\r\n\r\n    We respectfully submit this to your consideration and wait for a\r\n    reply.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) NATIONAL CONVENTION BUREAU.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] A very remarkable illustration of the manner in which Yuan Shih-kai\r\nwas trapped by official Japan during the monarchist movement has\r\nrecently been extensively quoted in the Far Eastern press. Here is the\r\nsubstance of a Japanese (vernacular) newspaper account showing the uses\r\nto which Japanese politicians put the Press:\r\n\r\n\"... When that question was being hotly discussed in China Marquis\r\nOkuma, interviewed by the Press, stated that monarchy was the right form\r\nof government for China and that in case a monarchical régime was\r\nrevived Yuan Shih-kai was the only suitable person to sit on the Throne.\r\nWhen this statement by Marquis Okuma was published in the Japanese\r\npapers, Yuan Shih-kai naturally concluded that the Japanese Government,\r\nat the head of which Marquis Okuma was, was favourably disposed towards\r\nhim and the monarchical movement. It can well be imagined, therefore,\r\nhow intense was his surprise when he later received a warning from the\r\nJapanese Government against the resuscitation of the monarchy in China.\r\nWhen this inconsistency in the Marquis's actions was called in question\r\nin the Japanese House of Representatives, the ex-Premier absolutely\r\ndenied the truth of the statement attributed to him by the Japanese\r\npapers, without any show of hesitancy, and thus boldly shirked the\r\nresponsibility which, in reality, lay on him....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\"THE THIRD REVOLUTION\"\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLT OF YUNNAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the circumstances it was only natural that the extraordinary\r\nchapter of history we have just narrated should have marched to its\r\nappointed end in just as extraordinary a manner as it had commenced.\r\nYuan Shih-kai, the uncrowned king, actually enjoyed in peace his empty\r\ntitle only for a bare fortnight, the curious air of unreality becoming\r\nmore and more noticeable after the first burst of excitement occasioned\r\nby his acceptance of the Throne had subsided. Though the year 1915 ended\r\nwith Peking brightly illuminated in honour of the new régime, which had\r\nadopted in conformity with Eastern precedents a new calendar under the\r\nstyle of Hung Hsien or \"glorious Constitutionalism,\" that official joy\r\nwas just as false as the rest had been and awakened the incredulity of\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day ominous rumours had spread in the diplomatic circle\r\nthat dramatic developments in South China had come which not only\r\ndirectly challenged the patient plotting of months but made a débâcle\r\nappear inevitable. Very few days afterwards it was generally known that\r\nthe southernmost province of China, Yunnan--on the borders of\r\nFrench-Indo-China--had telegraphed the Central Government a thinly\r\nveiled ultimatum, that either the monarchy must be cancelled and the\r\nchief monarchists executed at once or the province would take such steps\r\nas were deemed advisable. The text of these telegrams which follows was\r\npublished by the courageous editor of the Peking Gazette on the 31st\r\nDecember and electrified the capital. The reader will not fail to note\r\nhow richly allegorical they are in spite of their dramatic nature:\r\n\r\n    FIRST TELEGRAM\r\n\r\n    To the Great President:\r\n\r\n    Since the question of _Kuo-ti_ (form of State) was raised\r\n    consternation has seized the public mind; and on account of the\r\n    interference of various Powers the spirit of the people has been\r\n    more and more aroused. They have asked the question:--\"Who has\r\n    invited the disaster, and brought upon us such great disgrace?\" Some\r\n    one must be responsible for the alien insults heaped on us.\r\n\r\n    We have learned that each day is given to rapid preparations for the\r\n    Grand Ceremony; and it is now true that, internally, public opinion\r\n    has been slighted, and, externally, occasions have been offered to\r\n    foreigners to encroach on our rights. Our blood runs cold when we\r\n    face the dangers at the door. Not once but twice hath the President\r\n    taken the oath to observe and obey the Constitution and protect and\r\n    maintain the Republic. The oath was sworn before Heaven and Earth;\r\n    and it is on record in the hearts of millions of people and the\r\n    words thereof still echo in the ears of the people of all nations.\r\n    In the Classics it is said that \"in dealing with the people of the\r\n    country, faith is of the essence of great rule.\" Again it is written\r\n    that \"without faith a people cannot endure as a nation.\" How then\r\n    can one rule the people when he \"eats\" his own words and tears his\r\n    own oath? Principle has now been cast to the winds and the _Kuo-ti_\r\n    has been changed. We know not how the country can be administered.\r\n\r\n    Since the suspension of the National Assembly and the revision of\r\n    the Constitution, the powers of Government have been centred in one\r\n    person, with the implied freedom to do whatever seems meet without\r\n    let or hindrance. If the Government were to use this power in order\r\n    to reform the administration and consolidate the foundations of the\r\n    nation, there would be no fear of failure. For the whole country\r\n    would submit to the measures of the Central Government. Thus there\r\n    is not the least necessity to commit treason by changing the\r\n    _Kuo-ti_.\r\n\r\n    But although the recent decision of the Citizens' Representatives in\r\n    favour of a monarchy and the request of the high local officials for\r\n    the President's accession to the Throne have been represented as\r\n    inspired by the unanimous will of the people, it is well known that\r\n    the same has been the work of ignoble men whose bribery and\r\n    intimidation have been sanctioned by the authorities. Although inept\r\n    efforts have been made to disguise the deceit, the same is unhidden\r\n    to the eyes of the world.\r\n\r\n    Fortunately it is said that the President has from the very\r\n    beginning maintained a calm attitude, speaking not his mind on the\r\n    subject. It is now as easy to turn the tide as the reversing of the\r\n    palm. It may be objected that if the \"face\" of the nation is not\r\n    preserved in view of the interference of Foreign Powers, there will\r\n    be great danger in future. But it must be observed that official\r\n    declaration can only be made in accordance with the will of the\r\n    people, the tendency of which can easily be ascertained by searching\r\n    for the facts. If the will of the people that the country should be\r\n    the common property of the Nation be obeyed and the idea of the\r\n    President that a Dynasty is as cheap as a worn-out shoe is heeded,\r\n    the latter has it in his power to loosen the string that suspends\r\n    the bell just as much as the person who has hung it. If the wrong\r\n    path is not forsaken, it is feared that as soon as the heart of the\r\n    people is gone, the country will be broken to pieces and the\r\n    dismemberment of the Nation will take place when alien pressure is\r\n    applied to us. We who have hitherto received favours from the\r\n    President and have received high appointments from him hereby offer\r\n    our faithful advice in the spirit of men who are sailing in common\r\n    in a boat that is in danger; we speak as do those who love sincerity\r\n    and cherish the unbroken word. We hope that the President will, with\r\n    courage, refuse to listen to the speech of evil counsellors and heed\r\n    the voice of conscience and of honour. We further hope that he will\r\n    renew his promise to protect the Republic; and will publicly swear\r\n    that a monarchical system will never again appear.\r\n\r\n    Thus the heart of the people will be settled and the foundations of\r\n    the Nation will be consolidated. Then by enlisting the services of\r\n    sagacious colleagues in order to surmount the difficulties of the\r\n    time and sweeping away all corruption and beginning anew with the\r\n    people, it may be that the welfare and interest of the Nation will\r\n    be furthered. In sending this telegram our eyes are wet with tears,\r\n    knowing not what more to say. We respectfully await the order of the\r\n    President with our troops under arms.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) THE GOVERNORS OF YUNNAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SECOND TELEGRAM\r\n\r\n    For the Perusal of the Great President:--\r\n\r\n    In our humble opinion the reason why the people--Chinese and\r\n    foreign--cannot excuse the President is because the movement for the\r\n    change of Kuo-ti has been inspired, and indeed actually originated\r\n    in Peking, and that the ringleaders of the plot against the _Min\r\n    Kuo_ are all \"bosom-men\" of the President. The Chou An Hui,\r\n    organized by Yang Tu and five other men, set the fire ablaze and the\r\n    circular telegram sent by Chu Chi-chien and six other persons\r\n    precipitated the destruction of the Republican structure. The\r\n    President knew that the bad deed was being done and yet he did\r\n    nothing to arrest the same or punish the evil-doers. The people\r\n    therefore, are suspicious. A mandate was issued on the 24th of the\r\n    11th month of the 3rd year in which it is affirmed: \"Democracy and\r\n    republicanism are laid down in the Constitutional Compact; and there\r\n    is also a law relating to the punishment of those who spread\r\n    sedition in order to disturb the minds of the people. If any one\r\n    Shall hereafter dare to advance strange doctrines and misconstrue\r\n    the meaning of the Constitution, he will be punished severely in\r\n    accordance with the law of sedition.\"\r\n\r\n    Yang Tu for having publicly organized the said Society and Chu\r\n    Chi-chien for having directly plotted by telegram are the principal\r\n    offenders in the present flagrant case of sedition. As their crimes\r\n    are obvious and the subject of abundant proof, we hereby ask the\r\n    President to carry out at once the terms of the said mandate and\r\n    publicly execute Yang Tu, Sun Yu-yun, Yen Fu, Liu Shih-pei, Li\r\n    Hsieh-ho, Hu Ying, Chu Chi-chien, Tuan Chih-kuei, Chow Tzu-chi,\r\n    Liang Shih-yi, Chang Cheng-fang and Yuan Nai-kuan to the end that\r\n    the whole nation may be pacified. Then, and not till then, will the\r\n    world believe in the sincerity of the President, in his love for the\r\n    country and his intention to abide by the law. All the troops and\r\n    people here are in anger; and unless a substantial proof from the\r\n    Central Authorities is forthcoming, guaranteeing the maintenance of\r\n    the Republic, it will be impossible to suppress or pacify them. We\r\n    await a reply within twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) THE GOVERNORS OF YUNNAN PROVINCE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Feng Kuo-chang, President of the Republic.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Scholar Liang Chi-chao, sometime Minister of Justice,\r\nand the foremost \"Brain\" in China.]\r\n\r\nIt was evident from the beginning that pride prevented Yuan Shih-kai\r\nfrom retreating from the false position he had taken up. Under his\r\ninstructions the State Department sent a stream of powerful telegraphic\r\nmessages to Yunnan attempting to dissuade the Republican leaders from\r\nrevolt. But the die had been cast and very gravely the standard of\r\nrebellion was raised in the capital city of Yunnan and the people\r\nexhorted to shed their blood. Everything pointed to the fact that this\r\nrising was to be very different from the abortive July outbreak of 1913.\r\nThere was a soberness and a deliberation about it all which impressed\r\nclose observers with a sense of the ominous end which was now in sight.\r\n\r\nStill Peking remained purblind. During the month of January the\r\nsplendour of the dream empire, which was already dissolving into thin\r\nair, filled the newspapers. It was reported that an Imperial Edict\r\nprinted on Yellow Paper announcing the enthronement was ready for\r\nuniversal distribution: that twelve new Imperial Seals in jade or gold\r\nwere being manufactured: that a golden chair and a magnificent State\r\nCoach in the style of Louis XV were almost ready. Homage to the portrait\r\nof Yuan Shih-kai by all officials throughout the country was soon to be\r\nordered; sycophantic scholars were busily preparing a volume poetically\r\nentitled \"The Golden Mirror of the Empire,\" in which the virtues of the\r\nnew sovereign were extolled in high-sounding language. A recondite\r\nsignificance, it was said, was to be given to the old ceremonial dress,\r\nwhich was to be revived, from the fact that every official would carry a\r\nHu or Ivory Tablet to be held against the breast. The very mention of\r\nthis was sufficient to make the local price of ivory leap skywards! In\r\nthe privacy of drawing-rooms the story went the rounds that Yuan\r\nShih-kai, now completely deluded into believing in the success of his\r\ngreat scheme, had held a full dress rehearsal of a ceremony which would\r\nbe the first one at his new Court when he would invest the numerous\r\nladies of his establishment with royal rank. Seated on his Throne he had\r\nbeen engaged in instructing these interested females, already robed in\r\nmagnificent costumes, in the parts they were to play, when he had\r\nnoticed the absence of the Korean Lady--a consort he had won, it is\r\nsaid, in his Seoul days in competition against the Japanese Envoy\r\naccredited to Korea, thereby precipitating the war of 1894-95.[19] The\r\nKorean Lady had refused to enter the Throne-room, he was told, because\r\nshe was dissatisfied with the rank he proposed to confer on her. Sternly\r\nhe sent for her and told her to take her place in the circle. But no\r\nsooner had she arrived than hysterically she screamed, \"You told me when\r\nyou wedded me that no wife would be my superior: now I am counted only a\r\nsecondary consort.\" With that she hurled herself at the eldest wife who\r\nwas occupying the post of honour and assailed her bitterly. Amidst the\r\ngeneral confusion the would-be-Emperor hastily descended from his Throne\r\nand vainly intervened, but the women were not to be parted until their\r\nrobes were in tatters.\r\n\r\nIn such childishnesses did Peking indulge when a great disaster was\r\npreparing. To explain what had occurred in Yunnan it is necessary to go\r\nback and tell the story of a remarkable young Chinese--General Tsao-ao,\r\nthe soul of the new revolt.\r\n\r\nIn the revolution of 1911 each province had acted on the assumption that\r\nit possessed inherent autonomous rights and could assume sovereignty as\r\nsoon as local arrangements had allowed the organization of a complete\r\nprovisional government. Yunnan had been one of the earliest provinces to\r\nfollow the lead of the Wuchang rebels and had virtually erected itself\r\ninto a separate republic, which attracted much attention because of the\r\niron discipline which was preserved. Possessing a fairly well-organized\r\nmilitary system, largely owing to the proximity of the French frontier\r\nand the efforts which a succession of Viceroys had made to provide\r\nadequate frontier defence, it was amply able to guarantee its newly won\r\nautonomy. General Tsao-ao, then in command of a division of troops had\r\nbeen elected Generalissimo of the province; and bending himself to his\r\ntask in very few weeks he had driven into exile all officials who\r\nadhered to the Imperialist cause and made all local institutions\r\ncompletely self-supporting. Even in 1911 it had been reported that this\r\nyoung man dreamed of founding a dynasty for himself in the mountains of\r\nSouth China--an ambition by no means impossible of realization since he\r\nhad received a first-class military education in the Tokio Military\r\nSchools and was thoroughly up-to-date and conversant with modern\r\ntheories of government.\r\n\r\nThese reports had at the time greatly concerned Yuan Shih-kai who heard\r\nit stated by all who knew him that the Yunnan leader was a genius in his\r\nown way. In conformity with his policy of bringing to Peking all who\r\nmight challenge his authority, he had induced General Tsao-ao, since the\r\nlatter had played no part in the rebellion of 1913, to lay down his\r\noffice of Yunnan Governor-General and join him in the capital at the\r\nbeginning of 1914--another high provincial appointment being held out to\r\nhim as a bait.\r\n\r\nOnce in Peking, however, General Tsao-ao had been merely placed in\r\ncharge of an office concerned with the reorganization of the land-tax,\r\nnominally a very important piece of work long advocated by foreign\r\ncritics. But as there were no funds available, and as the purpose was\r\nplainly merely to keep him under observation, he fretted at the\r\nrestraint, and became engaged in secret political correspondence with\r\nmen who had been exiled abroad. As he was soon an open suspect, in order\r\nto avoid arrest he had taken the bold step at the very inception of the\r\nmonarchy movement of heading the list of Generals in residence in Peking\r\nwho petitioned the Senate to institute a Monarchy, this act securing him\r\nagainst summary treatment. But owing to his secret connection with the\r\nscholar Liang Chi-chao, who had thrown up his post of Minister of\r\nJustice and left the capital in order to oppose the new movement, he was\r\nwatched more and more carefully--his death being even hinted at.\r\n\r\nHe was clever enough to meet this ugly development with a masterly\r\npiece of trickery conceived in the Eastern vein. One day a carefully\r\narranged dispute took place between him and his wife, and the police\r\nwere angrily called in to see that his family and all their belongings\r\nwere taken away to Tientsin as he refused any longer to share the same\r\nroof with them. Being now alone in the capital, he apparently abandoned\r\nhimself to a life of shameless debauch, going nightly to the haunts of\r\npleasure and becoming a notorious figure in the great district in the\r\nOuter City of Peking which is filled with adventure and adventuresses\r\nand which is the locality from which Haroun al-Raschid obtained through\r\nthe medium of Arab travellers his great story of \"Aladdin and the\r\nWonderful Lamp.\" When governmental suspicions were thoroughly lulled, he\r\narranged with a singing-girl to let him out by the backdoor of her house\r\nat dawn from whence he escaped to the railway-station, rapidly reaching\r\nTientsin entirely unobserved.\r\n\r\nThe morning was well-advanced before the detectives who nightly watched\r\nhis movements became suspicious. Then finding that his whereabouts were\r\nunknown to the coachman dozing on the box of his carriage, they roughly\r\nentered the house where he had passed the night only to find that the\r\nbird had flown. Hasty telegrams were dispatched in every direction,\r\nparticularly to Tientsin--the great centre for political refugees--and\r\nhis summary arrest ordered. But fortune favoured him. A bare\r\nquarter-of-an-hour before the police began their search he had embarked\r\nwith his family on a Japanese steamer lying in the Tientsin river and\r\ncould snap his fingers at Yuan Shih-kai.\r\n\r\nOnce in Japan he lost no time in assembling his revolutionary friends\r\nand in a body they embarked for South China. As rapidly as possible he\r\nreached Yunnan province from Hongkong, travelling by way of the French\r\nTonkin railway. Entering the province early in December he found\r\neverything fairly ready for revolt, though there was a deficiency in\r\narms and munitions which had to be made good. Yuan Shih-kai, furious at\r\nthis evasion, had telegraphed to confidential agents in Yunnan to kill\r\nhim at sight, but fortunately he was warned and spared to perform his\r\nimportant work. Had a fortnight of grâce been vouchsafed him, he would\r\nhave probably made the most brilliant modern campaign that has been\r\nwitnessed in China, for he was an excellent soldier. Acting from the\r\nnatural fortress of Yunnan it was his plan to descend suddenly on the\r\nYangtsze Valley by way of Chungking and to capture the upper river in\r\none victorious march thus closing the vast province of Szechuan to the\r\nNorthern troops. But circumstances had made it imperative for him and\r\nhis friends to telegraph the Yunnan ultimatum a fortnight sooner than it\r\nshould have been dispatched, and the warning thus conveyed to the\r\nCentral Government largely crippled the Yunnan offensive.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which had made instant action necessary were as\r\nfollows. As we have seen from the record of the previous risings, the\r\nregion of the Yangtsze river has superlative value in Chinese politics.\r\nOffering as it does an easy road into the heart of the country and\r\ntouching more than half the Provinces, it is indeed a priceless means of\r\ncommunication, and for this reason Yuan Shih-kai had been careful after\r\nthe crushing of the rebellion of 1913 to load the river-towns with his\r\ntroops under the command of Generals he believed incorruptible. Chief of\r\nthese was General Feng Kuo-chang at Nanking who held the balance of\r\npower on the great river, and whose politics, though not entirely above\r\nsuspicion, had been proof against all the tempting offers South China\r\nmade to him until the ill-fated monarchy movement had commenced. But\r\nduring this movement General Feng Kuo-chang had expressed himself in\r\nsuch contemptuous terms of the would-be Emperor that orders had been\r\ngiven to another high official--Admiral Tseng, Garrison Commissioner at\r\nShanghai--to have him assassinated. Instead of obeying his instructions,\r\nAdmiral Tseng had conveyed a warning to his proposed victim, the\r\nconsequence being that the unfortunate admiral was himself brutally\r\nmurdered on the streets of Shanghai by revolver-shots for betraying the\r\nconfidence of his master. After this dénouement it was not very strange\r\nthat General Feng Kuo-chang should have intimated to the Republican\r\nParty that as soon as they entered the Yangtsze Valley he would throw in\r\nhis lot with them together with all his troops. Of this Yuan Shih-kai\r\nbecame aware through his extraordinary system of intelligence; and\r\nfollowing his usual practice he had ordered General Feng Kuo-chang to\r\nPeking as Chief of the General Staff--an appointment which would place\r\nhim under direct surveillance. First on one excuse, then on another,\r\nGeneral Feng Kuo-chang had managed to delay his departure from day to\r\nday without actually coming under the grave charge of refusing to obey\r\norders. But finally the position was such that he telegraphed to General\r\nTsao-ao that unless the Yunnan arrangements were hastened he would have\r\nto leave Nanking--and abandon this important centre to one of Yuan\r\nShih-kai's own henchmen--which meant the end of all hopes of the\r\nYangtsze Valley rising _en masse_.\r\n\r\nIt was to save Feng Kuo-chang, then, that the young patriot Tsao-ao\r\ncaused the ultimatum to be dispatched fourteen days too soon, _i.e._,\r\nbefore the Yunnan troops had marched over the mountain-barrier into the\r\nneighbouring province of Szechuan and seized the city of\r\nChungking--which would have barred the advance of the Northern troops\r\npermanently as the river defiles even when lightly defended are\r\nimpassable here to the strongest force. It was largely due to the\r\nhardships of forced marches conducted over these rugged mountains, which\r\nraise their precipitous peaks to the heavens, that Tsao-ao subsequently\r\nlost his life, his health being undermined by exposure, tuberculosis\r\nfinally claiming him. But one thing at least did his resolute action\r\nsecure. With Yunnan in open revolt and several other provinces about to\r\nfollow suit, General Feng Kuo-chang was able to telegraph Peking that it\r\nwas impossible for him to leave his post at Nanking without rebellion\r\nbreaking out. This veiled threat was understood by Yuan Shih-kai. Grimly\r\nhe accepted the checkmate.\r\n\r\nYet all the while he was acting with his customary energy. Troops were\r\ndispatched towards Szechuan in great numbers, being tracked up the\r\nrapids of the upper river on board fleets of junks which were ruthlessly\r\ncommandeered. Now commenced an extraordinary race between the Yunnan\r\nmountaineers and the Northern plainsmen for the strategic city of\r\nChungking. For some weeks the result was in doubt; for although Szechuan\r\nprovince was held by Northern garrisons, they were relatively speaking\r\nweak and surrounded by hostile Szechuan troops whose politics were\r\ndoubtful. In the end, however, Yuan Shih-kai's men reached their goal\r\nfirst and Chungking was saved. Heavy and continuous mountain-fighting\r\nensued, in which the Southern troops were only partially successful.\r\nBeing less well-equipped in mountain artillery and less well-found in\r\ngeneral supplies they were forced to rely largely on guerrilla warfare.\r\nThere is little accurate record of the desperate fighting which occurred\r\nin this wild region but it is known that the original Yunnan force was\r\nnearly annihilated, and that of the remnant numbers perished from\r\ndisease and exposure.\r\n\r\nOther events were, however, hastening the débâcle. Kueichow province had\r\nalmost at once followed the example of Yunnan. A third province,\r\nKwangsi, under a veteran who was much respected, General Lu Yun Ting,\r\nwas soon added; and gradually as in 1911 it became clear that the army\r\nwas only one chessman in a complicated and very ingenious game.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] This story is firmly believed by many, namely that a beautiful\r\nwoman caused the loss of Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\"THE THIRD REVOLUTION\" (Continued)\r\n\r\nTHE DOWNFALL AND DEATH OF YUAN SHIH-KAI\r\n\r\n\r\nAs had been the case during the previous revolts, it was not publicly or\r\non the battlefield that the most crucial work was performed: the\r\ndecisive elements in this new and conclusive struggle were marshalled\r\nbehind the scenes and performed their task unseen. Though the\r\nmandarinate, at the head of which stood Yuan Shih-kai, left no stone\r\nunturned to save itself from its impending fate, all was in vain. Slowly\r\nbut inexorably it was shown that a final reckoning had to be faced.\r\n\r\nThe reasons are not far to seek. Too long had the moral sense of\r\neducated men been outraged by common fraud and deceit for any\r\ncontinuance of a régime which had disgraced China for four long years to\r\nbe humanly possible. Far and wide the word was rapidly passing that Yuan\r\nShih-kai was not the man he had once been; he was in reality feeble and\r\ncholeric--prematurely old from too much history-making and too many\r\nhours spent in the harem. He had indeed become a mere Colossus with feet\r\nof clay,--a man who could be hurled to the ground by precisely the same\r\nmethods he had used to destroy the Manchus. Even his foreign supporters\r\nwere becoming tired and suspicious of him, endless trouble being now\r\nassociated with his name, there being no promise that quieter times\r\ncould possibly come so long as he lived. A very full comprehension of\r\nthe general position is given by perusing the valedictory letter of the\r\nleader of the Chinese intellectuals, that remarkable man--Liang\r\nCh'i-chao, who in December had silently and secretly fled from Tientsin\r\non information reaching him that his assassination was being planned. On\r\nthe even of his departure he had sent the following brilliant document\r\nto the Emperor-elect as a reply to an attempt to entrap him to Peking, a\r\ndocument the meaning of which was clear to every educated man. Its\r\nexquisite irony mixed with its bluntness told all that was necessary to\r\ntell--and forecasted the inevitable fall. It runs:--\r\n\r\n    For the Kind Perusal of the Great President:--\r\n\r\n    A respectful reading of your kind instructions reveals to me your\r\n    modesty and the brotherly love which you cherish for your humble\r\n    servant, who is so moved by your heart-touching sympathy that he\r\n    does not know how to return your kindness. A desire then seized him\r\n    to submit his humble views for your wise consideration; though on\r\n    the one hand he has thought that he might fail to express what he\r\n    wishes to say if he were to do so in a set of brief words, while on\r\n    the other hand he has no desire to trouble the busy mind of one on\r\n    whose shoulders fall myriads of affairs, with views expressed in\r\n    many words. Furthermore, what Ch'i-chao desires to say relates to\r\n    what can be likened to the anxiety of one who, fearing that the\r\n    heavens may some day fall on him, strives to ward off the\r\n    catastrophe. If his words should be misunderstood, it would only\r\n    increase his offence. Time and again he has essayed to write; but\r\n    each time he has stopped short. Now he is going South to visit his\r\n    parents; and looking at the Palace-Gate from afar, he realizes that\r\n    he is leaving the Capital indefinitely. The thought that he has been\r\n    a protégé of the Great President and that dangers loom ahead before\r\n    the nation as well as his sense of duty and friendly obligations,\r\n    charge him with the responsibility of saying something. He therefore\r\n    begs to take the liberty of presenting his humble but extravagant\r\n    views for the kind consideration of the Great President.\r\n\r\n    The problem of _Kuo-ti_ (form of State) appears to have gone too far\r\n    for reconsideration: the position is like unto a man riding on the\r\n    back of a wild tiger.... Ch'i-chao therefore at one moment thought\r\n    he would say no more about it, since added comment thereon might\r\n    make him all the more open to suspicion. But a sober study of the\r\n    general situation and a quiet consideration of the possible future\r\n    make him tremble like an autumn leaf; for the more he meditates, the\r\n    more dangerous the situation appears. It is true that the minor\r\n    trouble of \"foreign advice\" and rebel plotting can be settled and\r\n    guarded against; but what Ch'i-chao bitterly deplores is that the\r\n    original intention of the Great President to devote his life and\r\n    energy to the interest of the country--an intention he has fulfilled\r\n    during the past four years--will be difficult to explain to the\r\n    world in future. The trust of the world in the Great President would\r\n    be shattered with the result that the foundation of the country will\r\n    be unsettled. Do not the Sages say: \"In dealing with the people aim\r\n    at faithfulness?\" If faithfulness to promises be observed by those\r\n    in authority, then the people will naturally surrender themselves.\r\n    Once, however, a promise is broken, it will be as hard to win back\r\n    the people's trust as to ascend to the very Heavens. Several times\r\n    have oaths of office been uttered; yet even before the lips are dry,\r\n    action hath falsified the words of promise. In these circumstances,\r\n    how can one hope to send forth his orders to the country in the\r\n    future, and expect them to be obeyed? The people will say \"he\r\n    started in righteousness but ended in self-seeking: how can we trust\r\n    our lives in his hands, if he should choose to pursue even further\r\n    his love of self-enrichment?\" It is possible for Ch'i-chao to\r\n    believe that the Great President has no desire to make profit for\r\n    himself by the sacrifice of the country, but how can the mass of the\r\n    people--who believe only what they are told--understand what\r\n    Ch'i-chao may, perchance, believe?\r\n\r\n    The Great President sees no one but those who are always near him;\r\n    and these are the people who have tried to win his favour and gain\r\n    rewards by concocting the alleged unanimous petitions of the whole\r\n    country urging his accession to the Throne. In reality, however, the\r\n    will of the people is precisely the opposite. Even the high\r\n    officials in the Capital talk about the matter in a jeering and\r\n    sarcastic way. As for the tone of the newspapers outside Peking,\r\n    that is better left unmentioned. And as for the \"small people\" who\r\n    crowd the streets and the market-places, they go about as if\r\n    something untoward might happen at any moment. If a kingdom can be\r\n    maintained by mere force, then the disturbance at the time of Ch'in\r\n    Chih-huang and Sui Yang Ti could not have been successful. If, on\r\n    the other hand, it is necessary to secure the co-operation and the\r\n    willing submission of the hearts of the people, then is it not time\r\n    that our Great President bethinks himself and boldly takes his own\r\n    stand?\r\n\r\n    Some argue that to hesitate in the middle of a course after\r\n    indulging in much pomp and pageantry at the beginning will result in\r\n    ridicule and derision and that the dignity of the Chief Executive\r\n    will be lowered. But do they even know whether the Great President\r\n    has taken the least part in connection with the phantasies of the\r\n    past four months? Do they know that the Great President has, on many\r\n    occasions, sworn fidelity before high Heaven and the noon-day sun?\r\n    Now if he carries out his sacrosanct promise and is deaf to the\r\n    unrighteous advice of evil counsellors, his high virtue will be made\r\n    even more manifest than ever before. Wherein then is there need of\r\n    doubt or fear?\r\n\r\n    Others may even suggest that since the proposal was initiated by\r\n    military men, the tie that has hitherto bound the latter to the\r\n    Great President may be snapped in case the pear fails to ripen. But\r\n    in the humble opinion of Ch'i-chao, the troops are now all fully\r\n    inspired with a sense of obedience to the Chief Executive. Who then\r\n    can claim the right to drag our Great President into unrighteousness\r\n    for the sake of vanity and vainglory? Who will dare disobey the\r\n    behests of the Great President if he should elect to open his heart\r\n    and follow the path of honour and unbroken vows? If to-day, as Head\r\n    of the nation, he is powerless to silence the riotous clamour of the\r\n    soldiery as happened at Chen-chiao in ancient time, then be sure in\r\n    the capacity of an Emperor he will not be able to suppress an\r\n    outbreak of troops even as it happened once at Yuyang in the Tang\r\n    dynasty.[20] To give them the handle of the sword is simply courting\r\n    trouble for the future. But can we suspect the troops--so long\r\n    trained under the Great President--of such unworthy conduct? The\r\n    ancients say \"However a thing is done, do not hurt the feelings of\r\n    those who love you, or let your enemy have a chance to rejoice.\"\r\n    Recently calamities in the forms of drought and flood have\r\n    repeatedly visited China; and the ancients warn us that in such ways\r\n    does Heaven manifest its Will regarding great movements in our\r\n    country. In addition to these we must remember the prevailing evils\r\n    of a corrupt officialdom, the incessant ravages of robbers, excesses\r\n    in punishment, the unusually heavy burdens of taxation, as well as\r\n    the irregularity of weather and rain, which all go to increase the\r\n    murmurs and complaints of the people. Internally, the rebels are\r\n    accumulating strength against an opportune time to rise; externally,\r\n    powerful neighbouring countries are waiting for an opportunity to\r\n    harass us. Why then should our Great President risk his precious\r\n    person and become a target of public criticism; or \"abandon the rock\r\n    of peace in search of the tiger's tail\"; or discourage the loyalty\r\n    of faithful ones and encourage the sinister ambitions of the\r\n    unscrupulous? Ch'i-chao sincerely hopes that the Great President\r\n    will devote himself to the establishment of a new era which shall be\r\n    an inspiration to heroism and thus escape the fate of those who are\r\n    stigmatized in our annals with the name of Traitor. He hopes that\r\n    the renown of the Great President will long be remembered in the\r\n    land of _Chung Hua_ (China) and he prays that the fate of China may\r\n    not end with any abrupt ending that may befall the Great President.\r\n    He therefore submits his views with a bleeding heart. He realizes\r\n    that his words may not win the approval of one who is wise and\r\n    clever; but Ch'i-chao feels that unless he unburdens what is in his\r\n    heart, he will be false to the duty which bids him speak and be true\r\n    to the kindness that has been showered on him by the Great\r\n    President. Whether his loyalty to the Imperative Word will be\r\n    rewarded with approval or with reproof, the order of the Great\r\n    President will say.\r\n\r\n    There are other words of which Ch'i-chao wishes to tender to the\r\n    Great President. To be an independent nation to-day, we must need\r\n    follow the ways of the present age. One who opposes the current of\r\n    the world and protects himself against the enriching influence of\r\n    the world-spirit must eventually share the fate of the unselected.\r\n    It is sincerely hoped that the Great President will refrain to some\r\n    extent from restoring the old and withal work for real reform. Law\r\n    can only be made a living force by both the ruler and the people\r\n    obeying it with sincerity. When the law loses its strength, the\r\n    people will not know how to act; and then the dignity of Government\r\n    will disappear. It is hoped that the Great President will keep\r\n    himself within the bounds of law and not lead the officials and the\r\n    people to juggle with words. Participation in politics and\r\n    patriotism are closely related. Bear well in mind that it is\r\n    impossible to expect the people to share the responsibilities of the\r\n    country, unless they are given a voice in the transaction of public\r\n    business. The hope is expressed that the Great President will\r\n    establish a real organ representing the true will of the people and\r\n    encourage the natural growth of the free expression of public\r\n    opinion. Let us not become so arrogant and oppressive that the\r\n    people will have no chance to express their views, as this may\r\n    inspire hatred on the part of the people. The relation between the\r\n    Central Government and the provincial centres is like that between\r\n    the trunk and branches of a tree. If the branches are all withered,\r\n    how can the trunk continue to grow? It is hoped that the Great\r\n    President, while giving due consideration to the maintenance of the\r\n    dignity of the Central Government, will at the same time allow the\r\n    local life of the provinces to develop. Ethics, Righteousness,\r\n    Purity and Conscientiousness are four great principles. When these\r\n    four principles are neglected, a country dies. If the whole country\r\n    should come in spirit to be like \"concubines and women,\" weak and\r\n    open to be coerced and forced along with whomsoever be on the\r\n    stronger side, how can a State be established? May the Great\r\n    President encourage principle, and virtue, stimulate purity of\r\n    character, reject men of covetous and mean character, and grant wise\r\n    tolerance to those who know no fear in defending the right. Only\r\n    then will the vitality of the country be retained in some degree;\r\n    and in time of emergency, there will be a reserve of strength to be\r\n    drawn upon in support of the State. All these considerations are of\r\n    the order of obvious truths and it must be assumed that the Great\r\n    President, who is greatly wise, is not unaware of the same. The\r\n    reason why Ch'i-chao ventures to repeat them is this. He holds it\r\n    true that a duty is laid on him to submit whatever humble thoughts\r\n    are his, and at the same time he believes that the Great President\r\n    will not condemn a proper physic even though it may be cheap and\r\n    simple. How fortunate will Ch'i-chao be if advice so tendered shall\r\n    meet with approval. He is proceeding farther and farther away from\r\n    the Palace every day and he does not know how soon he will be able\r\n    to seek an audience again. He writes these words with tears dropping\r\n    into the ink-slab and he trusts that his words may receive the\r\n    attention of the Great President.\r\n\r\nSo ends this remarkable missive which has become an historic document in\r\nthe archives of the Republic. Once again it was whispered that so great\r\nan impression did this fateful warning produce on the Emperor-elect that\r\nhe was within an ace of cancelling the disastrous scheme which now\r\nenmeshed him. But in the end family influence won the day; and\r\nstubbornly and doggedly the doomed man pushed on with his attempt to\r\ncrush revolt and consolidate his crumbling position.\r\n\r\nEvery possible effort was made to minimize the effect of international\r\ninfluence on the situation. As the sycophantic vernacular press of the\r\ncapital, long drilled to blind subservience, had begun to speak of his\r\nenthronement as a certainty on the 9th February, a Circular Note was\r\nsent to the Five Allied Powers that no such date had been fixed, and\r\nthat the newspaper reports to that effect were inventions. In order\r\nspecially to conciliate Japan, a high official was appointed to proceed\r\non an Embassy to Tokio to grant special industrial concessions--a\r\nmanoeuvre which was met with the official refusal of the Tokio\r\nGovernment to be so placated. Peking was coldly informed that owing to\r\n\"court engagements\" it would be impossible for the Emperor of Japan to\r\nreceive any Chinese Mission. After this open rebuff attention was\r\nconcentrated on \"the punitive expedition\" to chastise the disaffected\r\nSouth, 80,000 men being put in the field and a reserve of 80,000\r\nmobilized behind them. An attempt was also made to win over waverers by\r\nan indiscriminate distribution of patents of nobility. Princes, Dukes,\r\nMarquises, Viscounts and Barons were created in great batches overnight\r\nonly to be declined in very many cases, one of the most precious\r\npossessions of the Chinese race being its sense of humour. Every one, or\r\nalmost every one, knew that the new patents were not worth the paper\r\nthey were written on, and that in future years the members of this\r\nspurious nobility would be exposed to something worse than contempt.\r\nFrance was invited to close the Tonkin frontier, but this request also\r\nmet with a rebuff, and revolutionists and arms were conveyed in an\r\never-more menacing manner into the revolted province of Yunnan by the\r\nFrench railways. A Princedom was at length conferred on Lung Chi Kwang,\r\nthe Military Governor of Canton, Canton being a pivotal point and Lung\r\nChi Kwang, one of the most cold-blooded murderers in China, in the hope\r\nthat this would spur him to such an orgy of crime that the South would\r\nbe crushed. Precisely the opposite occurred, since even murderers are\r\nable to read the signs of the times. Attempts were likewise made to\r\nenforce the use of the new Imperial Calendar, but little success crowned\r\nsuch efforts, no one outside the metropolis believing for a moment that\r\nthis innovation possessed any of the elements of permanence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the monetary position steadily worsened, the lack of money\r\nbecoming so marked as to spread panic. Still, in spite of this, the\r\nleaders refused to take warning, and although the political impasse was\r\nconstantly discussed, the utmost concession the monarchists were willing\r\nto make was to turn China into a Federal Empire with the provinces\r\nconstituted into self-governing units. The over-issue of paper currency\r\nto make good the gaps in the National Finance, now slowly destroyed the\r\ncredit of the Central Government and made the suspension of specie\r\npayment a mere matter of time. By the end of February the province of\r\nKueichow was not only officially admitted by the Peking Government to be\r\nin open revolt as well as Yunnan, but rebel troops were reported to be\r\ninvading the neighbouring province of Hunan. Kwangsi was also reported\r\nto be preparing for secession whilst in Szechuan local troops were\r\nrevolting in increasing numbers. Rumours of an attempted assassination\r\nof Yuan Shih-kai by means of bombs now circulated,--and there were many\r\narrests and suicides in the capital. Though by a mandate issued on the\r\n23rd February, the enthronement ceremony was indefinitely postponed,\r\nthat move came too late. The whole country was plainly trembling on the\r\nedge of a huge outbreak when, less than four weeks later, Yuan Shih-kai\r\nreluctantly and publicly admitted that the game was up. It is understood\r\nthat a fateful interview he had with the British Minister greatly\r\ninfluenced him, though the formal declaration of independence of Kwangsi\r\non the 16th March, whither the scholar Liang Ch'i-chao had gone, was\r\nalso a powerful argument. On the 22nd March the Emperor-elect issued the\r\nmandate categorically cancelling the entire monarchy scheme, it being\r\ndeclared that he would now form a Responsible Cabinet. Until that date\r\nthe Government Gazette had actually perpetrated the folly of publishing\r\nside by side Imperial Edicts and Presidential Mandates--the first for\r\nChinese eyes, the second for foreign consumption. Never before even in\r\nChina had such a farce been seen. A rapid perusal of the Mandate of\r\nCancellation will show how lamely and poorly the retreat is made:\r\n\r\n    DECREE CANCELLING THE EMPIRE (22ND MARCH)\r\n\r\n    After the establishment of the _Min Kuo_ (_i.e._ the Republic),\r\n    disturbances rapidly followed one another; and a man of little\r\n    virtue like me was called to take up the vast burden of the State.\r\n    Fearing that disaster might befall us any day, all those who had the\r\n    welfare of the country at heart advocated the reinstitution of the\r\n    monarchical system of government to the end that a stop be put to\r\n    all strife for power and a régime of peace be inaugurated.\r\n    Suggestions in this sense have unceasingly been made to me since the\r\n    days of Kuei Chou (the year of the first Revolution, 1911) and each\r\n    time a sharp rebuke has been administered to the one making the\r\n    suggestion. But the situation last year was indeed so different from\r\n    the circumstances of preceding years that it was impossible to\r\n    prevent the spread of such ideas.\r\n\r\n    It was said that China could never hope to continue as a nation\r\n    unless the constitutional monarchical form of state were adopted;\r\n    and if quarrels like those occurring in Mexico and Portugal were to\r\n    take place in China, we would soon share the fate of Annam and\r\n    Burmah. A large number of people then advocated the restoration of a\r\n    monarchy and advanced arguments which were reasonable. In this\r\n    proposal all the military and civil officials, scholars and people\r\n    concurred; and prayers were addressed to me in most earnest tone by\r\n    telegram and in petitions. Owing to the position I was at the time\r\n    holding, which laid on me the duty of maintaining the then existing\r\n    situation, I repeatedly made declarations resisting the adoption of\r\n    the advice; but the people did not seem to realize my embarrassment.\r\n    And so it was decided by the acting Li Fa Yuan (_i.e._ the Senate)\r\n    that the question of _Kuo-ti_ (form of State) should be settled by\r\n    the Convention of Citizens' Representatives. As the result, the\r\n    representatives of the Provinces and of the Special Administrative\r\n    Areas unanimously decided in favour of a constitutional monarchy,\r\n    and in one united voice elected me as the Emperor. Since the\r\n    sovereignty of the country has been vested in the citizens of China\r\n    and as the decision was made by the entire body of the\r\n    representatives, there was no room left to me for further\r\n    discussion. Nevertheless, I continued to be of the conviction that\r\n    my sudden elevation to the Great Seat would be a violation of my\r\n    oath and would compromise my good faith, leaving me unable to\r\n    explain myself; I, therefore, declined in earnest words in order to\r\n    make clear the view which hath always been mine. The said Senate\r\n    however, stated with firmness that the oath of the Chief Executive\r\n    rested on a peculiar sanction and should be observed or discarded\r\n    according to the will of the people. Their arguments were so\r\n    irresistible that there was in truth no excuse for me further to\r\n    decline the offer.\r\n\r\n    Therefore I took refuge behind the excuse of \"preparations\" in order\r\n    that the desire of the people might be satisfied. But I took no\r\n    steps actually to carry out the programme. When the trouble in\r\n    Yunnan and Kueichow arose, a mandate was officially issued\r\n    announcing the decision to postpone the measure and forbidding\r\n    further presentation of petitions praying for the enthronement. I\r\n    then hastened the convocation of the Li Fa Yuan (_i.e._, a new\r\n    Parliament) in order to secure the views of that body and hoping\r\n    thus to turn back to the original state of affairs, I, being a man\r\n    of bitter experiences, had at once given up all ideas of world\r\n    affairs; and having retired into the obscurity of the river Yuan (in\r\n    Honan), I had no appetite for the political affairs of the country.\r\n    As the result of the revolution in Hsin Hai, I was by mistake\r\n    elected by the people. Reluctantly I came out of my retirement and\r\n    endeavoured to prop up the tottering structure. I cared for nothing,\r\n    but the salvation of the country. A perusal of our history of\r\n    several thousand years will reveal in vivid manner the sad fate of\r\n    the descendants of ancient kings and emperors. What then could have\r\n    prompted me to aspire to the Throne? Yet while the representatives\r\n    of the people were unwilling to believe in the sincerity of my\r\n    refusal of the offer, a section of the people appear to have\r\n    suspected me of harbouring the desire of gaining more power and\r\n    privileges. Such difference in thought has resulted in the creation\r\n    of an exceedingly dangerous situation. As my sincerity has not been\r\n    such as to win the hearts of the people and my judgment has not been\r\n    sound enough to appraise every man, I have myself alone to blame for\r\n    lack of virtue. Why then should I blame others? The people have been\r\n    thrown into misery and my soldiers have been made to bear hardships;\r\n    and further the people have been cast into panic and commerce has\r\n    rapidly declined. When I search my own heart a measure of sorrow\r\n    fills it. I shall, therefore, not be unwilling to suppress myself in\r\n    order to yield to others.\r\n\r\n    I am still of the opinion that the \"designation petitions\" submitted\r\n    through the Tsan Cheng Yuan are unsuited to the demands of the time;\r\n    and the official acceptance of the Imperial Throne made on the 11th\r\n    day of the 12th month of last year (11th December, 1915) is hereby\r\n    cancelled. \"The designation petitions\" of the Provinces and of the\r\n    Special Administrative Areas are hereby all returned through the\r\n    State Department to the Tsan Cheng Yuan, _i.e._, the acting Li Fa\r\n    Yuan (Parliament), to be forwarded to the petitioners for\r\n    destruction; and all the preparations connected therewith are to\r\n    cease at once. In this wise I hope to imitate the sincerity of the\r\n    Ancients by taking on myself all the blame so that my action may\r\n    fall in line with the spirit of humanity which is the expression of\r\n    the will of Heaven. I now cleanse my heart and wash my thoughts to\r\n    the end that trouble may be averted and the people may have peace.\r\n    Those who advocated the monarchical system were prompted by the\r\n    desire to strengthen the foundation of the country; but as their\r\n    methods have proved unsuitable their patriotism might harm the\r\n    country. Those who have opposed the monarchy have done so out of\r\n    their desire to express their political views. It may be therefore\r\n    presumed that they would not go to the extreme and so endanger the\r\n    country. They should, therefore, all hearken to the voice of their\r\n    own conscience and sacrifice their prejudices, and with one mind and\r\n    one purpose unite in the effort of saving the situation so that the\r\n    glorious descendants of the Sacred Continent may be spared the\r\n    horrors of internal warfare and the bad omens may be changed into\r\n    lucky signs.\r\n\r\n    In brief I now confess that all the faults of the country are the\r\n    result of my own faults. Now that the acceptance of the Imperial\r\n    Throne has been cancelled every man will be responsible for his own\r\n    action if he further disturbs the peace of the locality and thus\r\n    gives an opportunity to others. I, the Great President, being\r\n    charged with the duty of ruling over the whole country, cannot\r\n    remain idle while the country is racing to perdition. At the present\r\n    moment the homesteads are in misery, discipline has been\r\n    disregarded, administration is being neglected and real talents have\r\n    not been given a chance. When I think of such conditions I awake in\r\n    the darkness of midnight. How can we stand as a nation if such a\r\n    state of affairs is allowed to continue? Hereafter all officials\r\n    should thoroughly get rid of their corrupt habits and endeavour to\r\n    achieve merits. They should work with might and main in their\r\n    duties, whether in introducing reforms or in abolishing old\r\n    corruptions. Let all be not satisfied with empty words and entertain\r\n    no bias regarding any affair. They should hold up as their main\r\n    principle of administration the policy that only reality will count\r\n    and deal out reward or punishment with strict promptness. Let all\r\n    our generals, officials, soldiers and people all, all, act in\r\n    accordance with this ideal.\r\n\r\nThis attempt at an _Amende honorable_, so far from being well-received,\r\nwas universally looked upon as an admission that Yuan Shih-kai had\r\nalmost been beaten and that a little more would complete his ruin.\r\nThough, as we have said, the Northern troops were fighting well in his\r\ncause on the upper reaches of the great Yangtsze, the movement against\r\nhim was now spreading as though it had been a dread contagious disease,\r\nthe entire South uniting against Peking. His promise to open a proper\r\nLegislative Chamber on 1st May was met with derision. By the middle of\r\nApril five provinces--Yunnan, Kueichow, Kwangsi, Kwangtung and\r\nChekiang--had declared their independence, and eight others were\r\npreparing to follow suit. A Southern Confederacy, with a Supreme\r\nMilitary Council sitting at Canton, was organized, the brutal Governor\r\nLung Chi Kwang having been won over against his master, and the scholar\r\nLiang Ch'i-chao flitting from place to place, inspiring move after move.\r\nThe old parliament of 1913 was reported to be assembling in Shanghai,\r\nwhilst terrorist methods against Peking officials were bruited abroad\r\nprecipitating a panic in the capital and leading to an exodus of\r\nwell-to-do families who feared a general massacre.\r\n\r\nAn open agitation to secure Yuan Shih-kai's complete retirement and\r\nexile now commenced. From every quarter notables began telegraphing him\r\nthat he must go,--including General Feng Kuo-chang who still held the\r\nbalance of power on the Yangtsze. Every enemy Yuan Shih-kai had ever had\r\nwas also racing back to China from exile. By the beginning of May the\r\nsituation was so threatening that the Foreign Legations became alarmed\r\nand talked of concerting measures to insure their safety. On the 6th May\r\ncame the _coup de grâce_. The great province of Szechuan, which has a\r\npopulation greater than the population of France, declared its\r\nindependence; and the whole Northern army on the upper reaches of the\r\nYangtsze was caught in a trap. The story is still told with bated breath\r\nof the terrible manner in which Yuan Shih-kai sated his rage when this\r\nnews reached him--Szechuan being governed by a man he had hitherto\r\nthoroughly trusted--one General Chen Yi. Arming himself with a sword and\r\nbeside himself with rage he burst into the room where his favourite\r\nconcubine was lying with her newly-delivered baby. With a few savage\r\nblows he butchered them both, leaving them lying in their gore, thus\r\nrelieving the apoplectic stroke which threatened to overwhelm him.\r\nNothing better illustrates the real nature of the man who had been so\r\nlong the selected bailiff of the Powers.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th May it became necessary to suspend specie payment in Peking,\r\nthe government banks having scarcely a dollar of silver left, a last\r\nattempt to negotiate a loan in America having failed. Meanwhile under\r\ninspiration of General Feng Kuo-chang, a conference to deal with the\r\nsituation was assembling at Nanking; but on the 11th May, the Canton\r\nMilitary Government, representing the Southern Confederacy, had already\r\nunanimously elected Vice-President Li Yuan Hung as president of the\r\nRepublic, it being held that legally Yuan Shih-kai had ceased to be\r\nPresident when he had accepted the Throne on the previous 13th December.\r\nThe Vice-President, who had managed to remove his residence outside the\r\nPalace, had already received friendly offers of protection from certain\r\nPowers which he declined, showing courage to the end. Even the Nanking\r\nConference, though composed of trimmers and wobblers, decided that the\r\nretirement of Yuan Shih-kai was a political necessity, General Feng\r\nKuo-chang as chairman of the Conference producing at the last moment a\r\ntelegram from the fallen Dictator declaring that he was willing to go if\r\nhis life and property were guaranteed.\r\n\r\nA more dramatic collapse was, however, in store. As May drew to an end\r\nit was plain that there was no government at all left in Peking. The\r\nlast phase had been truly reached. Yuan Shih-kai's nervous collapse was\r\nknown to all the Legations which were exceedingly anxious about the\r\npossibility of a soldiers' revolt in the capital. The arrival of a first\r\ndetachment of the savage hordes of General Chang Hsun added Byzantine\r\ntouches to a picture already lurid with a sickened ruler and the\r\nMephistophelian figure of that ruler's _âme damnée_, the Secretary Liang\r\nShih-yi, vainly striving to transmute paper into silver, and find the\r\nwherewithal to prevent a sack of the capital. It was said at the time\r\nthat Liang Shih-yi had won over his master to trying one last throw of\r\nthe dice. The troops of the remaining loyal Generals, such as Ni\r\nShih-chung of Anhui, were transported up the Yangtsze in an attempt to\r\nrestore the situation by a savage display,--but that effort came to\r\nnought.\r\n\r\nThe situation had become truly appalling in Peking. It was even said\r\nthat the neighbouring province of Shantung was to become a separate\r\nstate under Japanese protection. Although the Peking administration was\r\nstill nominally the Central Government of China, it was amply clear to\r\nobservers on the spot that by a process of successive collapses all that\r\nwas left of government was simply that pertaining to a city-state of the\r\nantique Greek type--a mal-administration dominated by the enigmatic\r\npersonality of Liang Shih-yi. The writ of the capital no longer ran more\r\nthan ten miles beyond the city walls. The very Government Departments,\r\ndisgusted with, and distrustful of, the many hidden influences at work,\r\nhad virtually declared their independence and went their own way,\r\ndemanding foreign dollars and foreign banknotes from the public, and\r\nrefusing all Chinese money. The fine residuum of undisputed power left\r\nin the hands of the Mal-administrator-in-chief, Liang Shih-yi, was the\r\ncontrol of the copper cash market which he busily juggled with to the\r\nvery end netting a few last thousands for his own purse, and showing\r\nthat men like water inevitably find their true level. In all China's\r\ntribulations nothing similar had ever been seen. Even in 1900, after the\r\nBoxer bubble had been pricked and the Court had sought safety in flight,\r\nthere was a certain dignity and majesty left. Then an immense misfortune\r\nhad fallen across the capital; but that misfortune was like a cloak\r\nwhich hid the nakedness of the victim; and there was at least no\r\npretence at authority. In the Summer of 1916, had it not been for the\r\nfact that an admirable police and gendarmerie system, comprising 16,000\r\nmen, secured the safety of the people, there can be little doubt that\r\nfiring and looting would have daily taken place and no woman been safe.\r\nIt was the last phase of political collapse with a vengeance: and small\r\nwonder if all Chinese officials, including even high police officers,\r\nsent their valuables either out of the city or into the Legation Quarter\r\nfor safe custody. Extraordinary rumours circulated endlessly among the\r\ncommon people that there would be great trouble on the occasion of the\r\nDragon Festival, the 5th June; and what actually took place was perhaps\r\nmore than a coincidence.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 6th June an electric thrill ran through Peking--Yuan\r\nShih-kai was dead! At first the news was not believed, but by eleven\r\no'clock it was definitely known in the Legation Quarter that he had died\r\na few minutes after ten o'clock that morning from uraemia of the\r\nblood--the surgeon of the French Legation being in attendance almost to\r\nthe last. A certificate issued later by this gentleman immediately\r\nquieted the rumours of suicide, though many still refused to believe\r\nthat he was actually dead. \"I did not wish this end,\" he is reported to\r\nhave whispered hoarsely a few minutes before he expired, \"I did not wish\r\nto be Emperor. Those around me said that the people wanted a king and\r\nnamed me for the Throne. I believed and was misled.\" And in this way did\r\nhis light flicker out. If there are sermons in stones and books in the\r\nrunning brooks surely there is an eloquent lesson in this tragedy!\r\nBefore expiring the wretched man issued the following Death Mandate in\r\naccordance with the ancient tradition, attempting as the long night fell\r\non him to make his peace with men:--\r\n\r\n    LAST MANDATE OF YUAN SHIH-KAI\r\n\r\n    The Min Kuo has been established for five years. Unworthily have I,\r\n    the Great President, been entrusted with the great task by the\r\n    citizens. Owing to my lack of virtue and ability I have not been\r\n    able fully to transform into deeds what I have desired to\r\n    accomplish; and I blush to say that I have not realized one\r\n    ten-thousandth part of my original intention to save the country and\r\n    the people. I have, since my assumption of the office, worked in\r\n    day and thought in the night, planning for the country. It is true\r\n    that the foundation of the country is not yet consolidated, the\r\n    hardships of the people not yet relieved, and innumerable reforms\r\n    are still unattended to. But by the valuable services of the civil\r\n    officials and military men, some semblance of peace and order has\r\n    been maintained in the provinces and friendly relations with the\r\n    Powers upheld till now.\r\n\r\n    While on the one hand I comfort myself with such things\r\n    accomplished, on the other hand I have much to blame myself for. I\r\n    was just thinking how I could retire into private life and rest\r\n    myself in the forest and near the springs in fulfilment of my\r\n    original desire, when illness has suddenly overtaken me. As the\r\n    affairs of the State are of gravest importance, the right man must\r\n    be secured to take over charge of the same. In accordance with\r\n    Article 29 of the Provisional Constitution, which states that in\r\n    case the office of the Great President should be vacated for certain\r\n    reasons or when the Great President is incapacitated from doing his\r\n    duties, the Vice-President shall exercise authority and power in his\r\n    stead. I, the Great President, declare in accordance with the\r\n    Provisional Constitution that the Vice-President shall exercise in\r\n    an acting capacity, the authority and power of the Great President\r\n    of the Chung Hua Min Kuo.\r\n\r\n    The Vice-President being a man of courtesy, good nature, benevolence\r\n    and wisdom, will certainly be capable of greatly lessening the\r\n    difficulties of the day and place the country on the foundation of\r\n    peace, and so remedy the defects of me, the Great President, and\r\n    satisfy the expectations of the people of the whole country. The\r\n    civil and military officials outside of the Capital as well as the\r\n    troops, police and scholars and people should doubly keep in mind\r\n    the difficulties and perils of the nation, and endeavour to maintain\r\n    peace and order to the best of their ability, placing before\r\n    everything else the welfare of the country. The ancients once said:\r\n    \"It is only when the living do try to become strong that the dead\r\n    are not dead.\" This is also the wish of me, the Great President.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) TUAN CHI-JUI,\r\n    Secretary of State and\r\n    Minister of War\r\n\r\n    TSAO JU-LIN,\r\n    Minister of Foreign Affairs and\r\n    Communications.\r\n\r\n    WANG YI-TANG,\r\n    Minister of Interior.\r\n\r\n    CHOW TZU-CHI,\r\n    Minister of Finance.\r\n\r\n    LIU-KUAN-HSIUNG,\r\n    Minister of Navy.\r\n\r\n    CHANG TSUNG-HSIANG,\r\n    Minister of Justice and\r\n    Agriculture and Commerce.\r\n\r\n    CHANG KUO-KAN,\r\n    Minister of Education.\r\n\r\n    6th day of the 6th month of the 5th year of Chung Hua Min Kuo.\r\n\r\nThis tragic dénouement did not fail to awaken within very few days\r\namong thinking minds a feeling of profound sympathy for the dead man\r\ncoupled with sharp disgust for the part that foreigners had played--not\r\nall, of course--but a great number of them. Briefly, when all the facts\r\nare properly grouped it can be said that Yuan Shih-kai was killed by his\r\nforeign friends--by the sort of advice he has been consistently given in\r\nConstitutional Law, in Finance, in Politics, in Diplomacy. It is easy to\r\ntrace step by step the broad road he had been tempted to travel, and to\r\nsee how at each turning-point the men who should have taught him how to\r\nbe true and loyal to the Western things the country had nominally\r\nadhered to from the proclamation of the Republic, showed him how to be\r\ndisloyal and untrue. The tragedy is one which is bound to be deeply\r\nstudied throughout the whole world when the facts are properly known and\r\nthere is time to think about them, and if there is anything to-day left\r\nto poetic justice the West will know to whom to apportion the blame.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai, the man, when he came out of retirement in 1911, was in\r\nmany ways a wonderful Chinese: he was a fount of energy and of a\r\nphysical sturdiness rare in a country whose governing classes have\r\nhitherto been recruited from attenuated men, pale from study and the\r\nlotus life. He had a certain task to which to put his hand, a huge task,\r\nindeed, since the reformation of four hundred millions was involved, yet\r\none which was not beyond him if wisely advised. He was an ignorant man\r\nin certain matters, but he had had much political experience and\r\napparently possessed a marvellous aptitude for learning. The people\r\nneeded a leader to guide them through the great gateway of the West, to\r\nhelp them to acquire those jewels of wisdom and experience which are a\r\ncommon heritage. An almost Elizabethan eagerness filled them, as if a\r\nNew World they had never dreamed of had been suddenly discovered for\r\nthem and lay open to their endeavours. China, hitherto derided as a\r\ndecaying land, had been born anew; and in single massive gesture had\r\nproclaimed that she, too, would belong to the elect and be governed\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nWhat was the foreign response--the official response? In every\r\ntransaction into which it was possible to import them, reaction and\r\nobscurantism were not only commonly employed but heartily recommended.\r\nNot one trace of genuine statesmanship, not one flash of altruism, was\r\never seen save the American flash in the pan of 1913, when President\r\nWilson refused to allow American participation in the great\r\nReorganization Loan because he held that the terms on which it was to be\r\ngranted infringed upon China's sovereign rights. Otherwise there was\r\nnothing but a tacit endorsement of the very policy which has been\r\ntearing the entrails out of Europe--namely militarism. That was the fine\r\nfruit which was offered to a hopeful nation--something that would wither\r\non the branch or poison the people as they plucked it. They were taught\r\nto believe that political instinct was the ability to misrepresent in a\r\nconvincing way the actions and arguments of your opponents and to profit\r\nby their mistakes--not that it is a mighty impulse which can re-make\r\nnations. The Republic was declared by the actions of Western bureaucrats\r\nto be a Republic _pour rire_, not a serious thing; and by this false and\r\ncruel assumption they killed Yuan Shih-kai.\r\n\r\nIf that epitaph is written on his political tombstone, it will be as\r\nfull of blinding truth as is only possible with Last Things.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] The incident of Chen-chiao is very celebrated in Chinese annals. A\r\nyellow robe, the symbol of Imperial authority, was thrown around General\r\nChao Kuang-ying, at a place called Chen-chiao, by his soldiers and\r\nofficers when he commanded a force ordered to the front. Chao returned\r\nto the Capital immediately to assume the Imperial Throne, and was thus\r\n\"compelled\" to become the founder of the famous Sung dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe \"incident of Yuyang\" refers to the execution of Yang Kuei-fei, the\r\nfavourite concubine of Emperor Yuan Tsung of the Tang dynasty. The\r\nEmperor for a long time was under the alluring influence of Yang\r\nKuei-fei, who had a paramour named An Lo-hsan. The latter finally\r\nrebelled against the Emperor. The Emperor left the capital and proceeded\r\nto another place together with his favourite concubine, guarded by a\r\nlarge force of troops. Midway, however, the soldiers threatened to rebel\r\nunless the concubine was killed on the spot. The clamour was such that\r\nthe Emperor was forced to sacrifice the favourite of his harem, putting\r\nher to death in the presence of his soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE NEW RÉGIME,--FROM 1916 TO 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin an hour of the death of Yuan Shih-kai, the veteran General Tuan\r\nChi-jui, in his capacity of Secretary of State, had called on\r\nVice-President Li Yuan-hung--the man whom years before he had been sent\r\nto the Yangtsze to bring captive to Peking--and welcomed him as\r\nPresident of the Republic. At one o'clock on the same day the Ministers\r\nof the Allied Powers who had hastily assembled at the Waichiaopu\r\n(Foreign Office), were informed that General Li Yuan-hung had duly\r\nassumed office and that the peace and security of the capital were fully\r\nguaranteed. No unrest of any sort need be apprehended; for whilst\r\nrumours would no doubt circulate wildly as soon as the populace realized\r\nthe tragic nature of the climax which had come the Gendarmerie Corps and\r\nthe Metropolitan Police--two forces that numbered 18,000 armed men--were\r\ntaking every possible precaution.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these assurances great uneasiness was felt. The foreign\r\nLegations, which are very imperfectly informed regarding Chinese affairs\r\nalthough living in the midst of them, could not be convinced that\r\ninternal peace could be so suddenly attained after five years of such\r\nfierce rivalries. Among the many gloomy predictions made at the time,\r\nthe most common to fall from the lips of Foreign Plenipotentiaries was\r\nthe remark that the Japanese would be in full occupation of the country\r\nwithin three months--the one effective barrier to their advance having\r\nbeen removed. No better illustration could be given of the inadequate\r\ngrasp of politics possessed by those whose peculiar business it should\r\nbe to become expert in the science of cause and effect. In China, as in\r\nthe Balkans, professional diplomacy errs so constantly because it has\r\nin the main neither the desire nor the training to study dispassionately\r\nfrom day to day all those complex phenomena which go to make up modern\r\nnationalism. Guided in its conduct almost entirely by a policy of\r\npersonal predilections, which is fitfully reinforced by the recollection\r\nof precedents, it is small wonder if such mountains of mistakes choke\r\nevery Legation dossier. Determined to have nothing whatever to do, save\r\nin the last resort, with anything that savours of Radicalism, and\r\ninclining naturally towards ideals which have long been abandoned in the\r\nworkaday world, diplomacy is the instinctive lover of obscurantism and\r\nthe furtive enemy of progress. Distrusting all those generous movements\r\nwhich spring from the popular desire to benefit by change, it follows\r\nfrom this that the diplomatic brotherhood inclines towards those truly\r\ndetestable things--secret compacts. In the present instance, having been\r\nbitterly disappointed by the complete collapse of the strong man theory,\r\nit was only natural that consolation should be sought by casting doubt\r\non the future. Never have sensible men been so absurd. The life-story of\r\nYuan Shih-kai, and the part European and Japanese diplomacy played in\r\nthat story, form a chapter which should be taught as a warning to all\r\nwho enter politics as a career, since there is exhibited in this history\r\na complete compendium of all the more vicious traits of Byzantinism.\r\n\r\nThe first acts of President Li Yuan-hung rapidly restored confidence and\r\nadvertised to the keen-eyed that the end of the long drawn-out\r\nRevolution had come. Calling before him all the generals in the capital,\r\nhe told them with sincerity and simplicity that their country's fortunes\r\nrested in their hands; and he asked them to take such steps as would be\r\nin the nature of a permanent insurance against foreign interference in\r\nthe affairs of the Republic. He was at once given fervent support. A\r\nmass meeting of the military was followed by the whole body of\r\ncommissioned men volunteering to hold themselves personally responsible\r\nfor the maintenance of peace and order in the capital. The dreadful\r\ndisorders which had ushered in the Yuan Shih-kai régime were thus made\r\nimpossible; and almost at once men went about their business as usual.\r\n\r\nThe financial wreckage left by the mad monarchy adventure was, however,\r\nappalling. Not only was there no money in the capital but hardly any\r\nfood as well; for since the suspension of specie payments country\r\nsupplies had ceased entering the city as farmers refused to accept\r\ninconvertible paper in payment for their produce. It became necessary\r\nfor the government to sell at a nominal price the enormous quantities of\r\ngrain which had been accumulated for the army and the punitive\r\nexpedition against the South; and for many days a familiar sight was the\r\nendless blue-coated queues waiting patiently to receive as in war-time\r\ntheir stipulated pittance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, although the troops remained loyal to the new régime, not so\r\nthe monarchist politicians. Seeing that their hour of obliteration had\r\ncome, they spared no effort to sow secret dissensions and prevent the\r\nprovinces from uniting again with Peking. It would be wearisome to give\r\nin full detail the innumerable schemes which were now hourly formulated,\r\nto secure that the control of the country should not be exercised in a\r\nlawful way. Finding that it was impossible to conquer the general\r\ndetestation felt for them, the monarchists, led by Liang Shih-yi,\r\nchanged their tactics and exhausted themselves in attempting to secure\r\nthe issue of a general amnesty decree. But in spite of every argument\r\nPresident Li Yuan-hung remained unmoved and refused absolutely to\r\nconsider their pardon. A just and merciful man, it was his intention to\r\nallow the nation to speak its mind before issuing orders on the subject;\r\nbut to show that he was no advocate of the terrorist methods practised\r\nby his predecessor, he now issued a Mandate summarily abolishing the\r\ninfamous _Chih Fa Chu_, or Military Court, which Yuan Shih-kai had\r\nturned into an engine of judicial assassination, and within whose gloomy\r\nprecincts many thousands of unfortunate men had perished practically\r\nuntried in the period 1911-1916.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the general situation throughout the country only slowly\r\nameliorated. The Northern Military party, determined to prevent\r\npolitical power from passing solely into the hands of the Southern\r\nRadicals, bitterly opposed the revival of the Nanking Provisional\r\nConstitution, and denounced the re-convocation of the old Parliament of\r\n1913, which had already assembled in Shanghai, preparatory to coming up\r\nto the capital. It needed a sharp manoeuvre to bring them to their\r\nsenses. The Chinese Navy, assembled in the waters near Shanghai, took\r\naction; and in an ultimatum communicated to Peking by their Admiral,\r\ndeclared that so long as the government in the hands of General Tuan\r\nChi-jui refused to conform to popular wishes by reviving the Nanking\r\nProvisional Constitution and resummoning the old Parliament, so long\r\nwould the Navy refuse to recognize the authority of the Central\r\nGovernment. With the fleet in the hands of the Southern Confederacy,\r\nwhich had not yet been formally dissolved, the Peking Government was\r\npowerless in the whole region of the Yangtsze; consequently, after many\r\nvain manoeuvres to avoid this reasonable and proper solution, it was at\r\nlast agreed that things should be brought back precisely where they had\r\nbeen before the _coup d'état_ of the 4th November, 1913--the Peking\r\nGovernment being reconstituted by means of a coalition cabinet in which\r\nthere would be both nominees of the North and South--the premiership\r\nremaining in the hands of General Tuan Chi-jui.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th June a long funeral procession wended its way from the\r\nPresidential Palace to the railway Station; it was the remains of the\r\ngreat dictator being taken to their last resting-place in Honan.\r\nConspicuous in this cortege was the magnificent stage-coach which had\r\nbeen designed to bear the founder of the new dynasty to his throne but\r\nwhich only accompanied him to his grave. The detached attitude of the\r\ncrowds and the studied simplicity of the procession, which was designed\r\nto be republican, proved more clearly than reams of arguments that\r\nChina--despite herself perhaps--had become somewhat modernized, the\r\noldest country in the world being now the youngest republic and timidly\r\ntrying to learn the lessons of youth.\r\n\r\nOnce Yuan Shih-kai had been buried, a Mandate ordering the summary\r\narrest of all the chief monarchist plotters was issued; but the gang of\r\ncorrupt men had already sought safety in ignominious flight; and it was\r\nunderstood that so long as they remained on soil under foreign\r\njurisdiction, no attempt would be made even to confiscate their goods\r\nand chattels as would certainly have been done under former governments.\r\nThe days of treachery and double-dealing and cowardly revenge were\r\nindeed passing away and the new régime was committed to decency and\r\nfairplay. The task of the new President was no mean one, and in all the\r\ncircumstances if he managed to steer a safe middle course and avoid both\r\nCaesarism and complete effacement, that is a tribute to his training.\r\nBorn in 1864 in Hupeh, one of the most important mid-Yangtsze provinces,\r\nPresident Li Yuan-hung was now fifty-two years old, and in the prime of\r\nlife; but although he had been accustomed to a military atmosphere from\r\nhis earliest youth his policy had never been militaristic. His father\r\nhaving been in command of a force in North China for many years, rising\r\nfrom the ranks to the post of _Tsan Chiang_ (Lieutenant-Colonel), had\r\nbeen constrained to give him the advantage of a thoroughly modern\r\ntraining. At the age of 20 he had entered the Naval School at Tientsin;\r\nwhence six years later he had graduated, seeing service in the navy as\r\nan engineer officer during the Chino-Japanese war of 1894. After that\r\ncampaign he had been invited by Viceroy Chang Chih-tung, then one of the\r\nmost distinguished of the older viceroys, to join his staff at Nanking,\r\nand had been entrusted with the supervision of the construction of the\r\nmodern forts at the old Southern capital, which played such a notable\r\npart in the Revolution. When Chang Chih-tung was transferred to the\r\nWuchang viceroyalty, General Li Yuan-hung had accompanied him, actively\r\nparticipating in the training of the new Hupeh army, and being assisted\r\nin that work by German instructors. In 1897 he had gone to Japan to\r\nstudy educational, military and administrative methods, returning to\r\nChina after a short stay, but again proceeding to Tokio in 1897 as an\r\nofficer attached to the Imperial Guards. In the autumn of the following\r\nyear he had returned to Wuchang and been appointed Commander of the\r\nCavalry. Yet another visit was paid by him to Japan in 1902 to attend\r\nthe grand military manoeuvres, these journeys giving him a good working\r\nknowledge of Japanese, in addition to the English which had been an\r\nimportant item in the curriculum of the Naval School, and which he\r\nunderstands moderately well. In 1903 he was promoted Brigadier-General,\r\nbeing subsequently gazetted as the Commander of the 2nd Division of\r\nRegulars (_Chang Pei Chun_) of Hupeh. He also constantly held various\r\nsubsidiary posts, in addition to his substantive appointment, connected\r\nwith educational and administrative work of various kinds, and has\r\ntherefore a sound grasp of provincial government. He was\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the 8th Division during the famous military\r\nmanoeuvres of 1906 at Changtehfu in Honan province, which are said to\r\nhave given birth to the idea of a universal revolt against the Manchus\r\nby using the army as the chief instrument.\r\n\r\nOn the memorable day of October 11, 1911, when the standard of revolt\r\nwas raised at Wuchang, somewhat against his will as he was a loyal\r\nofficer, he was elected military Governor, thus becoming the first real\r\nleader of the Republic. Within the space of ten days his leadership had\r\nsecured the adhesion of fourteen provinces to the Republican cause; and\r\nthough confronted by grave difficulties owing to insufficiency of\r\nequipment and military supplies, he fought the Northern soldiery for two\r\nmonths around Wuchang with varying success. He it was, when the Republic\r\nhad been formally established and the Manchu régime made a thing of the\r\npast, who worked earnestly to bring about better relations between the\r\narmies of North and South China which had been arrayed against one\r\nanother during many bitter weeks. It was he, also, who was the first to\r\nadvocate the complete separation of the civil and military\r\nadministration--the administrative powers in the early days of the\r\nRepublic being entirely in the hands of the military governors of the\r\nprovinces who recruited soldiery in total disregard to the wishes of the\r\nCentral Government. Although this reform has even to-day only been\r\npartially successful, there is no reason to doubt that before the\r\nRepublic is many years older the idea of the military dictating the\r\npolicy and administration of the country will pass away. The so-called\r\nSecond Revolution of 1913 awakened no sympathy in General Li Yuan-hung,\r\nbecause he was opposed to internal strife and held that all Chinese\r\nshould work for unity and concerted reform rather than indulge in\r\nfruitless dissensions. His disapproval of the monarchy movement had been\r\nequally emphatic in the face of an ugly outlook. He was repeatedly\r\napproached by the highest personages to give in his adhesion to Yuan\r\nShih-kai becoming emperor, but he persistently refused although grave\r\nfears were publicly expressed that he would be assassinated. Upon the\r\nformal acceptance of the Throne by Yuan Shih-kai, he had had conferred\r\non him a princedom which he steadfastly refused to accept; and when the\r\nallowances of a prince were brought to him from the Palace he returned\r\nthem with the statement that as he had not accepted the title the money\r\nwas not his. Every effort to break his will proved unavailing, his\r\npatience and calmness contributing very materially to the vast moral\r\nopposition which finally destroyed Yuan Shih-kai.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man who was called upon to preside over the new government\r\nand parliament which was now assembling in Peking; and certainly it may\r\nbe counted as an evidence of China's traditional luck which brought him\r\nto the helm. General Li Yuan-hung knew well that the cool and singular\r\nplan which had been pursued to forge a national mandate for a revival of\r\nof the empire would take years completely to obliterate, and that the\r\noctopus-hold of the Military Party--the army being the one effective\r\norganization which had survived the Revolution--could not be loosened\r\nin a day,--in fact would have to be tolerated until the nation asserted\r\nitself and showed that it could and would be master. In the\r\ncircumstances his authority could not but be very limited, disclosing\r\nitself in passive rather than in active ways. Wishing to be above all a\r\nconstitutional President, he quickly saw that an interregnum must be\r\nphilosophically accepted during which the Permanent Constitution would\r\nbe worked out and the various parties forced to a general agreement; and\r\nthanks to this decision the year which has now elapsed since Yuan\r\nShih-kai's death has been almost entirely eventless, with the exception\r\nof the crisis which arose over the war-issue, a matter which is fully\r\ndiscussed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the closing months of 1916, the position was not a little\r\nsingular. Two great political parties had arisen through the\r\nRevolution--the Kuo Ming Tang or Nationalists, who included all the\r\nRadical elements, and the Chinputang or Progressives, whose adherents\r\nwere mainly men of the older official classes, and therefore\r\nconservative. The Yunnan movement, which had led to the overthrow of\r\nYuan Shih-kai, had been inspired and very largely directed by the\r\nscholar Liang Ch'i-chao, a leader of the Chinputang. To this party,\r\nthen, though numerically inferior to the Kuo Ming Tang, was due the\r\nhonour and credit of re-establishing the Republic, the Kuo Ming Tang\r\nbeing under a cloud owing to the failure of the Second Revolution of\r\n1913 which it had engineered. Nevertheless, owing to the Kuo Ming Tang\r\nbeing more genuinely republican, since it was mainly composed of younger\r\nand more modern minds, it was from its ranks that the greatest check to\r\nmilitarism sprang; and therefore although its work was necessarily\r\nconfined to the Council-chamber, its moral influence was very great and\r\nconstantly representative of the civilian element as opposed to the\r\nmilitarist. By staking everything on the necessity of adhering to the\r\nNanking Provisional Constitution until a permanent instrument was drawn\r\nup, the Kuo Ming Tang rapidly established an ascendancy; for although\r\nthe Nanking Constitution had admittedly failed to bring representative\r\ngovernment because of the difficulty of defining powers in such a way as\r\nto make a practical autocracy impossible, it had at least established as\r\na basic principle that China could no longer be ruled as a family\r\npossession, which in itself marked a great advance on all previous\r\nconceptions. President Li Yuan-hung's policy, in the circumstances, was\r\nto play the part of a moderator and to seek to bring harmony to a mass\r\nof heterogeneous elements that had to carry out the practical work of\r\ngovernment over four hundred millions of people.\r\n\r\nHis success was at the outset hampered by the appeal the military were\r\nquick in making to a new method--to offset the power of Parliament in\r\nPeking. We have already dealt with the evils of the circular telegram in\r\nChina--surely one of the most unexpected results of adapting foreign\r\ninventions to native life. By means of these telegraphic campaigns a\r\nrapid exchange of views is made possible among the provincial governors;\r\nand consequently in the autumn of 1916, inspired by the Military Party,\r\na wholly illegal Conference of generals was organized by the redoubtable\r\nold General Chang Hsun on the Pukow railway for the purpose of overawing\r\nparliament, and securing that the Military Party retained a controlling\r\nhand behind the scenes. It is perhaps unnecessary to-day to do more than\r\nnote the fact that the peace of the country was badly strained by this\r\nprocedure; but thanks to moderate counsels and the wisdom of the\r\nPresident no open breach occurred and there is reason to believe that\r\nthis experiment will not be repeated,--at least not in the same way.[21]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty to be solved is of an unique nature. It is not that the\r\ngenerals and the Military Party are necessarily reactionary: it is that,\r\nnot belonging to the intellectual-literary portion of the ruling\r\nelements, they are less advanced and less accustomed to foreign ways,\r\nand therefore more in touch with the older China which lingers on in the\r\nvast agricultural districts, and in all those myriad of townships which\r\nare dotted far and wide across the provinces to the confines of Central\r\nAsia. Naturally it is hard for a class of men who hold the balance of\r\npower and carry on much of the actual work of governing to submit to the\r\npaper decrees of an institution they do not accept as being responsible\r\nand representative: but many indications are available that when a\r\nPermanent Constitution has been promulgated, and made an article of\r\nfaith in all the schools, a change for the better will come and the old\r\nantagonisms gradually disappear.\r\n\r\nIt is on this Constitution that Parliament has been at work ever since\r\nit re-assembled in August, 1916, and which is now practically completed.\r\nSitting together three times a week as a National Convention, the two\r\nHouses have subjected the Draft Constitution (which was prepared by a\r\nSpecial Parliamentary Drafting Committee) to a very exhaustive\r\nexamination and discussion. Many violent scenes have naturally marked\r\nthe progress of this important work, the two great parties, the Kuo Ming\r\nTang and the Chinputang, coming to loggerheads again and again. But in\r\nthe main the debates and the decisions arrived at have been satisfactory\r\nand important, because they have tended to express in a concrete and\r\nindisputable form the present state of the Chinese mind and its immense\r\nunderlying commonsense. Remarkable discussions and fierce enmities, for\r\ninstance, marked the final decision not to make the Confucian cult the\r\nState Religion; but there is not the slightest doubt that in formally\r\nregistering this veritable revolution in the secret stronghold of\r\nChinese political thought, a Bastille has been overthrown and the\r\nground left clear for the development of individualism and personal\r\nresponsibility in a way which was impossible under the leaden formulae\r\nof the greatest of the Chinese sages. In defining the relationship which\r\nmust exist between the Central Government and the provinces even more\r\nformidable difficulties have been encountered, the apostles of\r\ndecentralization and the advocates of centralization refusing for many\r\nmonths to agree on the so-called Provincial system, and then fighting a\r\nbattle _à outrance_ on the question of whether this body of law should\r\nform a chapter in the Constitution or be simply an annexure to the main\r\ninstrument. The agreement which was finally arrived at--to make it part\r\nand parcel of the Constitution--was masterly in that it has secured that\r\nthe sovereignty of the people will not tend to be expressed in the\r\nprovincial dietines which have now been re-erected (after having been\r\nsummarily destroyed by Yuan Shih-kai), the Central Parliament being left\r\nthe absolute master. This for a number of years will no doubt be more of\r\na theory than a practice; but there is every indication that\r\nparliamentary government will within a limited period be more successful\r\nin China than in some European countries; and that the Chinese with\r\ntheir love of well-established procedure and cautious action, will\r\nselect open debate as the best method of sifting the grain from the\r\nchaff and deciding every important matter by the vote of the majority.\r\nAlready in the period of 1916-1917 Parliament has more than justified\r\nits re-convocation by becoming a National Watch Committee.\r\nInterpellations on every conceivable subject have been constant and\r\nfrequent; fierce verbal assaults are delivered on Cabinet Ministers; and\r\nslowly but inexorably a real sense of Ministerial responsibility is\r\nbeing created, the fear of having to run the gauntlet of Parliament\r\nabating, if it has not yet entirely destroyed, many malpractices. In the\r\nopinion of the writer in less than ten years Parliament will have\r\nsucceeded in coalescing the country into an organic whole, and will have\r\nplaced the Cabinet in such close daily relations with it that something\r\nvery similar to the Anglo-Saxon theory of government will be impregnably\r\nentrenched in Peking. That such a miracle should be possible in extreme\r\nEastern Asia is one more proof that there are no victories beyond the\r\ncapacity of the human mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Tsao-ao, the Hero of the Yunnan Rebellion of\r\n1915-16, who died from the effects of the campaign.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Liang Shih-yi, who was the Power behind Yuan Shih-kai,\r\nnow proscribed and living in exile at Hong-Kong.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for the time being, in China as in countries ten thousand\r\nmiles away, ministerial irresponsibility is the enemy; that is to say\r\nthat so-called Cabinet-rule, with the effacement of the Chief Executive,\r\nhas tended to make Cabinet Ministers removed from effective daily\r\ncontrol. All sorts of things are done which should not be done and men\r\nare still in charge of portfolios who should be summarily expelled from\r\nthe capital for malpractices.[22] But although Chinese are slow to take\r\naction and prefer to delay all decisions until they have about them the\r\ninexorable quality which is associated with Fate, there is not the\r\nslightest doubt that in the long run the dishonest suffer, and an\r\nincreasingly efficient body of men take their place. From every point of\r\nview then there is reason for congratulation in the present position,\r\nand every hope that the future will unroll peacefully.\r\n\r\nA visit to Parliament under the new régime is a revelation to most men:\r\nthe candid come away with an impression which is never effaced from\r\ntheir minds. There is a peculiar suggestiveness even in the location of\r\nthe Houses of the National Assembly. They are tucked away in the distant\r\nWestern city immediately under the shadow of the vast Tartar Wall as if\r\nit had been fully expected when they were called into being that they\r\nwould never justify their existence, and that the crushing weight of the\r\ngreat bastion of brick and stone surrounding the capital would soon\r\nprove to them how futile it was for such palpable intruders to aspire to\r\nnational control. Under Yuan Shih-kai, as under the Manchus, they were\r\nan exercise in the arm of government, something which was never to be\r\nallowed to harden into a settled practice. They were first cousins to\r\nrailways, to electrical power, to metalled roadways and all those other\r\nmodern instances beginning to modify an ancient civilization entirely\r\nbased on agriculture; and because they were so distantly related to the\r\nreal China of the farm-yard it was thought that they would always stand\r\noutside the national life.\r\n\r\nThat was what the fools believed. Yet in a copy of the rules of\r\nprocedure of the old Imperial Senate (Tzuchengyuan) the writer finds\r\nthis note written in 1910: \"The Debates of this body have been\r\nremarkable during the very first session. They make it seem clear that\r\nthe first National Parliament of 1913 will seize control of China and\r\nnullify the power of the Throne. Result, revolution--\" Though the dating\r\nis a little confused, the prophecy is worthy of record.\r\n\r\nThe watchfulness of the special police surrounding the Parliament of\r\n1916-1917 and the great number of these men also tells a story as\r\neloquent as the location of the building. It is not so much that any\r\ncontemplated violence sets these guardians here as the necessity to\r\nadvertise that there has been unconstitutional violence in the past\r\nwhich, if possible, will be rigidly defeated in the future. Probably no\r\nNational Assembly in the world has been held up to greater contempt than\r\nthe Parliament of Peking and probably no body deserves it less. An\r\nafternoon spent in the House of Representatives would certainly surprise\r\nmost open-minded men who have been content to believe that the Chinese\r\nexperiment was what some critics have alleged it to be. The Chinese as a\r\npeople, being used to guild-house proceedings, debates, in which the\r\nwelfare of the majority is decided after an examination of the\r\nprinciples at stake, are a very old and well-established custom; and\r\nthough at present there are awkwardnesses and gaucheries to be noted,\r\nwhen practice has become better fixed, the common sense of the race will\r\nabundantly disclose itself and make a lasting mark on contemporary\r\nhistory. There can be no doubt about this at all.\r\n\r\nTake your seat in the gallery and see for yourself. The first question\r\nwhich rises to the lips is--where are the young men, those crude and\r\ncallow youths masquerading as legislators which the vernacular press has\r\nso excessively lampooned? The majority of the members, so far from being\r\nyoung, are men of thirty or forty, or even fifty, with intelligent and\r\ntired faces that have lost the Spring of youth. Here and there you will\r\neven see venerable greybeards suffering from rheumy coughs who ought to\r\nbe at home; and though occasionally there is a lithe youngster in\r\nEuropean clothes with the veneer he acquired abroad not yet completely\r\nrubbed off, the total impression is that of oldish men who have reached\r\nyears of maturity and who are as representative of the country and as\r\ngood as the country is in a position to-day to provide. No one who knows\r\nthe real China can deny that.\r\n\r\nThe Continental arrangement of the Members' desks and the raised tribune\r\nof the Speaker, with its rows of clerks and recorders, make an\r\nimpression of orderliness, tinged nevertheless with a faint\r\nrevolutionary flavour. Perhaps it is the straight black Chinese hair and\r\nthe rich silk clothing, set on a very plain and unadorned background,\r\nwhich recall the pictures of the French Revolution. It is somehow\r\nnatural in such circumstances that there should occasionally be dramatic\r\noutbursts with the blood of offenders bitterly demanded as though we\r\nwere not living in the Twentieth Century when blood alone is admittedly\r\nno satisfaction. The presence of armed House police at every door, and\r\nin the front rows of the strangers' gallery as well, contributes to this\r\nimpression which has certain qualities of the theatre about it and is\r\noddly stimulating. China at work legislating has already created her\r\nfirst traditions: she is proceeding deliberately armed--with the\r\nlessons of the immediate past fully noted.\r\n\r\nThis being the home of a literary race, papers and notebooks are on most\r\nMembers' desks. As the electric bells ring sharply an unending\r\nprocession of men file in to take their seats, for there has been a\r\nrecess and the House has been only half-filled. Nearly every one is in\r\nChinese dress (_pien-yi_) with the Member's badge pinned conspicuously\r\non the breast. The idea speedily becomes a conviction that this after\r\nall is not extraneous to the nation, but actually of the living flesh, a\r\nvital and imperative thing. The vastness and audacity of it all cannot\r\nfail to strike the imaginative mind, for the four or five hundred men\r\nwho are gathered here typify, if they do not yet represent, the four or\r\nfive hundred millions who make up the country. You see as it were the\r\nnation in profile, a ponderous, slow-moving mass, quickly responsive to\r\ncurious sub-conscious influences--suddenly angry and suddenly calm again\r\nbecause Reason has after all always been the great goddess which is\r\nperpetually worshipped. All are scholarly and deliberate in their\r\nmovements. When the Speaker calls the House in order and the debate\r\ncommences, deep silence comes save for the movement of hundreds of\r\nnervous hands that touch papers or fidget to and fro. Every man uses\r\nhis hands, particularly when he speaks, not clenched as a European would\r\ndo, but open, with the slim fingers speaking a language of their own,\r\ntwisting, turning, insinuating, deriding, a little history of\r\ncompromises. It would be interesting to write the story of China from a\r\nstudy of the hands.\r\n\r\nEach man goes to the rostrum to speak, and each has much to say. Soon\r\nanother impression deepens--that the Northerners with their clear-cut\r\nspeech and their fuller voices have an advantage over the Southerners of\r\nthe kind that all public performers know. The mandarin language of\r\nPeking is after all the mother-language of officialdom, the _madre\r\nlingua_, less nervous and more precise than any other dialect and\r\ninvested with a certain air of authority which cannot be denied. The\r\nsharp-sounding, high-pitched Southern voice, though it may argue very\r\nacutely and rapidly, appears at an increasing disadvantage. There seems\r\nto be a tendency inherent in it to become querulous, to make its\r\npleading sound specious because of over-much speech. These are curious\r\nlittle things which have been not without influence in other regions of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe applause when it comes proves the same thing as applause does\r\neverywhere; that if you want to drive home your points in a large\r\nassembly you must be condensed and simple, using broad, slashing\r\narguments. This is precisely what distinguishes melodrama from drama,\r\nand which explains why excessive analysis is no argument in the popular\r\nmind. Generally, however, there is not much applause and the voice of\r\nthe speaker wanders through the hall uninterrupted by signs of content\r\nor discontent. Sometimes, although rather rarely, there is a gust of\r\nlaughter as a point is scored against a hated rival. But it dies away as\r\nsuddenly as it arose--almost before you have noted it, as if it were\r\nsuperfluous and must make room for more serious things.\r\n\r\nWith the closing of a debate there is the vote. An electric bell rings\r\nagain, and with a rough hand the House police close all the exits. The\r\nclerks come down into the aisles. They seem to move listlessly and\r\nindifferently; yet very quickly they have checked the membership to\r\ninsure that the excessively large quorum requisite is present. Now the\r\nSpeaker calls for the vote. Massively and stiffly, as at a word of\r\ncommand the \"ayes\" rise in their seats. There is a round of applause;\r\nthe bill has been carried almost unanimously. That, however, is not\r\nalways so. When there is an obstreperous mood abroad, the House will\r\ndecline to proceed with the agenda, and a dozen men will rise at a time\r\nand speak from behind their desks, trying to talk each other down. The\r\nSpeaker stands patiently wrestling with the problem of procedure--and\r\noften failing since practice is still in process of being formed. Years\r\nmust elapse before absolutely hard-and-fast rules are established. Still\r\nthe progress already made since August, 1916, is remarkable, and\r\nsomething is being learned every day. The business of a Parliament is\r\nafter all to debate--to give voice to the uppermost thoughts in the\r\nnation's mind; and how those thoughts are expressed is a continual\r\nexposition of the real state of the nation's political beliefs.\r\nParliament is--or should be--a microcosm of the race; parliament is\r\nnever any better or any worse than the mass of the people. The rule of\r\nthe majority as expressed in the voting of the National Assembly must be\r\ntaken as a fundamental thing; China is no exception to the rule--the\r\nrule of the majority must be decisive. But here another complexity of\r\nthe new Chinese political life enters into the problem. The existence of\r\na responsible Cabinet, which is not yet linked to the Legislative body\r\nin any well-understood way, and which furthermore has frequently acted\r\nin opposition to the President's office, makes for a daily struggle in\r\nthe administration of the country which is strongly to be condemned and\r\nwhich has already led to some ugly clashes. But nevertheless there are\r\nincreasing indications that parliamentary government is making steady\r\nheadway and that when both the Permanent Constitution and the Local\r\nGovernment system have been enforced, a new note will be struck. No\r\ndoubt it will need a younger generation in office to secure a complete\r\nabandonment of all the old ways, but the writer has noted with\r\nastonishment during the past twelve-month how eager even viceroys\r\nbelonging to the old Manchu régime have become to fall in with the new\r\norder and to lend their help, a sharp competition to obtain ministerial\r\nposts being evident in spite of the fact that the gauntlet of Parliament\r\nhas to be run and a majority vote recorded before any appointment is\r\nvalid.\r\n\r\nOne last anomaly has, however, yet to be done away with in Peking. The\r\ndeposed boy Emperor still resides in the Winter Palace surrounded by a\r\nminiature court,--a state of affairs which should not be tolerated any\r\nlonger as it no doubt tends to assist the rumours which every now and\r\nagain are mysteriously spread by interested parties that a Restoration\r\nis imminent. The time has arrived when not only must the Manchu Imperial\r\nFamily be removed far from the capital but a scheme worked out for\r\ncommuting the pension-system of so-called Bannerman families who still\r\ndraw their monthly allowances as under the Manchus, thanks to the\r\narticles of Favourable Treatment signed at the time of abdication of\r\n1912. When these two important questions have been settled, imperialism\r\nin China will tend rapidly to fade into complete oblivion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Although the events dealt with in Chapter XVI have brought China\r\nface to face with a new crisis the force of the arguments used here is\r\nin no wise weakened.\r\n\r\n[22] Since this was written two Cabinet Ministers have been summarily\r\narrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE REPUBLIC IN COLLISION WITH REALITY: TWO TYPICAL INSTANCES OF\r\n\"FOREIGN AGGRESSION\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the internal conditions which the new administration\r\nwas called upon to face with the death of Yuan Shih-kai. With very\r\nlittle money in the National Treasury and with the provinces unable or\r\nunwilling to remit to the capital a single dollar, it was fortunate that\r\nat least one public service, erected under foreign pressure, should be\r\nbrilliantly justifying its existence. The Salt Administration,\r\nefficiently reorganized in the space of three years by the great Indian\r\nauthority, Sir Richard Dane, was now providing a monthly surplus of\r\nnearly five million dollars; and it was this revenue which kept China\r\nalive during a troubled transitional period when every one was declaring\r\nthat she must die. By husbanding this hard cash and mixing it liberally\r\nwith paper money, the Central Government has been able since June, 1916,\r\nto meet its current obligations and to keep the general machinery from\r\nbreaking down.\r\n\r\nBut in a country such as China new dangers have to be constantly faced\r\nand smoothed away--the interests of the outer world pressing on the\r\ncountry and conflicting with the native interest at a myriad points. And\r\nin order to illustrate and make clear the sort of daily exacerbation\r\nwhich the nation must endure because of the vastness of its territory\r\nand the octopus-hold of the foreigner we give two typical cases of\r\ninternational trouble which have occurred since Yuan Shih-kai's death.\r\nThe first is the well-known Chengchiatun incident which occurred in\r\nManchuria in August, 1916: the second is the Lao-hsi-kai affair which\r\ntook place in Tientsin in November of the same year and created a storm\r\nof rage against France throughout North China which at the moment of\r\nwriting has not yet abated.\r\n\r\nThe facts about the Chengchiatun incident are incredibly simple and\r\nmerit being properly told. Chengchiatun is a small Mongol-Manchurian\r\nmarket-town lying some sixty miles west of the South Manchurian railway\r\nby the ordinary cart-roads, though as the crow flies the distance is\r\nmuch less. The country round about is \"new country,\" the prefecture in\r\nwhich Chengchiatun lies being originally purely Mongol territory on\r\nwhich Chinese squatted in such numbers that it was necessary to erect\r\nthe ordinary Chinese civil administration. Thirty or forty miles due\r\nwest of the town cultivation practically ceases; and then nothing meets\r\nthe eye but the rolling grasslands of Mongolia, with their sparse\r\nencampments of nomad horsemen and shepherds which stretch so\r\nmonotonously into the infinities of High Asia.\r\n\r\nThe region is strategically important because the trade-routes converge\r\nthere from the growing marts of the Taonanfu administration, which is\r\nthe extreme westernly limit of Chinese authority in the Mongolian\r\nborderland. A rich exchange in hides, furs, skins, cattle and foodstuffs\r\nhas given this frontier town from year to year an increasing importance\r\nin the eyes of the Chinese who are fully aware of the dangers of a\r\nlaissez aller policy and are determined to protect the rights they have\r\nacquired by pre-emption. The fact that notorious Mongol brigand-chiefs,\r\nsuch as the famous Babachapu who was allied to the Manchu Restoration\r\nParty and who was said to have been subsidized by the Japanese Military\r\nParty, had been making Chengchiatun one of their objectives, brought\r\nconcern early in 1916 to the Moukden Governor, the energetic General\r\nChang Tso-lin, who in order to cope with the danger promptly established\r\na military cordon round the district, with a relatively large reserve\r\nbased on Chengchiatun, drawn from the 28th Army Division. A certain\r\namount of desultory fighting months before any one had heard of the town\r\nhad given Chengchiatun the odour of the camp; and when in the summer the\r\nJapanese began military manoeuvres in the district with various\r\nscattered detachments, on the excuse that the South Manchuria railway\r\nzone where they alone had the right under the Portsmouth Peace Treaty to\r\nbe, was too cramped for field exercises, it became apparent that\r\ndangerous developments might be expected--particularly as a body of\r\nJapanese infantry was billeted right in the centre of the town.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th August a Japanese civilian at Chengchiatun--there is a small\r\nJapanese trading community there--approached a Chinese boy who was\r\nselling fish. On the boy refusing to sell at the price offered him, the\r\nJapanese caught hold of him and started beating him. A Chinese soldier\r\nof the 28th Division who was passing intervened; and a scuffle commenced\r\nin which other Chinese soldiers joined and which resulted in the\r\nJapanese being severely handled. After the Chinese had left him, the man\r\nbetook himself to the nearest Japanese post and reported that he had\r\nbeen grievously assaulted by Chinese soldiers for no reason whatsoever.\r\nA Japanese gendarme made a preliminary investigation in company with the\r\nman; then returning to the Japanese barracks, declared that he could\r\nfind no one in authority; that his attempts at discovering the culprits\r\nhad been resisted; and that he must have help. The Japanese officer in\r\ncommand, who was a captain, detailed a lieutenant and twenty men to\r\nproceed to the Chinese barracks to obtain satisfaction from the Chinese\r\nCommander--using force if necessary. It was precisely in this way that\r\nthe play was set in motion.\r\n\r\nThe detachment marched off to the headquarters of the offending Chinese\r\ndetachment, which was billeted in a pawnshop, and tried to force their\r\nway past a sentry who stood his ground, into the inner courtyards. A\r\nlong parley ensued with lowered bayonets; and at last on the Chinese\r\nsoldier absolutely refusing to give way, the lieutenant gave orders to\r\ncut him down. There appears to be no doubt about these important\r\nfacts--that is to say, that the act of war was the deliberate attack by\r\na Japanese armed detachment on a Chinese sentry who was guarding the\r\nquarters of his Commander.\r\n\r\nA frightful scene followed. It appears that scattered groups of Chinese\r\nsoldiers, some with their arms, and some without, had collected during\r\nthis crisis and point-blank firing at once commenced. The first shots\r\nappear to have been fired--though this was never proved--by a Chinese\r\nrégimental groom, who was standing with some horses some distance away\r\nin the gateway of some stabling and who is said to have killed or\r\nwounded the largest number of Japanese. In any case, seven Japanese\r\nsoldiers were killed outright, five more mortally wounded and four\r\nseverely so, the Chinese themselves losing four killed, besides a number\r\nof wounded. The remnant of the Japanese detachment after this rude\r\nreverse managed to retreat with their wounded officer to their own\r\nbarracks where the whole detachment barricaded themselves in, firing for\r\nmany hours at everything that moved on the roads though absolutely no\r\nattempt was made by the Chinese soldiery to advance against them.\r\n\r\nThe sound of this heavy firing, and the wild report that many Japanese\r\nhad been killed, had meanwhile spread panic throughout the town, and\r\nthere was a general _sauve qui peut_, a terrible retribution being\r\nfeared. The local Magistrate finally restored some semblance of order;\r\nand after dark proceeded in person with some notables of the town to the\r\nJapanese barracks to tender his regrets and to arrange for the removal\r\nof the Japanese corpses which were lying just as they had fallen, and\r\nwhich Chinese custom demanded should be decently cared for, though they\r\nconstituted important and irrefragible evidence of the armed invasion\r\nwhich had been practised. The Japanese Commander, instead of meeting\r\nthese conciliatory attempts half-way, thereupon illegally arrested the\r\nMagistrate and locked him up, being impelled to this action by the\r\ngeneral fear among his men that a mass attack would be made in the night\r\nby the Chinese troops in garrison and the whole command wiped out.\r\nNothing, however, occurred and on the 14th instant the Magistrate was\r\nduly released on his sending for his son to take his place as hostage.\r\nOn the 16th the Magistrate had successfully arranged the withdrawal of\r\nall Chinese troops five miles outside the town to prevent further\r\nclashes. On the 15th Japanese cavalry and infantry began to arrive in\r\nlarge numbers from the South Manchuria railway zone (where they alone\r\nhave the Treaty right to be) and the town of Chengchiatun was\r\narbitrarily placed by them in a state of siege.\r\n\r\nHere is the stuff of which the whole incident was made: there is nothing\r\nmaterial beyond the facts stated which illustrate very glaringly the\r\nmanner in which a strong Power acts towards a weak one.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the effect in Tokio of these happenings had been electrical.\r\nRelying on the well-known Japanese police axiom, that the man who gets\r\nin his story first is the prosecutor and the accused the guilty party,\r\nirrespective of what the evidence may be, the newspapers all came out\r\nwith the same account of a calculated attack by \"ferocious Chinese\r\nsoldiers\" on a Japanese detachment and the general public were asked to\r\nbelieve that a number of their enlisted nationals had been deliberately\r\nand brutally murdered. It was not, however, until more than a week after\r\nthe incident that an official report was published by the Tokio Foreign\r\nOffice, when the following garbled account was distributed far and wide\r\nas the Japanese case:--\r\n\r\n    \"When one Kiyokishy Yoshimoto, aged 27, an employé of a Japanese\r\n    apothecary at Chengchiatun, was passing the headquarters of the\r\n    Chinese troops on the 13th instant, a Chinese soldier stopped him,\r\n    and, with some remarks, which were unintelligible to the Japanese,\r\n    suddenly struck him on the head. Yoshimoto became enraged, but was\r\n    soon surrounded by a large number of Chinese soldiers and others,\r\n    who subjected him to all kind of humiliation. As a result of this\r\n    lawlessness on the part of the Chinese, the Japanese sustained\r\n    injuries in seven or eight places, but somehow he managed to break\r\n    away and reach a Japanese police box, where he applied for help. On\r\n    receipt of this news, a policeman, named Kowase, hastened to the\r\n    spot, but by the time he arrived there all the offenders had fled.\r\n    He therefore repaired to the headquarters of the Chinese to lay a\r\n    complaint, but the sentry stopped him, and presented a pistol at\r\n    him, and under these circumstances he was obliged to apply to the\r\n    Japanese Garrison headquarters, where Captain Inone instructed\r\n    Lieutenant Matsuo with twenty men to escort the policeman to the\r\n    Chinese headquarters. When the party approached the Chinese\r\n    headquarters, Chinese troops began to fire, and the policeman and\r\n    others were either killed or wounded. Despite the fact that the\r\n    Japanese troops retired, the Chinese troops did not give up firing,\r\n    but besieged the Japanese garrison, delivering several severe\r\n    attacks. Soon after the fighting ceased, the Chinese authorities\r\n    visited the Japanese barracks, and expressed the desire that the\r\n    affair be settled amicably. It was the original intention of the\r\n    Japanese troops to fight it out, but they were completely\r\n    outnumbered, and lest the safety of the Japanese residents be\r\n    endangered, they stopped fighting. On examination of the dead bodies\r\n    of seven Japanese soldiers, who were attacked outside the barracks,\r\n    it was discovered that they had been all slain by the Chinese\r\n    troops, the bodies bearing marks of violence.\"\r\n\r\nWithout entering again into the merits of the case, we would ask those\r\nwho are acquainted with recent history whether it is likely that Chinese\r\nsoldiers, knowing all the pains and penalties attaching to such action,\r\nwould deliberately attack a body of twenty armed Japanese under an\r\nofficer as the Japanese official account states? We believe that no\r\nimpartial tribunal, investigating the matter on the spot, could fail to\r\npoint out the real aggressors and withal lay bare the web of a most\r\namazing state of affairs. For in order to understand what occurred, on\r\nthe 13th August, 1916, it is necessary to turn far away from\r\nChengchiatun and see what lies behind it all.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the brain of the Japanese Military Party, which by no\r\nmeans represents the Japanese nation or the Japanese Government although\r\nit exercises a powerful influence on both, is the fixed idea that South\r\nManchuria and Inner Mongolia must be turned into a strongly held and\r\nfortified Japanese _enclave_, if the balance of power in Eastern Asia is\r\nto be maintained. Pursuant to this idea, Japanese diplomacy was induced\r\nmany months ago to concentrate its efforts on winning--if not\r\nwringing--from Russia the strategically important strip of railway south\r\nof the Sungari River, because (and this should be carefully noted) with\r\nthe Sungari as the undisputed dividing-line between the Russian and\r\nJapanese spheres in Manchuria, and with Japanese shallow-draft gun-boats\r\nnavigating that waterway and entering the Nonni river, it would be easily\r\npossible for Japan to complete a \"Continental quadrilateral\" which would\r\ninclude Korea, South Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, the extreme western\r\nbarrier of which would be the new system of Inner Mongolian railways\r\ncentring round Taonanfu and terminating at Jehol, for which Japan already\r\nholds the building rights[23]. Policing rights--in the outer zone of this\r\n_enclave_,--with a total exclusion of all Chinese garrisons, is the\r\npreliminary goal towards which the Japanese Military Party has been long\r\nplainly marching; and long before anybody had heard of Chengchiatun, a\r\nscheme of reconnoitring detachments had been put in force to spy out the\r\nland and form working alliances with the Mongol bands in order to harass\r\nand drive away all the representatives of Chinese authority. What\r\noccurred, then, at Chengchiatun might have taken place at any one of\r\nhalf-a-dozen other places in this vast and little-known region whither\r\nJapanese detachments have silently gone; and if Chinese diplomacy in the\r\nmonth of August, 1916, was faced with a rude surprise, it was only what\r\npolitical students had long been expecting. For though Japan should be\r\nthe real defender of Chinese liberties, it is a fact that in Chinese\r\naffairs Japanese diplomacy has been too long dictated to by the Military\r\nParty in Tokio and attempts nothing save when violence allows it to tear\r\nfrom China some fresh portion of her independence.\r\n\r\nAnd here we reach the crux of the matter. One of the little known\r\npeculiarities of the day lies in the fact that Japan is the land of\r\npolitical inaction _because there is no tradition of action save that\r\nwhich has been built up by the military and naval chiefs since the\r\nChinese war of_ 1894-95. Having only visualized the world in\r\ninternational terms during two short decades, there has been no time for\r\na proper tradition to be created by the civil government of Japan; and\r\nbecause there is no such tradition, the island empire of the East has no\r\ntrue foreign policy and is at the mercy of manufactured crises, being\r\ntoo often committed to petty adventures which really range her on the\r\nside of those in Europe the Allies have set themselves to destroy. It is\r\nfor this reason that the Chinese are consistently treated as though they\r\nwere hewers of wood and drawers of water, helots who are occasionally\r\nnattered in the columns of the daily press and yet are secretly looked\r\nupon as men who have been born merely to be cuffed and conquered. The\r\nMoukden Governor, General Chang Tso-lin, discussing the Chengchiatun\r\naffair with the writer, put the matter in a nutshell. Striking the table\r\nhe exclaimed: \"After all we are not made of wood like this, we too are\r\nflesh and blood and must defend our own people. A dozen times I have\r\nsaid, 'Let them come and take Manchuria openly if they dare, but let\r\nthem cease their childish intrigues.' Why do they not do so? Because\r\nthey are not sure they can swallow us--not at all sure. Do you\r\nunderstand? We are weak, we are stupid, we are divided, but we are\r\ninnumerable, and in the end, if they persist, China will burst the\r\nJapanese stomach.\"\r\n\r\nSuch passionate periods are all very well, but when it comes to the\r\nsober business of the council chamber it is a regrettable fact that\r\nChinese, although foreign friends implore them to do so, do not properly\r\nuse the many weapons in their armoury. Thus in this particular case,\r\ninstead of at once hurrying to Chengchiatun some of the many foreign\r\nadvisers who sit kicking their heels in Peking from one end of the year\r\nto the other and who number competent jurisconsults, China did next to\r\nnothing. No proper report was drawn up on the spot; sworn statements\r\nwere not gathered, nor were witnesses brought to Peking; and it\r\ntherefore happened that when Japan filed her demands for redress, China\r\nhad not in her possession anything save an utterly inadequate defence.\r\nMainly because of this she was forced to agree to forgoing any direct\r\ndiscussion of the rights and wrongs of the case, proceeding directly to\r\nnegotiations based on the various claims which Japan filed and which\r\nwere as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1. Punishment of the General commanding the 28th Division.\r\n\r\n    2. The dismissal of officers at Chengchiatun responsible for the\r\n    occurrence as well as the severe punishment of those who took direct\r\n    part in the fracas.\r\n\r\n    3. Proclamations to be posted ordering all Chinese soldiers and\r\n    civilians in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia to refrain\r\n    from any act calculated to provoke a breach of the peace with\r\n    Japanese soldiers or civilians.\r\n\r\n    4. China to agree to the stationing of Japanese police officers in\r\n    places in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia where their\r\n    presence was considered necessary for the protection of Japanese\r\n    subjects. China also to agree to the engagement by the officials of\r\n    South Manchuria of Japanese police advisers.\r\n\r\n    _And in addition_:--\r\n\r\n    1. Chinese troops stationed in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner\r\n    Mongolia to employ a certain number of Japanese Military officers as\r\n    advisers.\r\n\r\n    2. Chinese Military Cadet schools to employ a certain number of\r\n    Japanese Military officers as instructors.\r\n\r\n    3. The Military Governor of Moukden to proceed personally to Port\r\n    Arthur to the Japanese Military Governor of Kwantung to apologize\r\n    for the occurrence and to tender similar personal apologies to the\r\n    Japanese Consul General in Moukden.\r\n\r\n    4. Adequate compensation to be paid by China to the Japanese\r\n    sufferers and to the families of those killed.\r\n\r\nThe merest tyro will see at once that so far from caring very much about\r\nthe killing of her soldiery, Japan was bent on utilizing the opportunity\r\nto gain a certain number of new rights and privileges in the zone of\r\nSouthern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia--notably an extension of\r\nher police and military-supervision rights. In spite, however, of the\r\nfaulty procedure to which she had consented, China showed considerable\r\ntenacity in the course of negotiations which lasted nearly half a year,\r\nand by the end of January, 1917, had whittled down the question of\r\nJapanese compensation to fairly meagre proportions. To be precise the\r\ntwo governments agreed to embody by the exchange of Notes the five\r\nfollowing stipulations:--\r\n\r\n    1. The General commanding the 28th Division to be reprimanded.\r\n\r\n    2. Officers responsible to be punished according to law. If the law\r\n    provides for severe punishment, such punishment will be inflicted.\r\n\r\n    3. Proclamations to be issued enjoining Chinese soldiers and\r\n    civilians in the districts where there is mixed residence to accord\r\n    considerate treatment to Japanese soldiers and civilians.\r\n\r\n    4. The Military Governor of Moukden to send a representative to Port\r\n    Arthur to convey his regret when the Military Governor of Kwantung\r\n    and Japanese Consul General at Moukden are there together.\r\n\r\n    5. A solatium of $500 (Five Hundred Dollars) to be given to the\r\n    Japanese merchant Yoshimoto.\r\n\r\nBut though the incident was thus nominally closed, and amicable\r\nrelations restored, the most important point--the question of Japanese\r\npolice-rights in Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia--was left\r\nprecisely where it had been before, the most vigorous Chinese protests\r\nnot having induced Japan to abate in the slightest her pretensions.\r\nDuring previous years a number of Japanese police-stations and\r\npolice-boxes had been established in defiance of the local authorities\r\nin these regions, and although China in these negotiations recorded her\r\nstrongest possible objection to their presence as being the principal\r\ncause of the continual friction between Chinese and Japanese, Japan\r\nrefused to withdraw from her contention that they did not constitute any\r\nextension of the principle of extraterritoriality, and that indeed\r\nJapanese police, distributed at such points as the Japanese consular\r\nauthorities considered necessary, must be permanently accepted. Here\r\nthen is a matter which will require careful consideration when the\r\nPowers meet to revise their Chinese Treaties as they must revise them\r\nafter the world-war; for Japan in Manchuria is fundamentally in no\r\ndifferent a position from England in the Yangtsze Valley and what\r\napplies to one must apply to the other. The new Chinese police which are\r\nbeing distributed in ever greater numbers throughout China form an\r\nadmirable force and are superior to Japanese police in the performance\r\nof nearly all their duties. It is monstrous that Japan, as well as other\r\nPowers, should act in such a reprehensible manner when the Chinese\r\nadministration is doing all it can to provide efficient guardians of the\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Famous or Infamous General Chang-Hsun, the leading\r\nReactionary in China to-day, who still commands a force of 30,000 men\r\nastride of the Pukow Railway.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Bas-relief in a Peking Temple, well illustrating\r\nIndo-Chinese influences.]\r\n\r\nThe second case was one in which French officialdom by a curious act of\r\nfolly gravely alienated Chinese sympathies and gave a powerful weapon to\r\nthe German propaganda in China at the end of 1916. The Lao-hsi-kai\r\ndispute, which involved a bare 333 acres of land in Tientsin, has now\r\ntaken its place beside the Chengchiatun affair, and has become a leading\r\ncase in that great dossier of griefs which many Chinese declare make up\r\nthe corpus of Euro-Chinese relations. Here again the facts are\r\nabsolutely simple and absolutely undisputed. In 1902 the French consular\r\nauthorities in Tientsin filed a request to have their Concession\r\nextended on the ground that they were becoming cramped. The Chinese\r\nauthorities, although not wishing to grant the request and indeed\r\nignoring it for a long time, were finally induced to begin fitful\r\nnegotiations; and in October, 1916, after having passed through various\r\nprocesses of alteration, reduction, and re-statement during the interval\r\nof fourteen years, the issue had been so fined down that a virtual\r\nagreement regarding the administration of the new area had been\r\nreached--an agreement which the Peking Government was prepared to put\r\ninto force subject to one reasonable stipulation, that the local\r\nopposition to the new grant of territory which was very real, as Chinese\r\nfeel passionately on the subject of the police-control of their\r\nland-acreage, was first overcome. The whole essence or soul of the\r\ndisputes lay therein: that the lords of the soil, the people of China,\r\nand in this case more particularly the population of Tientsin, should\r\naccept the decision arrived at which was that a joint Franco-Chinese\r\nadministration be established under a Chinese Chairman.\r\n\r\nWhen the terms of this proposed agreement were communicated to the\r\nTientsin Consulate by the French Legation the arrangement did not please\r\nthe French Consul-General, who was under transfer to Shanghai and who\r\nproposed to settle the case to the satisfaction of his nationals before\r\nhe left. There is absolutely no dispute about this fact either--namely\r\nthat the main pre-occupation of a consular officer, charged primarily\r\nunder the Treaties with the simple preservation of law and order among\r\nhis nationals, was the closing-up of a vexatious outstanding case, by\r\nforce if necessary, before he handed over his office to his successor.\r\nIt was with this idea that an ultimatum was drawn up by the French\r\nConsul General and, having been weakly approved by the French Legation,\r\nwas handed to the Chinese local authorities. It gave them a time-limit\r\nof twenty-four hours in which to effect the complete police evacuation\r\nof the coveted strip of territory on the ground that the delay in the\r\nsignature of a formal Protocol had been wilful and deliberate and had\r\nclosed the door to further negotiations; and as no response came at the\r\nend of the time-limit, an open invasion of Chinese territory was\r\npractised by an armed French detachment; nine uniformed Chinese\r\nconstables on duty being forcibly removed and locked up in French\r\nbarracks and French sentries posted on the disputed boundary.\r\n\r\nThe result of this misguided action was an enormous Chinese outcry and\r\nthe beginning of a boycott of the French in North China,--and this in\r\nthe middle of a war when France has acted with inspiring nobility. Some\r\n2,000 native police, servants and employé's promptly deserted the French\r\nConcession _en masse_; popular unions were formed to keep alive\r\nresentment; and although in the end the arrested police were set at\r\nliberty, the friendly intervention of the Allies proved unable to effect\r\na settlement of the case which at the moment of writing remains\r\nprecisely where it was a year ago.[24]\r\n\r\nHere you have the matter of foreign interests in China explained in the\r\nsense that they appear to Chinese. It is not too much to say that this\r\nillustration of the deliberate lawlessness, which has too often been\r\npractised in the past by consuls who are simply Justices of the Peace,\r\nwould be incredible elsewhere; and yet it is this lawlessness which has\r\ncome to be accepted as part and parcel of what is called \"policy\" in\r\nChina because in the fifty years preceding the establishment of the\r\nRepublic a weak and effeminate mandarinate consistently sought safety in\r\nsurrenders. It is this lawlessness which must at all costs be suppressed\r\nif we are to have a happy future. The Chinese people have so far\r\ncontented themselves by pacific retaliation and have not exploded into\r\nrage; but those who see in the gospel of boycott an ugly manifestation\r\nof what lies slumbering should give thanks nightly that they live in a\r\nland where reason is so supreme. Think of what might not happen in China\r\nif the people were not wholly reasonable! Throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of the land you have small communities of foreigners, mere drops\r\nin a mighty ocean of four hundred millions, living absolutely secure\r\nalthough absolutely at the mercy of their huge swarms of neighbours. All\r\nsuch foreigners--or nearly all--have come to China for purposes of\r\nprofit; they depend for their livelihood on co-operation with the\r\nChinese; and once that co-operation ceases they might as well be dead\r\nand buried for all the good residence will do them. In such\r\ncircumstances it would be reasonable to suppose that a certain decency\r\nwould inspire their attitude, and that a policy of give-and-take would\r\nalways be sedulously practised; and we are happy to say that there is\r\nmore of this than there used to be. It is only when incidents such as\r\nthe Chengchiatun and Laihsikai affairs occur that the placid population\r\nis stirred to action. Even then, instead of turning and rending the many\r\nlittle defenceless communities--as European mobs would certainly\r\ndo--they simply confine themselves to boycotting the offenders and\r\nhoping that this evidence of their displeasure will finally induce the\r\nworld to believe that they are determined to get reasonable treatment.\r\nThe Chinese as a people may be very irritating in the slowness with\r\nwhich they do certain things--though they are as quick in business as\r\nthe quickest Anglo-Saxon--but that is no excuse why men who call\r\nthemselves superior should treat them with contempt. The Chinese are the\r\nfirst to acknowledge that it will take them a generation at least to\r\nmodernize effectively their country and their government; but they\r\nbelieve that having erected a Republic and having declared themselves as\r\ndisciples of the West they are justified in expecting the same treatment\r\nand consideration which are to be given after the war even to the\r\nsmallest and weakest nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] Russian diplomats now deny that the Japanese proposals regarding\r\nthe cession of the railway south of the Sungari river have ever been\r\nformally agreed to.\r\n\r\n[24] A further illustration of the action of French diplomacy in China\r\nhas just been provided (April, 1917) in the protest lodged by France\r\nagainst the building of a railway in Kwangsi Province by American\r\nengineers with American capital--France claiming _exclusive rights_ in\r\nKwangsi by virtue of a letter sent by the Chinese Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs to the French Legation in 1914 as settlement for a frontier\r\ndispute in that year. The text of the letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The dispute that rose in consequence of the disturbance at the border\r\nof Annam and Kwangsi has been examined into by the Joint Committee\r\ndetailed by both parties concerned, and a conclusion has been reached to\r\nthe effect that all matters relating to the solution of the case would\r\nbe carried out in accordance with the request of Your Excellency.\r\n\r\n\"In order to demonstrate the especially good friendly relations existing\r\nbetween the two countries, the Republican Government assures Your\r\nExcellency that in case of a railway construction or a mining enterprise\r\nbeing undertaken in Kwangsi Province in the future, for which foreign\r\ncapital is required, France would first be consulted for a loan of the\r\nnecessary capital. On such an occasion, the Governor of Kwangsi will\r\ndirectly negotiate with a French syndicate and report to the\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nIt is high time that the United States raises the whole question of the\r\nopen door in China again, and refuses to tolerate any longer the old\r\ndisruptive and dog-in-the-manger policy of the Powers. America is now\r\nhappily in a position to inaugurate a new era in the Far East as in the\r\nFar West and to stop exploitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCHINA AND THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of Chinese sentiments on the subject of the war, as well as\r\nthe precise relations between the Chinese Government and the two groups\r\nof belligerents, are matters which have been totally misunderstood. To\r\nthose who have grasped the significance of the exhaustive preceding\r\naccount of the Republic in travail, this statement should not cause\r\nsurprise; for China has been in no condition to play anything but an\r\ninsignificant and unsatisfactory rôle in world-politics.\r\n\r\nWhen the world-war broke out China was still in the throes of her\r\ndomestic troubles and without any money at all in her Central Treasury;\r\nand although Yuan Shih-kai, on being suddenly confronted with an\r\nunparalleled international situation, did initiate certain negotiations\r\nwith the German Legation with a view to securing a cancellation of the\r\nKiaochow lease, the ultimatum which Japan dispatched to Germany on the\r\n15th August, 1914, completely nullified his tentative proposals. Yuan\r\nShih-kai had, indeed, not been in the slightest degree prepared for such\r\na sensational development as war between Japan and Germany over the\r\nquestion of a cruiser-base established on territory leased from China;\r\nand although he considered the possibility of sending a Chinese force to\r\nco-operate in the attack on the German stronghold, that project was\r\nnever matured, whilst his subsequent contrivances, notably the\r\nestablishment of a so-called war-zone in Shantung, were without\r\ninternational value, and attracted no attention save in Japan.\r\n\r\nChinese, however, did not remain blind to the trend of events. After the\r\nfall of Tsingtao and the subsequent complications with Japan, which so\r\ngreatly served to increase the complexities of a nebulous situation,\r\ncertain lines of thought insensibly developed. That the influential\r\nclasses in China should have desired that Germany should by some means\r\nrehabilitate herself in Europe and so be placed in a position to\r\nchastise a nation that for twenty years had brought nothing but sorrow\r\nto them was perhaps only natural; and it is primarily to this one cause\r\nthat so-called sympathy with Germany during the first part of the war\r\nhas been due. But it must also be noticed that the immense German\r\npropaganda in China during the first two years of the war, coupled with\r\nthe successes won in Russia and elsewhere, powerfully impressed the\r\npopulation--not so much because they were attracted by the feats of a\r\nPower that had enthroned militarism, but because they wrongly supposed\r\nthat sooner or later the effects of this military display would be not\r\nonly to secure the relaxation of the Japanese grip on the country but\r\nwould compel the Powers to re-cast their pre-war policies in China and\r\nabandon their attempts at placing the country under financial\r\nsupervision. Thus, by the irony of Fate, Germany in Eastern Asia for the\r\nbest part of 1914, 1915 and 1916, stood for the aspirations of the\r\noppressed--a moral which we may very reasonably hope will not escape the\r\nattention of the Foreign Offices of the world. Nor must it be forgotten\r\nthat the modern Chinese army, being like the Japanese, largely\r\nGermany-trained and Germany-armed, had a natural predilection for\r\nTeutonism; and since the army, as we have shown, plays a powerful rôle\r\nin the politics of the Republic, public opinion was greatly swayed by\r\nwhat it proclaimed through its accredited organs.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, it was humanly impossible for such a vast country\r\nwith such vast resources in men and raw materials to remain permanently\r\nquiescent during an universal conflagration when there was so much to be\r\nsalvaged. Slowly the idea became general in China that something had to\r\nbe done; that is that a state of technical neutrality would lead nowhere\r\nsave possibly to Avernus.\r\n\r\nAs early as November, 1915, Yuan Shih-kai and his immediate henchmen had\r\nindeed realized the internal advantages to be derived from a formal\r\nwar-partnership with the signatories of the Pact of London, the impulse\r\nto the movement being given by certain important shipments of arms and\r\nammunition from China which were then made. A half-surreptitious\r\nattempt to discuss terms in Peking caused no little excitement, the\r\nmatter being, however, only debated in very general terms. The principal\r\nitem proposed by the Peking government was characteristically the\r\nstipulation that an immediate loan of two million pounds should be made\r\nto China, in return for her technical belligerency. But when the\r\nproposal was taken to Tokio, Japan rightly saw that its main purpose was\r\nsimply to secure an indirect foreign endorsement of Yuan Shih-kai's\r\ncandidature as Emperor; and for that reason she threw cold-water on the\r\nwhole project. To subscribe to a formula, which besides enthroning Yuan\r\nShih-kai would have been a grievous blow to her Continental ambitions,\r\nwas an unthinkable thing; and therefore the manoeuvre was foredoomed to\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nThe death of Yuan Shih-kai in the summer of 1916 radically altered the\r\nsituation. Powerful influences were again set to work to stamp out the\r\nGerman cult and to incline the minority of educated men who control the\r\ndestinies of the country to see that their real interests could only lie\r\nwith the Allies, who were beginning to export Chinese man-power as an\r\nauxiliary war-aid and who were very anxious to place the whole matter on\r\na sounder footing. Little real progress was, however, made in the face\r\nof the renewed German efforts to swamp the country with their\r\npropaganda. By means of war-maps, printed in English and Chinese, and\r\nalso by means of an exhaustive daily telegraphic service which hammered\r\nhome every possible fact illustrative of German invincibility, the\r\nGerman position in China, so far from being weakened, was actually\r\nstrengthened during the period when Rumania was being overrun. By a\r\nsingular destiny, any one advocating an alliance with the Allies was\r\nbitterly attacked not only by the Germans but by the Japanese as\r\nwell--this somewhat naïve identification of Japan's political interest\r\nwith those of an enemy country being an unique feature of the situation\r\nworthy of permanent record.\r\n\r\nIt was not until President Wilson sent out his Peace offering of the\r\n19th December, 1916, that a distinct change came. On this document being\r\nformally communicated to the Chinese Government great interest was\r\naroused, and the old hopes were revived that it would be somehow\r\npossible for China to gain entry at the definitive Peace Congress which\r\nwould settle beyond repeal the question of the disposal of Kiaochow and\r\nthe whole of German interests in Shantung Province,--a subject of\r\nburning interest to the country not only because of the harsh treatment\r\nwhich had been experienced at the hands of Japan, but because the\r\nprecedent established in 1905 at the Portsmouth Treaty was one which it\r\nwas felt must be utterly shattered if China was not to abandon her claim\r\nof being considered a sovereign international State. On that occasion\r\nJapan had simply negotiated direct with Russia concerning all matters\r\naffecting Manchuria, dispatching a Plenipotentiary to Peking, after the\r\nTreaty of Peace had been signed, to secure China's adhesion to all\r\nclauses _en bloc_ without discussion. True enough, by filing the\r\nTwenty-one Demands on China in 1915--when the war was hardly half-a-year\r\nold--and by forcing China's assent to all Shantung questions under the\r\nthreat of an Ultimatum, Japan had reversed the Portsmouth Treaty\r\nprocedure and apparently settled the issues at stake for all time;\r\nnevertheless the Chinese hoped when the facts were properly known to the\r\nworld that this species of diplomacy would not be endorsed, and that\r\nindeed the Shantung question could be reopened.\r\n\r\nConsequently great pains were taken at the Chinese Foreign Office to\r\ndraft a reply to the Wilson Note which would tell its own story. The\r\nauthorized translation of the document handed to the American Legation\r\non the 8th January has therefore a peculiar political interest. It runs\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have examined with the care which the gravity of the question\r\n    demands the note concerning peace which President Wilson has\r\n    addressed to the Governments of the Allies and the Central Powers\r\n    now at war and the text of which Your Excellency has been good\r\n    enough to transmit to me under instructions of your Government.\r\n\r\n    \"China, a nation traditionally pacific, has recently again\r\n    manifested her sentiments in concluding treaties concerning the\r\n    pacific settlement of international disputes, responding thus to the\r\n    voeux of the Peace Conference held at the Hague.\r\n\r\n    \"On the other hand, the present war, by its prolongation, has\r\n    seriously affected the interests of China, more so perhaps than\r\n    those of other Powers which have remained neutral. She is at present\r\n    at a time of reorganization which demands economically and\r\n    industrially the co-operation of foreign countries, a co-operation\r\n    which a large number of them are unable to accord on account of the\r\n    war in which they are engaged.\r\n\r\n    \"In manifesting her sympathy for the spirit of the President's\r\n    Note, having in view the ending as soon as possible of the\r\n    hostilities, China is but acting in conformity not only with her\r\n    interests but also with her profound sentiments.\r\n\r\n    \"On account of the extent which modern wars are apt to assume and\r\n    the repercussions which they bring about, their effects are no\r\n    longer limited to belligerent States. All countries are interested\r\n    in seeing wars becoming as rare as possible. Consequently China\r\n    cannot but show satisfaction with the views of the Government and\r\n    people of the United States of America who declare themselves ready,\r\n    and even eager, to co-operate when the war is over, by all proper\r\n    means to assure the respect of the principle of the equality of\r\n    nations, whatever their power may be, and to relieve them of the\r\n    peril of wrong and violence. China is ready to join her efforts with\r\n    theirs for the attainment of such results which can only be obtained\r\n    through the help of all.\"\r\n\r\nAlready, then, before there had been any question of Germany's ruthless\r\nsubmarine war necessitating a decisive move, China had commenced to show\r\nthat she could not remain passive during a world-conflict which was\r\nindirectly endangering her interests. America, by placing herself in\r\ndirect communication with the Peking Government on the subject of a\r\npossible peace, had given a direct hint that she was solicitous of\r\nChina's future and determined to help her as far as possible. All this\r\nwas in strict accordance with the traditional policy of the United\r\nStates in China, a policy which although too idealistic to have had much\r\npractical value--being too little supported by battleships and bayonets\r\nto be respected--has nevertheless for sixty years tempered the wind to\r\nthe shorn lamb. The ground had consequently been well prepared for the\r\nremarkable dénouement which came on the 9th February, 1917, and which\r\nsurprised all the world.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of that month the United States formally communicated with\r\nChina on the subject of the threatened German submarine war against\r\nneutral shipping and invited her to associate herself with America in\r\nbreaking-off diplomatic relations with Germany. China had meanwhile\r\nreceived a telegraphic communication from the Chinese Minister in Berlin\r\ntransmitting a Note from the German Government making known the measures\r\nendangering all merchant vessels navigating the prescribed zones. The\r\neffect of these two communications on the mind of the Chinese Government\r\nwas at first admittedly stunning and very varied expressions of opinion\r\nwere heard in Peking. For the first time in the history of the country\r\nthe government had been invited to take a step which meant the\r\ninauguration of a definite Foreign policy from which there could be no\r\nretreat. For four days a discussion raged which created the greatest\r\nuneasiness; but by the 8th February, President Li Yuan-hung had made up\r\nhis mind--the final problem being simply the \"conversion\" of the\r\nMilitary Party to the idea that a decisive step, which would for ever\r\nseparate them from Germany, must at last be taken. It is known that the\r\nbrilliant Scholar Liang Ch'i-chao, who was hastily summoned to Peking,\r\nproved a decisive influence and performed the seemingly impossible in a\r\nfew hours' discussion. Realizing at once the advantages which would\r\naccrue from a single masculine decision he advised instant action in\r\nsuch a convincing way that the military leaders surrendered. Accordingly\r\non the 9th February the presence of the German Minister was requested at\r\nthe Chinese Foreign Office when the following Note was read to him and\r\nsubsequently transmitted telegraphically to Berlin.\r\n\r\n    Your Excellency:\r\n\r\n    A telegraphic communication has been received from the Chinese\r\n    Minister at Berlin transmitting a note from the German Government\r\n    dated February 1st, 1917, which makes known that the measures of\r\n    blockade newly adopted by the Government of Germany will, from that\r\n    day, endanger neutral merchant vessels navigating in certain\r\n    prescribed zones.\r\n\r\n    The new measures of submarine warfare, inaugurated by Germany,\r\n    imperilling the lives and property of Chinese citizens to even a\r\n    greater extent than the measures previously taken which have already\r\n    cost so many human lives to China, constitute a violation of the\r\n    principles of public international law at present in force; the\r\n    tolerance of their application would have as a result the\r\n    introduction into international law of arbitrary principles\r\n    incompatible with even legitimate commercial intercourse between\r\n    neutral states and between neutral states and belligerent powers.\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government, therefore, protests energetically to the\r\n    Imperial German Government against the measures proclaimed on\r\n    February 1st, and sincerely hopes that with a view to respecting the\r\n    rights of neutral states and to maintaining the friendly relations\r\n    between these two countries, the said measures will not be carried\r\n    out.\r\n\r\n    In case, contrary to its expectations, its protest be ineffectual\r\n    the Government of the Chinese Republic will be constrained, to its\r\n    profound regret, to sever the diplomatic relations at present\r\n    existing between the two countries. It is unnecessary to add that\r\n    the attitude of the Chinese Government has been dictated purely by\r\n    the desire to further the cause of the world's peace and by the\r\n    maintenance of the sanctity of international law.\r\n\r\n    I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the\r\n    assurance of my highest consideration.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the following reply was handed to the American Minister\r\nin Peking thus definitely clinching the matter:\r\n\r\n    Your Excellency:\r\n\r\n    I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's\r\n    Note of the 4th February, 1917, informing me that the Government of\r\n    the United States of America, in view of the adoption by the German\r\n    Government of its new policy of submarine warfare on the 1st of\r\n    February, has decided to take certain action which it judges\r\n    necessary as regards Germany.\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government, like the President of the United States of\r\n    America, is reluctant to believe that the German Government will\r\n    actually carry into execution those measures which imperil the lives\r\n    and property of citizens of neutral states and jeopardize the\r\n    commerce, even legitimate, between neutrals as well as between\r\n    neutrals and belligerents and which tend, if allowed to be enforced\r\n    without opposition, to introduce a new principle into public\r\n    international law.\r\n\r\n    The Chinese Government being in accord with the principles set forth\r\n    in Your Excellency's note and firmly associating itself with the\r\n    Government of the United States, has taken similar action by\r\n    protesting energetically to the German Government against the new\r\n    measures of blockade. The Chinese Government also proposes to take\r\n    such action in the future as will be deemed necessary for the\r\n    maintenance of the principles of international law.\r\n\r\n    I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the\r\n    assurance of my highest consideration.\r\n\r\n    His Excellency Paul S. Reinsch,\r\n    Envoy Extraordinary & Minister Plenipotentiary of\r\n    The United States of America.\r\n\r\nWhen these facts became generally known an extraordinary ferment was\r\nnoticeable. What efforts had to be made to overcome the not\r\ninconsiderable opposition of the Military Party who were opposed to any\r\ndeparture from a policy of passive neutrality need not now be set down;\r\nbut it is sufficient to state that the decision arrived at was in every\r\nsense a victory of the younger intellectual forces over the older\r\nmandarinate, whose traditions of _laissez faire_ and spineless diplomacy\r\nhad hitherto cost the country so dear. A definite and far-reaching\r\nForeign Policy had at last been inaugurated. By responding rapidly and\r\nfirmly to the invitation of the United States to associate herself with\r\nthe stand taken against Germany's piratical submarine warfare, China has\r\nundoubtedly won for herself a new place in the world's esteem. Both in\r\nEurope and America the news of this development awakened\r\nwell-understandable enthusiasm, and convinced men that the Republic at\r\nlast stood for something vital and real. Until the 9th February, 1917,\r\nwhat China had been doing was not really to maintain her neutrality,\r\nsince she had been unable to defend her territory from being made a\r\ncommon battleground in 1914: she had been engaged in guarding and\r\nperpetuating her traditional impotency. For whilst it may be accurate to\r\ndeclare--a fact which few Westerners have realized--that to the mass of\r\nthe Chinese nation the various members of the European Family are\r\nundistinguishable from one another, there being little to choose in\r\nChina between a Russian or a German, an Englishman or an Austrian, a\r\nFrenchman or a Greek, the trade-contact of a century had certainly\r\ntaught to a great many that there was profit in certain directions and\r\nnone in certain others. It was perfectly well-known, for instance, that\r\nEngland stood for a sea-empire; that the sea was an universal road; that\r\nBritish ships, both mercantile and military, were the most numerous; and\r\nthat other things being equal it must primarily be Britain more than any\r\nother European country which would influence Chinese destinies. But the\r\nBritish Alliance with Japan had greatly weakened the trust which\r\noriginally existed; and this added to the fact that Germany, although\r\ncompletely isolated and imprisoned by the sea, still maintained herself\r\nintact by reason of her marvellous war-machine, which had ploughed\r\nforward with such horrible results in a number of directions, had made\r\ninaction seem the best policy. And yet, although the Chinese may be\r\npardoned for not forming clear concepts regarding the rights and wrongs\r\nof the present conflict, they had undoubtedly realized that it was\r\nabsolutely essential for them not to remain outside the circle of\r\ninternational friendships when a direct opportunity was offered them to\r\nstep within.\r\n\r\nIt was a sudden inkling of these things which now dawned on the public\r\nmind and slowly awakened enthusiasm. For the first time since Treaty\r\nrelations with the Powers had been established Chinese diplomatic action\r\nhad swept beyond the walls of Peking and embraced world-politics within\r\nits scope. The Confucianist conception of the State, as being simply a\r\nregional creation, a thing complete in itself and all sufficient because\r\nit was locked to the past and indifferent to the future, had hitherto\r\nbeen supreme, foreign affairs being the result of unwilling contact at\r\nsea-ports or in the wastes of High Asia where rival empires meet. To\r\nfind Chinese--five years after the inauguration of their Republic--ready\r\nto accept literally and loyally in the western way all the duties and\r\nobligations which their rights of eminent domain confer was a great and\r\nfine discovery. It has been supposed by some that a powerful rôle was\r\nplayed in this business by the temptation to benefit materially by an\r\nastute move: that is that China was greatly influenced in her decision\r\nby the knowledge that the denouncing of the German treaties would\r\ninstantly suspend the German Boxer indemnity and pour into the depleted\r\nCentral Treasury a monthly surplus of nearly two million Mexican\r\ndollars. Paradoxical as it may sound in a country notoriously\r\nhard-pressed for cash, monetary considerations played no part whatever\r\nin convincing the Peking Government that the hour for action had\r\narrived; nor again was there any question of real hostility to a nation\r\nwhich is so far removed from the East as to be meaningless to the\r\nmasses. The deep, underlying, decisive influence was simply\r\nexpediency--the most subtle of all political reasons and the hardest to\r\ndefine. But just as Britain declared war because the invasion of Belgium\r\nbrought to a head all the vague grounds for opposition to German policy;\r\nand just as America broke off relations because the scrapping of\r\nundertaking after undertaking regarding the sea-war made it imperative\r\nfor her to act, so did China choose the right moment to enunciate the\r\ndoctrine of her independence by voicing her determination to hold to the\r\nwhole corpus of international sanctions on which her independence\r\nfinally rests. In the last analysis, then, the Chinese note of the 9th\r\nFebruary to the German Government was a categorical and unmistakable\r\nreply to all the insidious attempts which had been made since the\r\nbeginning of the war to place her outside and beyond the operation of\r\nthe Public Law of Europe; and it is solely and entirely in that light\r\nthat her future actions must be judged. The leaders who direct the\r\ndestinies of China became fully prepared for a state of belligerency\r\nfrom the moment they decided to speak; but they could not but be\r\nsupremely anxious concerning the expression of that belligerency, since\r\ntheir international position had for years been such that a single false\r\nmove might cripple them.\r\n\r\nLet us make this clear. Whilst China has been from the first fully\r\nprepared to co-operate with friendly Powers in the taking of\r\nwar-measures which would ultimately improve her world-position, she has\r\nnot been prepared to surrender the initiative in these matters into\r\nforeign hands. The argument that the mobilization of her resources could\r\nonly be effectively dealt with by specially designated foreigners, for\r\ninstance, has always been repellent to her because she knows from bitter\r\nexperience that although Japan has played little or no part in the war,\r\nand indeed classifies herself as a semi-belligerent, the Tokio\r\nGovernment would not hesitate to use any opportunity which presented\r\nitself in China for selfish ends; and by insisting that as she is on the\r\nspot she is the most competent to insure the effectiveness of Chinese\r\nco-operation, attempt to tighten her hold on the country. It is a fact\r\nwhich is self-evident to observers on the spot that ever since the coup\r\nof the Twenty-one Demands, many Japanese believe that their country has\r\nsucceeded in almost completely infeodating China and has become the\r\nsovereign arbitrator of all quarrels, as well as the pacificator of the\r\nEastern World. Statements which were incautiously allowed to appear in\r\nthe Japanese Press a few days prior to the Chinese Note of the 9th\r\nFebruary disclose what Japan really thought on the subject of China\r\nidentifying herself with the Allies. For instance, the following, which\r\nbears the hall-mark of official inspiration, reads very curiously in the\r\nlight of after-events:\r\n\r\n    ... \"Dispatches from Peking say that England and France have already\r\n    started a flanking movement to induce China to join the anti-German\r\n    coalition. The intention of the Chinese Government has not yet been\r\n    learned. But it is possible that China will agree, if conditions are\r\n    favourable, thus gaining the right to voice her views at the coming\r\n    peace conference. Should the Entente Powers give China a firm\r\n    guarantee, it is feared here that China would not hesitate to act.\r\n\r\n    \"The policy of the Japanese Government toward this question cannot\r\n    yet be learned. It appears, however, that the Japanese Government is\r\n    not opposed to applying the resolutions of the Paris Economic\r\n    Conference, in so far as they concern purely economic questions,\r\n    since Japan desires that German influence in the commerce and\r\n    finance of the Orient should be altogether uprooted. But should the\r\n    Entente Powers of Europe try to induce China to join them, Japan may\r\n    object on the ground that it will create more disturbances in China\r\n    and lead to a general disturbance of peace in the Orient.\"\r\n\r\nNow there is not the slightest doubt in the writer's mind--and he can\r\nclaim to speak as a student of twenty years' standing--that this\r\ndefinition of Japanese aims and objects is a very true one; and that the\r\nsubsequent invitation to China to join the Allies which came from Tokio\r\nafter a meeting between the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs and the\r\nAllied Ambassadors was simply made when a new orientation of policy had\r\nbeen forced by stress of circumstances. Japan has certainly always\r\nwished German influence in the Far East to be uprooted if she can take\r\nthe place of Germany; but if she cannot take that place absolutely and\r\nentirely she would vastly prefer the influence to remain, since it is in\r\nthe nature of counterweight to that of other European Powers and of\r\nAmerica--foreign influence in China, as Mr. Hioki blandly told the late\r\nPresident Yuan Shih-kai in his famous interview of the 18th January,\r\n1915, being a source of constant irritation to the Japanese people, and\r\nthe greatest stumbling-block to a permanent understanding in the Far\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nChinese suspicion of any invitation coming by way of Tokio has been,\r\ntherefore, in every way justified, if it is a reasonable and legitimate\r\nthing for a nation of four hundred millions of people to be acutely\r\nconcerned about their independence; for events have already proved up to\r\nthe hilt that so far from the expulsion of Germany from Shantung having\r\nresulted in the handing-back of interests which were forcibly acquired\r\nfrom China in 1898, that expulsion has merely resulted in Japan\r\nsucceeding to such interests and thereby obliterating all trace of her\r\noriginal promise to the world in 1914 that she would restore to China\r\nwhat was originally taken from her. Here it is necessary to remark that\r\nnot only did Japan in her negotiations over the Twenty-one Demands force\r\nChina to hand over the twelve million pounds of German improvements in\r\nShantung province, but that Baron Hayashi, the present Japanese Minister\r\nto China, has recently declared that Japan would demand from China a\r\nvast settlement or concession at Tsingtao, thus making even the alleged\r\nhanding-back of the leased territory--which Japan is pledged to force\r\nfrom Germany at the Peace Conference--wholly illusory, the formula of a\r\nSettlement being adopted because twelve years' experience of Port Arthur\r\nhas shown that territorial \"leases,\" with their military garrisons and\r\nadministrative offices, are expensive and antiquated things, and that it\r\nis easier to push infiltration by means of a multitude of Settlements in\r\nwhich police-boxes and policemen form an important element, than to cut\r\noff slices of territory under a nomenclature which is a clamant\r\nadvertisement of disruptive aims.\r\n\r\nNow although these matters appear to be taking us far from the\r\nparticular theme we are discussing, it is not really so. Like a dark\r\nthunder-cloud on the horizon the menace of Japanese action has rendered\r\nfrank Chinese co-operation, even in such a simple matter as war-measures\r\nagainst Germany, a thing of supreme difficulty. The mere rumour that\r\nChina might dispatch an Expeditionary Force to Mesopotamia was\r\nsufficient to send the host of unofficial Japanese agents in Peking\r\nscurrying in every direction and insisting that if the Chinese did\r\nanything at all they should limit themselves to sending troops to\r\nRussia, where they would be \"lost\"--a suggestion made because that was\r\nwhat Japan herself offered to do when she declined in 1915 the Allies'\r\nproposal to dispatch troops to Europe. Nor must the fact be lost sight\r\nof that as in other countries so in China, foreign affairs provide an\r\nexcellent opportunity for influencing the march of internal events.\r\nThus, as we have clearly shown, the Military Party, although originally\r\naverse to any action at all, saw that a strong foreign policy would\r\ngreatly enhance its reputation and allow it to influence the important\r\nelections for the Parliament of 1918 which, sitting as a National\r\nConvention, will elect the next President. Thus, in the extraordinary\r\nway which happens throughout the world, the whole of February was\r\nconsumed in the rival political parties manoeuvring for position, the\r\nVice-President, General Feng Kuo-chang, himself coming hastily to Peking\r\nfrom Nanking to take part in this elaborate game in which many were now\r\nparticipating merely for what they could get out of it.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th March matters were brought to a climax by an open breach\r\nbetween President Li Yuan-hung and the Premier, General Tuan Chi-jui, at\r\na Cabinet meeting regarding the procedure to be observed in breaking off\r\ndiplomatic relations with Germany. Although nearly a month had elapsed,\r\nno reply had been received from Berlin; and of the many plans of action\r\nproposed nothing had been formally decided. Owing to the pressure Japan\r\nwas exerting from Tokio to get China to come to a definite arrangement,\r\npopular anxiety was growing. Over the question of certain telegrams to\r\nbe communicated to the Japanese Government, of which he had been kept in\r\nignorance, President Li Yuan-hung took a firm stand; with the result\r\nthat the Premier, deeply offended, abruptly left the Council Chamber,\r\nhanded in his resignation and left the capital--a course of action which\r\nthreatened to provoke a national crisis.\r\n\r\nFortunately in President Li Yuan-hung China had a cool and dispassionate\r\nstatesman. At the first grave crisis in his administration he wished at\r\nall costs to secure that the assent of Parliament should be given to all\r\nsteps taken, and that nothing so speculative as a policy which had not\r\nbeen publicly debated should be put into force. He held to this point\r\ndoggedly; and after some negotiations, the Premier was induced to return\r\nto the capital and resume office, on the understanding that nothing\r\nfinal was to be done until a popular endorsement had been secured.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th March the question was sent to Parliament for decision.\r\nAfter a stormy debate of several hours in the Lower House the policy of\r\nthe Government was upheld by 330 votes to 87: on the following day the\r\nSenate endorsed this decision by 158 votes to 37. By a coincidence which\r\nwas too extraordinary not to have been artificially contrived, the\r\nlong-awaited German reply arrived on the morning of this 10th March,\r\ncopies of the document being circulated wholesale by German agents among\r\nthe Members of Parliament in a last effort to influence their decision.\r\nThe actual text of the German reply was as follows, and it will be seen\r\nhow transparently worded it is:\r\n\r\n    _To the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China_:\r\n\r\n    YOUR EXCELLENCY: By the instructions of my home Government--which\r\n    reached me on the 10th inst.--I beg to forward you the following\r\n    reply to China's protest to the latest blockade policy of Germany:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Imperial German Government expresses its great surprise at the\r\n    action threatened by the Government of the Republic of China in its\r\n    Note of protest. Many other countries have also protested, but\r\n    China, which has been in friendly relations with Germany, is the\r\n    only State which has added a threat to its protest. The surprise is\r\n    doubly great, because of the fact that, as China has no shipping\r\n    interests in the seas of the barred zones, she will not suffer\r\n    thereby.\r\n\r\n    \"The Government of the Republic of China mentions that loss of life\r\n    of Chinese citizens has occurred as the results of the present\r\n    method of war. The Imperial German Government wishes to point out\r\n    that the Government of the Republic of China has never communicated\r\n    with the Imperial Government regarding a single case of this kind\r\n    nor has it protested in this connexion before. According to reports\r\n    received by the Imperial Government, such losses as have been\r\n    actually sustained by Chinese subjects have occurred in the firing\r\n    line while they were engaged in digging trenches and in other war\r\n    services. While thus engaged, they were exposed to the dangers\r\n    inevitable to all forces engaged in war. The fact that Germany has\r\n    on several occasions protested against the employment of Chinese\r\n    citizens for warlike purpose is evidence that the Imperial\r\n    Government has given excellent proof of its friendly feelings toward\r\n    China. In consideration of these friendly relations the Imperial\r\n    Government is willing to treat the matter as if the threat had never\r\n    been uttered. It is reasonable for the Imperial Government to expect\r\n    that the Government of the Republic of China will revise its views\r\n    respecting the question.\r\n\r\n    \"Germany's enemies were the first to declare a blockade on Germany\r\n    and the same is being persistently carried out. It is therefore\r\n    difficult for Germany to cancel her blockade policy. The Imperial\r\n    Government is nevertheless willing to comply with the wishes of the\r\n    Government of the Republic of China by opening negotiations to\r\n    arrive at a plan for the protection of Chinese life and property,\r\n    with the view that the end may be achieved and thereby the utmost\r\n    regard be given to the shipping rights of China. The reason which\r\n    has prompted the Imperial Government to adopt this conciliatory\r\n    policy is the knowledge that, once diplomatic relations are severed\r\n    with Germany, China will not only lose a truly good friend but will\r\n    also be entangled in unthinkable difficulties.\"\r\n\r\n    In forwarding to Your Excellency the above instructions from my home\r\n    Government, I beg also to state that--if the Government of China be\r\n    willing--I am empowered to open negotiations for the protection of\r\n    the shipping rights of China.\r\n\r\n    I have the honour to be....\r\n\r\n    (Signed by the German Minister.)\r\n\r\n    March 10, 1917.\r\n\r\nWith a Parliamentary endorsement behind them there remained nothing for\r\nthe Peking Government but to take the vital step of severing diplomatic\r\nrelations. Certain details remained to be settled but these were\r\nexpeditiously handled. Consequently, without any further discussion, at\r\nnoon on the 14th March the German Minister was handed his passports,\r\nwith the following covering dispatch from the Chinese Foreign Office. It\r\nis worthy of record that in the interval between the Chinese Note of the\r\n9th February and the German reply of the 10th March the French\r\nmail-steamer _Athos_ had been torpedoed in the Mediterranean and five\r\nhundred Chinese labourers proceeding to France on board her drowned.\r\n\r\n    _Your Excellency_:--\r\n\r\n    With reference to the new submarine policy of Germany, the\r\n    Government of the Republic of China, dictated by the desire to\r\n    further the cause of world's peace and to maintain the sanctity of\r\n    International Law, addressed a protest to Your Excellency on\r\n    February 9th and declared that in case, contrary to its\r\n    expectations, its protest be ineffectual, it would be constrained to\r\n    sever the diplomatic relations at present existing between the two\r\n    countries.\r\n\r\n    During the lapse of a month no heed has been paid to the protest of\r\n    the Government of the Republic in the activities of the German\r\n    Submarines, activities which have caused the loss of many Chinese\r\n    lives. On March 10, a reply was received from Your Excellency.\r\n    Although it states that the Imperial German Government is willing to\r\n    open negotiations to arrive at a plan for the protection of Chinese\r\n    life and property, yet it declares that it is difficult for Germany\r\n    to cancel her blockade policy. It is therefore not in accord with\r\n    the object of the protest and the Government of the Chinese\r\n    Republic, to its deep regret, considers its protest to be\r\n    ineffectual. The Government of the Republic is constrained to sever\r\n    the diplomatic relations at present existing with the Imperial\r\n    German Government. I have the honour to send herewith to Your\r\n    Excellency, the passport for Your Excellency, the members of the\r\n    German Legation and their families and retinue for protection while\r\n    leaving Chinese territory. With regard to the Consular Officers of\r\n    Germany in China, this Ministry has instructed the different\r\n    Commissioners of Foreign Affairs to issue to them similarly\r\n    passports for leaving the country.\r\n\r\n    I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the\r\n    assurance of my highest consideration.\r\n\r\n    March 14th, 1917.\r\n\r\nIt was not until eleven days later--on the 25th March--that the German\r\nMinister and his suite reluctantly left Peking for Germany via America.\r\nMeanwhile the Chinese Government remained undecided regarding the taking\r\nof the final step as a number of important matters had still to be\r\nsettled. Not only had arrangements to be made with the Allies but there\r\nwas the question of adjusting Chinese policy with American action. A\r\nspecial commission on Diplomatic affairs daily debated the procedure to\r\nbe observed, but owing to the conflict of opinion in the provinces\r\nfurther action was greatly delayed. As it is necessary to show the\r\nnature of this conflict we give two typical opinions submitted to the\r\nGovernment on the question of a formal declaration of war against\r\nGermany (and Austria). The first Memorandum was written for the\r\nDiplomatic Commission by the scholar Liang Ch'i-chao and is singularly\r\nlucid:--\r\n\r\n    THE NECESSITY FOR WAR\r\n\r\n    \"Those who question the necessity for war can only quote the\r\n    attitude of America as example. The position of China is, however,\r\n    different from that of America in two points. First, actual warfare\r\n    will follow immediately after America's declaration of war, so it is\r\n    necessary for her to make the necessary preparations before taking\r\n    the step. For this purpose, America has voted several hundred\r\n    million dollars for an increase of her naval appropriations. America\r\n    therefore cannot declare war until she has completed every\r\n    preparation. With China it is different. Even after the declaration\r\n    of war, there will be no actual warfare. It is therefore unnecessary\r\n    for us to wait.\r\n\r\n    \"Secondly, America has no such things as foreign settlements,\r\n    consular jurisdiction or other unequal treaties with Germany. Under\r\n    the existing conditions America has no difficulties in safeguarding\r\n    herself against the Germans residing in America after the severance\r\n    of diplomatic relations even though war has not yet been actually\r\n    declared, and as to future welfare, America will have nothing to\r\n    suffer even though her old treaties with Germany should continue to\r\n    be operative. It is impossible for China to take the necessary steps\r\n    to safeguard the country against the Germans residing in China\r\n    unless the old treaties be cancelled. For unless war is declared it\r\n    is impossible to cancel the consular jurisdiction of the Germans,\r\n    and so long as German consular jurisdiction remains in China we will\r\n    meet with difficulties everywhere whenever we wish to deal with the\r\n    Germans. If our future is to be considered, unless war is declared,\r\n    the old treaties will again come into force upon the resumption of\r\n    diplomatic relations, in which case we shall be held responsible for\r\n    all the steps which we have taken in contravention of treaties\r\n    during the rupture. It will be advantageous to China if the old\r\n    treaties be cancelled by a declaration of war and new treaties be\r\n    negotiated after the conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\n    \"In short by severing diplomatic relations with Germany China has\r\n    already incurred the ill-feelings of that country. We shall not be\r\n    able to lessen the hostile feelings of the Germans even if we\r\n    refrain from declaring war on them. It is therefore our obligation\r\n    to choose the course that will be advantageous to us. This is not\r\n    reluctantly yielding to the request of the Entente Allies. It is the\r\n    course we must take in our present situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE REASON FOR DECLARING WAR\r\n\r\n    \"The presumptuous manner in which Germany has replied to our demand\r\n    is an open affront to our national integrity. Recently Germany has\r\n    deliberately shown hostility to our advice by reiterating her\r\n    determination to carry out the ruthless submarine policy with\r\n    increased vigour. All these are reasons for diplomatic rupture as\r\n    well as for declaration of war. Furthermore, the peace of the Far\r\n    East was broken by the occupation of Kiachow by Germany. This event\r\n    marked the first step of the German disregard for international law.\r\n    In the interests of humanity and for the sake of what China has\r\n    passed through, she should rise and punish such a country, that\r\n    dared to disregard international law. Such a reason for war is\r\n    certainly beyond criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE TIME TO DECLARE WAR\r\n\r\n    \"War should be declared as soon as possible. The reason for the\r\n    diplomatic rupture is sufficient reason for declaring war. This has\r\n    already been explained. It would be impossible for us to find an\r\n    excuse for declaring war if war be not declared now. According to\r\n    usual procedure war is declared when the forces of the two countries\r\n    come into actual conflict. Now such a possibility does not exist\r\n    between China and Germany. Since it is futile to expect Germany to\r\n    declare war on us first, we should ask ourselves if war is\r\n    necessary. If not, then let us go on as we are, otherwise we must\r\n    not hesitate any more.\r\n\r\n    \"Some say that China should not declare war on Germany until we have\r\n    come to a definite understanding with the Entente Allies respecting\r\n    certain terms. This is indeed a wrong conception of things. We\r\n    declare war because we want to fight for humanity, international law\r\n    and against a national enemy. It is not because we are partial\r\n    towards the Entente or against Germany or Austria. International\r\n    relations are not commercial connexions. Why then should we talk\r\n    about exchange of privileges and rights? As to the revision of\r\n    Customs tariff, it has been our aspiration for more than ten years\r\n    and a foremost diplomatic question, for which we have been looking\r\n    for a suitable opportunity to negotiate with the foreign Powers. It\r\n    is our view that the opportunity has come because foreign Powers are\r\n    now on very friendly terms with China. It is distinctly a separate\r\n    thing from the declaration of war. Let no one try to confuse the\r\n    two.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE QUESTION OF AUSTRIA\r\n\r\n    \"If China decides to declare war on Germany the same attitude should\r\n    be taken towards Austria. We have severed diplomatic relations with\r\n    Germany but retain the _status quo_ with Austria. This is fraught\r\n    with danger. German intrigue is to be dreaded. What they have done\r\n    in America and Mexico is enough to shock us. The danger can easily\r\n    be imagined when we remember that they have in China the Austrian\r\n    Legation, Austrian Consulates and Austrian concessions as their\r\n    bases of operation for intrigue and plotting. Some say we should\r\n    follow America, which has not yet severed diplomatic relations with\r\n    Austria. This is a great mistake. America can afford to ignore\r\n    Austria because there are no Austrian concessions and Austrian\r\n    consular jurisdiction in America.\r\n\r\n    \"The question is then what steps should be taken to sever diplomatic\r\n    relations with and declare war on Austria. The solution is that\r\n    since Austria has also communicated to our Minister regarding her\r\n    submarine policy we can serve her with an ultimatum demanding that\r\n    the submarine policy be cancelled within twenty-four hours. If\r\n    Austria refuses, China may sever diplomatic relations and declare\r\n    war at the same time immediately upon the expiry of the twenty-four\r\n    hour limit.\r\n\r\n    \"In conclusion I wish to say that whenever a policy is adopted we\r\n    should carry out the complete scheme. If we should hesitate in the\r\n    middle and become afraid to go ahead we will soon find ourselves in\r\n    an embarrassing position. The Government and Parliament should\r\n    therefore stir up courage and boldly make the decision and take the\r\n    step.\"\r\n\r\nUnanswerable as seem these arguments to the Western mind, they were by\r\nno means so to the mass of Chinese who are always fearful lest some\r\nsudden reshuffling in the relationships existing between foreign Powers\r\nexposes them to new and greater calamities. This Chinese viewpoint, with\r\nits ignorance of basic considerations, is well-illustrated by the Second\r\nMemorandum, which follows. Written by the famous reformer of 1898 Kang\r\nYu-wei, it demonstrates how greatly the revolutionists of 1911 are in\r\nadvance of a school which was the vogue less than twenty years ago and\r\nwhich is completely out of touch with the thought which the war has made\r\nworld-wide. Nevertheless the line of argument which characterizes this\r\nutterance is still a political factor in China and must be understood.\r\n\r\n    MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n    ... \"The breach between the United States and Germany is no concern\r\n    of ours. But the Government suddenly severed diplomatic relations\r\n    with Germany and is now contemplating entry into the war. This is to\r\n    advance beyond the action of the United States which continues to\r\n    observe neutrality. And if we analyse the public opinion of the\r\n    country, we find that all peoples--high and low, well-informed and\r\n    ignorant--betray great alarm when informed of the rupture and the\r\n    proposal to declare war on Germany, fearing that such a development\r\n    may cause grave peril to the country. This war-policy is being urged\r\n    by a handful of politicians, including a few members of Parliament\r\n    and several party men with the view of creating a diplomatic\r\n    situation to serve their political ends and to reap great profits.\r\n\r\n    \"Their arguments are that China--by siding with the Entente--may\r\n    obtain large loans, the revision of the Customs Tariff and the\r\n    suspension of the Boxer indemnity to Germany, as well as the\r\n    recovery of the German concessions, mining and railroad rights and\r\n    the seizure of German commerce. Pray, how large is Germany's share\r\n    of the Boxer indemnity? Seeing that German commerce is protected by\r\n    international law, will China be able to seize it; and does she not\r\n    know that the Kaiser may in the future exact restitution?\r\n\r\n\r\n    PERILS OF WAR\r\n\r\n    \"News from Holland tells of a rumoured secret understanding between\r\n    Germany, Japan and Russia. The Japanese Government is pursuing a\r\n    policy of friendship toward Germany. This is very disquieting news\r\n    to us. As to foreign loans and the revision of the Customs Tariff,\r\n    we can raise these matters at any time. Why then should we traffic\r\n    for these things at the risk of grave dangers to the nation? My view\r\n    is that what we are to obtain from the transaction is far less than\r\n    what we are to give. If it be argued that the policy aims at\r\n    securing for China her right to live as an unfettered nation, then\r\n    we ought to ask for the cancellation of the entire Boxer\r\n    Indemnities, the abolition of exterritoriality, the retrocession of\r\n    the foreign concessions and the repeal or amendment of all unjust\r\n    treaties after the war. But none of these have we demanded. If we\r\n    ourselves cannot improve our internal administration in order to\r\n    become a strong country, it is absurd to expect our admission to the\r\n    ranks of the first-class Powers simply by being allowed a seat at\r\n    the Peace Conference and by taking a side with the Entente!\r\n\r\n    \"Which side will win the war? I shall not attempt to predict here.\r\n    But it is undoubted that all the arms of Europe--and the industrial\r\n    and financial strength of the United States and Japan--have proved\r\n    unavailing against Germany. On the other hand France has lost her\r\n    Northern provinces and Belgium, Serbia and Rumania are blotted off\r\n    the map. Should Germany be victorious, the whole of Europe--not to\r\n    speak of a weak country like China--would be in great peril of\r\n    extinction. Should she be defeated, Germany still can--after the\r\n    conclusion of peace--send a fleet to war against us. And as the\r\n    Powers will be afraid of a second world-war, who will come to our\r\n    aid? Have we not seen the example of Korea? There is no such thing\r\n    as an army of righteousness which will come to the assistance of\r\n    weak nations. I cannot bear to think of hearing the angry voice of\r\n    German guns along our coasts!\r\n\r\n    \"If we allow the Entente to recruit labour in our country without\r\n    restriction, thousands upon thousands of our fellow countrymen will\r\n    die for no worthy cause; and if we allow free exportation of\r\n    foodstuff, in a short time the price of daily necessaries will mount\r\n    ten to a hundredfold. This is calculated to cause internal troubles.\r\n    Yea, all gains from this policy will go to the politicians but the\r\n    people will suffer the evil consequences through no fault of theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DIPLOMACY OF CONFUCIUS\r\n\r\n    \"In the matter of diplomacy, we do not need to go to the West for\r\n    the apt learning on the point at issue. Confucius has said: 'Be\r\n    truthful and cultivate friendship--this is the foundation of human\r\n    happiness.' Our country being weak and undeveloped, if we strive to\r\n    be truthful and cultivate friendship, we can still be a civilized\r\n    nation, albeit hoary with age. But we are now advised to take\r\n    advantage of the difficulties of Germany and abandon honesty in\r\n    order that we may profit thereby. Discarding treaties is to be\r\n    unfaithful, grasping for gains is not the way of a gentleman, taking\r\n    advantage of another's difficulties is to be mean and joining the\r\n    larger in numbers is cowardice. How can we be a nation, if we throw\r\n    away all these fundamental qualities.\r\n\r\n    \"Even in the press of England and the United States, there is\r\n    opposition to America entering the war. If we observe neutrality, we\r\n    are not bound to any side; and when the time comes for peace--as a\r\n    friend to both sides--we may be able to bring about the ends of the\r\n    war. Is this not a service to humanity and the true spirit of\r\n    civilization?\r\n\r\n    \"Now it is proposed to take the existence of this great nation of\r\n    five thousand years and four hundred million people in order to\r\n    serve the interests of politicians in their party struggles. We are\r\n    now to be bound to foreign nations, without freedom to act for\r\n    ourselves and running great risks of national destruction. Can you\r\n    gentlemen bear to see this come to pass? China has severed relations\r\n    with Germany but the decision for war has not yet been reached. The\r\n    whole country is telegraphing opposition to the Government's policy\r\n    and wants to know whether Germany will not in the future take\r\n    revenge on account of our rupture with her; and if we are not\r\n    secured against this eventuality, what are the preparations to meet\r\n    with a contingency? The Government must not stake the fate of the\r\n    nation as if it be a child's toy, and the people must not be cast\r\n    into the whirlpool of slaughter. The people are the backbone of a\r\n    country, and if the people are all opposed to war on Germany, the\r\n    Government--in spite of the support of Parliament--must call a great\r\n    citizens' convention to decide the question. We must persist in our\r\n    neutrality. You gentlemen are patriotic sons of this country and\r\n    must know that the existence of China as a nation depends upon what\r\n    she does now in this matter. In tears, I appeal to you.\r\n\r\n    \"KANG YU-WEI.\"\r\n\r\nMarch and April were consumed in this fruitless discussion in which\r\neverybody participated. The Premier, General Tuan Chi-jui, in view of\r\nthe alleged provincial opposition, now summoned to Peking a Conference\r\nof Provincial Military Governors to endorse his policy, but this action\r\nalthough crowned with success so far as the army chiefs were\r\nconcerned--the conference voting solidly for war--was responsible for\r\ngreatly alarming Parliament which saw in this procedure a new attempt\r\nto undermine its power and control the country by extra-legal means.\r\nFurthermore, publication in the Metropolitan press of what the Japanese\r\nwere doing behind the scenes created a fear that extraordinary intrigues\r\nwere being indulged in with the object of securing by means of secret\r\ndiplomacy certain guarantees of a personal nature. Apart from being\r\nassociated with the semi-official negotiations of the Entente Powers in\r\nPeking, Japan was carrying on a second set of negotiations partly by\r\nmeans of a confidential agent named Kameio Nishihara dispatched from\r\nTokio specially for that purpose by Count Terauchi, the Japanese\r\nPremier, a procedure which led to the circulation of highly sensational\r\nstories regarding China's future commitments. When the Premier, General\r\nTuan Chi-jui, had made his statement to Parliament on the 10th March,\r\nregarding the necessity of an immediate rupture with Germany, he had\r\nimplied that China had already received assurances from the Allies that\r\nthere would be a postponement of the Boxer Indemnities for a term of\r\nyears, an immediate increase in the Customs Tariff, and a modification\r\nof the Peace Protocol of 1901 regarding the presence of Chinese troops\r\nnear Tientsin. Suddenly all these points were declared to be in doubt.\r\nRound the question of the length of time the Indemnities might be\r\npostponed, and the actual amount of the increase in the Customs Tariff,\r\nthere appeared to be an inexplicable muddle largely owing to the\r\nintervention of so many agents and to the fact that the exchange of\r\nviews had been almost entirely verbal, unofficial, and secret. It would\r\nbe wearisome to analyse a dispute which belongs to the peculiar\r\natmosphere of Peking diplomacy; but the vast difficulties of making even\r\na simple decision in China were glaringly illustrated by this matter.\r\nWith a large section of the Metropolitan press daily insisting that the\r\nfuture of democracy in China would be again imperilled should the\r\nMilitary Party have its own way, small wonder if the question of a\r\nformal declaration of war on Germany (and Austria) now assumed an\r\nentirely different complexion.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st May, in spite of all these trials and tribulations, being\r\npressed by the Premier to do so, the Cabinet unanimously decided that a\r\ndeclaration of war was imperative; and on the 7th May, after an\r\nagreement with the President had been reached, Parliament received the\r\nfollowing dispatch--this method of communication being the usual one\r\nbetween the executive and legislative branches of the Government:\r\n\r\n    The President has the honour to communicate to the House of\r\n    Representatives the following proposal. Since the severance of\r\n    diplomatic relations with Germany, Germany has continued to violate\r\n    the rights of the neutral nations and to damage and cause losses in\r\n    life and property to our people as well as to trample on\r\n    international law and disregard principles of humanity. For the\r\n    purpose of hastening peace, upholding international law and\r\n    protecting the life and property of our people, the President is of\r\n    the view that it is necessary to declare war on the German\r\n    Government. In accordance with Article 35 of the Provisional\r\n    Constitution, he now asks for the approval of the House, and\r\n    demands--in accordance with Article 21 of the Provisional\r\n    Constitution--that the meeting in the House be held in secret.\r\n\r\nOn 8th May, after hearing a statement made in person by the Premier, the\r\nHouse of Representatives in secret session referred the question for\r\nexamination to the House sitting as a Committee in order to gain time to\r\nmake up its mind. On the same day the Senate sat on the same question. A\r\nvery heated and bitter discussion followed in the upper House, not\r\nbecause of any real disagreement regarding the matter at issue, but\r\nbecause a large section of Senators were extremely anxious regarding the\r\ninternal consequences. This is well-explained by the following written\r\ninterpellation which was addressed to the government by a large number\r\nof parliamentarians:\r\n\r\n    We, the undersigned, hereby address this interpellation to the\r\n    Government. As a declaration of war on Germany has become an object\r\n    of the foreign policy of the Government, the latter has held\r\n    informal meetings to ascertain the views of parliament on the\r\n    question; and efforts are being made by the Government to secure the\r\n    unanimous support of both Houses for its war policy. In pursuing\r\n    this course, the Government appears to believe that its call for\r\n    support will be readily complied with by the Houses. But in our view\r\n    there are quite a number of members in both Houses who fail\r\n    thoroughly to understand the war decision of the Government. The\r\n    reason for this is that, according to recent reports, both foreign\r\n    and vernacular, the Government has entered into secret treaties with\r\n    a \"neighbouring country.\" It is also reported that secret agents on\r\n    both sides are active and are travelling between the two countries.\r\n    The matter seems to be very grave; and it has already attracted the\r\n    attention of Parliament, which in the near future will discuss the\r\n    war-issue.\r\n\r\n    Being in doubt as to the truth of such a report, we hereby request\r\n    the Government for the necessary information in the matter. We also\r\n    beg to suggest that, if there is any secret diplomatic agreement, we\r\n    consider it expedient for the Government to submit the matter to\r\n    Parliament for the latter's consideration. This will enable the\r\n    members in Parliament to study the question with care and have a\r\n    clear understanding of the matter. When this is done, Parliament\r\n    will be able to support the Government in the prosecution of its war\r\n    policy according to the dictates of conscience. In this event both\r\n    Parliament and Government will be able to co-operate with each other\r\n    in the solution of the present diplomatic problem. Troubled not a\r\n    little with the present diplomatic situation of the country, we\r\n    hereby address this interpellation to the Government in accordance\r\n    with law. It is hoped that an answer from the Government will be\r\n    dispatched to us within three days from date.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th May Parliament met in secret session and it was plain that a\r\ncrisis had come. Members of the House of Representatives experienced\r\ngreat difficulties in forcing their way through a mob of several\r\nthousand roughs who surrounded the approaches to Parliament, many\r\nmembers being hustled if not struck. The mob was so plainly in control\r\nof a secret organization that the House of Representatives refused to\r\nsit. Urgent messages were sent to the Police and Gendarmerie\r\nheadquarters for reinforcements of armed men as a protection, whilst the\r\npresence of the Premier was also demanded. Masses of police were soon on\r\nthe ground, but whilst they prevented the mob from entering Parliament\r\nand carrying out their threat of burning the buildings, and murdering\r\nthe members, they could not--or would not--disperse the crowds, it\r\ntranspiring subsequently that half a battalion of infantry in plain\r\nclothes under their officers formed the backbone of the demonstrators.\r\n\r\nIt was not until nearly dark, after six or seven hours of these\r\ndisorderly scenes, that the Premier finally arrived. Cavalry had\r\nmeanwhile also been massed on the main street; but it was only when the\r\nreport spread that a Japanese reporter had been killed that the order\r\nwas finally given to charge the mob and disperse it by force. This was\r\nvery rapidly done, as apart from the soldiers in plain clothes the mass\r\nof people belonged to the lowest class, and had no stomach for a fight,\r\nhaving only been paid to shout. It was nearly midnight, after twelve\r\nhours of isolation and a foodless day, that the Representatives were\r\nable to disperse without having debated the war-question. The upshot\r\nwas that with the exception of the Minister of Education, the Premier\r\nfound that his entire Cabinet had resigned, the Ministers being\r\nunwilling to be associated with what had been an attempted coercion of\r\nParliament carried out by the Military.\r\n\r\nThe Premier, General Tuan Chi-jui, however, remained determined to carry\r\nhis point, and within a week a second dispatch was sent to the House of\r\nRepresentatives demanding, in spite of what had happened, that the\r\ndeclaration of war be immediately brought up for debate. Meanwhile\r\npublication in a leading Peking newspaper of further details covering\r\nJapan's subterranean activities greatly inflamed the public, and made\r\nthe Liberal political elements more determined than ever to stand firm.\r\nIt was alleged that Count Terauchi was reviving in a more subtle form\r\nGroup V of the Twenty-one Demands of 1915, the latest Japanese proposal\r\ntaking the form of a secret Treaty of twenty articles of which the main\r\nstipulations were to be a loan of twenty million yen to China to\r\nreorganize the three main Chinese arsenals under Japanese guidance, and\r\na further loan of eighty million yen to be expended on the Japanization\r\nof the Chinese army. As a result of this publication, which rightly or\r\nwrongly was declared to be without foundation, the editor of _The Peking\r\nGazette_ was seized in the middle of the night and thrown into gaol; but\r\nParliament so far from being intimidated passed the very next day (19th\r\nMay) a resolution refusing to consider in any form the declaration of\r\nwar against Germany until the Cabinet had been reorganized--which meant\r\nthe resignation of General Tuan Chi-jui. A last effort was made by the\r\nreactionary element to jockey the President into submission by\r\npresenting to the Chief Executive a petition from the Military Governors\r\nassembled in Peking demanding the immediate dissolution of Parliament.\r\nOn this proposal being absolutely rejected by the President as wholly\r\nunconstitutional, and the Military Governors soundly rated for their\r\ninterference, an ominous calm followed.\r\n\r\nParliament, however, remained unmoved and continued its work. Although\r\nthe draft of the Permanent Constitution had been practically completed,\r\nimportant additions to the text were now proposed, such additions being\r\ndesigned to increase parliamentary control and provide every possible\r\nprecaution against arbitrary acts in the future. Thus the new provision\r\nthat a simple vote of want of confidence in the Cabinet must be followed\r\nby the President either dismissing the Cabinet or dissolving the House\r\nof Representatives--but that the dissolution of the Lower House could\r\nnot be ordered without the approval of the Senate--was generally\r\nrecognized as necessary to destroy the last vestiges of the Yuan\r\nShih-kai régime. Furthermore a new article, conferring on the President\r\nthe right to dismiss the Premier summarily by Presidential Mandate\r\nwithout the counter-signature of the other Cabinet Ministers, completed\r\nthe disarray of the conservatives who saw in this provision the dashing\r\nof their last hopes.[25]\r\n\r\nBy the 21st May, the last remaining Cabinet Minister--the Minister of\r\nEducation--had resigned and the Premier was left completely isolated. On\r\nthe 23rd May the President, relying on the general support of the\r\nnation, summarily dismissed General Tuan Chi-jui from the Premiership\r\nand appointed the veteran diplomat Dr. Wu Ting-fang to act during the\r\ninterim period in his stead, at the same time placing the metropolitan\r\ndistricts under four trustworthy Generals who were vested with\r\nprovost-marshals' powers under a system which gave them command of all\r\nthe so-called \"precautionary troops\" holding the approaches to the\r\ncapital. The Military Governors, who a few hours before these events had\r\nleft Peking precipitately in a body on the proclaimed mission of allying\r\nthemselves with the redoubtable General Chang Hsun at Hsuchowfu, and\r\nthreatening the safety of the Republic, were, however, coolly received\r\nin the provinces in spite of all their most bitter attempts to stir up\r\ntrouble. This, however, as will be shown, had no influence on their\r\nsubsequent conduct. The quiet disappearance of the ex-Premier in the\r\nmidst of this upheaval caused the report to spread that all the members\r\nof the corrupt camarilla which had surrounded him were to be arrested,\r\nbut the President soon publicly disclaimed any intention of doing\r\nso,--which appears to have been a fatal mistake. It is disheartening to\r\nhave to state that nearly all the Allied Legations in Peking had been in\r\nintimate relations with this gang--always excepting the American\r\nLegation whose attitude is uniformly correct--the French Minister going\r\nso far as to entertain the Military Governors and declare, according to\r\nreports in the native press, that Parliament was of no importance at\r\nall, the only important thing being for China promptly to declare war.\r\nThat some sort of public investigation into Peking diplomacy is\r\nnecessary before there can be any hope of decent relations between China\r\nand the Powers seems indisputable.[26]\r\n\r\nBefore the end of May the militarists being now desperate, attempted the\r\nold game of inciting the provincial capitals \"to declare their\r\nindependence,\" although the mass of the nation was plainly against them.\r\nSome measure of success attended this move, since the soldiery of the\r\nnorthern provinces obediently followed their leaders and there was a\r\nsudden wild demand for a march on Peking. A large amount of\r\nrolling-stock on the main railways was seized with this object, the\r\nconfusion being made worse confounded by the fierce denunciations which\r\nnow came from the southernmost provinces, coupled with their threats to\r\nattack the Northern troops all along the line as soon as they could\r\nmobilize.\r\n\r\nThe month of June opened with the situation more threatening than it had\r\nbeen for years. Emissaries of the recalcitrant Military Governors,\r\ntogether with all sorts of \"politicals\" and disgruntled generals,\r\ngathered in Tientsin--which is 80 miles from Peking--and openly\r\nestablished a Military Headquarters which they declared would be\r\nconverted into a Provisional Government which would seek the recognition\r\nof the Powers. Troops were moved and concentrated against Peking; fresh\r\ndemands were made that the President should dissolve Parliament; whilst\r\nthe Metropolitan press was suddenly filled with seditious articles. The\r\nPresident, seeing that the situation was becoming cataclysmic, was\r\ninduced, through what influences is not known, to issue a mandate\r\nsummoning General Chang Hsun to Peking to act as a mediator, which was\r\nanother fatal move. He arrived in Tientsin with many troops on the 7th\r\nJune where he halted and was speedily brought under subversive\r\ninfluences, sending at once up to Peking a sort of ultimatum which was\r\nsimply the old demand for the dissolution of Parliament.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on the 5th June, the United States, which had been alarmed by\r\nthese occurrences, had handed China the following Note hoping thereby to\r\nsteady the situation:\r\n\r\n    The Government of the United States learns with the most profound\r\n    regret of the dissension in China and desires to express the most\r\n    sincere desire that tranquillity and political co-ordination may be\r\n    forthwith re-established.\r\n\r\n    The entry of China into war with Germany--or the continuance of the\r\n    _status quo_ of her relations with that Government--are matters of\r\n    secondary consideration.\r\n\r\n    The principal necessity for China is to resume and continue her\r\n    political entity, to proceed along the road of national development\r\n    on which she has made such marked progress.\r\n\r\n    With the form of Government in China or the personnel which\r\n    administers that Government, the United States has an interest only\r\n    in so far as its friendship impels it to be of service to China. But\r\n    in the maintenance by China of one Central United and alone\r\n    responsible Government, the United States is deeply interested, and\r\n    now expresses the very sincere hope that China, in her own interest\r\n    and in that of the world, will immediately set aside her factional\r\n    political disputes, and that all parties and persons will work for\r\n    the re-establishment of a co-ordinate Government and the assumption\r\n    of that place among the Powers of the World to which China is so\r\n    justly entitled, but the full attainment of which is impossible in\r\n    the midst of internal discord.\r\n\r\nThe situation had, however, developed so far and so rapidly that this\r\nexpression of opinion had little weight. The Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic, General Feng Kuo-chang, unwilling or unable to do anything,\r\nhad already tendered his resignation from Nanking, declaring that he\r\nwould maintain the \"neutrality\" of the important area of the lower\r\nYangtsze during this extraordinary struggle; and his action, strange as\r\nit may seem, typified the vast misgivings which filled every one's mind\r\nregarding the mad course of action which the rebellious camarilla had\r\ndecided upon.\r\n\r\nUntil Saturday the 9th June, the President had seemed adamant. On that\r\nday he personally saw foreign press correspondents and assured them\r\nthat, in spite of every threat, he would in no conceivable\r\ncircumstances attempt the unconstitutional step of dissolving\r\nParliament,--unconstitutional because the Nanking Provisional\r\nConstitution under which the country was still governed pending the\r\nformal passage of the Permanent Constitution through Parliament, only\r\nprovided for the creation of Parliament as a grand constitutional\r\nDrafting Committee but gave no power to the Chief Executive to dissolve\r\nit during its \"life\" which was three years. As we have already shown,\r\nthe period between the _coup d'état_ of 4th November, 1913, and the\r\nre-convocation of Parliament on 1st August, 1916, had been treated as a\r\nmere interregnum: therefore until 1918, if the law were properly\r\nconstrued, no power in the land could interrupt the Parliamentary\r\nsessions except Parliament itself. Parliament, in view of these\r\nthreatening developments, had already expressed its willingness (a) to\r\nreconsider certain provisions of the draft constitution in such a\r\nconciliatory manner as to insure the passage of the whole instrument\r\nthrough both houses within two weeks; (b) to alter the Election Law in\r\nsuch fashion as to conciliate the more conservative elements in the\r\ncountry; (c) to prorogue the second session (1916-1917) immediately\r\nthese things were done and after a very short recess to open the third\r\nsession (1917-1918) and close it within three months, allowing new\r\nelections to be held in the early months of 1918,--the new Parliament to\r\nbe summoned in April, 1918, to form itself into a National Convention\r\nand elect the President for the quinquennial period 1918-1923.\r\n\r\nAll these reasonable plans were knocked on the head on Sunday, the 10th\r\nJune, by the sudden report that the President having been peremptorily\r\ntold that the dissolution of Parliament was the sole means of saving the\r\nRepublic and preventing the sack of Peking, as well as an open armed\r\nattempt to restore the boy-emperor Hsuan Tung, had at last made up his\r\nmind to surrender to the inevitable. He had sealed a Mandate decreeing\r\nthe dissolution of Parliament which would be promulgated as soon as it\r\nhad received the counter-signature of the acting Premier, Dr. Wu\r\nTing-fang, such counter-signature being obligatory under Article 45 of\r\nthe Provisional Constitution.\r\n\r\nAt once it became clear again, as happens a thousand times during every\r\nyear in the East, that what is not nipped in the bud grows with such\r\nmalignant swiftness as finally to blight all honest intentions. Had\r\nsteps been taken on or about the 23rd May to detain forcibly in Peking\r\nthe ringleader of the recalcitrant Military Governors, one General Ni\r\nShih-chung of Anhui, history would have been very different and China\r\nspared much national and international humiliation. Six years of stormy\r\nhappenings had certainly bred in the nation a desire for\r\nconstitutionalism and a detestation of military domination. But this\r\ndesire and detestation required firm leadership. Without that leadership\r\nit was inchoate and powerless, and indeed made furtive by the constant\r\nfear of savage reprisals. A great opportunity had come and a great\r\nopportunity had been lost. President Li Yuan-hung's personal argument,\r\ncommunicated to the writer, was that in sealing the Mandate dissolving\r\nParliament he had chosen the lesser of two evils, for although South\r\nChina and the Chinese Navy declared they would defend Parliament to the\r\nlast, they were far away whilst large armies were echeloned along the\r\nrailways leading into Peking and daily threatening action. The events of\r\nthe next year or so must prove conclusively, in spite of what has\r\nhappened in this month of June, 1917, that the corrupt power of the\r\nsword can no longer even nominally rule China.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Late President Yuan Shih-kai]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: President Yuan Shi-kai photographed immediately after his\r\nInauguration as Provisional President, March 10th, 1912.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the veteran Dr. Wu Ting-fang, true to his faith, declared that\r\nno power on earth would cause him to sign a Mandate possessing no\r\nlegality behind it; and he indeed obstinately resisted every attempt to\r\nseduce him. Although his resignation was refused he stood his ground\r\nmanfully, and it became clear that some other expedient would have to be\r\nresorted to. In the small hours of the 13th June what this was was made\r\nclear: by a rapid reshuffling of the cards Dr. Wu Ting-fang's\r\nresignation was accepted and the general officer commanding the Peking\r\nGendarmerie, a genial soul named General Chiang Chao-tsung, who had\r\nsurvived unscathed the vicissitudes of six years of revolution, was\r\nappointed to act in his stead and duly counter-signed the fateful\r\nMandate which was at once printed and promulgated at four o'clock in the\r\nmorning. It has been stated to the writer that had it not been so issued\r\nfour battalions of Chang Hsun's savage pigtailed soldiery, who had been\r\nbivouacked for some days in the grounds of the Temple of Heaven, would\r\nhave been let loose on the capital. The actual text of the Mandate\r\nproves conclusively that the President had no hand in its drafting--one\r\nargument being sufficient to prove that, namely the deliberate ignoring\r\nof the fact that Parliament had been called into being by virtue of\r\narticle 53 of the Nanking Provisional Constitution and that under\r\narticle 54 its specific duty was to act as a grand constitutional\r\nconference to draft and adopt the Permanent Constitution, article 55\r\nfurthermore giving Parliament the right summarily to amend the\r\nProvisional Constitution before the Promulgation of the permanent\r\ninstrument, should that be necessary. Provisions of this sort would\r\nnaturally carry no weight with generals of the type of Chang Hsun, of\r\nwhom it is said that until recent years he possessed only the most\r\nelementary education; but it is a dismal thing to have to record that\r\nthe Conservative Party in China should have adopted a platform of brute\r\nforce in the year of grâce, 1917.\r\n\r\n    MANDATE DISSOLVING PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n    In the 6th month of last year I promulgated a Mandate stating that\r\n    in order to make a Constitution it was imperative that Parliament\r\n    should be convened. The Republic was inaugurated five years ago and\r\n    yet there was no Constitution, which should be the fundamental law\r\n    of a nation, therefore it was ordered that Parliament be re-convened\r\n    to make the Constitution, etc., at once.\r\n\r\n    Therefore the main object for the re-convocation of Parliament was\r\n    to make a formal constitution for the country. Recently a petition\r\n    was received from Meng En-yuen, Tu-chun of Kirin, and others, to the\r\n    effect that \"in the articles passed by the Constitution Conference\r\n    there were several points as follows: 'when the House of\r\n    Representatives passes a vote of want of confidence against the\r\n    Cabinet Ministers, the President may dismiss the Cabinet Ministers,\r\n    or dissolve the said House, but the dissolution of the House shall\r\n    have the approval of the Senate.' Again, 'When the President\r\n    dismisses his Prime Minister, it is unnecessary for him to secure\r\n    the counter-signature of the Cabinet Ministers.' Again 'when a bill\r\n    is passed by the Two Houses it shall have the force of the law.' We\r\n    were surprised to read the above provisions.\r\n\r\n    \"According to the precedents of other nations the Constitution has\r\n    never been made by Parliament. If we should desire a good and\r\n    workable Constitution, we should seek a fundamental solution. Indeed\r\n    Parliament is more important than any other organ in the country;\r\n    but when the national welfare is imperilled, we must take action. As\r\n    the present Parliament does not care about the national welfare, it\r\n    is requested that in view of the critical condition of the country,\r\n    drastic measures be taken and both the House of Representatives and\r\n    the Senate be dissolved so that they may be reorganized and the\r\n    Constitution may be made without any further delay. Thus the form of\r\n    the Republican Government be preserved, etc.\"\r\n\r\n    Of late petitions and telegrams have been received from the military\r\n    and civil officials, merchants, scholars, etc., containing similar\r\n    demands. The Senate and the House of Representatives have held the\r\n    Constitution Conference for about one year, and the Constitution has\r\n    not yet been completed. Moreover at this critical time most of the\r\n    M.P.'s of both Houses have tendered their resignation. Hence it is\r\n    impossible to secure quorums to discuss business. There is therefore\r\n    no chance to revise the articles already passed. Unless means be\r\n    devised to hasten the making of the Constitution, the heart of the\r\n    people will never be satisfied.\r\n\r\n    I, the President, who desire to comply with the will of the populace\r\n    and to consolidate the foundation of the nation, grant the request\r\n    of the Tuchuns and the people. It is hereby ordered that the Senate\r\n    and the House of Representatives be dissolved, and that another\r\n    election be held immediately. Thus a Constitutional Government can\r\n    be maintained. It must be pointed out that the object for the\r\n    reorganization of Parliament is to hasten the making of the\r\n    Constitution, and not to abolish the Legislative Organ of the\r\n    Republic. I hope all the citizens of the Republic will understand my\r\n    motives.\r\n\r\nA great agitation and much public uneasiness followed the publication of\r\nthis document; and the parliamentarians, who had already been leaving\r\nPeking in small numbers, now evacuated the capital _en masse_ for the\r\nSouth. The reasonable and wholly logical attitude of the\r\nConstitutionalists is well-exhibited in the last Memorandum they\r\nsubmitted to the President some days prior to his decision to issue the\r\nMandate above-quoted; and a perusal of this document will show what may\r\nbe expected in the future. It will be noted that the revolting Military\r\nGovernors are boldly termed rebels and that the constitutional view of\r\neverything they may contrive as from the 13th June, 1917, is that it\r\nwill be bereft of all legality and simply mark a fresh interregnum.\r\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the situation is brought back\r\nby the Mandate of the 13th June to where it was on the 6th June, 1916,\r\nwith the death of Yuan Shih-kai, and that a period of civil commotion\r\nseems inevitable.\r\n\r\n    MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n    To the President: Our previous memorandum to Your Excellency must\r\n    have received your attention. We now beg further to inform you that\r\n    the rebels are now practically in an embarrassing predicament on\r\n    account of internal differences, the warning of the friendly Powers,\r\n    and the protest of the South-western provinces. Their position is\r\n    becoming daily more and more untenable. If Your Excellency strongly\r\n    holds out for another ten days or so, their movement will collapse.\r\n\r\n    Some one, however, has the impudence to suggest that with the entry\r\n    of Chang Hsun's troops into the Capital, and delay in the settlement\r\n    of the question will mean woe and disaster. But to us, there need be\r\n    no such fear. As the troops in the Capital have no mind to oppose\r\n    the rebels, Tsao Kun and his troops alone will be adequate for their\r\n    purposes in the Capital. But now the rebel troops have been halting\r\n    in the neighbourhood of the Capital for the last ten days. This\r\n    shows that they dare not open hostilities against the Government,\r\n    which step will certainly bring about foreign intervention and incur\r\n    the strong opposition of the South-western provinces. Having refused\r\n    to participate in the rebellion at the invitation of Ni Shih-chung\r\n    and Chang Tso-lin, Chang Hsun will certainly not do what Tsao Kun\r\n    has not dared to do. But the rebels have secret agents in the\r\n    Capital to circulate rumours to frighten the public and we hope that\r\n    the President will remain calm and unperturbed, lest it will give an\r\n    opportunity for the rebel agents to practise their evil tricks.\r\n\r\n    Respecting Parliament, its re-assembly was one of the two most\r\n    important conditions by means of which the political differences\r\n    between the North and the South last year were healed. The\r\n    dissolution of Parliament would mean the violation of the terms of\r\n    settlement entered into between the North and the South last year\r\n    and an open challenge to the South. Would the South remain silent\r\n    respecting this outrageous measure? If the South rises in arms\r\n    against this measure, what explanation can the Central Government\r\n    give? It will only serve to hasten the split between the North and\r\n    the South. From a legal point of view, the Power of Government is\r\n    vested in the Provisional Constitution. When the Government\r\n    exercises power which is not provided for by the Constitution, it\r\n    simply means high treason.\r\n\r\n    Some one has suggested that it would not be an illegal act for the\r\n    Government to dissolve Parliament, since it is not provided in the\r\n    Provisional Constitution as to how Parliament should be dissolved,\r\n    nor does that instrument specifically prohibit the Government from\r\n    dissolving Parliament. But this is a misinterpretation. For\r\n    instance, the Provisional Constitution has not provided that the\r\n    President shall not proclaim himself Emperor, nor does it prohibit\r\n    him from so doing. According to such interpretation, it would not be\r\n    illegal, if the President were to proclaim himself Emperor of the\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n    In short, the action taken by Ni Shih-chung and others is nothing\r\n    short of open rebellion. From the legal point of view, any\r\n    suggestion of compromise would be absurd. It has already been a\r\n    fatal mistake for the President to have allowed them to do what they\r\n    like, and if he again yields to their pressure by dissolving\r\n    Parliament, he will be held responsible, when the righteous troops\r\n    rise and punish the rebels. If the President, deceived by ignoble\r\n    persons, take upon himself to dissolve the assembly, his name will\r\n    go down in history as one committing high treason against the\r\n    Government, and the author of the break between the North and the\r\n    South. The President has been known as the man by whose hands the\r\n    Republic was built. We have special regard for his benevolent\r\n    character and kind disposition. We are reluctant to see him\r\n    intimidated and misled by evil counsels to take a step which will\r\n    undo all his meritorious services to the county and shatter the\r\n    unique reputation he has enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe unrolling of these dramatic events was the signal for the greatest\r\nsubterranean activity on the part of the Japanese, who were now\r\neverywhere seen rubbing their hands and congratulating themselves on the\r\ncourse history was taking. General Tanaka, Vice-Chief of the Japanese\r\nGeneral Staff, who had been on an extensive tour of inspection in China,\r\nso _planned as to include every arsenal north of the Yangtsze_ had\r\narrived at the psychological moment in Peking and was now deeply engaged\r\nthrough Japanese field-officers in the employ of the Chinese Government,\r\nin pulling every string and in trying to commit the leaders of this\r\nunedifying plot in such a way as to make them puppets of Japan. The\r\nJapanese press, seizing on the American Note of the 5th June as an\r\nexcuse, had been belabouring the United States for some days for its\r\n\"interference\" in Chinese affairs, and also for having ignored Japan's\r\n\"special position\" in China, which according to these publicists\r\ndemanded that no Power take any action in the Far East, or give any\r\nadvice, without first consulting Japan. That a stern correction will\r\nhave to be offered to this presumption as soon as the development of the\r\nwar permits it is certain. But not only Japanese military officers and\r\njournalists were endlessly busy: so-called Japanese advisers to the\r\nChinese Government had done their utmost to assist the confusion. Thus\r\nDr. Ariga, the Constitutional expert, when called in at the last moment\r\nfor advice by President Li Yuan-hung had flatly contradicted Dr.\r\nMorrison, who with an Englishman's love of justice and constitutionalism\r\nhad insisted that there was only one thing for the President to do--to\r\nbe bound by legality to the last no matter what it might cost him. Dr.\r\nAriga had falsely stated that the issue was a question of expediency,\r\nthus deliberately assisting the forces of disruption. This is perhaps\r\nonly what was to be expected of a man who had advised Yuan Shih-kai to\r\nmake himself Emperor--knowing full well that he could never succeed and\r\nthat indeed the whole enterprise from the point of view of Japan was an\r\nelaborate trap.\r\n\r\nThe provincial response to the action taken on the 13th June became what\r\nevery one had expected: the South-western group of provinces, with their\r\nmilitary headquarters at Canton, began openly concerting measures to\r\nresist not the authority of the President, who was recognized as a just\r\nman surrounded by evil-minded persons who never hesitated to betray him,\r\nbut to destroy the usurping generals and the corrupt camarilla behind\r\nthem; whilst the Yangtsze provinces, with their headquarters at Nanking,\r\nwhich had hitherto been pledged to \"neutrality,\" began secretly\r\nexchanging views with the genuinely Republican South. The group of\r\nTientsin generals and \"politicals,\" confused by these developments,\r\nremained inactive; and this was no doubt responsible for the mad coup\r\nattempted by the semi-illiterate General Chang Hsun. In the small hours\r\nof July 1st General Chang Hsun, relying on the disorganization in the\r\ncapital which we have dealt with in our preceding account entered the\r\nImperial City with his troops by prearrangement with the Imperial Family\r\nand at 4 o'clock on the morning of the 1st July the Manchu boy-emperor\r\nHsuan Tung, who lost the Throne on the 12th February, 1912, was\r\nenthroned before a small assembly of Manchu nobles, courtiers and\r\nsycophantic Chinese. The capital woke up to find military patrols\r\neverywhere and to hear incredulously that the old order had returned.\r\nThe police, obeying instructions, promptly visited all shops and\r\ndwelling-houses and ordered every one to fly the Dragon Flag. In the\r\nafternoon of the same day the following Restoration Edict was issued,\r\nits statements being a tissue of falsehoods, the alleged memorial from\r\nPresident Li Yuan-hung, which follows the principal document, being a\r\nbare-faced forgery, whilst no single name inserted in the text save that\r\nof Chang Hsun had any right to be there. There is also every reason to\r\nbelieve that the Manchu court party was itself coerced, terror being\r\nfelt from the beginning regarding the consequences of this mad act which\r\nwas largely possible because Peking is a Manchu city.\r\n\r\n    IMPERIAL EDICT\r\n\r\n    Issued the 13th day of the 5th Moon of the 9th year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n\r\n    While yet in our boyhood the inheritance of the great domain was\r\n    unfortunately placed in our possession; and since we were then all\r\n    alone, we were unable to weather the numerous difficulties. Upon the\r\n    outbreak of the uprising in the year of Hsin Hai, (1911) Our\r\n    Empress, Hsiao Ting Chin, owing to her Most High Virtue and Most\r\n    Deep Benevolence was unwilling to allow the people to suffer, and\r\n    courageously placed in the hands of the late Imperial Councillor,\r\n    Yuan Shih-kai, the great dominion which our forefathers had built\r\n    up, and with it the lives of the millions of Our People, with orders\r\n    to establish a provisional government.\r\n\r\n    The power of State was thus voluntarily given to the whole country\r\n    with the hope that disputes might disappear, disturbances might stop\r\n    and the people enabled to live in peace. But ever since the form of\r\n    State was changed into a Republic, continuous strife has prevailed\r\n    and several wars have taken place. Forcible seizure, excessive\r\n    taxation and bribery have been of everyday occurrence. Although the\r\n    annual revenue has increased to 400 millions this amount is still\r\n    insufficient to meet the needs. The total amount of foreign\r\n    obligations has reached a figure of more than ten thousand millions\r\n    yet more loans are being contracted. The people within the seas are\r\n    shocked by this state of affairs and interest in life has forsaken\r\n    them. The step reluctantly taken by Our Empress Hsiao Ting Chin for\r\n    the purpose of giving respite to the people has resulted untowardly\r\n    in increasing the burdens of Our People. This indeed Our Empress\r\n    Hsiao Ting Chin was unable to foresee, and the result must have made\r\n    her Spirit in Heaven to weep sorely. And it is owing to this that we\r\n    have been praying to Heaven day and night in the close confines of\r\n    the palace, meditating and weeping in silent suffering.\r\n\r\n    Recently party strife has resulted in war and the country has\r\n    remained too long in an unsettled condition. The Republic has fallen\r\n    to pieces and means of remedy have been exhausted.\r\n\r\n    Chang Hsun, Feng Kuo-chang and Lu Yung-ting have jointly\r\n    memorialized the Throne stating that the minds of people are\r\n    disturbed and they are longing to see the old régime restored, and\r\n    asking that the throne be reoccupied in order to comfort the people.\r\n\r\n    Chu Hung-chi and others have also memorialized us stating that the\r\n    country is in imminent danger and that the people have lost their\r\n    faith in the Republic, and asking that we ascend the Throne in\r\n    obedience to the mandate of Heaven and man.\r\n\r\n    Li Yuan-hung has also memorialized the throne, returning the great\r\n    power of State to us in order to benefit the country and save the\r\n    people.\r\n\r\n    A perusal of the said memorials, which are worded in earnest terms,\r\n    has filled our heart with regret and fear. On the one hand We, being\r\n    yet in Our boyhood, are afraid to assume the great responsibilities\r\n    for the existence of the country but on the other hand We are\r\n    unwilling to turn our head away from the welfare of the millions\r\n    simply because the step might affect Our own safety.\r\n\r\n    After weighing the two sides and considering the mandates of Heaven\r\n    and man, we have decided reluctantly to comply with the prayers, and\r\n    have again occupied the Court to attend to the affairs of State\r\n    after resuming possession of the great power on the 13th day of the\r\n    5th moon of the 9th year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n\r\n    A new beginning will be made with our people. Hereafter the\r\n    principles of morality and the sacred religion shall be our\r\n    constitution in spirit, and order, righteousness, honesty and\r\n    conscience will be practised to rebind the minds of the people who\r\n    are now without bonds. People high and low will be uniformly treated\r\n    with sincerity, and will not depend on obedience of law alone as the\r\n    means of co-operation. Administration and orders will be based on\r\n    conscientious realization and no one will be allowed to treat the\r\n    form of State as material for experiment. At this time of exhaustion\r\n    when its vitality is being wasted to the last drop and the existence\r\n    of the country is hanging in the balance, we, as if treading on thin\r\n    ice over deep waters, dare not in the slightest degree indulge in\r\n    license on the principle that the Sovereign is entitled to\r\n    enjoyment. It is our wish therefore that all officials, be they high\r\n    or low, should purify their hearts and cleanse themselves of all\r\n    forms of old corruption; constantly keeping in mind the real\r\n    interests of the people. Every bit of vitality of the people they\r\n    shall be able to preserve shall go to strengthen the life of the\r\n    country for whatever it is worth. Only by doing so can the danger be\r\n    averted and Heaven moved by our sincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE NINE ARTICLES\r\n\r\n    Herewith we promulgate the following principal things, which we must\r\n    either introduce as reforms or abolish as undesirable in\r\n    restoration.\r\n\r\n    1. We shall obey the edict of Emperor Teh Tsung Chin (Kuang Hsu),\r\n    namely, that the sovereign power shall be controlled by the Court\r\n    (state) but the detailed administration shall be subject to public\r\n    opinion. The country shall be called The Empire of Ta Ching; and the\r\n    methods of other constitutional monarchies shall be carefully\r\n    copied.\r\n\r\n    2. The allowance for the Imperial House shall be the same as before,\r\n    namely, $4,000,000 per year. The sum shall be paid annually and not\r\n    a single cent is to be added.\r\n\r\n    3. We shall strictly obey the instructions of our forefathers to the\r\n    extent that no member of the imperial family shall be allowed to\r\n    interfere with administrative affairs.\r\n\r\n    4. The line of demarcation between Man (Manchu) and Han (Chinese)\r\n    shall be positively obliterated. All Manchurian and Mongolian posts\r\n    which have already been abolished shall not be restored. As to\r\n    intermarriage and change of customs the officials concerned are\r\n    hereby commanded to submit their views on the points concerning them\r\n    respectively.\r\n\r\n    5. All treaties and loan agreements, money for which has already\r\n    been paid, formally concluded and signed with any eastern and\r\n    western countries before this 13th day of the 5th Moon of the 9th\r\n    year of Hsuan Tung, shall continue to be valid.\r\n\r\n    6. The stamp duty which was introduced by the Republic is hereby\r\n    abolished so that the people may be relieved of their burdens. As to\r\n    other petty taxes and contributions the Viceroys and Governors of\r\n    the provinces are hereby commanded to make investigations and report\r\n    on the same for their abolition.\r\n\r\n    7. The criminal code of the Republic is unsuited to this country. It\r\n    is hereby abolished. For the time being the provisional criminal\r\n    code as adopted in the first year of Hsuan Tung shall be observed.\r\n\r\n    8. The evil custom of political parties is hereby forbidden. Old\r\n    political offenders are all pardoned. We shall, however, not be able\r\n    to pardon those who deliberately hold themselves aloof and disturb\r\n    peace and order.\r\n\r\n    9. All of our people and officials shall be left to decide for\r\n    themselves the custom of wearing or cutting their queues as\r\n    commanded in the 9th moon of the 3rd year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n\r\n    We swear that we and our people shall abide by these articles. The\r\n    Great Heaven and Earth bear witness to our words. Let this be made\r\n    known to all.\r\n\r\n    Counter-signed by Chang Hsun,\r\n    Member of the Imperial Privy Council.\r\n\r\n    ALLEGED MEMORIAL BY PRESIDENT LI YUAN-HUNG\r\n\r\n    In a memorial submitted this day, offering to return the sovereign\r\n    power of State and praying that we again ascend the throne to\r\n    control the great empire, Li Yuan-hung states that some time ago he\r\n    was forced by mutinous troops to steal the great throne and falsely\r\n    remained at the head of the administration but failed to do good to\r\n    the difficult situation. He enumerates the various evils in the\r\n    establishment of a Republic and prays that we ascend the throne to\r\n    again control the Empire with a view that the people may thereby be\r\n    saved. As to himself he awaits punishment by the properly instituted\r\n    authorities, etc. As his words are so mournful and full of remorse\r\n    they must have been uttered from a sincere heart. Since it was not\r\n    his free choice to follow the rebellion, the fact that he has\r\n    returned the great power of administration to us shows that he knows\r\n    the great principle of righteousness. At this time of national\r\n    danger and uncertainty, he has taken the lead of the people in\r\n    obeying their sovereign, and decided before others the plan to save\r\n    the country from ruin. The merit is indeed great, and we are highly\r\n    pleased with his achievement. Li Yuan-hung is hereby to have\r\n    conferred on him the dignity of Duke of the first class so as to\r\n    show our great appreciation. Let him accept our Edict and for ever\r\n    receive our blessings.\r\n\r\n    Counter-signed by Chang Hsun,\r\n    Member of the Privy Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PRIVY COUNCIL\r\n\r\n    At this time of restoration a Privy Council is hereby established in\r\n    order that we may be assisted in our duties and that responsibility\r\n    may be made definite. Two Under-Secretaries of the Council are also\r\n    created. Other officials serving outside of the capital shall remain\r\n    as under the system in force during the first year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n    All civil and military officials who are now serving at their\r\n    various posts are hereby commanded to continue in office as\r\n    hitherto.\r\n\r\n    Counter-signed by Chang Hsun.\r\n\r\n(Hereafter follow many appointments of reactionary Chinese officials.)\r\n\r\nThe general stupefaction at the madness of this act and the military\r\noccupation of all posts and telegraph-offices in Peking allowed 48 hours\r\nto go by before the reaction came. On the 2nd July Edicts still\r\ncontinued to appear attempting to galvanize to life the corpse of\r\nImperialism and the puzzled populace flew the Dragon Flag. On the\r\nmorning of the 3rd, however, the news suddenly spread that President Li\r\nYuan-hung, who had virtually been made a prisoner in the Presidential\r\nPalace, had escaped at nine o'clock the night before by motorcar\r\naccompanied by two aides-de-camp, and after attempting to be received at\r\nthe French Hospital in the Legation Quarter, had proceeded to the\r\nJapanese Legation where he was offered a suitable residence. On the\r\nevening of the 3rd the Japanese Legation issued the following official\r\ncommunique (in French) defining its attitude:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TRANSLATION\r\n\r\n    President Li, accompanied by two members of his staff, came at 9.30\r\n    on the evening of July 2 to the residence of General Saito, Military\r\n    Attaché of the Japanese Legation, and asked protection from him. He\r\n    arrived in a spontaneous manner and without previous notice.\r\n\r\n    Under these circumstances, the Imperial Japanese Legation, following\r\n    international usage, has decided to accord him the necessary\r\n    protection and has placed at his disposal a part of the military\r\n    barracks.\r\n\r\n    The Legation further declares that as long as President Li remains\r\n    there, it will not permit any political action on his part.\r\n\r\nFollowing this sensational development it became known that President Li\r\nYuan-hung had completely frustrated the efforts of the Imperialists by\r\nsending away a number of important telegraphic Mandates by courier to\r\nTientsin as well as the Presidential Seal. By a masterly move in one of\r\nthese Mandates General Tuan Chi-jui was reappointed Premier, whilst\r\nVice-President Feng Kuo-chang was asked to officiate as President, the\r\narrangements being so complete as at once to catch Chang Hsun in his own\r\nnet.\r\n\r\nHere is the text of these four historically important messages:\r\n\r\n    (1) Dated July 1. To-day Inspector General Chang Hsun entered the\r\n    city with his troops and actually restored the monarchy. He stopped\r\n    traffic and sent Liang Ting-fen and others to my place to persuade\r\n    me. Yuan-hung refused in firm language and swore that he would not\r\n    recognize such a step. It is his hope that the Vice-President and\r\n    others will take effective means to protect the Republic.\r\n\r\n    Li Yuan-hung.\r\n\r\n    (2) Dated July 1. As Heaven does not scorn calamity so has the\r\n    monarchy been restored. It is said that in an edict issued by the\r\n    Ching House it is stated that Yuan-hung had actually memorialized to\r\n    return the power of State to the said House. This is an\r\n    extraordinary announcement. China changed from autocracy to a\r\n    Republic by the unanimous wish of the five races of the country.\r\n    Since Yuan-hung was entrusted by the people with the great\r\n    responsibilities it is his natural duty to maintain the Republic to\r\n    the very end. Nothing more or less than this will he care to say. He\r\n    is sending this in order to avoid misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n    Li Yuan-hung.\r\n\r\n    (3) The President to the Vice-President.\r\n\r\n    To the Vice-President Feng at Nanking--It is to be presumed that the\r\n    two telegrams sent on the 1st have safely reached you. I state with\r\n    deepest regret and greatest sorrow that as the result of my lack of\r\n    ability to handle the situation the political crisis has eventually\r\n    affected the form of government. For this Yuan-hung realizes that he\r\n    owes the country apology. The situation in Peking is daily becoming\r\n    more precarious. Since Yuan-hung is now unable to exercise his power\r\n    the continuity of the Republic may be suddenly interrupted. You are\r\n    also entrusted by the citizens with great responsibilities; I ask\r\n    you to temporarily exercise the power and functions of the President\r\n    in your own office in accordance with the provisions of Article 42\r\n    of the Provisional Constitution and Article 5 of the Presidential\r\n    Election Law. As the means of communication is effectively blocked\r\n    it is feared that the sending of my seal will meet with difficulty\r\n    and obstruction. Tuan Chih-chuan (Tuan Chi-jui) has been appointed\r\n    Premier, and is also ordered to temporarily protect the seal, and\r\n    later to devise a means to forward it on to you. Hereafter\r\n    everything pertaining to the important question of saving the\r\n    country shall be energetically pushed by you and Chih-chuan with\r\n    utmost vigour. The situation is pressing and your duty is clear. In\r\n    great anxiety and expectation I am sending you this telegram.\r\n\r\n    Li Yuan-hung.\r\n\r\n    (4) Dated July 3. To Vice-President Feng, Tu Chuns and Governors of\r\n    the Provinces, Provincial Assemblies, Inspector General Lu:--I\r\n    presume that the two telegrams dated 1st and one dated 3rd inst.\r\n    have safely reached your place. With bitter remorse to myself I now\r\n    make the statement that the political crisis has resulted in\r\n    affecting the form of government. Tuan Chih-chuan has been appointed\r\n    on the 1st inst. as Premier; and the Vice-President has been asked\r\n    to exercise the power and functions of the President in accordance\r\n    of office by the Vice-President. Premier Tuan is authorized to act\r\n    at his discretion. All the seal and documents have been sent to\r\n    Tientsin, and Premier Tuan has been told to keep and guard the same\r\n    for the time being. He has also been asked to forward the same to\r\n    the Vice-President. The body guards of the President's Office have\r\n    suddenly been replaced and I have been pressed to give up the Three\r\n    Lakes. Yuan-hung has therefore removed to a sanctuary. As regards\r\n    the means to save the country I trust that you will consult and work\r\n    unitedly with Vice-President Feng and Premier Tuan. In great\r\n    expectation, and with much of my heart not poured out.\r\n\r\n    Li Yuan-hung.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, whilst these dramatic events were occurring in Peking, others\r\nno less sensational were taking place in the provinces. The Tientsin\r\ngroup, suddenly realizing that the country was in danger, took action\r\nvery swiftly, disclosing that in spite of all disputes Republicanism had\r\nbecome very dear to every thinking man in the country, and that at last\r\nit was possible to think of an united China. The Scholar Liang Chi Chao,\r\nspokesman of Chinese Liberalism, in an extraordinarily able message\r\ncircularized the provinces in terms summarizing everything of\r\nimportance. Beginning with the fine literary flight that \"heaven has\r\nrefused to sympathize with our difficulties by allowing traitors to be\r\nborn\" he ends with the astounding phrase that although he had proposed\r\nto remain silent to the end of his days, \"at the sight of the fallen\r\nnest he has, however, spat the stopper out of his throat,\" and he calls\r\nupon all China to listen to his words which are simply that the Republic\r\nmust be upheld or dissolution will come.\r\n\r\nArms now united with Literature. General Tuan Chi-jui, immediately\r\naccepting the burden placed on him, proceeded to the main entrenched\r\ncamp outside Tientsin and assumed command of the troops massed there,\r\nissuing at the same time the following manifesto:\r\n\r\n    TUAN CHI-JUI'S MANIFESTO\r\n\r\n    To Vice-President Feng Kuo-chang, Inspector General of Wumin, Tu\r\n    Chuns, Governors, Tu-tungs....\r\n\r\n    Heaven is chastening this country by the series of disturbances that\r\n    have taken place. Chang Hsun, filled with sinister designs, has\r\n    occupied the capital by bringing up his troops under the pretext of\r\n    effecting a compromise with the astounding result that last night\r\n    the Republican form of government was overthrown. The question of\r\n    the form of Government is the very fundamental principle on which\r\n    the national existence depends. It requires assiduous efforts to\r\n    settle the form of government and once a decision has been reached\r\n    on the subject, any attempt to change the same is bound to bring on\r\n    unspeakable disasters to the country. To-day the people of China are\r\n    much more enlightened and democratic in spirit than ever before. It\r\n    is, therefore, absolutely impossible to subjugate the millions by\r\n    holding out to the country the majesty of any one family.\r\n\r\n    When the Republic of China was being founded, the Ching House, being\r\n    well aware of the general inclinations of modern peoples, sincerely\r\n    and modestly abdicated its power. Believing that such spirit\r\n    deserved handsome recognition the people were willing to place the\r\n    Ching House under the protection of special treatment and actually\r\n    recorded the covenant on paper, whereby contentment and honour were\r\n    vouchsafed the Ching House. Of the end of more than 20 dynasties of\r\n    Chinese history, none can compare with the Ching dynasty for peace\r\n    and safety.\r\n\r\n    Purely for sake of satisfying his ambitions of self-elevation Chang\r\n    Hsun and others have audaciously committed a crime of inconceivable\r\n    magnitude and are guilty of high treason. Like Wang Mang and Tung\r\n    Tso he seeks to sway the whole nation by utilizing a young and\r\n    helpless emperor. Moreover he has given the country to understand\r\n    that Li Yuan-hung has memorialized the Ching House that many evils\r\n    have resulted from republicanism and that the ex-emperor should be\r\n    restored to save the masses. That Chang Hsun has been guilty of\r\n    usurpation and forging documents is plain and the scandal is one\r\n    that shocks all the world.\r\n\r\n    Can it be imagined that Chang Hsun is actuated by a patriotic\r\n    motive? Surely despotism is no longer tolerated in this stage of\r\n    modern civilization. Such a scheme can only provoke universal\r\n    opposition. Five years have already passed since the friendly Powers\r\n    accorded their recognition of the Chinese Republic and if we think\r\n    we could afford to amuse ourselves with changes in the national\r\n    fabric, we could not expect foreign powers to put up with such\r\n    childishness. Internal strife is bound to invite foreign\r\n    intervention and the end of the country will then be near.\r\n\r\n    Can it be possible that Chang Hsun has acted in the interest of the\r\n    Ching House? The young boy-emperor lives in peace and contentment\r\n    and has not the slightest idea of ever ruling China again. It is\r\n    known that his tutors have been warning him of the dangers of\r\n    intriguing for power. That the boy-emperor has been dragged on the\r\n    throne entirely against his own wishes is undeniable. History tells\r\n    us that no dynasty can live for ever. It is an unprecedented\r\n    privilege for the Ching dynasty to be able to end with the gift of\r\n    special treatment. How absurd to again place the Tsing house on the\r\n    top of a high wall so that it may fall once more and disappear for\r\n    ever.\r\n\r\n    Chi-jui, after his dismissal, resolved not to participate in\r\n    political affairs, but as he has had a share, however insignificant,\r\n    in the formation of the Chinese Republic, and having served the\r\n    Republic for so long he cannot bear to see its destruction without\r\n    stretching out a helping hand. Further, he has been a recipient of\r\n    favours from the defunct dynasty, and he cannot bear to watch\r\n    unmoved, the sight of the Ching House being made the channel of\r\n    brigandage with suicidal results. Wherever duty calls, Chi-jui will\r\n    go in spite of the danger of death. You, gentlemen, are the pillars\r\n    of the Republic of China and therefore have your own duties to\r\n    perform. In face of this extraordinary crisis, our indignation must\r\n    be one. For the interest of the country we should abide by our oath\r\n    of unstinted loyalty; and for the sake of the Tsing House let us\r\n    show our sympathy by sane and wise deeds. I feel sure you will put\r\n    forth every ounce of your energy and combine your efforts to combat\r\n    the great disaster. Though I am a feeble old soldier, I will follow\r\n    you on the back of my steed.\r\n\r\n    (Sgd) TUAN CHI-JUI.\r\n\r\nFollowing the publication of this manifesto a general movement of troops\r\nbegan. On the 5th July the important Peking-Tientsin railway was\r\nreported interrupted forty miles from the capital--at Langfang which is\r\nthe station where Admiral Seymour's relief expedition in 1900 was nearly\r\nsurrounded and exterminated. Chang Hsun, made desperate by the swift\r\nanswer to his coup, had moved out of Peking in force stiffening his own\r\ntroops with numbers of Manchu soldiery, and announcing that he would\r\nfight it out to the bitter end, although this proved as false as the\r\nrest had been. The first collision occurred on the evening of the 5th\r\nJuly and was disastrous for the King-maker. The whole Northern army,\r\nwith the exception of a Manchu Division in Peking, was so rapidly\r\nconcentrated on the two main railways leading to the capital that Chang\r\nHsun's army, hopelessly outnumbered and outmanoeuvred, fell back after a\r\nbrief resistance. Chang Hsun himself was plainly stupefied by the\r\ndiscovery that imperialism of the classic type was as much out of date\r\nin the North as in the South; and within one week of his _coup_ he was\r\nprepared to surrender if his life and reputation were spared. By the 9th\r\nJuly the position was this: the Republican forces had surrounded\r\nPeking: Chang Hsun had resigned every appointment save the command of\r\nhis own troops: the Manchu Court party had drafted a fresh Edict of\r\nRenunciation, but being terrorized by the pigtailed troops surrounding\r\nthe Palace did not dare to issue it.\r\n\r\nThe usual bargaining now commenced with the Legation Quarter acting as a\r\nspecies of middleman. No one was anxious to see warfare carried into the\r\nstreets of Peking, as not only might this lead to the massacres of\r\ninnocent people, but to foreign complications as well. The novelty had\r\nalready been seen of a miniature air-raid on the Imperial city, and the\r\npanic that exploding bombs had carried into the hearts of the Manchu\r\nImperial Family made them ready not only to capitulate but to run away.\r\nThe chief point at issue was, however, not the fate of the monarchy,\r\nwhich was a dead thing, but simply what was going to happen to Chang\r\nHsun's head--a matter which was profoundly distressing Chang Hsun. The\r\nRepublican army had placed a price of £10,000 on it, and the firebrands\r\nwere advocating that the man must be captured, dead or alive, and suffer\r\ndecapitation in front of the Great Dynastic Gate of the Palace as a\r\nrevenge for his perfidy. Round this issue a subtle battle raged which\r\nwas not brought to a head until the evening of the 11th July, when all\r\nattempts at forcing Chang Hsun to surrender unconditionally having\r\nfailed, it was announced that a general attack would be made on his\r\nforces at daylight the next morning.\r\n\r\nPromptly at dawn on the 12th July a gun-signal heralded the assault.\r\nLarge Republican contingents entered the city through various Gates, and\r\na storm of firing aroused terror among the populace. The main body of\r\nChang Hsun's men, entrenched in the great walled enclosure of the Temple\r\nof Heaven, were soon surrounded, and although it would have been\r\npossible for them to hold out for several days, after a few hours'\r\nfiring a parley began and they quietly surrendered. Similarly in the\r\nImperial city, where Chang Hsun had taken up his residence, this leader,\r\nin spite of his fire-eating declarations, soon fled to the Legation\r\nQuarter and besought an asylum. His men held out until two in the\r\nafternoon, when their resistance collapsed and the cease-fire sounded.\r\nThe number of casualties on both sides was infinitesimal, and thus after\r\neleven days' farce the Manchu dynasty found itself worse off than ever\r\nbefore. It is necessary, however, not to lose sight of the main problem\r\nin China, which is the establishment of a united government and a\r\ncessation of internecine warfare,--issues which have been somewhat\r\nsimplified by Chang Hsun's escapade, but not solved. That a united\r\ngovernment will ultimately be established is the writer's belief, based\r\non a knowledge of all the facts. But to attain that further provincial\r\nstruggles are inevitable, since China is too large a unit to find common\r\nground without much suffering and bitterness. President Li Yuan-hung\r\nhaving declared that nothing would induce him to resume office,\r\nVice-President Feng Kuo-chang has become the legal successor and has\r\nquietly assumed office. Chang Hsun's abortive coup has already cleared\r\nthe air in North China to this extent: that the Manchu Imperial Family\r\nis to be removed from Peking and the Imperial allowance greatly reduced,\r\nwhilst the proscription of such out-and-out imperialists as Kang Yu-wei\r\nhas destroyed the last vestiges of public support. Finally the\r\ncompletion of China's foreign policy, _i.e._ the declaration of war\r\nagainst Germany and Austria, has at last been made on the 14th August,\r\n1917, and a consistent course of action mapped out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The National Assembly sitting as a National Convention\r\nengaged on the Draft of the Permanent Constitution.\r\n\r\n_Specially photographed by permission of the Speakers for the Present\r\nWork_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from rear of Hall of the National Assembly sitting\r\nas a National Convention engaged on the Draft of the Permanent\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n_Specially photographed by permission of the Speakers for the Present\r\nWork_.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] The final text of the Permanent Constitution as it stood on the\r\n28th May, 1917, will be found in the appendix. Its accuracy has been\r\nguaranteed to the writer by the speakers of the two Houses.\r\n\r\n[26] Since this was written certain diplomatists in Peking have been\r\nforced to resign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL PROBLEM:--REMODELLING THE POLITICO-ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP\r\nBETWEEN CHINA AND THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe careful narrative we have made--supported as it is by documents--of\r\nthe history of China since the inception of the Republic six years ago\r\nshould not fail to awaken profound astonishment among those who are\r\ninterested in the spread of good government throughout the world. Even\r\ncasual readers will have no difficulty in realizing how many lives have\r\nbeen lost and how greatly the country has been crippled both owing to\r\nthe blind foreign support given to Yuan Shih-kai during four long and\r\nweary years and to the stupid adhesion to exploded ideas, when a little\r\nintelligence and a little generosity and sympathy would have guided the\r\nnation along very different paths. To have to go back, as China was\r\nforced to do in 1916, and begin over again the work which should have\r\nbeen performed in 1912 is a handicap which only persistent resolution\r\ncan overcome; for the nation has been so greatly impoverished that years\r\nmust elapse before a complete recovery from the disorders which have\r\nupset the internal balance can be chronicled: and when we add that the\r\nevents of the period May-July, 1917, are likely still further to\r\nincrease the burden the nation carries, the complicated nature of the\r\noutlook will be readily understood.\r\n\r\nHappily foreign opinion has lately taken turn for the better. Whilst the\r\nsubstitution of a new kind of rule in place of the Yuan Shih-kai régime,\r\nwith its thinly disguised Manchuism and its secret worship of fallen\r\ngods, was at first looked upon as a political collapse tinged with\r\ntragedy--most foreigners refusing to believe in an Asiatic Republic--the\r\nmasculine decision of the 9th February, 1917, which diplomatically\r\nranged China definitely on the side of the Liberal Powers, has caused\r\nsomething of a _volte face_. Until this decision had been made it was\r\nthe fashion to declare that China was not only not fit to be a Republic\r\nbut that her final dissolution was only a matter of time. Though the\r\nempire disappeared because it had become an impossible rule in the\r\nmodern world--being womanish, corrupt, and mediaeval--to the foreign\r\nmind the empire remained the acme of Chinese civilization; and to kill\r\nit meant to lop off the head of the Chinese giant and to leave lying on\r\nthe ground nothing but a corpse. It was in vain to insist that this\r\nsimile was wrong and that it was precisely because Chinese civilization\r\nhad exhausted itself that a new conception of government had to be\r\ncalled in to renew the vitality of the people. Men, and particularly\r\ndiplomats, refused to understand that this embodied the heart and soul\r\nof the controversy, and that the sole mandate for the Republic, as well\r\nas the supreme reason why it had to be upheld if the country was not to\r\ndissolve, has always lain in the fact that it postulates something which\r\nis the very antithesis of the system it has replaced and which should be\r\nwholly successful in a single generation, if courage is shown and the\r\nwhip unflinchingly used.\r\n\r\nThe chief trouble, in the opinion of the writer, has been the simplicity\r\nof the problem and not its complexity. By eliminating the glamour which\r\nsurrounded the Throne, and by kicking away all the pomp and circumstance\r\nwhich formed the age-old ritual of government, the glaring simplicity\r\nand _barrenness_ of Chinese life--when contrasted with the complex\r\nWest--has been made evident. Bathed in the hard light of modern\r\nrealities, the poetic China which Haroun al-Raschid painted in his\r\nAladdin, and which still lives in the beautiful art of the country, has\r\nvanished for ever and its place has been taken by a China of prose. To\r\nthose who have always pictured Asia in terms of poetry this has no doubt\r\nbeen a very terrible thing--a thing synonymous with political death. And\r\nyet in point of fact the elementary things remain much as they have\r\nalways been before, and if they appear to have acquired new meaning it\r\nis simply because they have been moved into the foreground and are no\r\nlonger masked by a gaudy superstructure.\r\n\r\nFor if you eliminate questions of money and suppose for a moment that\r\nthe national balance-sheet is entirely in order, China is the old China\r\nalthough she is stirred by new ideas. Here you have by far the greatest\r\nagricultural community in the world, living just as it has always lived\r\nin the simplest possible manner, and remitting to the cities (of which\r\nthere are not ten with half-a-million inhabitants) the increment which\r\nthe harvests yield. These cities have made much municipal progress and\r\ndeveloped an independence which is confessedly new. Printing presses\r\nhave spread a noisy assertiveness, as well as a very critical and\r\nlitigious spirit, which tends to resent and oppose authority.[27] Trade,\r\nalthough constantly proclaimed to be in a bad way, is steadily growing\r\nas new wants are created and fashions change. An immense amount of new\r\nbuilding has been done, particularly in those regions which the\r\nRevolution of 1911 most devastated. The archaic fiscal system, having\r\nbeen tumbled into open ruin, has been partially replaced by European\r\nconceptions which are still only half-understood, but which are not\r\nreally opposed. The country, although boasting a population which is\r\nonly some fifty millions less than the population of the nineteen\r\ncountries of Europe, has an army and a police-force so small as to allow\r\none to say that China is virtually disarmed since there are only 900,000\r\nmen with weapons in their hands. Casting about to discover what really\r\ntinges the outlook, that must simply be held to be the long delay the\r\nworld has made in extending the same treatment to China as is now\r\ngranted to the meanest community of Latin America. It has been almost\r\nentirely this, coupled with the ever-present threat of Japanese\r\nchauvinism, which has given China the appearance of a land that is\r\nhopelessly water-logged, although the National Debt is relatively the\r\nsmallest in the world and the people the most industrious and\r\nlaw-abiding who have ever lived. In such circumstances that ideas of\r\ncollapse should have spread so far is simply due to a faulty estimate\r\nof basic considerations.\r\n\r\nFor we have to remember that in a country in which the thoroughly\r\nEnglish doctrine of _laissez faire_ has been so long practised that it\r\nhas become second nature, and in which the philosophic spirit is so\r\nundisputed that the pillars of society are just as much the beggars who\r\nbeg as the rich men who support them, influences of a peculiar character\r\nplay an immense rôle and can be only very slowly overcome. Passivity has\r\nbeen so long enthroned that of the Chinese it may be truly said that\r\nthey are not so much too proud to fight as too indifferent,--which is\r\nnot a fruitful state of affairs. Looking on the world with callous\r\ndetachment the masses go their own way, only pausing in their work on\r\ntheir ancient Festival days which they still celebrate just as they have\r\nalways celebrated them since the beginning of their history. The petty\r\ndaily activities of a vast legion of people grouped together in this\r\nextraordinary way, and actuated by impulses which seem sharply to\r\nconflict with the impulses of the other great races of the world, appear\r\nincredible to Westerners who know what the outer perils really are, and\r\nwho believe that China is not only at bay but encircled--caught in a\r\nnetwork of political agreements and commitments which have permanently\r\ndestroyed her power of initiative and reduced her to inanition. To find\r\nher lumbering on undisturbed, ploughing the fields, marrying and giving\r\nin marriage, buying, selling, cursing and laughing, carrying out\r\nrebellions and little plots as though the centuries that stretch ahead\r\nwere still her willing slaves, has in the end become to onlookers a\r\nveritable nightmare. Puzzled by a phenomenon which is so disconcerting\r\nas to be incapable of any clear definition, they have ended by declaring\r\nthat an empty Treasury is an empty rule, adding that as it is solely\r\nfrom this monetary viewpoint that the New China ought to be judged,\r\ntheir opinion is the one which will finally be accepted as\r\nauthoritative. The situation is admittedly dangerous; and it is\r\nimperative that a speedy remedy be sought; for the heirs and assigns of\r\nan estate which has been mismanaged to the brink of bankruptcy must\r\nsecure at all costs that no public receivership is made.\r\n\r\nWhat is the remedy? That must consist simply enough in attacking the\r\ngrand simplicities directly; in recognizing, as we have clearly shown,\r\nthat the bases of Chinese life having collapsed through Euro-Japanese\r\npressure, the politico-economic relationship between the Republic and\r\nthe world must be remodelled at the earliest possible opportunity, every\r\nagreement which has been made since the Treaties of 1860 being carefully\r\nand completely revised.[28]\r\n\r\nTo say this is to give utterance to nothing very new or brilliant: it is\r\nthe thought which has been present in everyone's mind for a number of\r\nyears. So far back as 1902, when Great Britain negotiated with China the\r\ninoperative Mackay Commercial Treaty, provision was not only made for a\r\ncomplete reform of the Tariff--import duties to be made two and a\r\nhalf times as large in return for a complete abolition of _likin_\r\nor inter-provincial trade-taxation--but for the abolition of\r\nextraterritoriality when China should have erected a modern and efficient\r\njudicial system. And although matters equally important, such as the\r\nfunding of all Chinese indemnities and loans into one Consolidated Debt,\r\nas well as the withdrawal of the right of foreign banks to make banknote\r\nissues in China, were not touched upon, the same principles would\r\nundoubtedly have been applied in these instances, as being conducive to\r\nthe re-establishment of Chinese autonomy, had Chinese negotiators been\r\nclever enough to urge them as being of equal importance to the older\r\nissues. For it is primarily debt, and the manipulation of debt, which is\r\nthe great enemy.\r\n\r\nThree groups of indebtedness and three groups of restrictions,\r\ncorresponding with the three vital periods in Chinese history, lie\r\nto-day like three great weights on the body of the Chinese giant. First,\r\nthere is the imbroglio of the Japanese war of 1894-5; second, the\r\nsettlement following the Boxer explosion of 1900; and third, the cost of\r\nthe revolution of 1911-1912. We have already discussed so exhaustively\r\nthe Boxer Settlement and the finance of the Revolutionary period that it\r\nis necessary to deal with the first period only.\r\n\r\nIn that first period China, having been rudely handled by Japan,\r\nrecovered herself only by indulging in the sort of diplomacy which had\r\nbecome traditional under the Manchus. Thankful for any help in her\r\ndistress, she invited and welcomed the intervention of Russia, which\r\ngave her back the Liaotung Peninsula and preserved for her the shadow of\r\nher power when the substance had already been so sensationally lost. Men\r\nare apt to forget to-day that the financial accommodation which allowed\r\nChina to liquidate the Japanese war-debt was a remarkable transaction in\r\nwhich Russia formed the controlling element. In 1895 the Tsar's\r\nGovernment had intervened for precisely the same motives that animate\r\nevery State at critical times in history, that is, for reasons of\r\nself-interest. The rapid victory which Japan had won had revived in an\r\nacute form the whole question of the future of the vast block of\r\nterritory which lies south of the Amur regions and is bathed by the\r\nYellow Sea. Russian statesmen suddenly became conscious that the policy\r\nof which Muravieff-Amurski in the middle of the nineteenth century had\r\nbeen the most brilliant exponent--the policy of reaching \"warm\r\nwater\"--was in danger of being crucified, and the work of many years\r\nthrown away. Action on Russia's part was imperative; she was great\r\nenough to see that; and so that it should not be said that she was\r\nmerely depriving a gallant nation of the fruits of victory and thereby\r\nissuing to her a direct challenge, she invited the chief Powers in\r\nTreaty relations with China to co-operate with her in readjusting what\r\nshe described as the threatened balance. France and Germany responded to\r\nthat invitation; England demurred. France did so because she was already\r\nthe devoted Ally of a nation that was a guarantee for the security of\r\nher European frontiers: Germany because she was anxious to see that\r\nRussia should be pushed into Asiatic commitments and drawn away from the\r\nproblems of the Near East. England on her part very prudently declined\r\nto be associated with a transaction which, while not opposed to her\r\ninterests, was filled with many dubious elements.\r\n\r\nIt was in Petrograd that this account was liquidated. The extraordinary\r\nchapter which only closed with the disastrous Peace of Portsmouth opened\r\nfor Russia in a very brilliant way. The presence in Moscow of the\r\nveteran statesman Li Hung-chang on the occasion of the Tsar's Coronation\r\nafforded an opportunity for exhaustively discussing the whole problem of\r\nthe Far East. China required money: Russia required the acceptance of\r\nplans which ultimately proved so disastrous to her. Under Article IV of\r\nthe Treaty of Shimonoseki (April, 1895) China had agreed to pay Japan as\r\na war-indemnity 200 million Treasury taels in eight instalments: that is\r\n50 million taels within six months, a further 50 millions within twelve\r\nmonths, and the remaining 100 millions in six equal instalments spread\r\nover seven years, as well as an additional sum of 50 millions for the\r\nretrocession of the Liaotung Peninsula.\r\n\r\nChina, therefore, needed at once 80 million taels. Russia undertook to\r\nlend her at the phenomenally low rate of 4 per cent. the sum of\r\n£16,000,000 sterling--the interest and capital of which the Tsar's\r\nGovernment guaranteed to the French bankers undertaking the flotation.\r\nIn return for this accommodation, the well known Russo-Chinese\r\nDeclaration of the 24th June (6th July), 1895, was made in which the\r\nvital article IX states that--\"In consideration of this Loan the Chinese\r\nGovernment declares that it will not grant to any foreign Power any\r\nright or privilege of no matter what description touching the control or\r\nadministration of the revenues of the Chinese Empire. Should, however,\r\nthe Chinese Government grant to any foreign Power rights of this nature,\r\nit is understood that the mere fact of having done so will extend those\r\nrights to the Russian Government.\"\r\n\r\nThis clause has a monumental significance: it started the scramble in\r\nChina: and all the history of the past 22 years is piled like a pyramid\r\non top of it. Now that the Romanoffs have been hurled from the throne,\r\nRussia must prove eager to reverse the policy which brought Japan to her\r\nSiberian frontiers and which pinned a brother democracy to the ground.\r\n\r\nFor China, instead of being nearly bankrupt as so many have asserted,\r\nhas, thanks to the new scale of indebtedness which the war has\r\nestablished, become one of the most debt-free countries in the world,\r\nher entire national debt (exclusive of railway debt) amounting to less\r\nthan 150 millions sterling, or seven shillings per head of population,\r\nwhich is certainly not very terrible. No student who has given due\r\nattention to the question can deny that it is primarily on the proper\r\nhandling of this nexus of financial interests, and not by establishing\r\nany artificial balance of power between foreign nations, that the peace\r\nof the Far East really hinges. The method of securing national\r\nredemption is ready-made: Western nations should use the Parliament of\r\nChina as an instrument of reform, and by limiting themselves to this one\r\nmethod secure that civil authority is reinforced to such a point that\r\nits behests have behind them all the wealth of the West. In questions of\r\ncurrency, taxation, railways and every other vexatious problem, it is\r\nsolely by using this instrument that satisfactory results can be\r\nattained.[29] For once Chinese realize that parliamentary government is\r\nnot merely an experimental thing but the last chance the country is to\r\nbe given to govern itself, they will rally to the call and prove that\r\nmuch of the trouble and turmoil of past years has been due to the\r\nmisunderstanding of the internal problem by Western minds which has\r\nincited the population to intrigue against one another and remain\r\ndisunited. And if we insist that there is urgent need for a settlement\r\nof these matters in the terms we have indicated, it is because we know\r\nvery precisely what Japanese thought on this subject really is.\r\n\r\nWhat is that thought--whither does it lead?\r\n\r\nIt may be broadly said that Japanese activities throughout the Far East\r\nare based on a thorough and adequate appreciation of the fact that apart\r\nfrom the winning of the hegemony of China, there is the far more\r\ndifficult and knotty problem of overshadowing and ultimately dislodging\r\nthe huge network of foreign interests--particularly British\r\ninterests--which seventy-five years of Treaty intercourse have entwined\r\nabout the country. These interests, growing out of the seed planted in\r\nthe early Canton Factory days, had their origin in the termination by\r\nthe act of the British Government of the trading monopoly enjoyed until\r\nthe thirties of last century by the East India Company. Left without\r\nproper definition until the Treaty of Nanking in 1842 had formally won\r\nthe principle of trading-rights at five open ports, and thus established\r\na first basis of agreement between England and China (to which all the\r\ntrading powers hastened to subscribe), these interests expanded in a\r\nhalf-hearted way until 1860, when in order to terminate friction, the\r\nprinciple of extraterritoriality was boldly borrowed from the Turkish\r\nCapitulations, and made the rock on which the entire fabric of\r\ninternational dealings in China was based. These treaties, with their\r\nalways-recurring \"most-favoured nation\" clause, and their implication of\r\nequal treatment for all Powers alike, constitute the Public Law of the\r\nFar East, just as much as the Treaties between the Nations constitute\r\nthe Public Law of Europe; and any attempt to destroy, cripple, or limit\r\ntheir scope and function has been very generally deemed an assault on\r\nall the High Contracting Parties alike. By a thoroughly Machiavellian\r\npiece of reasoning, those who have been responsible for the framing of\r\nrecent Japanese policy, have held it essential to their plan to keep the\r\nworld chained to the principle of extraterritoriality and Chinese Tariff\r\nand economic subjection because these things, imposing as they\r\nnecessarily do restrictions and limitations in many fields, leave it\r\nfree to the Japanese to place themselves outside and beyond these\r\nrestrictions and limitations; and, by means of special zones and secret\r\nencroachments, to extend their influence so widely that ultimately\r\nforeign treaty-ports and foreign interests may be left isolated and at\r\nthe mercy of the \"Higher machinery\" which their hegemony is installing.\r\nThe Chinese themselves, it is hoped, will be gradually cajoled into\r\nacquiescing in this very extraordinary state of affairs, because being\r\nunorganized and split into suspicious groups, they can be manipulated in\r\nsuch a way as to offer no effective mass resistance to the Japanese\r\nadvance, and in the end may be induced to accept it as inevitable.\r\n\r\nIf the reader keeps these great facts carefully in mind a new light will\r\ndawn on him and the urgency of the Chinese question will be disclosed.\r\nThe Japanese Demands of 1915, instead of being fantastic and\r\nfar-fetched, as many have supposed, are shown to be very intelligently\r\ndrawn-up, the entire Treaty position in China having been most\r\nexhaustively studied, and every loophole into the vast region left\r\nuntouched by the ex-territorialized Powers marked down for invasion. For\r\nWestern nations, in spite of exorbitant demands at certain periods in\r\nChinese history, having mainly limited themselves to acquiring coastal\r\nand communication privileges, which were desired more for genuine\r\npurposes of trade than for encompassing the destruction of Chinese\r\nautonomy, are to-day in a disadvantageous position which the Japanese\r\nhave shown they thoroughly understand by not only tightening their hold\r\non Manchuria and Shantung, but by going straight to the root of the\r\nmatter and declaring on every possible occasion that they alone are\r\nresponsible for the peace and safety of the Far East--and this in spite\r\nof the fact that their plan of 1915 was exposed and partially\r\nfrustrated. But the chief force behind the Japanese Foreign Office, it\r\nshould be noted, is militarist; and it is a point of honour for the\r\nMilitary Party to return to the charge in China again and again until\r\nthere is definite success or definite failure.\r\n\r\nNow in view of the facts which have been so voluminously set forth in\r\npreceding chapters, it is imperative for men to realize that the\r\nstruggle in the Far East is like the Balkan Question a thing rooted in\r\ngeography and peoples, and cannot be brushed aside or settled by\r\ncompromises. The whole future of Chinese civilization is intimately\r\nbound up with the questions involved, and the problem instead of\r\nbecoming easier to handle must become essentially more difficult from\r\nday to day. Japan's real objective being the termination of the implied\r\ntrusteeship which Europe and America still exercise in the Far East, the\r\ncourse of the European war must intimately effect the ultimate outcome.\r\nIf that end is satisfactory for democracies, China may reasonably claim\r\nto share in the resulting benefits; if on the other hand the Liberal\r\nPowers do not win an overwhelming victory which shall secure the\r\nsanctity of Treaties for all time, it will go hard for China. Outwardly,\r\nthe immediate goal which Japan seeks to attain is merely to become the\r\naccredited spokesman of Eastern Asia, the official representative; and,\r\nusing this attorneyship as a cloak for the advancement of objects which\r\nother Powers would pursue on different principles, so impregnably to\r\nentrench herself where she has no business to be that no one will dare\r\nto attempt to turn her out. For this reason we see revived in Manchuria\r\non a modified scale the Eighteenth Century device, once so essential a\r\nfeature of Dutch policy in the struggle against Louis XIV, namely the\r\ncreation of \"barrier-cities\" for closing and securing a frontier by\r\ngiving them a special constitution which withdraws them from ordinary\r\njurisdiction and places foreign garrisons in them. This is precisely\r\nwhat is going on from the Yalu to Eastern Mongolia, and this procedure\r\nno doubt will be extended in time to other regions as opportunities\r\narise. Already in Shantung the same policy is being pursued and there\r\nare indications that it is being thought of in Fuhkien; whilst the\r\ninfantry garrison which was quietly installed at Hankow--600 miles up\r\nthe Yangtsze river--at the time of the Revolution of 1911 is apparently\r\nto be made permanent. Allowing her policy to be swayed by men who know\r\nfar too little of the sea, Japan stands in imminent danger of forgetting\r\nthe great lesson which Mahan taught, that for island-peoples sea-power\r\nis everything and that land conquests which diminish the efficacy of\r\nthat power are merely a delusion and snare. Plunging farther and farther\r\ninto the vast regions of Manchuria and Mongolia which have been the\r\ngraves of a dozen dynasties, Japan is displaying increasing indifference\r\nfor the one great lesson which the war has yielded--the overwhelming\r\nimportance of the sea.[30] Necessarily guardian of the principles on\r\nwhich intercourse in Asia is based, because she framed those principles\r\nand fought for them and has built up great edifices under their\r\nsanction, British sea-power--now allied for ever, let us hope, with\r\nAmerican power--nevertheless remains and will continue to remain, in\r\nspite of what may be half-surreptitiously done to-day, the dominant\r\nfactor in the Far East as it is in the Far West. Withdrawn from view for\r\nthe time being, because of the exigencies of the hour and because the\r\nAnglo-Japanese Alliance is still counted a binding agreement, Western\r\nsea-power nevertheless stands there, a heavy cloud in the offing, full\r\nof questionings regarding what is going on in the Orient, and fully\r\ndetermined, let us pray, one day to receive frank answers. For the right\r\nof every race, no matter how small or weak, to enjoy the inestimable\r\nbenefits of self-government and independence may be held to have been so\r\nabsolutely established that it is a mere question of time for the\r\ndoctrine not only to be universally accepted but to be universally\r\napplied. In many cases, it is true, the claims of certain races are as\r\nyet incapable of being expressed in practical state-forms; but where\r\nnationalities have long been well-defined, there can be no question\r\nwhatsoever that a properly articulated autonomy must be secured in such\r\na way as to preclude the possibility of annexations.\r\n\r\nNow although in their consideration of Asia it is notorious that Western\r\nstatesmen have not cared to keep in mind political concepts which have\r\nbecome enthroned in Europe, owing to the fact that an active element of\r\nopposition to such concepts was to be found in their own policies, a\r\nvast change has undoubtedly been recently worked, making it certain\r\nthat the claims of nationalism are soon to be given the same force and\r\nvalue in the East as in the West. But before there can be any question\r\nof Asia for the Asiatics being adopted as a root principle by the whole\r\nworld, it will have to be established in some unmistakable form that the\r\nsurrender of the policy of conquest which Europe has pursued for four\r\ncenturies East of the Suez Canal will not lead to its adoption by an\r\nAsiatic Power under specious forms which hide the glittering sword. If\r\nthat can be secured, then the present conflict will have truly been a\r\nWar of Liberation for the East as well as for the West. For although\r\nJapan has been engaged for some years in declaring to all Asiatics under\r\nher breath that she holds out the hand of a brother to them, and dreams\r\nof the days when the age of European conquests will be nothing but a\r\ndistant memory, her actions have consistently belied her words and shown\r\nthat she has not progressed in political thought much beyond the crude\r\nconceptions of the Eighteenth Century. Thus Korea, which fell under her\r\nsway because the nominal independence of the country had long made it\r\nthe centre of disastrous international intrigues, is governed to-day as\r\na conquered province by a military viceroy without a trace of autonomy\r\nremaining and without any promise that such a régime is only temporary.\r\nAlthough nothing in the undertakings made with the Powers has ever\r\nadmitted that a nation which boasts of an ancient line of kings, and\r\nwhich gave Japan much of her own civilization, should be stamped under\r\nfoot in such manner, the course which politics have taken in Korea has\r\nbeen disastrous in the extreme ever since Lord Lansdowne in 1905, as\r\nBritish Secretary for Foreign Affairs, pointed out in a careful dispatch\r\nto the Russian Government that Korea was a region which fell naturally\r\nunder the sway of Japan. Not only has a tragic fate overcome the sixteen\r\nmillion inhabitants of that country, but there has been a covert\r\nextension of the principles applied to them to the people of China.\r\n\r\nNow if as we say European concepts are to have universal meaning, and if\r\nJapan desires European treatment, it is time that it is realized that\r\nthe policy followed in Korea, combined with the attempt to extend that\r\ntreatment to soil where China rightly claims undisputed sovereignty,\r\nforms an insuperable barrier to Japan being admitted to the inner\r\ncouncil of the nations.[31] No one wishes to deny to Japan her proper\r\nplace in the world, in view of her marvellous industrial progress, but\r\nthat place must be one which fits in with modern conceptions and is not\r\none thing to the West and another to the East. Even the saying which was\r\nmade so much of during the Russian war of 1904, that Korea in foreign\r\nhands was a dagger pointed at the heart of Japan--has been shown to be\r\ninherently false by the lessons of the present struggle, the Korean\r\ndagger-point being 120 sea miles from the Japanese coast. Such arguments\r\nclearly show that if the truce which was hastily patched up in 1905 is\r\nto give way to a permanent peace, that can be evolved only by locking on\r\nto the Far East the principles which are in process of being vindicated\r\nin Europe. In other words, precisely as Poland is to be given autonomy,\r\nso must Korea enjoy the same privileges, the whole Japanese theory of\r\nsuzerainty on the Eastern Asiatic Continent being abandoned. To\r\nre-establish a proper balance of power in the Far East, the Korean\r\nnation, which has had a known historical existence of 1,500 years, must\r\nbe reinstated in something resembling its old position; for Korea has\r\nalways been the keystone of the Far Eastern arch, and it is the\r\ndestruction of that arch more than anything else which has brought the\r\ncollapse of China so perilously near.\r\n\r\nOnce the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people have been\r\nsatisfied, the whole Manchurian-Mongolian question will assume a\r\ndifferent aspect, and a true peace between China and Japan will be made\r\npossible. It is to no one's interest to have a Polish question in the\r\nFar East with all the bitterness and the crimes which such a question\r\nmust inevitably lead to; and the time to obviate the creation of such a\r\nquestion is at the very beginning before it has become an obsession and\r\na great international issue. Although the Japanese annexation may be\r\nheld to have settled the question once and for all, we have but to point\r\nto Poland to show that a race can pass through every possible\r\nhumiliation and endure every possible species of truncation without\r\ndying or abating by one whit its determination to enjoy what happier\r\nraces have won.\r\n\r\nThe issue is a vital one. China by her recent acts has given a\r\ncategorical and unmistakable reply to all the insidious attempts to\r\nplace her outside and beyond the operation of international law and all\r\nthose sanctions which make life worth living; and because of the formal\r\nbirth of a Foreign Policy it can be definitely expected that this\r\nnation, despite its internal troubles and struggles, will never rest\r\ncontent until she has created a new nexus of world-relationships which\r\nshall affirm and apply every one of the principles experience elsewhere\r\nhas proved are the absolute essentials to peace and happiness. China is\r\nalready many decades ahead of Japan in her theory of government, no\r\nmatter what the practice may be, the marvellous revolution of 1911\r\nhaving given back to this ancient race its old position of leader in\r\nideas on the shores of the Yellow Sea. The whole dream Japan has\r\ncherished, and has sought to give form to during the war, is in the last\r\nanalysis antiquated and forlorn and must ultimately dissolve into thin\r\nair; for it is monstrous to suppose, in an age when European men have\r\nsacrificed everything to free themselves from the last vestiges of\r\nfeudalism, that in the Far East the cult of Sparta should remain a\r\nhallowed and respected doctrine. Japan's policy in the Far East during\r\nthe period of the war has been uniformly mischievous and is largely\r\nresponsible for the fierce hatreds which burst out in 1917 over the war\r\nissue; and China will be forced to raise at the earliest possible moment\r\nthe whole question of the validity of the undertakings extorted from her\r\nin 1915 under the threat of an ultimatum. Although the precise nature\r\nof Anglo-Japanese diplomacy during the vital eleven days from the 4th to\r\nthe 15th August, 1914 [_i.e._ from the British declaration of war on\r\nGermany to the Japanese ultimatum regarding Kiaochow] remains a sealed\r\nbook, China suspects that Japan from the very beginning of the present\r\nwar world-struggle has taken advantage of England's vast commitments and\r\nacted _ultra vires_. China hopes and believes that Britain will never\r\nagain renew the Japanese alliance, which expires in 1921, in its present\r\nform, particularly now that an Anglo-American agreement has been made\r\npossible. China knows that in spite of all coquetting with both the\r\nextreme radical and military parties which is going on daily in Peking\r\nand the provinces the secret object of Japanese diplomacy is either the\r\nrestoration of the Manchu dynasty, or the enthronement of some pliant\r\nusurper, a puppet-Emperor being what is needed to repeat in China the\r\nhistory of Korea. Japan would be willing to go to any lengths to secure\r\nthe attainment of this reactionary object. Faithful to her \"divine\r\nmission,\" she is ceaselessly stirring up trouble and hoping that time\r\nmay still be left her to consolidate her position on the Asiatic\r\nmainland, one of her latest methods being to busy herself at distant\r\npoints in the Pacific so that Western men for the sake of peace may be\r\nultimately willing to abandon the shores of the Yellow Seas to her\r\nunchallenged mastery.\r\n\r\nThe problem thus outlined becomes a great dramatic thing. The lines\r\nwhich trace the problem are immense, stretching from China to every\r\nshore bathed by the Pacific and then from there to the distant west.\r\nWhenever there is a dull calm, that calm must be treated solely as an\r\nintermission, an interval between the acts, a preparation for something\r\nmore sensational than the last episode, but not as a permanent\r\nsettlement which can only come by the methods we have indicated. For the\r\nChinese question is no longer a local problem, but a great world-issue\r\nwhich statesmen must regulate by conferences in which universal\r\nprinciples will be vindicated if they wish permanently to eliminate what\r\nis almost the last remaining international powder-magazine. A China that\r\nis henceforth not only admitted to the family of nations on terms of\r\nequality but welcomed as a representative of Liberalism and a subscriber\r\nto all those sanctions on which the civilization of peace rests, will\r\ndirectly tend to adjust every other Asiatic problem and to prevent a\r\nrecrudescence of those evil phenomena which are the enemies of progress\r\nand happiness. Is it too much to dream of such a consummation? We think\r\nnot. It is to America and to England that China looks to rehabilitate\r\nherself and to make her Republic a reality. If they lend her their help,\r\nif they are consistent, there is still no reason why this democracy on\r\nthe shores of the Yellow Sea should not be reinstated in the proud\r\nposition it occupied twenty centuries ago, when it furnished the very\r\nsilks which clothed the daughters of the Caesars.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] The growth of the Chinese press is remarkable. Although no complete\r\nstatistics are available there is reason to believe that the number of\r\nperiodicals in China now approximates 10,000, the daily vernacular\r\nnewspapers in Peking alone exceeding 60. Although no newspaper in China\r\nprints more than 20,000 copies a day, the reading public is growing at a\r\nphenomenal rate, it being estimated that at least 50 million people read\r\nthe daily publications, or hear what they say,--a fact which is deemed\r\nso politically important that all political parties and groups have\r\ntheir chains of organs throughout the country.\r\n\r\n[28] The mediaeval condition of Chinese trade taxation is well\r\nillustrated by a Memorandum which the reader will find in the appendix.\r\nOne example may be quoted. Timber shipped from the Yalu river, _i.e._\r\nfrom Chinese territory, to Peking, pays duties at _five_ different\r\nplaces, the total amount of which aggregates 20 per cent. of its market\r\nvalue; whilst timber from America, with transit dues and Peking Octroi\r\nadded, only pays 10 per cent.! China is probably the only country that\r\nhas ever existed that discriminates against its own goods and gives\r\npreference to the foreigner,--through the operation of the Treaties.\r\n\r\n[29] We need only give a single example of what we mean. If, in the\r\nmatter of the reform of the currency, instead of authorizing\r\ntrade-agencies, _i.e._ the foreign Exchange Banks, to make a loan to\r\nChina, which is necessarily hedged round with conditions favourable to\r\nsuch trade-agencies, the Powers took the matter directly in their own\r\nhands; and selecting the Bank of China--the national fiscal agent--as\r\nthe instrument of reform agreed to advance all the sums necessary,\r\n_provided_ a Banking Law was passed by the Parliament of China of a\r\nsatisfying nature, and the necessary guarantees were forthcoming, it\r\nwould soon be possible to have a uniform National Currency which would\r\nbe everywhere accepted and lead to a phenomenal trade expansion. It\r\nshould be noted that China is still on a Copper Standard basis,--the\r\npeople's buying and selling being conducted in multiples of copper\r\ncent-pieces of which there has been an immense over-issue, the latest\r\nfigures showing that there are no less than 22,000,000,000 1-cent, ten\r\ncash pieces in circulation or 62 coins per head of population--roughly\r\ntwenty-five millions sterling in value,--or 160,000 tons of copper! The\r\nnumber of silver dollars and subsidiary silver coins is not accurately\r\nknown,--nor is the value of the silver bullion; but it certainly cannot\r\ngreatly exceed this sum. In addition there is about £15,000,000 of paper\r\nmoney. A comprehensive scheme of reform, placed in the hands of the Bank\r\nof China, would require at least £15,000,000; but this sum would be\r\nsufficient to modernize the currency and establish a universal silver\r\ndollar standard.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of China requires at least 600 branches throughout the country\r\nto become a true fiscal agent. It has to-day one-tenth of this number.\r\n\r\n[30] It should be carefully noted that not only has Japan no unfriendly\r\nfeelings for Germany but that German Professors have been appointed to\r\noffice during the war. In the matter of enemy trading Japan's policy has\r\nbeen even more extraordinary. Until there was a popular outcry among the\r\nEntente Allies, German merchants were allowed to trade more or less as\r\nusual. They were not denied the use of Japanese steamers, shipping\r\ncompanies being simply \"advised\" not to deal with them, the two German\r\nbanks in Yokohama and Kobe being closed only in the Autumn of 1916. It\r\nwas not until April, 1917, that Enemy Trading Regulations were formally\r\npromulgated and enforced,--that is when the war was very far\r\nadvanced--the action of China against Germany being no doubt largely\r\nresponsible for this step.\r\n\r\nThat the Japanese nation greatly admires the German system of government\r\nand is in the main indifferent to the results of the war has long been\r\nevident to observers on the spot.\r\n\r\n[31] A very remarkable confirmation of these statements is afforded in\r\nthe latest Japanese decision regarding Manchuria which will be\r\nimmediately enforced. The experience of the past three years having\r\nproved conclusively that the Chinese, in spite of their internal strife,\r\nare united to a man in their determination to prevent Japan from\r\ntightening her hold on Manchuria and instituting an open Protectorate,\r\nthe Tokio Government has now drawn up a subtle scheme which it is\r\nbelieved will be effective. A Bill for the unification of administration\r\nin South Manchuria has passed the Japanese Cabinet Conference and will\r\nsoon be formally promulgated. Under the provisions of this Bill, the\r\nManchuria Railway Company will become the actual organ of Japanese\r\nadministration in South Manchuria; the Japanese Consular Service will be\r\nsubordinate to the administration of the Railway; and all the powers\r\nhitherto vested in the Consular Service, political, commercial, judicial\r\nand administrative, will be made part of the organization of the South\r\nManchuria Railway. This is not all. From another Japanese source we\r\nlearn that a law is about to take effect by which the administration of\r\nthe South Manchuria Railway will be transferred directly to the control\r\nof the Government-General of Korea, thus making the Railway at once an\r\napparently commercial but really political organization. In future the\r\nrevenues of the South Manchuria Railway are to be paid direct to the\r\nGovernment-General of Korea; and the yearly appropriation for the upkeep\r\nand administration of the Railway is to be fixed at Yen 12,000,000.\r\nThese arrangements, especially the amalgamation of the South Manchuria\r\nRailway, are to take effect from the 1st July, 1917, and are an attempt\r\nto do in the dark what Japan dares not yet attempt in the open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS IN GROUP I\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) The so-called Nineteen Articles, being the grant made by the Throne\r\nafter the outbreak of the Wuchang Rebellion in 1911 in a vain attempt to\r\nsatisfy the nation.\r\n\r\n(2) The Abdication Edicts issued on the 12th February, 1912, endorsing\r\nthe establishment of the Republic.\r\n\r\n(3) The terms of abdication, generally referred to as \"The articles of\r\nFavourable Treatment,\" in which special provision is made for the\r\n\"rights\" of Manchus, Mongols, Mohammedans and Tibetans, who are\r\nconsidered as being outside the Chinese nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINETEEN ARTICLES\r\n\r\n1.

Yuan\r\nShih-kai was, therefore, especially commanded some time ago to dispatch\r\ncommissioners to confer with the representatives of the Republican Army\r\non the general situation and to discuss matters pertaining to the\r\nconvening of a National Assembly for the decision of the suitable mode\r\nof settlement. Separated as the South and the North are by great\r\ndistances, the unwillingness of either side to yield to the other can\r\nresult only in the continued interruption of trade and the prolongation\r\nof hostilities, for, so long as the form of government is undecided, the\r\nNation can have no peace. It is now evident that the hearts of the\r\nmajority of the people are in favour of a republican form of government:\r\nthe provinces of the South were the first to espouse the cause, and the\r\ngenerals of the North have since pledged their support. From the\r\npreference of the people's hearts, the Will of Heaven can be discerned.\r\nHow could We then bear to oppose the will of the millions for the glory\r\nof one Family! Therefore, observing the tendencies of the age on the one\r\nhand and studying the opinions of the people on the other, We and His\r\nMajesty the Emperor hereby vest the sovereignty in the People and decide\r\nin favour of a republican form of constitutional government. Thus we\r\nwould gratify on the one hand the desires of the whole nation who, tired\r\nof anarchy, are desirous of peace, and on the other hand would follow in\r\nthe footsteps of the Ancient Sages, who regarded the Throne as the\r\nsacred trust of the Nation.\r\n\r\nNow Yuan Shih-kai was elected by the Tucheng-yuan to be the Premier.\r\nDuring this period of transference of government from the old to the\r\nnew, there should be some means of uniting the South and the North. Let\r\nYuan Shih-kai organize with full powers a provisional republican\r\ngovernment and confer with the Republican Army as to the methods of\r\nunion, thus assuring peace to the people and tranquillity to the Empire,\r\nand forming the one Great Republic of China by the union as heretofore,\r\nof the five peoples, namely, Manchus, Chinese, Mongols, Mohammedans, and\r\nTibetans together with their territory in its integrity. We and His\r\nMajesty the Emperor, thus enabled to live in retirement, free from\r\nresponsibilities, and cares and passing the time in ease and comfort,\r\nshall enjoy without interruption the courteous treatment of the Nation\r\nand see with Our own eyes the consummation of an illustrious government.\r\nIs not this highly advisable?\r\n\r\nBearing the Imperial Seal and Signed by\r\n  Yuan Shih-kai, the Premier;\r\n  Hoo Wei-teh, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs;\r\n  Chao Ping-chun, Minister of the Interior;\r\n  Tan Hsuen-heng, Acting Minister of Navy;\r\n  Hsi Yen, Acting Minister of Agriculture, Works and Commerce;\r\n  Liang Shih-yi, Acting Minister of Communications;\r\n  Ta Shou, Acting Minister of the Dependencies.\r\n\r\n25th day of the 12th moon of the 3rd year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWe have respectfully received the following Imperial Edict from Her\r\nImperial Majesty the Empress Dowager Lung Yu:--\r\n\r\nOn account of the perilous situation of the State and the intense\r\nsufferings of the people, We some time ago commanded the Cabinet to\r\nnegotiate with the Republican Army the terms for the courteous treatment\r\nof the Imperial House, with a view to a peaceful settlement. According\r\nto the memorial now submitted to Us by the Cabinet embodying the\r\narticles of courteous treatment proposed by the Republican Army, they\r\nundertake to hold themselves responsible for the perpetual offering of\r\nsacrifices before the Imperial Ancestral Temples and the Imperial\r\nMausolea and the completion as planned of the Mausoleum of His Late\r\nMajesty the Emperor Kuang Hsu. His Majesty the Emperor is understood to\r\nresign only his political power, while the Imperial Title is not\r\nabolished. There have also been concluded eight articles for the\r\ncourteous treatment of the Imperial House, four articles for the\r\nfavourable treatment of Manchus, Mongols, Mohammedans, and Tibetans. We\r\nfind the terms of perusal to be fairly comprehensive. We hereby proclaim\r\nto the Imperial Kinsmen and the Manchus, Mongols, Mohammedans, and\r\nTibetans that they should endeavour in the future to fuse and remove\r\nall racial differences and prejudices and maintain law and order with\r\nunited efforts. It is our sincere hope that peace will once more be seen\r\nin the country and all the people will enjoy happiness under a\r\nrepublican government.\r\n\r\nBearing the Imperial Seal and Signed by\r\n  Yuan Shih-kai, the Premier;\r\n  Hoo Wei-teh, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs;\r\n  Chao Ping-chun, Minister of the Interior;\r\n  Tan Hsuen-heng, Acting Minister of the Navy;\r\n  Hsi Yen, Acting Minister of Agriculture, Works and Commerce;\r\n  Liang Shih-yi, Acting Minister of Communications;\r\n  Ta Shou, Acting Minister of the Dependencies.\r\n\r\n25th day of the 12th moon of the 3rd year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWe have respectfully received the following Edict from Her Imperial\r\nMajesty the Empress Dowager Lung Yu:--\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the ruler of a country emphasized the important duty of\r\nprotecting the lives of his people, and as their shepherd could not have\r\nthe heart to cause them injury. Now the newly established form of\r\ngovernment has for its sole object the appeasement of the present\r\ndisorder with a view to the restoration of peace. If, however, renewed\r\nwarfare were to be indefinitely maintained, by disregarding the opinion\r\nof the majority of the people, the general condition of the country\r\nmight be irretrievably ruined, and there might follow mutual slaughter\r\namong the people, resulting in the horrible effects of a racial war. As\r\na consequence, the spirits of Our Imperial Ancestors might be greatly\r\ndisturbed and millions of people might be terrorized. The evil\r\nconsequences cannot be described. Between the two evils, We have adopted\r\nthe lesser one. Such is the motive of the Throne in modelling its policy\r\nin accordance with the progress of time, the change of circumstances,\r\nand the earnest desires of Our People. Our Ministers and subjects both\r\nin and out of the Metropolis should, in conformity with Our idea,\r\nconsider most carefully the public weal and should not cause the country\r\nand the people to suffer from the evil consequences of a stubborn pride\r\nand of prejudiced opinions.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of the Interior, the General Commandant of the Gendarmerie,\r\nChiang Kuei-ti, and Feng Kuo-chang, are ordered to take strict\r\nprecautions, and to make explanations to the peoples so clearly and\r\nprecisely as to enable every and all of them to understand the wish of\r\nthe Throne to abide by the ordinance of heaven, to meet the public\r\nopinion of the people and to be just and unselfish.\r\n\r\nThe institution of the different offices by the State has been for the\r\nwelfare of the people, and the Cabinet, the various Ministries in the\r\nCapital, the Vice-royalties, Governorships, Commissionerships, and\r\nTaotaiships, have therefore been established for the safe protection of\r\nthe people, and not for the benefit of one man or of one family.\r\nMetropolitan and Provincial officials of all grades should ponder over\r\nthe present difficulties and carefully perform their duties. We hereby\r\nhold it the duty of the senior officials earnestly to advise and warn\r\ntheir subordinates not to shirk their responsibilities, in order to\r\nconform with Our original sincere intention to love and to take care of\r\nOur people.\r\n\r\nBearing the Imperial Seal and Signed by\r\n  Yuan Shih-kai, the Premier;\r\n  Hoo Wei-teh, Minister of Foreign Affairs;\r\n  Chao Ping-chun, Minister of the Interior;\r\n  Tan Hsuen-heng, Acting Minister of the Navy;\r\n  Hsi Yen, Acting Minister of Agriculture, Works and Commerce;\r\n  Liang Shih-yi, Acting Minister of Communications;\r\n  Ta Shou, Acting Minister of the Dependencies.\r\n\r\n25th day of the 12th moon of the 3rd year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS OF ABDICATION\r\n\r\nN.B.

Acting upon this\r\nprinciple, France in the 17th, England, America, Germany and Austria in\r\nthe 18th Century abolished such kind of taxation, the Customs tariff\r\nremaining, which is a levy on imports at the first port of entry. Its\r\npurpose is to increase the cost of production of imported goods and to\r\nserve as a protection of native products (sic). Raw materials from\r\nabroad are, however, exempt from Customs duty in order to provide cheap\r\nmaterial for home manufactures. An altogether different state of\r\naffairs, however, exists in this country. Likin stations are found\r\nthroughout the country, while raw materials are taxed. Take the Hangchow\r\nsilk for instance. When transported to the Capital for sale, it has to\r\npay a tax on raw material of 18 per cent. Foreign imported goods on the\r\nother hand, are only taxed at the rate of five per cent _ad valorem_\r\nCustoms duty at the first port of entry with another 2.5 per cent\r\ntransit duty at one of the other ports through which the goods pass.\r\nBesides these only landing duty is imposed upon imported goods at the\r\nport of destination. Upon timber being shipped from Fengtien and Antung\r\nto Peking, it has to pay duties at five different places, the total\r\namount of which aggregates 20 per cent of its market value, while timber\r\nfrom America is taxed only ten per cent. Timber from Jueichow to Hankow\r\nand Shanghai is taxed at six different places, the total amount of duty\r\npaid aggregating 17.5 per cent., while timber imported from abroad to\r\nthese ports is required to pay Customs duty only one-third thereof. The\r\nabove-mentioned rates on native goods are the minimum. Not every\r\nmerchant can, however, obtain such special 'exemption,' without a long\r\nnegotiation and special arrangements with the authorities. Otherwise, a\r\nmerchant must pay 25 per cent of the market value of his goods as duty.\r\nFor this reason the import of timber into this country has greatly\r\nincreased within the last few years, the total amount of which being\r\nvalued at $13,000,000 a year. Is this not a great injustice to native\r\nmerchants?\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE METHOD\r\n\r\n\"Respecting the improvement of the economic condition of the people, a\r\ncountry can hardly attain this object without developing its foreign\r\ncommerce. The United States of America, Germany and Japan have one by\r\none abolished their export duty as well as made appropriations for\r\nsubsidies to encourage the export of certain kinds of commodities. We,\r\non the other hand, impose likin all along the line upon native\r\ncommodities destined for foreign markets in addition to export duty.\r\nGoods for foreign markets are more heavily taxed than for home\r\nconsumption. Take the Chekiang silk for instance. Silk for export is\r\nmore heavily taxed than that for home use. Different rates of taxation\r\nare imposed upon tea for foreign and home markets. Other kinds of native\r\nproducts for export are also heavily taxed with the result that, within\r\nthe last two decades, the annual exports of this country are exceeded by\r\nimports by over Tls. 640,000,000,000. From the 32nd year of the reign of\r\nKuang Hsu to the 4th year of the Republic, imports exceed exports on the\r\naverage by Tls. 120,000,000. These, figures speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nLIKIN\r\n\r\n\"Likin stations have been established at places where railway\r\ncommunication is available. This has done a good deal of harm to\r\ntransportation and the railway traffic. Lately a proposal has been made\r\nin certain quarters that likin stations along the railways be abolished;\r\nand the measure has been adopted by the Peking-Tientsin and\r\nTientsin-Pukow Railways at certain places. When the towns and cities\r\nthroughout the country are connected by railways, there will be no place\r\nfor likin stations. With the increase in the number of treaty ports, the\r\n'likin zone' will be gradually diminished. Thencefrom the proceeds from\r\nlikin will be decreased year by year.\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the collection of likin the development of both home and\r\nforeign trade has been arrested and the people are working under great\r\ndisadvantages. Hence in order to develop foreign and home trade the\r\nGovernment must do away with likin, which will bring back business\r\nprosperity, and in time the same will enable the Government to obtain\r\nnew sources of revenues.\r\n\r\n\"From the above-mentioned considerations, the Government can hardly\r\ndevelop and encourage trade without the abolition of likin. By treaty\r\nwith Great Britain, America and Japan, the Government can increase the\r\nrate of Customs tariff to cover losses due to the abolition of likin.\r\nThe question under consideration is not a new one. But the cause which\r\nhas prevented the Government from reaching a prompt decision upon this\r\nquestion is the fear that, after the abolition of likin, the proceeds\r\nfrom the increased Customs tariff would not be sufficient to cover the\r\nshortage caused by the abolition of likin.\r\n\r\nCOST OF ABOLITION OF LIKIN\r\n\r\n\"But such a fear should disappear when the Authorities remember the\r\nfollowing facts:--\r\n\r\n\"(a) The loss as the result of the abolition of likin: $38,900,000.\r\n\r\n\"(b) The loss as the result of the abolition of a part of duty collected\r\nby the native Customs houses: $7,300,000.\r\n\r\n\"(c) Annual proceeds from different kinds of principal and miscellaneous\r\ntaxes which shall be done away with the abolition of likin $11,800,000.\r\n\r\n\"The above figures are determined by comparing the actual amount of\r\nproceeds collected by the Government in the 3rd and 4th years of the\r\nRepublic with the estimated amount in the Budget of the fifth year. The\r\ntotal amount of loss caused by the abolition of likin will be\r\n$58,000,000.\r\n\r\nINCREASE OF CUSTOMS TARIFF\r\n\r\n\"The amount of increase in the Customs tariff which the Government\r\nexpects to collect is as follows:--(a) The increase in import duties\r\n$29,000,000. (b) The increase in export duties Tls. 6,560,000.\r\n\r\n\"The above figures are determined according to the Customs returns of\r\nthe 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years of the Republic. By deducting Tls. 2,200,000\r\nof transit duty, the net increase will be Tls. 33,600,000, which is\r\nequal to $48,500,000. For the sake of prudence, allowance of five per\r\ncent. of the total amount is made against any incidental shortage. The\r\nnet revenue thus increased would amount to $46,100,000. Against the loss\r\nof $58,000,000, there will be a shortage of some $11,900,000. This,\r\nhowever, will not be difficult to make good by new sources of revenue as\r\nthe result of a tariff revision:--(a) Tax on goods at the time of\r\nmanufacture $800,000. (b) Tax on goods at the time of sale $8,000,000.\r\n(c) Tax on cattle and slaughtering houses $2,000,000. (d) Tax on\r\nfoodstuffs $4,000,000.\r\n\r\n\"Under (a) and (b) are the taxes to be collected on native made foreign\r\nimitation goods and various kinds of luxurious articles. Under (c) and\r\n(d) are taxes which are already enforced in the provinces but which can\r\nbe increased to that much by reorganizing the method of collection. The\r\ntotal sum of the proceeds set forth under above items will amount to\r\n$14,800,000. These will be quite sufficient to cover the loss caused by\r\nthe abolition of likin.\r\n\r\nA VITAL INTEREST\r\n\r\n\"As the abolition of likin concerns the vital interest of the merchants\r\nand manufacturers, it should be carried out without delay. The\r\ncommercial and industrial enterprises of the country can only thrive\r\nafter likin is abolished and only then can new sources of revenue be\r\nobtained. This measure will form the fundamental factor of our\r\nindustrial and economical development. But one thing to which we should\r\nlike to call the special attention of the Government is the procedure to\r\nbe adopted to negotiate with the Foreign countries respecting the\r\nadoption of this measure. The first step in this connection should be\r\nthe increase of the present Customs tariff to the actual five per cent\r\n_ad valorem_ rate. When this is done, proposals should be made to the\r\nPowers having treaty relations with us concerning the abolition of likin\r\nand revision of Customs tariff. The transit destination duties on\r\nimported goods should at the same time be done away with. This would not\r\nentail any disadvantage to the importers of foreign goods and any\r\ndiplomatic question would not be difficult of solution. Meantime\r\npreparatory measures should be devised for reorganizing the method of\r\ncollecting duties set forth above so that the abolition of likin can\r\ntake place as soon as the Government obtains the consent of the foreign\r\nPowers respecting the increase of Customs tariff.\"\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nTHE LEADING OUTSTANDING CASES BETWEEN CHINA AND THE FOREIGN POWERS\r\n\r\n(Author's note. The following memorandum was drawn up by Dr. C.C. Wu,\r\nCouncillor at the Chinese Foreign Office and son of Dr. Wu Ting-fang,\r\nthe Foreign Minister, and is a most competent and precise statement. It\r\nis a noteworthy fact that not only is Dr. C.C. Wu a British barrister\r\nbut he distinguished himself above all his fellows in the year he was\r\ncalled to the Bar. It is also noteworthy that the Lao Hsi-kai case does\r\nnot figure in this summary, China taking the view that French action\r\nthroughout was _ultra vires_, and beyond discussion.)\r\n\r\nBY DR. C.C. WU\r\n\r\nRepublican China inherited from imperial China the vast and rich\r\nterritory of China Proper and its Dependencies, but the inheritance was\r\nby no means free from incumbrances as in the case of Outer Mongolia,\r\nTibet and Manchuria, and other impediments in the form of unfavourable\r\ntreaty obligations and a long list of outstanding foreign cases\r\naffecting sovereign and territorial rights.\r\n\r\nI have been asked by the Editor of the _North-China Daily News_ to\r\ncontribute an article on some of the outstanding questions between China\r\nand foreign powers, instancing Tibet, Manchuria, Mongolia, and to give\r\nthe Chinese point of view on these questions. Although the subject is a\r\ndelicate one to handle, particularly in the press, being as it is one in\r\nwhich international susceptibilities are apt to be aroused, I have yet\r\naccepted the invitation in the belief that a calm and temperate\r\nstatement of the Chinese case will hurt no one whose case will bear\r\npublic discussion but will perhaps do some good by bringing about a\r\nclear understanding of the points at issue between China and the foreign\r\nPowers concerned, and thus facilitating an early settlement which is so\r\nearnestly desired by China. I may say that I have appreciated the\r\nBritish sense of justice and fairplay displayed by the \"North-China\r\nDaily News\" in inviting a statement of the Chinese case in its own\r\ncolumns on questions one of which concerns British interests in no small\r\ndegree, and the discussion cannot be conducted under a better spirit\r\nthan that expressed in the motto of the senior British journal in the\r\nFar East: \"Impartial not Neutral.\"\r\n\r\n1º MANCHURIA\r\n\r\nThe treaty between China and Japan of 1915 respecting South Manchuria\r\nand Eastern Inner Mongolia giving that power special rights and\r\nprivileges in those regions has given rise to many knotty problems for\r\nthe diplomatists of the two countries to solve. Two of such problems are\r\nmentioned here.\r\n\r\nJAPANESE POLICE BOXES IN MANCHURIA AND MONGOLIA\r\n\r\nSince the last days of the Tsings, the Japanese have been establishing\r\npolice boxes in different parts of South Manchuria and Eastern Inner\r\nMongolia always under protest of the local and Peking authorities. Since\r\nthe treaty of 1915, a new reason has become available in the right of\r\nmixed residence given to Japanese in these regions. It is said that for\r\nthe protection and control of their subjects, and indeed for the\r\ninterest of the Chinese themselves, it is best that this measure should\r\nbe taken. It is further contended that the stationing of police officers\r\nis but a corollary to the right of exterritoriality, and that it is in\r\nno way a derogation of Chinese sovereignty.\r\n\r\nIt is pointed out by the Chinese Government that in the treaty of 1915,\r\nexpress provision is made for Japanese in South Manchuria and Eastern\r\nInner Mongolia to submit to the police laws and ordinances and taxation\r\nof China (Article 5). This leaves the matter in no doubt. If the\r\nJapanese wish to facilitate the Chinese police in their duty of\r\nprotection and control of the Japanese, they have many means at their\r\ncommand for so doing. It is unnecessary to point out that the\r\nestablishment of foreign police on Chinese soil (except in foreign\r\nsettlements and concessions where it is by the permission of the Chinese\r\nGovernment) is, to our thinking, at any rate, a very grave derogation to\r\nChina's sovereign rights. Furthermore, from actual experience, we know\r\nthat the activities of these foreign police will not be confined to\r\ntheir countrymen; in a dispute between a Chinese and a Japanese both\r\nwill be taken to the Japanese station by the Japanese policeman. This\r\nexistence of an imperium in imperio, so far from accomplishing its\r\navowed object of \"improving the relations of the countries and bringing\r\nabout the development of economic interests to no small degree,\" will,\r\nit is feared, be the cause of continual friction between the officials\r\nand people of the two countries.\r\n\r\nAs to the legal contention that the right of police control is a natural\r\ncorollary to the right of exterritoriality, it must be said that ever\r\nsince the grant of consular jurisdiction to foreigners by China in her\r\nfirst treaties, this is the first time that such a claim has been\r\nseriously put forward. We can only say that if this interpretation of\r\nexterritoriality is correct the other nations enjoying exterritoriality\r\nin China have been very neglectful in the assertion of their just\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nIn the Chengchiatun case, the claim of establishing police boxes\r\nwherever the Japanese think necessary was made one of the demands. The\r\nChinese Government in its final reply which settled the case took the\r\nstand as above outlined.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned in passing that in Amoy the Japanese have also\r\nendeavoured to establish similar police rights. The people of that city\r\nand province, and indeed of the whole country, as evidenced by the\r\nprotests received from all over China, have been very much exercised\r\nover the matter. It is sincerely hoped that with the undoubted\r\nimprovement of relations between the two countries within the last\r\nseveral months, the matter will be smoothly and equitably settled.\r\n\r\nLEGAL STATUS OF KOREANS IN CHIENTAO\r\n\r\nThe region which goes by the name of Chientao, a Japanese denomination,\r\ncomprises several districts in the Yenchi Circuit of Kirin Province\r\nnorth of the Tumen Kiang (or the Tiumen River) which here forms the\r\nboundary between China and Korea. For over thirty years Koreans have\r\nbeen allowed here to cultivate the waste lands and acquire ownership\r\ntherein, a privilege which has not been permitted to any other\r\nforeigners in China and which has been granted to these Koreans on\r\naccount of the peculiar local conditions. According to reliable sources,\r\nthe Korean population now amounts to over 200,000 which is more than the\r\nChinese population itself. In 1909 an Agreement, known as the Tumen\r\nKiang Boundary Agreement, was arrived at between China and Japan, who\r\nwas then the acknowledged suzerain of Korea, dealing, inter alia, with\r\nthe status of these Koreans. It was provided that while Koreans were to\r\ncontinue to enjoy protection of their landed property, they were to be\r\nsubject to Chinese laws and to the jurisdiction of Chinese courts. The\r\nsubsequent annexation of Korea did not affect this agreement in point of\r\ninternational law, and as a matter of practice Japan has adhered to it\r\nuntil September, 1915. Then the Japanese Consul suddenly interfered in\r\nthe administration of justice by the local authorities over the Koreans\r\nand claimed that he should have jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese claim is based on the Treaty Respecting South Manchuria and\r\nEastern Inner Mongolia signed in May, 1915, article 5 of which provides\r\nthat civil and criminal cases in which the defendants are Japanese shall\r\nbe tried and adjudicated by the Japanese consul.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese view is that this article is inapplicable to Koreans in this\r\nregion and that the Tumen Kiang Agreement continues in force. This view\r\nis based on a saving clause in article 8 of the Treaty of 1915 which\r\nsays that \"all existing treaties between China and Japan relating to\r\nManchuria shall, except where otherwise provided for by treaty, remain\r\nin force.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the origin of the Tumen Kiang Agreement supports\r\nthis view. When the Japanese assumed suzerainty over Korea they raised\r\ncertain questions as to the boundary between China and Korea. There were\r\nalso outstanding several questions regarding railways and mines between\r\nChina and Japan. Japan insisted that the boundary question and the\r\nrailway and mining questions be settled at the same time. As a result,\r\ntwo agreements were concluded in 1909 one respecting the boundary\r\nquestion, the Tumen Kiang Agreement, and the other respecting railways\r\nand mines whereby Japan obtained many new and valuable privileges and\r\nconcessions, such as the extension of the Kirin-Changchun Railway to the\r\nKorean frontier, the option on the Hsinminfu-Fakumen line, and the\r\nworking of the Fushun and Yentai mines, while in return China obtained a\r\nbare recognition of existing rights, namely the boundary between China\r\nand Korea and the jurisdiction over the Koreans in the Yenchi region.\r\nThe two settlements were in the nature of quid pro quo though it is\r\nclear that the Japanese side of the scale heavily outweighed that of the\r\nChinese. Now Japan endeavours to repudiate, for no apparent reason so\r\nfar as we can see, the agreement which formed the consideration whereby\r\nshe obtained so many valuable concessions.\r\n\r\nSecondly, while Koreans are now Japanese subjects, it is contended by\r\nthe Chinese that the particular Koreans inhabiting the Yenchi region\r\nare, as regards China, in a different position from Japanese subjects\r\nelsewhere. These Koreans enjoy the rights of free residence and of\r\ncultivating and owning land in the interior of China, rights denied to\r\nother foreigners, including Japanese who, even by the new treaty, may\r\nonly lease land in South Manchuria. For this exceptional privilege, they\r\nare subject to the jurisdiction of Chinese laws and Chinese courts, a\r\nduty not imposed on other foreigners. It would be \"blowing hot and cold\r\nat the same time\" in the language of English lawyers if it is sought to\r\nenjoy the special privileges without performing the duties.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Japanese under the Treaty of 1915 are required to register\r\ntheir passports with the local authorities. On the other hand, Koreans\r\nin Yenchi have never been nor are they now required to procure\r\npassports. This would seem to be conclusive proof that Koreans in that\r\nregion are not within the provisions of the treaty of 1915 but are still\r\ngoverned by the Tumen Kiang Agreement.\r\n\r\nThe question is something more than one of academic or even merely\r\njudicial importance. As has been stated, the Koreans in Yenchi outnumber\r\nthe Chinese and the only thing that has kept the region Chinese\r\nterritory in fact as well as in name is the possession by the Chinese of\r\njurisdiction over every inhabitant, whether Chinese or Korean. Were\r\nChina to surrender that jurisdiction over a majority of those\r\ninhabitants, it would be tantamount to a cession of territory.\r\n\r\n2º MACAO\r\n\r\nThe dispute between China and Portugal over the Macao question has been\r\none of long standing. The first treaty of commerce signed between them\r\non August 13, 1862, at Tientsin, was not ratified in consequence of a\r\ndispute respecting the Sovereignty of Macao. By a Protocol signed at\r\nLisbon on March 26, 1887, China formally recognized the perpetual\r\noccupation and government of Macao and its dependencies by Portugal, as\r\nany other Portuguese possession; and in December of the same year, when\r\nthe formal treaty was signed, provision was made for the appointment of\r\na Commission to delimit the boundaries of Macao; \"but as long as the\r\ndelimitation of the boundaries is not concluded, everything in respect\r\nto them shall continue as at present without addition, diminution or\r\nalteration by either of the Parties.\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1908, a Japanese steamer, the _Tatsu Maru_, engaged\r\nin gun-running was captured by a Chinese customs cruiser near the\r\nKauchau archipelago (Nove Ilhas). The Portuguese authorities demanded\r\nher release on the ground that she was seized in Portuguese territorial\r\nwaters thus raising the question of the status of the waters surrounding\r\nMacao.\r\n\r\nIn the same year the Portuguese authorities of Macao attempted the\r\nimposition of land tax in Maliaoho, and proposed to dredge the waterways\r\nin the vicinity of Macao. The Chinese Government thereupon instructed\r\nits Minister in France, who was also accredited to Portugal, to make\r\npersonal representations to the Portuguese Foreign Office in regard to\r\nthe unwarrantable action of the local Portuguese authorities. The\r\nPortuguese Government requested the withdrawal of Chinese troops on the\r\nIsland of Lappa as a quid pro quo for the appointment of a new\r\nDemarcation Commissioner, reserving to itself the right to refer to The\r\nHague Tribunal any dispute that may arise between the Commissioners\r\nappointed by the respective Governments.\r\n\r\nAfter protracted negotiations it was agreed between the Chinese Minister\r\nand the Portuguese Government by an exchange of notes that the\r\nrespective Governments should each appoint a Demarcation Commissioner to\r\ndelimit the boundaries of Macao and its dependencies in pursuance of the\r\nLisbon Protocol and Article 2 of the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of 1887,\r\nsubject to the decision of their respective Governments.\r\n\r\nTHE PORTUGUESE CLAIM\r\n\r\nIn February, 1909, Portugal appointed General Joaquim Machado and China\r\nMr. Kao Erh-chien as their respective Commissioners and they met at\r\nHongkong in June of the same year.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese claim consisted of the whole of the Peninsula of Macao as\r\nfar north as Portas do Cerco, the Island of Lappa, Green Island (Ilha\r\nVerde), Ilhas de Taipa, Ilha de Coloane, Ilha Macarira, Ilha da\r\nTai-Vong-Cam, other small islands, and the waters of Porto Interior.\r\nThe Portuguese Commissioner also demanded that the portion of Chinese\r\nterritory between Portas de Cerco and Peishanling be neutralized.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of evidence, documentary or otherwise, China could not\r\nadmit Portugal's title to half the territory claimed, but was prepared\r\nto concede all that part of the Peninsula of Macao south of Portas do\r\nCerco which was already beyond the limits of the original Portuguese\r\nPossession of Macao, and also to grant the developed parts of Ilhas de\r\nColoane as Portuguese settlements. The ownership of territorial waters\r\nwas to remain vested in China.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations having proved fruitless were transferred to Lisbon but\r\non the outbreak of the Revolution in Portugal they were suspended. No\r\nmaterial progress has been made since.\r\n\r\n3º TIBET\r\n\r\nIn November, 1911, the Chinese garrison in Lhassa, in sympathy with the\r\nrevolutionary cause in China, mutinied against Amban Lien-yu, a Chinese\r\nBannerman, and a few months later the Tibetans, by order of the Dalai\r\nLama, revolted and besieged the Chinese forces in Lhassa till they were\r\nstarved out and eventually evacuated Tibet. Chinese troops in Kham were\r\nalso ejected. An expedition was sent from Szechuan and Yunnan to Tibet,\r\nbut Great Britain protested and caused its withdrawal.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1912, the British Minister in Peking presented a Memorandum\r\nto the Chinese Government outlining the attitude of Great Britain\r\ntowards the Tibetan question. China was asked to refrain from\r\ndispatching a military expedition into Tibet, as the re-establishment of\r\nChinese authority would, it is stated, constitute a violation of the\r\nAnglo-Chinese Treaty of 1906. Chinese suzerainty in regard to Tibet was\r\nrecognized. But Great Britain could not consent to the assertion of\r\nChinese sovereignty over a State enjoying independent treaty relations\r\nwith her. In conclusion, China was invited to come to an agreement\r\nregarding Tibet on the lines indicated in the Memorandum, such agreement\r\nto be antecedent to Great Britain's recognition of the Republic. Great\r\nBritain also imposed an embargo on the communications between China and\r\nTibet via India.\r\n\r\nIn deference to the wishes of the British Government, China at once\r\nissued orders that the expeditionary force should not proceed beyond\r\nGiamda. In her reply she declared that the Chinese Government had no\r\nintention of converting Tibet into another province of China and that\r\nthe preservation of the traditional system of Tibetan government was as\r\nmuch the desire of China as of Great Britain. The dispatch of troops\r\ninto Tibet was, however, necessary for the fulfilment of the\r\nresponsibilities attaching to China's treaty obligations with Great\r\nBritain, which required her to preserve peace and order throughout that\r\nvast territory, but she did not contemplate the idea of stationing an\r\nunlimited number of soldiers in Tibet. China considered that the\r\nexisting treaties defined the status of Tibet with sufficient clearness,\r\nand therefore there was no need to negotiate a new treaty. She\r\nexpressed the regret that the Indian Government had placed an embargo on\r\nthe communications between China and Tibet via India, as China was at\r\npeace with Great Britain and regretted that Great Britain should\r\nthreaten to withhold recognition of the Republic, such recognition being\r\nof mutual advantage to both countries. Finally, the Chinese Government\r\nhoped that the British Government would reconsider its attitude.\r\n\r\nTHE SIMLA CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nIn May, 1913, the British Minister renewed his suggestion of the\r\nprevious year that China should come to an agreement on the Tibetan\r\nquestion, and ultimately a Tripartite Conference was opened on October\r\n13, at Simla with Mr. Ivan Chen, Sir Henry McMahon, and Lonchen Shatra\r\nas plenipotentiaries representing China, Great Britain, and Tibet,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe following is the substance of the Tibetan proposals:--\r\n\r\n1. Tibet shall be an independent State, repudiating the Anglo-Chinese\r\nConvention of 1906.\r\n\r\n2. The boundary of Tibet in regard to China includes that portion of\r\nSinkiang south of Kuenlun Range and Altyn Tagh, the whole territory of\r\nChinghai, the western portion of Kansuh and Szechuan, including\r\nTachienlu and the northwestern portion of Yunnan, including Atuntzu.\r\n\r\n3. Great Britain and Tibet to negotiate, independent of China, new trade\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n4. No Chinese officials and troops to be stationed in Tibet.\r\n\r\n5. China to recognize Dalai Lama as the head of the Buddhist Religion\r\nand institutions in Mongolia and China.\r\n\r\n6. China to compensate Tibet for forcible exactions of money or property\r\ntaken from the Tibetan Government.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Plenipotentiary made the following counter-proposals:--\r\n\r\n1. Tibet forms an integral part of Chinese territory and Chinese rights\r\nof every description which have existed in consequence of this integrity\r\nshall be respected by Tibet and recognized by Great Britain. China\r\nengages not to convert Tibet into a province and Great Britain not to\r\nannex Tibet or any portion of it.\r\n\r\n2. China to appoint a Resident at Lhassa with an escort of 2,600\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n3. Tibet undertakes to be guided by China in her foreign and military\r\naffairs and not to enter into negotiations with any foreign Power except\r\nthrough the intermediary of China but this engagement does not exclude\r\ndirect relations between British Trade Agents and Tibetan authorities as\r\nprovided in the Anglo-Chinese Convention of 1906.\r\n\r\n4. Tibet to grant amnesty to those Tibetans known for their pro-Chinese\r\ninclinations and to restore to them their property.\r\n\r\n5. Clause 5 of Tibetan claims can be discussed.\r\n\r\n6. Revision of Trade Regulations of 1893 and 1908, if found necessary,\r\nmust be made by all the parties concerned.\r\n\r\n7. In regard to the limits of Tibet China claims Giamda and all the\r\nplaces east of it.\r\n\r\nTHE BOUNDARY DEADLOCK\r\n\r\nThe British plenipotentiary sustained in the main the Tibetan view\r\nconcerning the limits of Tibet. He suggested the creation of Inner and\r\nOuter Tibet by a line drawn along the Kuenlun Range to the 96th\r\nlongitude, turning south reaching a point south of the 34th latitude,\r\nthen in south-easterly direction to Niarong, passing Hokow, Litang,\r\nBatang in a western and then southern and southwestern direction to\r\nRima, thus involving the inclusion of Chiamdo in Outer Tibet and the\r\nwithdrawal of the Chinese garrison stationed there. He proposed that\r\nrecognition should be accorded to the autonomy of Outer Tibet whilst\r\nadmitting the right of the Chinese to re-establish such a measure of\r\ncontrol in Inner Tibet as would restore and safeguard their historic\r\nposition there, without in any way infringing the integrity of Tibet as\r\na geographical and political entity. Sir Henry McMahon also submitted to\r\nthe Conference a draft proposal of the Convention to the\r\nplenipotentiaries. After some modification this draft was initialled by\r\nthe British and Tibetan delegates but the Chinese delegate did not\r\nconsider himself authorized to do so. Thereupon the British member after\r\nmaking slight concessions in regard to representation in the Chinese\r\nParliament and the boundary in the neighbourhood of Lake Kokonor\r\nthreatened, in the event of his persisting in his refusal, to eliminate\r\nthe clause recognizing the suzerainty of China, and ipso facto the\r\nprivileges appertaining thereto from the draft Convention already\r\ninitialled by the British and Tibetan plenipotentiaries. In order to\r\nsave the situation, the Chinese delegate initialled the documents, but\r\non the clear understanding that to initial and to sign were two\r\ndifferent things and that to sign he must obtain instructions from his\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nChina, dissatisfied with the suggested division into an Inner and Outer\r\nTibet the boundaries of which would involve the evacuation of those\r\ndistricts actually in Chinese effective occupation and under its\r\nadministration, though otherwise in accord with the general principles\r\nof the draft Convention, declared that the initialled draft was in no\r\nway binding upon her and took up the matter with the British Government\r\nin London and with its representative in Peking. Protracted negotiations\r\ntook place thereafter, but, in spite of repeated concessions from the\r\nChinese side in regard to the boundary question, the British Government\r\nwould not negotiate on any basis other than the initialled convention.\r\nOn July 3 an Agreement based on the terms of the draft Convention but\r\nproviding special safe-guards for the interests of Great Britain and\r\nTibet in the event of China continuing to withhold her adherence, was\r\nsigned between Great Britain and Tibet, not, however, before Mr. Ivan\r\nChen had declared that the Chinese Government would recognize any treaty\r\nor similar document that might then or thereafter be signed between\r\nGreat Britain and Tibet.\r\n\r\nCHINA'S STANDPOINT\r\n\r\nWith the same spirit of compromise and a readiness to meet the wishes of\r\nthe British Government and even to the extent of making considerable\r\nsacrifices in so far as they were compatible with her dignity, China has\r\nmore than once offered to renew negotiations with the British Government\r\nbut the latter has up to the present declined to do so. China wants\r\nnothing more than the re-establishment of Chinese suzerainty over Tibet,\r\nwith recognition of the autonomy of the territory immediately under the\r\ncontrol of the Lhassa Government; she is agreeable to the British idea\r\nof forming an effective buffer territory in so far as it is consistent\r\nwith equity and justice; she is anxious that her trade interest should\r\nbe looked after by her trade agents as do the British, a point which is\r\nagreeable even to the Tibetans, though apparently not to the British; in\r\nother words, she expects that Great Britain would at least make with her\r\nan arrangement regarding Tibet which should not be any less\r\ndisadvantageous to her than that made with Russia respecting Outer\r\nMongolia.\r\n\r\nConsidering that China has claimed and exercised sovereign rights over\r\nTibet, commanded the Tibetan army, supervised Tibetan internal\r\nadministration, and confirmed the appointments of Tibetan officials,\r\nhigh and low, secular and even ecclesiastical, such expectations are\r\nmodest enough, surely. At the present moment, with communication via\r\nIndia closed, with no official representative or agent present, with\r\nrelations unsettled and unregulated, the position of China _vis-à-vis_\r\nTibet is far from satisfactory and altogether anomalous, while as\r\nbetween China and Great Britain there is always this important question\r\noutstanding. An early settlement in a reciprocal spirit of give and take\r\nand giving reasonable satisfaction to the legitimate aspirations and\r\nclaims of all parties is extremely desirable.\r\n\r\n4º OUTER MONGOLIA\r\n\r\nThe world is more or less acquainted with the events in Urga in\r\nDecember, 1911, and the proclamation of independence of Outer Mongolia\r\nwith Jetsun Dampa Hutukhtu as its ruler. By the Russo-Chinese\r\nDeclaration of November 5, 1913, and the Tripartite Convention of\r\nKiakhta of 1914 China has re-established her suzerainty over Outer\r\nMongolia and obtained the acknowledgment that it forms a part of the\r\nChinese territory. There remains the demarcation of boundary between\r\nInner and Outer Mongolia which will take place shortly, and the\r\noutstanding question of the status of Tannu Uriankhai where Russia is\r\nlately reported to be subjecting the inhabitants to Russian jurisdiction\r\nand expelling Chinese traders.\r\n\r\nThe Tannu Uriankhai lands, according to the Imperial Institutes of the\r\nTsing Dynasty, were under the control of the Tartar General of\r\nUliasutai, the Sain Noin Aimak, the Jasaktu Khan Aimak and the Jetsun\r\nDampa Hutkhta, and divided into forty-eight somons (tsoling).\r\nGeographically, according to the same authority, Tannu Uriankhai is\r\nbounded on the north by Russia, east by Tushetu Khan Aimak, west by the\r\nvarious aimaks of Kobdo, and south by Jasaktu Khan Aimak. By a Joint\r\nDemarcation Commission in 1868 the Russo Chinese boundary in respect to\r\nUriankhai was demitted and eight wooden boundary posts were erected to\r\nmark their respective frontiers.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, however, a Russian officer removed and burnt the boundary post\r\nat Chapuchi Yalodapa. The matter was taken up by the then Waiwupu with\r\nthe Russian Minister. He replied to the effect that the limits of\r\nUriankhai were an unsettled question and the Russian Government would\r\nnot entertain the Chinese idea of taking independent steps to remark the\r\nboundary or to replace the post and expressed dissatisfaction with the\r\nwork of the Joint Demarcation Commission of 1868, a dissatisfaction\r\nwhich would seem to be somewhat tardily expressed, to say the least. The\r\ncase was temporarily dropped on account of the secession of Uliasutai\r\nfrom China in the following year.\r\n\r\nWhile Uriankhai forms part of Autonomous Outer Mongolia, yet since Outer\r\nMongolia is under China's suzerainty, and its territory is expressly\r\nrecognized to form part of that of China, China cannot look on with\r\nindifference to any possible cession of territory by Outer Mongolia to\r\nRussia. Article 3 of the Kaikhta Agreement, 1915, prohibiting Outer\r\nMongolia from concluding treaties with foreign powers respecting\r\npolitical and territorial questions acknowledges China's right to\r\nnegotiate and make such treaties. It is the firm intention of the\r\nChinese Government to maintain its territorial integrity basing its case\r\non historical records, on treaty rights and finally on the principle of\r\nnationality. It is notorious that the Mongols will be extremely\r\nunwilling to see Uriankhai incorporated into the Russian Empire. While\r\nRussia is spending countless lives and incalculable treasure in fighting\r\nfor the sacred principle of nationality in Europe, we cannot believe\r\nthat the will deliberately violate the same principle in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbdication Edict of 1912, text of\r\nAbsolutism, the myth of\r\nAgreement between the Revolutionary Party and Europe and Asia Trading Co.\r\nAmerica drops out of the Six-Power group\r\nAmerican press agents\r\n  treaty opening Korea\r\nAmerica's Chinese policy\r\nAnglo-Japanese treaty\r\nAnnuity of Manchu Imperial Family\r\nAntung-Mukden railway\r\nAriga, Dr.\r\nArmy Reorganization Council\r\n\"Articles of Favourable Treatment for the Manchus\"\r\n  text of\r\n\r\nBabachapu\r\nBannerman families\r\nBelgian loan, the\r\n  Syndicate\r\nBlack Dragon Society, the\r\n  memorandum of\r\nBlack Dragon Society's review of European war issues\r\nBoycott on Japanese commerce\r\nBoxer Indemnities postponed\r\n  rebellion, the\r\n  and European intervention\r\nBritish policies in China\r\n  position towards the Yuan Shih-kai régime\r\n\r\nCambaluc of Marco Polo, the\r\nCanton province\r\nCassini Convention, the\r\nCatholic, Roman, controversies\r\nCentral Government, organization of\r\nChang Cheng-wu, Gen.\r\n  execution of\r\nChang Chih-tung\r\nChang Hsun, Gen.\r\nChang Kuo-kan\r\nChang Tso-lin, Gen.\r\nChang, Tsung-hsiang\r\nChang Yao Ching and the Europe\r\n  and Asia Trading Co.\r\nChen Yi, Gen.\r\nChengchiatun incident, the\r\nChekiang revolts against Yuan Shih-kai\r\nChia Ching, emperor\r\nChiang Chao-tsung, Gen.\r\nChiang Chun, the\r\nCh'ien Lung, emperor\r\nChih Fa Chu, or Military Court, at Pekin\r\nChihli province\r\nChina,\r\n  and her foreign residents\r\n  and the Foreign Powers, outstanding\r\n  cases between\r\n  and the German submarine war\r\n  considers war with Germany\r\n  declares war against Germany\r\nChina's,\r\n  break with Germany, causes leading to\r\n  economics, weakness of\r\n  financial reorganization\r\n  future in Manchuria\r\n  Imperial Government, negativeness\r\n  disguised\r\n  indignation at Japan's ultimatum\r\n  note to Germany severing relations\r\n  neutrality position\r\n  new régime\r\n  passivity\r\n  polity, principles of\r\n  protest against submarine war\r\n  reception of Wilson's Peace note\r\n  reply to Demands of Japan\r\n  reply to Japan's ultimatum\r\n  reply to President Wilson\r\n  tariff question\r\nChinese army,\r\n  German trained\r\n  boycott of the French\r\n  intrigues in Korea\r\nChing, Prince\r\nChino-Japanese,\r\n  relations\r\n  secret alliance proposed\r\n  treaties of 1915, text of\r\nChinputang, the (Progressives)\r\n_Chou An Hui_ (Society for the Preservation of Peace)\r\nChow Tzu-chi\r\nChu Chi-chun's telegram devising plans for electing Yuan Shih-kai as\r\n    Emperor\r\nCh'un, Prince Regent\r\nChungking, open port\r\nClausewitz, war-principle of\r\nConference of Governors on the war question\r\nConfucian worship re-established by Yuan Shih-kai\r\nConquest,\r\n  Manchu, of XVIIth Century\r\n  Mongol, of XIIIth Century\r\nConsolidating national debt\r\nConstitution,\r\n  first granted in Japan\r\n  Permanent, work on\r\n\"Constitutional Compact\"\r\n  of Yuan Shih-kai\r\n  text of\r\n  monarchy planned\r\nContinental quadrilateral, the, of Japan\r\n_Coup d'état_, the, of Sept., 1898\r\n_Coup d'état_, the parliamentary of 1913\r\nCrisp, Birch, attempts to float loan\r\n\r\nDane, Sir Richard\r\nDeath of Empress Lun Yi\r\nDecree cancelling the Empire\r\nDefence of the monarchial movement,\r\n  by Yang Tu\r\n  by Dr. Goodnow\r\n_Dementi_, 1913, of Yuan Shih-kai\r\nDiet of Japan, first summoned\r\nDiplomatic relations with China broken\r\nDistance in China, philosophy of\r\n\r\nEastern Asia, contestants for land-power in\r\nElection,\r\n  of 1913\r\n  of Yuan Shih-kai as emperor, machinery of\r\n  the, of 1915\r\n  records ordered burnt\r\nElectoral College, provision for\r\nEmperor,\r\n  analysis of powers of\r\n  Chia Ching\r\n  Ch'ien Lung\r\n  Hsiaouri\r\n  Hsuan Tung\r\n  K'ang-hsi\r\n  Kwanghsu\r\nEmperors, immurement of in Forbidden City\r\nEmpire, the dissolution of\r\nEmpress,\r\n  Lun Yi, death of\r\n  Tsu Hsi\r\nEurope and Asia Trading Co., the\r\nEuropean War,\r\n  the, its effect in China\r\n  China's predilection for Teutonism\r\n  consideration of war-partnership with the Allies\r\n  Japan's opposition\r\n  German propaganda\r\n  Pres.
