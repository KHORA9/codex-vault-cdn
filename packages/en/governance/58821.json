I ask only that\r\nwhat every self-respecting American demands from himself and from his\r\nsons shall be demanded of the American nation as a whole. Who among\r\nyou would teach your boys that ease, that peace, is to be the first\r\nconsideration in their eyes—to be the ultimate goal after which they\r\nstrive? You men of Chicago have made this city great, you men of\r\nIllinois have done your share, and more than your share, in making\r\nAmerica great, because you neither preach nor practice such a doctrine.\r\nYou work yourselves, and you bring up your sons to work. If you are\r\nrich and are worth your salt, you will teach your sons that though they\r\nmay have leisure, it is not to be spent in idleness; for wisely used\r\nleisure merely means that those who possess it, being free from the\r\nnecessity of working for their livelihood, are all the more bound to\r\ncarry on some kind of non-remunerative work in science, in letters, in\r\nart, in exploration, in historical research—work of the type we most\r\nneed in this country, the successful carrying out of which reflects\r\nmost honor upon the nation. We do not admire the man of timid peace.\r\nWe admire the man who embodies victorious effort; the man who never\r\nwrongs his neighbor, who is prompt to help a friend, but who has those\r\nvirile qualities necessary to win in the stern strife of actual life.\r\nIt is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed. In\r\nthis life we get nothing save by effort. Freedom from effort in the\r\npresent merely means that there has been stored up effort in the past.\r\nA man can be freed from the necessity of work only by the fact that he\r\nor his fathers before him have worked to good purpose. If the freedom\r\nthus purchased is used aright, and the man still does actual work,\r\nthough of a different kind, whether as a writer or a general, whether\r\nin the field of politics or in the field of exploration and adventure,\r\nhe shows he deserves his good fortune. But if he treats this period of\r\nfreedom from the need of actual labor as a period, not of preparation,\r\nbut of mere enjoyment, even though perhaps not of vicious enjoyment,\r\nhe shows that he is simply a cumberer of the earth’s surface, and he\r\nsurely unfits himself to hold his own with his fellows if the need to\r\ndo so should again arise. A mere life of ease is not in the end a very\r\nsatisfactory life, and, above all, it is a life which ultimately unfits\r\nthose who follow it for serious work in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the last analysis a healthy state can exist only when the men\r\nand women who make it up lead clean, vigorous, healthy lives; when\r\nthe children are so trained that they shall endeavor, not to shirk\r\ndifficulties, but to overcome them; not to seek ease, but to know how\r\nto wrest triumph from toil and risk. The man must be glad to do a\r\nman’s work, to dare and endure and to labor; to keep himself, and to\r\nkeep those dependent upon him. The woman must be the housewife, the\r\nhelpmeet of the homemaker, the wise and fearless mother of many healthy\r\nchildren. In one of Daudet’s powerful and melancholy books he speaks\r\nof “the fear of maternity, the haunting terror of the young wife of the\r\npresent day.” When such words can be truthfully written of a nation,\r\nthat nation is rotten to the heart’s core. When men fear work or fear\r\nrighteous war, when women fear motherhood, they tremble on the brink of\r\ndoom; and well it is that they should vanish from the earth, where they\r\nare fit subjects for the scorn of all men and women who are themselves\r\nstrong and brave and high-minded.\r\n\r\nAs it is with the individual, so it is with the nation. It is a base\r\nuntruth to say that happy is the nation that has no history. Thrice\r\nhappy is the nation that has a glorious history. Far better it is to\r\ndare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by\r\nfailure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy\r\nmuch nor suffer much, because they live in the gray twilight that knows\r\nnot victory nor defeat. If, in 1861, the men who loved the Union had\r\nbelieved that peace was the end of all things, and war and strife the\r\nworst of all things, and had acted up to their belief, we would have\r\nsaved hundreds of thousands of lives, we would have saved hundreds\r\nof millions of dollars. Moreover, besides saving all the blood and\r\ntreasure we then lavished, we would have prevented the heartbreak of\r\nmany women, the dissolution of many homes, and we would have spared\r\nthe country those months of gloom and shame when it seemed as if our\r\narmies marched only to defeat. We could have avoided all this suffering\r\nsimply by shrinking from strife. And if we had thus avoided it, we\r\nwould have shown that we were weaklings, and that we were unfit to\r\nstand among the great nations of the earth. Thank God for the iron in\r\nthe blood of our fathers, the men who upheld the wisdom of Lincoln,\r\nand bore sword or rifle in the armies of Grant! Let us, the children\r\nof the men who proved themselves equal to the mighty days, let us, the\r\nchildren of the men who carried the great Civil War to a triumphant\r\nconclusion, praise the God of our fathers that the ignoble counsels\r\nof peace were rejected; that the suffering and loss, the blackness of\r\nsorrow and despair, were unflinchingly faced, and the years of strife\r\nendured; for in the end the slave was freed, the Union restored, and\r\nthe mighty American Republic placed once more as a helmeted queen among\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nWe of this generation do not have to face a task such as that our\r\nfathers faced, but we have our tasks, and woe to us if we fail to\r\nperform them! We can not, if we would, play the part of China, and\r\nbe content to rot by inches in ignoble ease within our borders,\r\ntaking no interest in what goes on beyond them, sunk in a scrambling\r\ncommercialism; heedless of the higher life, the life of aspiration, of\r\ntoil and risk, busying ourselves only with the wants of our bodies for\r\nthe day, until suddenly we should find, beyond a shadow of question,\r\nwhat China has already found, that in this world the nation that has\r\ntrained itself to a career of unwarlike and isolated ease is bound, in\r\nthe end, to go down before other nations which have not lost the manly\r\nand adventurous qualities. If we are to be a really great people, we\r\nmust strive in good faith to play a great part in the world. We can not\r\navoid meeting great issues. All that we can determine for ourselves is\r\nwhether we shall meet them well or ill. In 1898 we could not help being\r\nbrought face to face with the problem of war with Spain. All we could\r\ndecide was whether we should shrink like cowards from the contest, or\r\nenter into it as beseemed a brave and high-spirited people; and, once\r\nin, whether failure or success should crown our banners. So it is now.\r\n\r\nWe can not avoid the responsibilities that confront us in Hawaii, Cuba,\r\nPorto Rico, and the Philippines. All we can decide is whether we shall\r\nmeet them in a way that will redound to the national credit, or whether\r\nwe shall make of our dealings with these new problems a dark and\r\nshameful page in our history. To refuse to deal with them at all merely\r\namounts to dealing with them badly. We have a given problem to solve.\r\nIf we undertake the solution, there is, of course, always danger that\r\nwe may not solve it aright; but to refuse to undertake the solution\r\nsimply renders it certain that we can not possibly solve it aright.\r\nThe timid man, the lazy man, the man who distrusts his country, the\r\nover-civilized man, who has lost the great fighting, masterful virtues,\r\nthe ignorant man, and the man of dull mind, whose soul is incapable of\r\nfeeling the mighty lift that thrills “stern men with empires in their\r\nbrains”—all these, of course, shrink from seeing the nation undertake\r\nits new duties; shrink from seeing us build a navy and an army adequate\r\nto our needs; shrink from seeing us do our share of the world’s work,\r\nby bringing order out of chaos in the great, fair tropic islands from\r\nwhich the valor of our soldiers and sailors has driven the Spanish\r\nflag. These are the men who fear the strenuous life, who fear the only\r\nnational life which is really worth leading. They believe in that\r\ncloistered life which saps the hardy virtues in a nation, as it saps\r\nthem in the individual; or else they are wedded to that base spirit of\r\ngain and greed which recognizes in commercialism the be-all and end-all\r\nof national life, instead of realizing that, though an indispensable\r\nelement, it is, after all, but one of the many elements that go to\r\nmake up true national greatness. No country can long endure if its\r\nfoundations are not laid deep in the material prosperity which comes\r\nfrom thrift, from business energy and enterprise, from hard, unsparing\r\neffort in the fields of industrial activity; but neither was any nation\r\never yet truly great if it relied upon material prosperity alone. All\r\nhonor must be paid to the architects of our material prosperity, to\r\nthe great captains of industry who have built our factories and our\r\nrailroads, to the strong men who toil for wealth with brain or hand;\r\nfor great is the debt of the nation to these and their kind. But our\r\ndebt is yet greater to the men whose highest type is to be found in\r\na statesman like Lincoln, a soldier like Grant. They showed by their\r\nlives that they recognized the law of work, the law of strife; they\r\ntoiled to win a competence for themselves and those dependent upon\r\nthem; but they recognized that there were yet other and even loftier\r\nduties—duties to the nation and duties to the race.\r\n\r\nWe can not sit huddled within our own borders and avow ourselves merely\r\nan assemblage of well-to-do hucksters who care nothing for what happens\r\nbeyond. Such a policy would defeat even its own end; for as the nations\r\ngrow to have ever wider and wider interests, and are brought into\r\ncloser and closer contact, if we are to hold our own in the struggle\r\nfor naval and commercial supremacy, we must build up our power without\r\nour own borders. We must build the Isthmian Canal, and we must grasp\r\nthe points of vantage which will enable us to have our say in deciding\r\nthe destiny of the oceans of the East and the West.\r\n\r\nSo much for the commercial side. From the standpoint of international\r\nhonor the argument is even stronger. The guns that thundered off Manila\r\nand Santiago left us echoes of glory, but they also left us a legacy of\r\nduty. If we drove out a medieval tyranny only to make room for savage\r\nanarchy, we had better not have begun the task at all. It is worse than\r\nidle to say that we have no duty to perform, and can leave to their\r\nfates the islands we have conquered. Such a course would be the course\r\nof infamy. It would be followed at once by utter chaos in the wretched\r\nislands themselves. Some stronger, manlier power would have to step in\r\nand do the work, and we would have shown ourselves weaklings, unable to\r\ncarry to successful completion the labors that great and high-spirited\r\nnations are eager to undertake.\r\n\r\nThe work must be done; we can not escape our responsibility; and\r\nif we are worth our salt, we shall be glad of the chance to do the\r\nwork—glad of the chance to show ourselves equal to one of the great\r\ntasks set modern civilization. But let us not deceive ourselves as to\r\nthe importance of the task. Let us not be misled by vainglory into\r\nunderestimating the strain it will put on our powers. Above all, let\r\nus, as we value our own self-respect, face the responsibilities with\r\nproper seriousness, courage, and high resolve. We must demand the\r\nhighest order of integrity and ability in our public men who are to\r\ngrapple with these new problems. We must hold to a rigid accountability\r\nthose public servants who show unfaithfulness to the interests of the\r\nnation or inability to rise to the high level of the new demands upon\r\nour strength and our resources.\r\n\r\nOf course we must remember not to judge any public servant by any one\r\nact, and especially should we beware of attacking the men who are\r\nmerely the occasions and not the causes of disaster. Let me illustrate\r\nwhat I mean by the army and the navy. If twenty years ago we had gone\r\nto war, we should have found the navy as absolutely unprepared as the\r\narmy. At that time our ships could not have encountered with success\r\nthe fleets of Spain any more than nowadays we can put untrained\r\nsoldiers, no matter how brave, who are armed with archaic black-powder\r\nweapons, against well-drilled regulars armed with the highest type of\r\nmodern repeating rifle. But in the early eighties the attention of the\r\nnation became directed to our naval needs. Congress most wisely made a\r\nseries of appropriations to build up a new navy, and under a succession\r\nof able and patriotic Secretaries, of both political parties, the\r\nnavy was gradually built up, until its material became equal to its\r\nsplendid personnel, with the result that in the summer of 1898 it\r\nleaped to its proper place as one of the most brilliant and formidable\r\nfighting navies in the entire world. We rightly pay all honor to the\r\nmen controlling the navy at the time it won these great deeds, honor\r\nto Secretary Long and Admiral Dewey, to the captains who handled the\r\nships in action, to the daring lieutenants who braved death in the\r\nsmaller craft, and to the heads of bureaus at Washington who saw that\r\nthe ships were so commanded, so armed, so equipped, so well engined,\r\nas to ensure the best results. But let us also keep ever in mind that\r\nall of this would not have availed if it had not been for the wisdom\r\nof the men who during the preceding fifteen years had built up the\r\nnavy. Keep in mind the Secretaries of the Navy during those years;\r\nkeep in mind the Senators and Congressmen who by their votes gave the\r\nmoney necessary to build and to armor the ships, to construct the great\r\nguns, and to train the crews; remember also those who actually did\r\nbuild the ships, the armor, and the guns; and remember the admirals and\r\ncaptains who handled battleship, cruiser, and torpedo-boat on the high\r\nseas, alone and in squadrons, developing the seamanship, the gunnery,\r\nand the power of acting together, which their successors utilized so\r\ngloriously at Manila and off Santiago. And, gentlemen, remember the\r\nconverse, too. Remember that justice has two sides. Be just to those\r\nwho built up the navy, and, for the sake of the future of the country,\r\nkeep in mind those who opposed its building up. Read the “Congressional\r\nRecord.” Find out the Senators and Congressmen who opposed the grants\r\nfor building the new ships; who opposed the purchase of armor, without\r\nwhich the ships were worthless; who opposed any adequate maintenance\r\nfor the Navy Department, and strove to cut down the number of men\r\nnecessary to man our fleets. The men who did these things were one\r\nand all working to bring disaster on the country. They have no share\r\nin the glory of Manila, in the honor of Santiago. They have no cause\r\nto feel proud of the valor of our sea-captains, of the renown of our\r\nflag. Their motives may or may not have been good, but their acts were\r\nheavily fraught with evil. They did ill for the national honor, and we\r\nwon in spite of their sinister opposition.\r\n\r\nNow, apply all this to our public men of to-day. Our army has never\r\nbeen built up as it should be built up. I shall not discuss with an\r\naudience like this the puerile suggestion that a nation of seventy\r\nmillions of freemen is in danger of losing its liberties from the\r\nexistence of an army of one hundred thousand men, three-fourths of\r\nwhom will be employed in certain foreign islands, in certain coast\r\nfortresses, and on Indian reservations. No man of good sense and stout\r\nheart can take such a proposition seriously. If we are such weaklings\r\nas the proposition implies, then we are unworthy of freedom in any\r\nevent. To no body of men in the United States is the country so much\r\nindebted as to the splendid officers and enlisted men of the regular\r\narmy and navy. There is no body from which the country has less to\r\nfear, and none of which it should be prouder, none which it should be\r\nmore anxious to upbuild.\r\n\r\nOur army needs complete reorganization,—not merely enlarging,—and the\r\nreorganization can only come as the result of legislation. A proper\r\ngeneral staff should be established, and the positions of ordnance,\r\ncommissary, and quartermaster officers should be filled by detail from\r\nthe line. Above all, the army must be given the chance to exercise\r\nin large bodies. Never again should we see, as we saw in the Spanish\r\nWar, major-generals in command of divisions who had never before\r\ncommanded three companies together in the field. Yet, incredible to\r\nrelate, Congress has shown a queer inability to learn some of the\r\nlessons of the war. There were large bodies of men in both branches\r\nwho opposed the declaration of war, who opposed the ratification of\r\npeace, who opposed the upbuilding of the army, and who even opposed\r\nthe purchase of armor at a reasonable price for the battleships and\r\ncruisers, thereby putting an absolute stop to the building of any new\r\nfighting-ships for the navy. If, during the years to come, any disaster\r\nshould befall our arms, afloat or ashore, and thereby any shame come\r\nto the United States, remember that the blame will lie upon the men\r\nwhose names appear upon the roll-calls of Congress on the wrong side of\r\nthese great questions. On them will lie the burden of any loss of our\r\nsoldiers and sailors, of any dishonor to the flag; and upon you and the\r\npeople of this country will lie the blame if you do not repudiate, in\r\nno unmistakable way, what these men have done. The blame will not rest\r\nupon the untrained commander of untried troops, upon the civil officers\r\nof a department the organization of which has been left utterly\r\ninadequate, or upon the admiral with an insufficient number of ships;\r\nbut upon the public men who have so lamentably failed in forethought as\r\nto refuse to remedy these evils long in advance, and upon the nation\r\nthat stands behind those public men.\r\n\r\nSo, at the present hour, no small share of the responsibility for the\r\nblood shed in the Philippines, the blood of our brothers, and the blood\r\nof their wild and ignorant foes, lies at the thresholds of those who so\r\nlong delayed the adoption of the treaty of peace, and of those who by\r\ntheir worse than foolish words deliberately invited a savage people to\r\nplunge into a war fraught with sure disaster for them—a war, too, in\r\nwhich our own brave men who follow the flag most pay with their blood\r\nfor the silly, mock humanitarianism of the prattlers who sit at home in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe army and the navy are the sword and the shield which this nation\r\nmust carry if she is to do her duty among the nations of the earth—if\r\nshe is not to stand merely as the China of the Western Hemisphere. Our\r\nproper conduct toward the tropic islands we have wrested from Spain\r\nis merely the form which our duty has taken at the moment. Of course\r\nwe are bound to handle the affairs of our own household well. We must\r\nsee that there is civic honesty, civic cleanliness, civic good sense\r\nin our home administration of city, State, and nation. We must strive\r\nfor honesty in office, for honesty toward the creditors of the nation\r\nand of the individual; for the widest freedom of individual initiative\r\nwhere possible, and for the wisest control of individual initiative\r\nwhere it is hostile to the welfare of the many. But because we set our\r\nown household in order we are not thereby excused from playing our part\r\nin the great affairs of the world. A man’s first duty is to his own\r\nhome, but he is not thereby excused from doing his duty to the State;\r\nfor if he fails in this second duty it is under the penalty of ceasing\r\nto be a freeman. In the same way, while a nation’s first duty is within\r\nits own borders, it is not thereby absolved from facing its duties in\r\nthe world as a whole; and if it refuses to do so, it merely forfeits\r\nits right to struggle for a place among the peoples that shape the\r\ndestiny of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies and the Philippines alike we are confronted by most\r\ndifficult problems. It is cowardly to shrink from solving them in\r\nthe proper way; for solved they must be, if not by us, then by some\r\nstronger and more manful race. If we are too weak, too selfish, or too\r\nfoolish to solve them, some bolder and abler people must undertake the\r\nsolution. Personally, I am far too firm a believer in the greatness of\r\nmy country and the power of my countrymen to admit for one moment that\r\nwe shall ever be driven to the ignoble alternative.\r\n\r\nThe problems are different for the different islands. Porto Rico is\r\nnot large enough to stand alone. We must govern it wisely and well,\r\nprimarily in the interest of its own people. Cuba is, in my judgment,\r\nentitled ultimately to settle for itself whether it shall be an\r\nindependent State or an integral portion of the mightiest of Republics.\r\nBut until order and stable liberty are secured, we must remain in the\r\nisland to ensure them, and infinite tact, judgment, moderation, and\r\ncourage must be shown by our military and civil representatives in\r\nkeeping the island pacified, in relentlessly stamping out brigandage,\r\nin protecting all alike, and yet in showing proper recognition to\r\nthe men who have fought for Cuban liberty. The Philippines offer a\r\nyet graver problem. Their population includes half-caste and native\r\nChristians, warlike Moslems, and wild pagans. Many of their people are\r\nutterly unfit for self-government, and show no signs of becoming fit.\r\nOthers may in time become fit, but at present can only take part in\r\nself-government under a wise supervision, at once firm and beneficent.\r\nWe have driven Spanish tyranny from the islands. If we now let it be\r\nreplaced by savage anarchy, our work has been for harm and not for\r\ngood. I have scant patience with those who fear to undertake the task\r\nof governing the Philippines, and who openly avow that they do fear\r\nto undertake it, or that they shrink from it because of the expense\r\nand trouble; but I have even scanter patience with those who make a\r\npretence of humanitarianism to hide and cover their timidity, and who\r\ncant about “liberty” and the “consent of the governed,” in order to\r\nexcuse themselves for their unwillingness to play the part of men.\r\nTheir doctrines, if carried out, would make it incumbent upon us to\r\nleave the Apaches of Arizona to work out their own salvation, and to\r\ndecline to interfere in a single Indian reservation. Their doctrines\r\ncondemn your forefathers and mine for ever having settled in these\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nEngland’s rule in India and Egypt has been of great benefit to England,\r\nfor it has trained up generations of men accustomed to look at the\r\nlarger and loftier side of public life. It has been of even greater\r\nbenefit to India and Egypt. And finally, and most of all, it has\r\nadvanced the cause of civilization. So, if we do our duty aright in the\r\nPhilippines, we will add to that national renown which is the highest\r\nand finest part of national life, we will greatly benefit the people of\r\nthe Philippine Islands, and, above all, we will play our part well in\r\nthe great work of uplifting mankind. But to do this work, keep ever in\r\nmind that we must show in a very high degree the qualities of courage,\r\nof honesty, and of good judgment. Resistance must be stamped out. The\r\nfirst and all-important work to be done is to establish the supremacy\r\nof our flag. We must put down armed resistance before we can accomplish\r\nanything else, and there should be no parleying, no faltering, in\r\ndealing with our foe. As for those in our own country who encourage the\r\nfoe, we can afford contemptuously to disregard them; but it must be\r\nremembered that their utterances are not saved from being treasonable\r\nmerely by the fact that they are despicable.\r\n\r\nWhen once we have put down armed resistance, when once our rule is\r\nacknowledged, then an even more difficult task will begin, for then\r\nwe must see to it that the islands are administered with absolute\r\nhonesty and with good judgment. If we let the public service of the\r\nislands be turned into the prey of the spoils politician, we shall have\r\nbegun to tread the path which Spain trod to her own destruction. We\r\nmust send out there only good and able men, chosen for their fitness,\r\nand not because of their partisan service, and these men must not\r\nonly administer impartial justice to the natives and serve their own\r\ngovernment with honesty and fidelity, but must show the utmost tact and\r\nfirmness, remembering that, with such people as those with whom we are\r\nto deal, weakness is the greatest of crimes, and that next to weakness\r\ncomes lack of consideration for their principles and prejudices.\r\n\r\nI preach to you, then, my countrymen, that our country calls not for\r\nthe life of ease but for the life of strenuous endeavor. The twentieth\r\ncentury looms before us big with the fate of many nations. If we stand\r\nidly by, if we seek merely swollen, slothful ease and ignoble peace,\r\nif we shrink from the hard contests where men must win at hazard of\r\ntheir lives and at the risk of all they hold dear, then the bolder\r\nand stronger peoples will pass us by, and will win for themselves the\r\ndomination of the world. Let us therefore boldly face the life of\r\nstrife, resolute to do our duty well and manfully; resolute to uphold\r\nrighteousness by deed and by word; resolute to be both honest and\r\nbrave, to serve high ideals, yet to use practical methods. Above all,\r\nlet us shrink from no strife, moral or physical, within or without the\r\nnation, provided we are certain that the strife is justified, for it is\r\nonly through strife, through hard and dangerous endeavor, that we shall\r\nultimately win the goal of true national greatness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPANSION AND PEACE\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED IN THE “INDEPENDENT,” DECEMBER 21, 1899\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the gentlest of our poets who wrote:\r\n\r\n    “Be bolde! Be bolde! and everywhere, Be bolde”;\r\n    Be not too bold! Yet better the excess\r\n    Than the defect; better the more than less.\r\n\r\nLongfellow’s love of peace was profound; but he was a man, and a wise\r\nman, and he knew that cowardice does not promote peace, and that even\r\nthe great evil of war may be a less evil than cringing to iniquity.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mahan, than whom there is not in the country a man whom we can\r\nmore appropriately designate by the fine and high phrase, “a Christian\r\ngentleman,” and who is incapable of advocating wrong-doing of any kind,\r\nnational or individual, gives utterance to the feeling of the great\r\nmajority of manly and thoughtful men when he denounces the great danger\r\nof indiscriminate advocacy of peace at any price, because “it may\r\nlead men to tamper with iniquity, to compromise with unrighteousness,\r\nsoothing their conscience with the belief that war is so entirely\r\nwrong that beside it no other tolerated evil is wrong. Witness Armenia\r\nand witness Crete. War has been avoided; but what of the national\r\nconsciences that beheld such iniquity and withheld the hand?”\r\n\r\nPeace is a great good; and doubly harmful, therefore, is the attitude\r\nof those who advocate it in terms that would make it synonymous with\r\nselfish and cowardly shrinking from warring against the existence of\r\nevil. The wisest and most far-seeing champions of peace will ever\r\nremember that, in the first place, to be good it must be righteous, for\r\nunrighteous and cowardly peace may be worse than any war; and, in the\r\nsecond place, that it can often be obtained only at the cost of war.\r\nLet me take two illustrations:\r\n\r\nThe great blot upon European international morality in the closing\r\ndecade of this century has been not a war, but the infamous peace kept\r\nby the joint action of the great powers, while Turkey inflicted the\r\nlast horrors of butchery, torture, and outrage upon the men, women,\r\nand children of despairing Armenia. War was avoided; peace was kept;\r\nbut what a peace! Infinitely greater human misery was inflicted during\r\nthis peace than in the late wars of Germany with France, of Russia with\r\nTurkey; and this misery fell, not on armed men, but upon defenceless\r\nwomen and children, upon the gray-beard and the stripling no less than\r\nupon the head of the family; and it came, not in the mere form of\r\ndeath or imprisonment, but of tortures upon men, and, above all, upon\r\nwomen, too horrible to relate—tortures of which it is too terrible\r\neven to think. Moreover, no good resulted from the bloodshed and\r\nmisery. Often this is the case in a war, but often it is not the case.\r\nThe result of the last Turko-Russian war was an immense and permanent\r\nincrease of happiness for Bulgaria, Servia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina.\r\nThese provinces became independent or passed under the dominion of\r\nAustria, and the advantage that accrued to them because of this\r\nexpansion of the domain of civilization at the expense of barbarism\r\nhas been simply incalculable. This expansion produced peace, and put a\r\nstop to the ceaseless, grinding, bloody tyranny that had desolated the\r\nBalkans for so many centuries. There are many excellent people who have\r\npraised Tolstoi’s fantastic religious doctrines, his fantastic advocacy\r\nof peace. The same quality that makes the debauchee and the devotee\r\nalternate in certain decadent families, the hysterical development\r\nwhich leads to violent emotional reaction in a morbid nature from vice\r\nto virtue, also leads to the creation of Tolstoi’s “Kreutzer Sonata”\r\non the one hand, and of his unhealthy peace-mysticism on the other. A\r\nsane and healthy mind would be as incapable of the moral degradation of\r\nthe novel as of the decadent morality of the philosophy. If Tolstoi’s\r\ncountrymen had acted according to his moral theories they would now\r\nbe extinct, and savages would have taken their place. Unjust war is\r\na terrible sin. It does not nowadays in the aggregate cause anything\r\nlike the misery that is caused in the aggregate by unjust dealing\r\ntoward one’s neighbors in the commercial and social world; and to\r\ncondemn all war is just as logical as to condemn all business and\r\nall social relations, as to condemn love and marriage because of the\r\nfrightful misery caused by brutal and unregulated passion. If Russia\r\nhad acted upon Tolstoi’s philosophy, all its people would long ago\r\nhave disappeared from the face of the earth, and the country would now\r\nbe occupied by wandering tribes of Tartar barbarians. The Armenian\r\nmassacres are simply illustrations on a small scale of what would\r\ntake place on the very largest scale if Tolstoi’s principles became\r\nuniversal among civilized people. It is not necessary to point out\r\nthat the teaching which would produce such a condition of things is\r\nfundamentally immoral.\r\n\r\nAgain, peace may come only through war. There are men in our country\r\nwho seemingly forget that at the outbreak of the Civil War the great\r\ncry raised by the opponents of the war was the cry for peace. One of\r\nthe most amusing and most biting satires written by the friends of\r\nunion and liberty during the Civil War was called the “New Gospel of\r\nPeace,” in derision of this attitude. The men in our own country who,\r\nin the name of peace, have been encouraging Aguinaldo and his people\r\nto shoot down our soldiers in the Philippines might profit not a\r\nlittle if they would look back to the days of the bloody draft riots,\r\nwhich were deliberately incited in the name of peace and free speech,\r\nwhen the mob killed men and women in the streets and burned orphan\r\nchildren in the asylums as a protest against the war. Four years of\r\nbloody struggle with an armed foe, who was helped at every turn by the\r\nself-styled advocates of peace, were needed in order to restore the\r\nUnion; but the result has been that the peace of this continent has\r\nbeen effectually assured. Had the short-sighted advocates of peace for\r\nthe moment had their way, and secession become an actual fact, nothing\r\ncould have prevented a repetition in North America of the devastating\r\nanarchic warfare that obtained for three quarters of a century in\r\nSouth America after the yoke of Spain was thrown off. We escaped\r\ngenerations of anarchy and bloodshed, because our fathers who upheld\r\nLincoln and followed Grant were men in every sense of the term, with\r\ntoo much common sense to be misled by those who preached that war was\r\nalways wrong, and with a fund of stern virtue deep in their souls which\r\nenabled them to do deeds from which men of over-soft natures would have\r\nshrunk appalled.\r\n\r\nWars between civilized communities are very dreadful, and as nations\r\ngrow more and more civilized we have every reason, not merely to\r\nhope, but to believe that they will grow rarer and rarer. Even with\r\ncivilized peoples, as was shown by our own experience in 1861, it\r\nmay be necessary at last to draw the sword rather than to submit to\r\nwrong-doing. But a very marked feature in the world-history of the\r\npresent century has been the growing infrequency of wars between\r\ngreat civilized nations. The Peace Conference at The Hague is but one\r\nof the signs of this growth. I am among those who believe that much\r\nwas accomplished at that conference, and I am proud of the leading\r\nposition taken in the conference by our delegates. Incidentally I may\r\nmention that the testimony is unanimous that they were able to take\r\nthis leading position chiefly because we had just emerged victorious\r\nfrom our most righteous war with Spain. Scant attention is paid to the\r\nweakling or the coward who babbles of peace; but due heed is given to\r\nthe strong man with the sword girt on thigh who preaches peace, not\r\nfrom ignoble motives, not from fear or distrust of his own powers, but\r\nfrom a deep sense of moral obligation.\r\n\r\nThe growth of peacefulness between nations, however, has been confined\r\nstrictly to those that are civilized. It can only come when both\r\nparties to a possible quarrel feel the same spirit. With a barbarous\r\nnation peace is the exceptional condition. On the border between\r\ncivilization and barbarism war is generally normal because it must be\r\nunder the conditions of barbarism. Whether the barbarian be the Red\r\nIndian on the frontier of the United States, the Afghan on the border\r\nof British India, or the Turkoman who confronts the Siberian Cossack,\r\nthe result is the same. In the long run civilized man finds he can keep\r\nthe peace only by subduing his barbarian neighbor; for the barbarian\r\nwill yield only to force, save in instances so exceptional that they\r\nmay be disregarded. Back of the force must come fair dealing, if the\r\npeace is to be permanent. But without force fair dealing usually\r\namounts to nothing. In our history we have had more trouble from the\r\nIndian tribes whom we pampered and petted than from those we wronged;\r\nand this has been true in Siberia, Hindustan, and Africa.\r\n\r\nEvery expansion of civilization makes for peace. In other words,\r\nevery expansion of a great civilized power means a victory for law,\r\norder, and righteousness. This has been the case in every instance of\r\nexpansion during the present century, whether the expanding power were\r\nFrance or England, Russia or America. In every instance the expansion\r\nhas been of benefit, not so much to the power nominally benefited,\r\nas to the whole world. In every instance the result proved that the\r\nexpanding power was doing a duty to civilization far greater and more\r\nimportant than could have been done by any stationary power. Take the\r\ncase of France and Algiers. During the early decades of the present\r\ncentury piracy of the most dreadful description was rife on the\r\nMediterranean, and thousands of civilized men were yearly dragged into\r\nslavery by the Moorish pirates. A degrading peace was purchased by the\r\ncivilized powers by the payment of tribute. Our own country was one\r\namong the tributary nations which thus paid blood-money to the Moslem\r\nbandits of the sea. We fought occasional battles with them; and so, on\r\na larger scale, did the English. But peace did not follow, because the\r\ncountry was not occupied. Our last payment was made in 1830, and the\r\nreason it was the last was because in that year the French conquest of\r\nAlgiers began. Foolish sentimentalists, like those who wrote little\r\npoems in favor of the Mahdists against the English, and who now write\r\nlittle essays in favor of Aguinaldo against the Americans, celebrated\r\nthe Algerian freebooters as heroes who were striving for liberty\r\nagainst the invading French. But the French continued to do their\r\nwork; France expanded over Algiers, and the result was that piracy on\r\nthe Mediterranean came to an end, and Algiers has thriven as never\r\nbefore in its history. On an even larger scale the same thing is true\r\nof England and the Soudan. The expansion of England throughout the\r\nNile valley has been an incalculable gain for civilization. Any one\r\nwho reads the writings of the Austrian priests and laymen who were\r\nprisoners in the Soudan under the Mahdi will realize that when England\r\ncrushed him and conquered the Soudan she conferred a priceless boon\r\nupon humanity and made the civilized world her debtor. Again, the same\r\nthing is true of the Russian advance in Asia. As in the Soudan the\r\nEnglish conquest is followed by peace, and the endless massacres of the\r\nMahdi are stopped forever, so the Russian conquest of the khanates of\r\ncentral Asia meant the cessation of the barbarous warfare under which\r\nAsian civilization had steadily withered away since the days of Genghis\r\nKhan, and the substitution in its place of the reign of peace and\r\norder. All civilization has been the gainer by the Russian advance, as\r\nit was the gainer by the advance of France in North Africa; as it has\r\nbeen the gainer by the advance of England in both Asia and Africa, both\r\nCanada and Australia. Above all, there has been the greatest possible\r\ngain in peace. The rule of law and of order has succeeded to the rule\r\nof barbarous and bloody violence. Until the great civilized nations\r\nstepped in there was no chance for anything but such bloody violence.\r\n\r\nSo it has been in the history of our own country. Of course our whole\r\nnational history has been one of expansion. Under Washington and Adams\r\nwe expanded westward to the Mississippi; under Jefferson we expanded\r\nacross the continent to the mouth of the Columbia; under Monroe we\r\nexpanded into Florida; and then into Texas and California; and finally,\r\nlargely through the instrumentality of Seward, into Alaska; while under\r\nevery administration the process of expansion in the great plains\r\nand the Rockies has continued with growing rapidity. While we had a\r\nfrontier the chief feature of frontier life was the endless war between\r\nthe settlers and the red men. Sometimes the immediate occasion for the\r\nwar was to be found in the conduct of the whites and sometimes in that\r\nof the reds, but the ultimate cause was simply that we were in contact\r\nwith a country held by savages or half-savages.\r\n\r\nWhere we abut on Canada there is no danger of war, nor is there any\r\ndanger where we abut on the well-settled regions of Mexico. But\r\nelsewhere war had to continue until we expanded over the country. Then\r\nit was succeeded at once by a peace which has remained unbroken to\r\nthe present day. In North America, as elsewhere throughout the entire\r\nworld, the expansion of a civilized nation has invariably meant the\r\ngrowth of the area in which peace is normal throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe same will be true of the Philippines. If the men who have counseled\r\nnational degradation, national dishonor, by urging us to leave the\r\nPhilippines and put the Aguinaldan oligarchy in control of those\r\nislands, could have their way, we should merely turn them over to\r\nrapine and bloodshed until some stronger, manlier power stepped in\r\nto do the task we had shown ourselves fearful of performing. But, as\r\nit is, this country will keep the islands and will establish therein\r\na stable and orderly government, so that one more fair spot of the\r\nworld’s surface shall have been snatched from the forces of darkness.\r\nFundamentally the cause of expansion is the cause of peace.\r\n\r\nWith civilized powers there is but little danger of our getting into\r\nwar. In the Pacific, for instance, the great progressive, colonizing\r\nnations are England and Germany. With England we have recently begun to\r\nfeel ties of kindness as well as of kinship, and with her our relations\r\nare better than ever before; and so they ought to be with Germany.\r\nRecently affairs in Samoa have been straightened out, although there we\r\nsuffered from the worst of all types of government, one in which three\r\npowers had a joint responsibility (the type, by the way, which some\r\nof the anti-imperialists actually advocated our introducing in the\r\nPhilippines, under the pretence of rendering them neutral). This was\r\naccomplished very largely because the three nations set good-humoredly\r\nto work to come to an agreement which would do justice to all. In the\r\npreliminary negotiations the agents of America and Germany were Mr.\r\nTripp and Baron Sternburg. No difficulty can ever arise between Germany\r\nand the United States which will not be settled with satisfaction to\r\nboth, if the negotiations are conducted by such representatives of\r\nthe two powers as these two men. What is necessary is to approach the\r\nsubject, not with a desire to get ahead of one another, but to do even\r\nand exact justice, and to put into operation a scheme which will work,\r\nwhile scrupulously conserving the honor and interest of all concerned.\r\n\r\nNations that expand and nations that do not expand may both ultimately\r\ngo down, but the one leaves heirs and a glorious memory, and the other\r\nleaves neither. The Roman expanded, and he has left a memory which has\r\nprofoundly influenced the history of mankind, and he has further left\r\nas the heirs of his body, and, above all, of his tongue and culture,\r\nthe so-called Latin peoples of Europe and America. Similarly to-day\r\nit is the great expanding peoples who bequeath to the future ages the\r\ngreat memories and material results of their achievements, and the\r\nnations which shall have sprung from their loins, England standing as\r\nthe archetype and best exemplar of all such mighty nations. But the\r\npeoples that do not expand leave, and can leave, nothing behind them.\r\n\r\nIt is only the warlike power of a civilized people that can give peace\r\nto the world. The Arab wrecked the civilization of the Mediterranean\r\ncoasts, the Turk wrecked the civilization of southeastern Europe, and\r\nthe Tartar desolated from China to Russia and to Persia, setting back\r\nthe progress of the world for centuries, solely because the civilized\r\nnations opposed to them had lost the great fighting qualities, and,\r\nin becoming overpeaceful, had lost the power of keeping peace with\r\na strong hand. Their passing away marked the beginning of a period\r\nof chaotic barbarian warfare. Those whose memories are not so short\r\nas to have forgotten the defeat of the Greeks by the Turks, of the\r\nItalians by the Abyssinians, and the feeble campaigns waged by Spain\r\nagainst feeble Morocco, must realize that at the present moment the\r\nMediterranean coasts would be overrun either by the Turks or by\r\nthe Soudan Mahdists if these warlike barbarians had only to fear\r\nthose southern European powers which have lost the fighting edge.\r\nSuch a barbarian conquest would mean endless war; and the fact that\r\nnowadays the reverse takes place, and that the barbarians recede\r\nor are conquered, with the attendant fact that peace follows their\r\nretrogression or conquest, is due solely to the power of the mighty\r\ncivilized races which have not lost the fighting instinct, and which by\r\ntheir expansion are gradually bringing peace into the red wastes where\r\nthe barbarian peoples of the world hold sway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AMONG REFORMERS\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED IN THE “CENTURY,” JUNE, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of Miss Mary E. Wilkins’s delightful heroines remarks, in speaking\r\nof certain would-be leaders of social reform in her village: “I don’t\r\nknow that I think they are so much above us as too far to one side.\r\nSometimes it is longitude and sometimes it is latitude that separates\r\npeople.” This is true, and the philosophy it teaches applies quite as\r\nmuch to those who would reform the politics of a large city, or, for\r\nthat matter, of the whole country, as to those who would reform the\r\nsociety of a hamlet.\r\n\r\nThere is always danger of being misunderstood when one writes about\r\nsuch a subject as this, because there are on each side unhealthy\r\nextremists who like to take half of any statement and twist it into an\r\nargument in favor of themselves or against their opponents. No single\r\nsentence or two is sufficient to explain a man’s full meaning, any more\r\nthan in a sentence or two it would be possible to treat the question of\r\nthe necessity for, and the limitations of, proper party loyalty, with\r\nthe thoroughness and justice shown, for instance, by Mr. Lecky in his\r\nrecent queerly named volume, “The Map of Life.”\r\n\r\nAll men in whose character there is not an element of hardened baseness\r\nmust admit the need in our public life of those qualities which we\r\nsomewhat vaguely group together when we speak of “reform,” and all men\r\nof sound mind must also admit the need of efficiency. There are, of\r\ncourse, men of such low moral type, or of such ingrained cynicism, that\r\nthey do not believe in the possibility of making anything better, or\r\ndo not care to see things better. There are also men who are slightly\r\ndisordered mentally, or who are cursed with a moral twist which\r\nmakes them champion reforms less from a desire to do good to others\r\nthan as a kind of tribute to their own righteousness, for the sake\r\nof emphasizing their own superiority. From neither of these classes\r\ncan we get any real help in the unending struggle for righteousness.\r\nThere remains the great body of the people, including the entire body\r\nof those through whom the salvation of the people must ultimately be\r\nworked out. All these men combine or seek to combine in varying degrees\r\nthe quality of striving after the ideal, that is, the quality which\r\nmakes men reformers, and the quality of so striving through practical\r\nmethods—the quality which makes men efficient. Both qualities are\r\nabsolutely essential. The absence of either makes the presence of the\r\nother worthless or worse.\r\n\r\nIf there is one tendency of the day which more than any other\r\nis unhealthy and undesirable, it is the tendency to deify mere\r\n“smartness,” unaccompanied by a sense of moral accountability. We\r\nshall never make our Republic what it should be until as a people we\r\nthoroughly understand and put in practice the doctrine that success is\r\nabhorrent if attained by the sacrifice of the fundamental principles\r\nof morality. The successful man, whether in business or in politics,\r\nwho has risen by conscienceless swindling of his neighbors, by deceit\r\nand chicanery, by unscrupulous boldness and unscrupulous cunning,\r\nstands toward society as a dangerous wild beast. The mean and cringing\r\nadmiration which such a career commands among those who think crookedly\r\nor not at all makes this kind of success perhaps the most dangerous of\r\nall the influences that threaten our national life. Our standard of\r\npublic and private conduct will never be raised to the proper level\r\nuntil we make the scoundrel who succeeds feel the weight of a hostile\r\npublic opinion even more strongly than the scoundrel who fails.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, mere beating the air, mere visionary adherence to a\r\nnebulous and possibly highly undesirable ideal, is utterly worthless.\r\nThe cloistered virtue which timidly shrinks from all contact with the\r\nrough world of actual life, and the uneasy, self-conscious vanity which\r\nmisnames itself virtue, and which declines to co-operate with whatever\r\ndoes not adopt its own fantastic standard, are rather worse than\r\nvalueless, because they tend to rob the forces of good of elements on\r\nwhich they ought to be able to count in the ceaseless contest with the\r\nforces of evil. It is true that the impracticable idealist differs from\r\nthe hard-working, sincere man who in practical fashion, and by deeds as\r\nwell as by words, strives in some sort actually to realize his ideal;\r\nbut the difference lies in the fact that the first is impracticable,\r\nnot in his having a high ideal, for the ideal of the other may be even\r\nhigher. At times a man must cut loose from his associates, and stand\r\nalone for a great cause; but the necessity for such action is almost\r\nas rare as the necessity for a revolution; and to take such ground\r\ncontinually, in season and out of season, is the sign of an unhealthy\r\nnature. It is not possible to lay down an inflexible rule as to when\r\ncompromise is right and when wrong; when it is a sign of the highest\r\nstatesmanship to temporize, and when it is merely a proof of weakness.\r\nNow and then one can stand uncompromisingly for a naked principle and\r\nforce people up to it. This is always the attractive course; but in\r\ncertain great crises it may be a very wrong course. Compromise, in the\r\nproper sense, merely means agreement; in the proper sense opportunism\r\nshould merely mean doing the best possible with actual conditions as\r\nthey exist. A compromise which results in a half-step toward evil is\r\nall wrong, just as the opportunist who saves himself for the moment by\r\nadopting a policy which is fraught with future disaster is all wrong;\r\nbut no less wrong is the attitude of those who will not come to an\r\nagreement through which, or will not follow the course by which, it is\r\nalone possible to accomplish practical results for good.\r\n\r\nThese two attitudes, the attitude of deifying mere efficiency, mere\r\nsuccess, without regard to the moral qualities lying behind it and the\r\nattitude of disregarding efficiency, disregarding practical results,\r\nare the Scylla and Charybdis between which every earnest reformer,\r\nevery politician who desires to make the name of his profession a term\r\nof honor instead of shame, must steer. He must avoid both under penalty\r\nof wreckage, and it avails him nothing to have avoided one, if he\r\nfounders on the other. People are apt to speak as if in political life,\r\npublic life, it ought to be a mere case of striving upward—striving\r\ntoward a high peak. The simile is inexact. Every man who is striving\r\nto do good public work is traveling along a ridge crest, with the gulf\r\nof failure on each side—the gulf of inefficiency on the one side,\r\nthe gulf of unrighteousness on the other. All kinds of forces are\r\ncontinually playing on him, to shove him first into one gulf and then\r\ninto the other; and even a wise and good man, unless he braces himself\r\nwith uncommon firmness and foresight, as he is pushed this way and\r\nthat, will find that his course becomes a pronounced zigzag instead\r\nof a straight line; and if it becomes too pronounced he is lost, no\r\nmatter to which side the zigzag may take him. Nor is he lost only as\r\nregards his own career. What is far more serious, his power of doing\r\nuseful service to the public is at an end. He may still, if a mere\r\npolitician, have political place, or, if a make-believe reformer,\r\nretain that notoriety upon which his vanity feeds. But, in either case,\r\nhis usefulness to the community has ceased.\r\n\r\nThe man who sacrifices everything to efficiency needs but a short\r\nshrift in a discussion like this. The abler he is, the more dangerous\r\nhe is to the community. The master and typical representative of a\r\ngreat municipal political organization recently stated under oath that\r\n“he was in politics for his pocket every time.” This put in its baldest\r\nand most cynically offensive shape the doctrine upon which certain\r\npublic men act. It is not necessary to argue its iniquity with those\r\nwho have advanced any great distance beyond the brigand theory of\r\npolitical life. Some years ago another public man enunciated much the\r\nsame doctrine in the phrase, “The Decalogue and the Golden Rule have no\r\npart in political life.” Such statements, openly made, imply a belief\r\nthat the public conscience is dull; and where the men who make them\r\ncontinue to be political leaders, the public has itself to thank for\r\nall shortcomings in public life.\r\n\r\nThe man who is constitutionally incapable of working for practical\r\nresults ought not to need a much longer shrift. In every community\r\nthere are little knots of fantastic extremists who loudly proclaim that\r\nthey are striving for righteousness, and who, in reality, do their\r\nfeeble best for unrighteousness. Just as the upright politician should\r\nhold in peculiar scorn the man who makes the name of politician a\r\nreproach and a shame, so the genuine reformer should realize that the\r\ncause he champions is especially jeopardized by the mock reformer who\r\ndoes what he can to make reform a laughing-stock among decent men.\r\n\r\nA caustic observer once remarked that when Dr. Johnson spoke of\r\npatriotism as the last refuge of a scoundrel, “he was ignorant of the\r\ninfinite possibilities contained in the word ‘reform.’” The sneer was\r\ndiscreditable to the man who uttered it, for it is no more possible\r\nto justify corruption by railing at those who by their conduct throw\r\nscandal upon the cause of reform than it is to justify treason by\r\nshowing that men of shady character frequently try to cover their\r\nmisconduct by fervent protestations of love of country. Nevertheless,\r\nthe fact remains that exactly as true patriots should be especially\r\njealous of any appeal to what is base under the guise of patriotism, so\r\nmen who strive for honesty, and for the cleansing of what is corrupt\r\nin the dark places of our politics, should emphatically disassociate\r\nthemselves from the men whose antics throw discredit upon the reforms\r\nthey profess to advocate.\r\n\r\nThese little knots of extremists are found everywhere, one type\r\nflourishing chiefly in one locality and another type in another. In\r\nthe particular objects they severally profess to champion they are as\r\nfar asunder as the poles, for one of their characteristics is that\r\neach little group has its own patent recipe for salvation and pays no\r\nattention whatever to the other little groups; but in mental and moral\r\nhabit they are fundamentally alike. They may be socialists of twenty\r\ndifferent types, from the followers of Tolstoi down and up, or they may\r\nostensibly champion some cause in itself excellent, such as temperance\r\nor municipal reform, or they may merely with comprehensive vagueness\r\nannounce themselves as the general enemies of what is bad, of corrupt,\r\nmachine politics, and the like. Their policies and principles are\r\nusually mutually exclusive; but that does not alter the conviction,\r\nwhich each feels or affects to feel, that his particular group is the\r\nreal vanguard of the army of reform. Of course, as the particular\r\ngroups are all marching in different directions, it is not possible for\r\nmore than one of them to be the vanguard. The others, at best, must\r\nbe off to one side, and may possibly be marching the wrong way in the\r\nrear; and, as a matter of fact, it is only occasionally that any one of\r\nthem is in the front. There are in each group many entirely sincere and\r\nhonest men, and because of the presence of these men we are too apt to\r\npay some of their associates the unmerited compliment of speaking of\r\nthem also as honest but impracticable. As a matter of fact, the typical\r\nextremist of this kind differs from the practical reformer, from the\r\npublic man who strives in practical fashion for decency, not at all\r\nin superior morality, but in inferior sense. He is not more virtuous;\r\nhe is less virtuous. He is merely more foolish. When Wendell Phillips\r\ndenounced Abraham Lincoln as “the slave-hound of Illinois,” he did not\r\nshow himself more virtuous than Lincoln, but more foolish. Neither did\r\nhe advance the cause of human freedom. When the contest for the Union\r\nand against slavery took on definite shape then he and his kind were\r\nswept aside by the statesmen and soldiers, like Lincoln and Seward,\r\nGrant and Farragut, who alone were able to ride the storm. Great as\r\nis the superiority in efficiency of the men who do things over those\r\nwho do not, it may be no greater than their superiority in morality.\r\nIn addition to the simple and sincere men who have a twist in their\r\nmental make-up, these knots of enthusiasts contain, especially among\r\ntheir leaders, men of morbid vanity, who thirst for notoriety, men who\r\nlack power to accomplish anything if they go in with their fellows to\r\nfight for results, and who prefer to sit outside and attract momentary\r\nattention by denouncing those who are really forces for good.\r\n\r\nIn every community in our land there are many hundreds of earnest and\r\nsincere men, clergymen and laymen, reformers who strive for reform in\r\nthe field of politics, in the field of philanthropy, in the field of\r\nsocial life; and we could count on the fingers of one hand the number\r\nof times these men have been really aided in their efforts by the men\r\nof the type referred to in the preceding paragraph. The socialist who\r\nraves against the existing order is not the man who ever lifts his\r\nhand practically to make our social life a little better, to make the\r\nconditions that bear upon the unfortunate a little easier; the man who\r\ndemands the immediate impossible in temperance is not the man who ever\r\naids in an effort to minimize the evils caused by the saloon; and those\r\nwho work practically for political reform are hampered, so far as\r\nthey are affected at all, by the strutting vanity of the professional\r\nimpracticables.\r\n\r\nIt is not that these little knots of men accomplish much of a\r\npositive nature that is objectionable, for their direct influence is\r\ninconsiderable; but they do have an undoubted indirect effect for bad,\r\nand this of a double kind. They affect for evil a certain number of\r\ndecent men in one way and a certain number of equally decent men in an\r\nentirely different way. Some decent men, following their lead, withdraw\r\nthemselves from the active work of life, whether social, philanthropic,\r\nor political, and by the amount they thus withdraw from the side of\r\nthe forces of good they strengthen the forces of evil, as, of course,\r\nit makes no difference whether we lessen the numerator or increase the\r\ndenominator. Other decent men are so alienated by such conduct that\r\nin their turn they abandon all effort to fight for reform, believing\r\nreformers to be either hypocrites or fools. Both of these phenomena\r\nare perfectly familiar to every active politician who has striven for\r\ndecency, and to every man who has studied history in an intelligent\r\nway. Few things hurt a good cause more than the excesses of its nominal\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nFortunately, most extremists lack the power to commit dangerous\r\nexcesses. Their action is normally as abortive as that of the queer\r\nabolitionist who, in 1864, nominated a candidate against Abraham\r\nLincoln when he was running for re-election to the Presidency. The men\r\nentering this movement represented all extremes, moral and mental.\r\nNominally they opposed Lincoln because they did not feel that he had\r\ngone far enough in what they deemed the right direction,—had not\r\nbeen sufficiently extreme,—and they objected to what they styled his\r\nopportunism, his tendency to compromise, his temporizing conduct,\r\nand his being a practical politician. In reality, of course, their\r\nopposition to Lincoln was conditioned, not upon what Lincoln had\r\ndone, but upon their own natures. They were incapable of supporting\r\na great constructive statesman in a great crisis; and this, not\r\nbecause they were too virtuous, but because they lacked the necessary\r\ncommon-sense and power of subordination of self to enable them to\r\nwork disinterestedly with others for the common good. Their movement,\r\nhowever, proved utterly abortive, and they had no effect even for evil.\r\nThe sound, wholesome common-sense of the American people fortunately\r\nrenders such movements, as a rule, innocuous; and this is, in reality,\r\nthe prime reason why republican government prospers in America, as it\r\ndoes not prosper, for instance, in France. With us these little knots\r\nof impracticables have an insignificant effect upon the national life,\r\nand no representation to speak of in our governmental assemblies. In\r\nFrance, where the nation has not the habit of self-government, and\r\nwhere the national spirit is more volatile and less sane, each little\r\ngroup grows until it becomes a power for evil, and, taken together, all\r\nthe little groups give to French political life its curious, and by no\r\nmeans elevating, kaleidoscopic character.\r\n\r\nMacaulay’s eminently sane and wholesome spirit and his knowledge\r\nof practical affairs give him a peculiar value among historians\r\nof political thought. In speaking of Scotland at the end of the\r\nseventeenth century he writes as follows:\r\n\r\n“It is a remarkable circumstance that the same country should have\r\nproduced in the same age the most wonderful specimens of both extremes\r\nof human nature. Even in things indifferent the Scotch Puritan would\r\nhear of no compromise; and he was but too ready to consider all who\r\nrecommended prudence and charity as traitors to the cause of truth. On\r\nthe other hand, the Scotchmen of that generation who made a figure in\r\nParliament were the most dishonest and unblushing time-servers that the\r\nworld has ever seen. Perhaps it is natural that the most callous and\r\nimpudent vice should be found in the near neighborhood of unreasonable\r\nand impracticable virtue. Where enthusiasts are ready to destroy or\r\nbe destroyed for trifles magnified into importance by a squeamish\r\nconscience, it is not strange that the very name of conscience should\r\nbecome a byword of contempt to cool and shrewd men of business.”\r\n\r\nWhat he says of Scotland in the time of King James and King William is\r\ntrue, word for word, of civic life in New York two centuries later.\r\nWe see in New York sodden masses of voters manipulated by clever,\r\nunscrupulous, and utterly selfish masters of machine politics. Against\r\nthem we see, it is true, masses of voters who both know how to, and\r\ndo, strive for righteousness; but we see also very many others in whom\r\nthe capacity for self-government seems to have atrophied. They have\r\nlost the power to do practical work by ceasing to exercise it, by\r\nconfining themselves to criticism and theorizing, to intemperate abuse\r\nand intemperate championship of what they but imperfectly understand.\r\nThe analogues of the men whom Macaulay condemns exist in numbers in\r\nNew York, and work evil in our public life for the very reason that\r\nMacaulay gives. They do not do practical work, and the extreme folly\r\nof their position makes them not infrequently the allies of scoundrels\r\nwho cynically practice corruption. Too often, indeed, they actually\r\nalienate from the cause of decency keen and honest men, who grow to\r\nregard all movements for reform with contemptuous dislike because\r\nof the folly and vanity of the men who in the name of righteousness\r\npreach unwisdom and practice uncharitableness. These men thus do\r\ninestimable damage; for the reform spirit, the spirit of striving after\r\nhigh ideals, is the breath of life in our political institutions; and\r\nwhatever weakens it by just so much lessens the chance of ultimate\r\nsuccess under democratic government.\r\n\r\nDiscarding the two extremes, the men who deliberately work for evil,\r\nand the men who are unwilling or incapable of working for good, there\r\nremains the great mass of men who do desire to be efficient, who do\r\ndesire to make this world a better place to live in, and to do what\r\nthey can toward achieving cleaner minds and more wholesome bodies. To\r\nthese, after all, we can only say: Strive manfully for righteousness,\r\nand strive so as to make your efforts for good count. You are not to be\r\nexcused if you fail to try to make things better; and the very phrase\r\n“trying to make things better” implies trying in practical fashion. One\r\nman’s capacity is for one kind of work and another man’s capacity for\r\nanother kind of work. One affects certain methods and another affects\r\nentirely different methods. All this is of little concern. What is of\r\nreally vital importance is that something should be accomplished, and\r\nthat this something should be worthy of accomplishment. The field is\r\nof vast size, and the laborers are always too few. There is not the\r\nslightest excuse for one sincere worker looking down upon another\r\nbecause he chooses a different part of the field and different\r\nimplements. It is inexcusable to refuse to work, to work slackly or\r\nperversely, or to mar the work of others.\r\n\r\nNo man is justified in doing evil on the ground of expediency. He is\r\nbound to do all the good possible. Yet he must consider the question\r\nof expediency, in order that he may do all the good possible, for\r\notherwise he will do none. As soon as a politician gets to the point\r\nof thinking that in order to be “practical” he has got to be base,\r\nhe has become a noxious member of the body politic. That species of\r\npracticability eats into the moral sense of the people like a cancer,\r\nand he who practices it can no more be excused than an editor who\r\ndebauches public decency in order to sell his paper.\r\n\r\nWe need the worker in the fields of social and civic reform; the man\r\nwho is keenly interested in some university settlement, some civic club\r\nor citizens’ association which is striving to elevate the standard of\r\nlife. We need clean, healthy newspapers, with clean, healthy criticism\r\nwhich shall be fearless and truthful. We need upright politicians,\r\nwho will take the time and trouble, and who possess the capacity, to\r\nmanage caucuses, conventions, and public assemblies. We need men who\r\ntry to be their poorer brothers’ keepers to the extent of befriending\r\nthem and working with them so far as they are willing; men who work\r\nin charitable associations, or, what is even better, strive to get\r\ninto touch with the wage-workers, to understand them, and to champion\r\ntheir cause when it is just. We need the sound and healthy idealist;\r\nthe theoretic writer, preacher, or teacher; the Emerson or Phillips\r\nBrooks, who helps to create the atmosphere of enthusiasm and practical\r\nendeavor. In public life we need not only men who are able to work\r\nin and through their parties, but also upright, fearless, rational\r\nindependents, who will deal impartial justice to all men and all\r\nparties. We need men who are far-sighted and resolute; men who combine\r\nsincerity with sanity. We need scholarly men, too—men who study all\r\nthe difficult questions of our political life from the standpoint both\r\nof practice and of theory; men who thus study trusts, or municipal\r\ngovernment, or finance, or taxation, or civil-service reform, as the\r\nauthors of the “Federalist” studied the problems of federal government.\r\n\r\nIn closing, let me again dwell upon the point I am seeking to\r\nemphasize, so that there shall be no chance of honest misunderstanding\r\nof what I say. It is vital that every man who is in politics, as a man\r\nought to be, with a disinterested purpose to serve the public, should\r\nstrive steadily for reform; that he should have the highest ideals. He\r\nmust lead, only he must lead in the right direction, and normally he\r\nmust be in sight of his followers. Cynicism in public life is a curse,\r\nand when a man has lost the power of enthusiasm for righteousness it\r\nwill be better for him and the country if he abandons public life.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the political reformer must not permit himself to be driven\r\nfrom his duty of supporting what is right by any irritation at the men\r\nwho, while nominally supporting the same objects, and even ridiculing\r\nhim as a backslider or an “opportunist,” yet by their levity or\r\nfanaticism do damage to the cause which he really serves, and which\r\nthey profess to serve. Let him disregard them; for though they are,\r\naccording to their ability, the foes of decent politics, yet, after\r\nall, they are but weaklings, and the real and dangerous enemies of\r\nthe cause he holds dear are those sinister beings who batten on the\r\nevil of our political system, and both profit by its existence, and\r\nby their own existence tend to perpetuate and increase it. We must\r\nnot be diverted from our warfare with these powerful and efficient\r\ncorruptionists by irritation at the vain prattlers who think they are\r\nat the head of the reform forces, whereas they are really wandering in\r\nbypaths in the rear.\r\n\r\nThe professional impracticable, the man who sneers at the sane and\r\nhonest strivers after good, who sneers at the men who are following,\r\nhowever humbly, in the footsteps of those who worked for and secured\r\npractical results in the days of Washington, and again in the days\r\nof Lincoln, who denounces them as time-servers and compromisers, is,\r\nof course, an ally of corruption. But, after all, he can generally\r\nbe disregarded, whereas the real and dangerous foe is the corrupt\r\npolitician, whom we can not afford to disregard. When one of these\r\nprofessional impracticables denounces the attitude of decent men as “a\r\nhodge-podge of the ideal and the practicable,” he is amusingly unaware\r\nthat he is writing his own condemnation, showing his own inability to\r\ndo good work or to appreciate good work. The Constitutional Convention\r\nover which Washington presided, and which made us a nation, represented\r\nprecisely and exactly this “hodge-podge,” and was frantically denounced\r\nin its day by the men of the impracticable type. Lincoln’s career\r\nthroughout the Civil War was such a “hodge-podge,” and was in its\r\nturn denounced in exactly the same way. Lincoln disregarded the jibes\r\nof these men, who did their puny best to hurt the great cause for\r\nwhich he battled; and they never, by their pin-pricks, succeeded in\r\ndiverting him from the real foe. The fanatical antislavery people\r\nwished to hurry him into unwise, extreme, and premature action, and\r\ndenounced him as compromising with the forces of evil, as being a\r\npractical politician—which he was, if practicality is held to include\r\nwisdom and high purpose. He did not permit himself to be affected by\r\ntheir position. He did not yield to what they advised when it was\r\nimpracticable, nor did he permit himself to become prejudiced against\r\nso much of what they championed as was right and practicable. His\r\nideal was just as high as theirs. He did not lower it. He did not lose\r\nhis temper at their conduct, or cease to strive for the abolition of\r\nslavery and the restoration of the Union; and whereas their conduct\r\nforeboded disaster to both causes, his efforts secured the success\r\nof both. So, in our turn, we of to-day are bound to try to tread in\r\nthe footsteps of those great Americans who in the past have held high\r\nideal and have striven mightily through practical methods to realize\r\nthat ideal. There must be many compromises; but we can not compromise\r\nwith dishonesty, with sin. We must not be misled at any time by the\r\ncheap assertion that people get only what they want; that the editor\r\nof a degraded newspaper is to be excused because the public want the\r\ndegradation; that the city officials who inaugurate a “wide-open”\r\npolicy are to be excused because a portion of the public likes vice;\r\nthat the men who jeer at philanthropy are to be excused because among\r\nphilanthropists there are hypocrites, and among unfortunates there are\r\nvicious and unworthy people. To pander to depravity inevitably means\r\nto increase the depravity. It is a dreadful thing that public sentiment\r\nshould condone misconduct in a public man; but this is no excuse for\r\nthe public man, if by his conduct he still further degrades public\r\nsentiment. There can be no meddling with the laws of righteousness, of\r\ndecency, of morality. We are in honor bound to put into practice what\r\nwe preach; to remember that we are not to be excused if we do not; and\r\nthat in the last resort no material prosperity, no business acumen, no\r\nintellectual development of any kind, can atone in the life of a nation\r\nfor the lack of the fundamental qualities of courage, honesty, and\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW-FEELING AS A POLITICAL FACTOR\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED IN THE “CENTURY,” JANUARY, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-feeling, sympathy in the broadest sense, is the most important\r\nfactor in producing a healthy political and social life. Neither our\r\nnational nor our local civil life can be what it should be unless it is\r\nmarked by the fellow-feeling, the mutual kindness, the mutual respect,\r\nthe sense of common duties and common interests, which arise when men\r\ntake the trouble to understand one another, and to associate together\r\nfor a common object. A very large share of the rancor of political\r\nand social strife arises either from sheer misunderstanding by one\r\nsection, or by one class, of another, or else from the fact that the\r\ntwo sections, or two classes, are so cut off from each other that\r\nneither appreciates the other’s passions, prejudices, and, indeed,\r\npoint of view, while they are both entirely ignorant of their community\r\nof feeling as regards the essentials of manhood and humanity.\r\n\r\nThis is one reason why the public school is so admirable an\r\ninstitution. To it more than to any other among the many causes\r\nwhich, in our American life, tell for religious toleration is due the\r\nimpossibility of persecution of a particular creed. When in their\r\nearliest and most impressionable years Protestants, Catholics, and Jews\r\ngo to the same schools, learn the same lessons, play the same games,\r\nand are forced, in the rough-and-ready democracy of boy life, to take\r\neach at his true worth, it is impossible later to make the disciples\r\nof one creed persecute those of another. From the evils of religious\r\npersecution America is safe.\r\n\r\nFrom the evils of sectional hostility we are, at any rate, far safer\r\nthan we were. The war with Spain was the most absolutely righteous\r\nforeign war in which any nation has engaged during the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and not the least of its many good features was the unity\r\nit brought about between the sons of the men who wore the blue and\r\nof those who wore the gray. This necessarily meant the dying out of\r\nthe old antipathy. Of course embers smoulder here and there; but the\r\ncountry at large is growing more and more to take pride in the valor,\r\nthe self-devotion, the loyalty to an ideal, displayed alike by the\r\nsoldiers of both sides in the Civil War. We are all united now. We are\r\nall glad that the Union was restored, and are one in our loyalty to it;\r\nand hand in hand with this general recognition of the all-importance of\r\npreserving the Union has gone the recognition of the fact that at the\r\noutbreak of the Civil War men could not cut loose from the ingrained\r\nhabits and traditions of generations, and that the man from the North\r\nand the man from the South each was loyal to his highest ideal of duty\r\nwhen he drew sword or shouldered rifle to fight to the death for what\r\nhe believed to be right.\r\n\r\nNor is it only the North and the South that have struck hands. The\r\nEast and the West are fundamentally closer together than ever before.\r\nUsing the word “West” in the old sense, as meaning the country west\r\nof the Alleghanies, it is of course perfectly obvious that it is the\r\nWest which will shape the destinies of this nation. The great group of\r\nwealthy and powerful States about the Upper Mississippi, the Ohio, the\r\nMissouri, and their tributaries, will have far more weight than any\r\nother section in deciding the fate of the Republic in the centuries\r\nthat are opening. This is not in the least to be regretted by the East,\r\nfor the simple and excellent reason that the interests of the West\r\nand the East are one. The West will shape our destinies because she\r\nwill have more people and a greater territory, and because the whole\r\ndevelopment of the Western country is such as to make it peculiarly the\r\nexponent of all that is most vigorously and characteristically American\r\nin our national life.\r\n\r\nSo it is with the Pacific Slope, and the giant young States that are\r\nthere growing by leaps and bounds. The greater the share they have in\r\ndirecting the national life, the better it will be for all of us.\r\n\r\nI do not for a moment mean that mistakes will not be committed in\r\nevery section of the country; they certainly will be, and in whatever\r\nsection they are committed it will be our duty to protest against\r\nthem, and to try to overthrow those who are responsible for them: but\r\nI do mean to say that in the long run each section is going to find\r\nthat its welfare, instead of being antagonistic to, is indissolubly\r\nbound up in, the welfare of other sections; and the growth of means of\r\ncommunication, the growth of education in its highest and finest sense,\r\nmeans the growth in the sense of solidarity throughout the country, in\r\nthe feeling of patriotic pride of each American in the deeds of all\r\nother Americans—of pride in the past history and present and future\r\ngreatness of the whole country.\r\n\r\nNobody is interested in the fact that Dewey comes from Vermont, Hobson\r\nfrom Alabama, or Funston from Kansas. If all three came from the same\r\ncounty it would make no difference to us. They are Americans, and every\r\nAmerican has an equal right to challenge his share of glory in their\r\ndeeds. As we read of the famous feats of our army in the Philippines,\r\nit matters nothing to us whether the regiments come from Oregon, Idaho,\r\nCalifornia, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, or Tennessee. What does matter\r\nis that these splendid soldiers are all Americans; that they are our\r\nheroes; that our blood runs in their veins; that the flag under which\r\nwe live is the flag for which they have fought, for which some of them\r\nhave died.\r\n\r\nDanger from religious antipathy is dead, and from sectional antipathy\r\ndying; but there are at times very ugly manifestations of antipathy\r\nbetween class and class. It seems a pity to have to use the word\r\n“class,” because there are really no classes in our American life in\r\nthe sense in which the word “class” is used in Europe. Our social and\r\npolitical systems do not admit of them in theory, and in practice they\r\nexist only in a very fluid state. In most European countries classes\r\nare separated by rigid boundaries, which can be crossed but rarely,\r\nand with the utmost difficulty and peril. Here the boundaries can\r\nnot properly be said to exist, and are certainly so fluctuating and\r\nevasive, so indistinctly marked, that they can not be appreciated when\r\nseen near by. Any American family which lasts a few generations will\r\nbe apt to have representatives in all the different classes. The great\r\nbusiness men, even the great professional men, and especially the\r\ngreat statesmen and sailors and soldiers, are very apt to spring from\r\namong the farmers or wage-workers, and their kinsfolk remain near the\r\nold home or at the old trade. If ever there existed in the world a\r\ncommunity where the identity of interest, of habit, of principle, and\r\nof ideals should be felt as a living force, ours is the one. Speaking\r\ngenerally, it really is felt to a degree quite unknown in other\r\ncountries of our size. There are, doubtless, portions of Norway and\r\nSwitzerland where the social and political ideals, and their nearness\r\nto realization, are not materially different from those of the most\r\nessentially American portions of our own land; but this is not true\r\nof any European country of considerable size. It is only in American\r\ncommunities that we see the farmer, the hired man, the lawyer, and the\r\nmerchant, and possibly even the officer of the army or the navy, all\r\nkinsmen, and all accepting their relations as perfectly natural and\r\nsimple. This is eminently healthy. This is just as it should be in our\r\nRepublic. It represents the ideal toward which it would be a good thing\r\nto approximate everywhere. In the great industrial centres, with their\r\nhighly complex, highly specialized conditions, it is of course merely\r\nan ideal. There are parts even of our oldest States, as, for example,\r\nNew York, where this ideal is actually realized; there are other parts,\r\nparticularly the great cities, where the life is so wholly different\r\nthat the attempt to live up precisely to the country conditions would\r\nbe artificial and impossible. Nevertheless, the fact remains that\r\nthe only true solution of our political and social problems lies in\r\ncultivating everywhere the spirit of brotherhood, of fellow-feeling and\r\nunderstanding between man and man, and the willingness to treat a man\r\nas a man, which are the essential factors in American democracy as we\r\nstill see it in the country districts.\r\n\r\nThe chief factor in producing such sympathy is simply association on a\r\nplane of equality, and for a common object. Any healthy-minded American\r\nis bound to think well of his fellow-Americans if he only gets to know\r\nthem. The trouble is that he does not know them. If the banker and\r\nthe farmer never meet, or meet only in the most perfunctory business\r\nway, if the banking is not done by men whom the farmer knows as his\r\nfriends and associates, a spirit of mistrust is almost sure to spring\r\nup. If the merchant or the manufacturer, the lawyer or the clerk, never\r\nmeets the mechanic or the handicraftsman, save on rare occasions,\r\nwhen the meeting may be of a hostile kind, each side feels that the\r\nother is alien and naturally antagonistic. But if any one individual\r\nof any group were to be thrown into natural association with another\r\ngroup, the difficulties would be found to disappear so far as he was\r\nconcerned. Very possibly he would become the ardent champion of the\r\nother group.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may be pardoned for quoting my own experience as an instance\r\nin point. Outside of college boys and politicians my first intimate\r\nassociates were ranchmen, cow-punchers, and game-hunters, and I\r\nspeedily became convinced that there were no other men in the country\r\nwho were their equals. Then I was thrown much with farmers, and I\r\nmade up my mind that it was the farmer upon whom the foundations of\r\nthe commonwealth really rested—that the farmer was the archetypical\r\ngood American. Then I saw a good deal of railroad men, and after quite\r\nan intimate acquaintance with them I grew to feel that, especially\r\nin their higher ranks, they typified the very qualities of courage,\r\nself-reliance, self-command, hardihood, capacity for work, power of\r\ninitiative, and power of obedience, which we like most to associate\r\nwith the American name. Then I happened to have dealings with certain\r\ncarpenters’ unions, and grew to have a great respect for the carpenter,\r\nfor the mechanic type. By this time it dawned upon me that they were\r\nall pretty good fellows, and that my championship of each set in\r\nsuccession above all other sets had sprung largely from the fact that\r\nI was very familiar with the set I championed, and less familiar with\r\nthe remainder. In other words, I had grown into sympathy with, into\r\nunderstanding of, group after group, with the effect that I invariably\r\nfound that they and I had common purposes and a common standpoint. We\r\ndiffered among ourselves, or agreed among ourselves, not because we had\r\ndifferent occupations or the same occupation, but because of our ways\r\nof looking at life.\r\n\r\nIt is this capacity for sympathy, for fellow-feeling and mutual\r\nunderstanding, which must lie at the basis of all really successful\r\nmovements for good government and the betterment of social and\r\ncivic conditions. There is no patent device for bringing about good\r\ngovernment. Still less is there any patent device for remedying social\r\nevils and doing away with social inequalities. Wise legislation can\r\nhelp in each case, and crude, vicious, or demagogic legislation can\r\ndo an infinity of harm. But the betterment must come through the slow\r\nworkings of the same forces which always have tended for righteousness,\r\nand always will.\r\n\r\nThe prime lesson to be taught is the lesson of treating each man on\r\nhis worth as a man, and of remembering that while sometimes it is\r\nnecessary, from both a legislative and social standpoint, to consider\r\nmen as a class, yet in the long run our safety lies in recognizing the\r\nindividual’s worth or lack of worth as the chief basis of action, and\r\nin shaping our whole conduct, and especially our political conduct,\r\naccordingly. It is impossible for a democracy to endure if the\r\npolitical lines are drawn to coincide with class lines. The resulting\r\ngovernment, whether of the upper or of the lower class, is not a\r\ngovernment of the whole people, but a government of part of the people\r\nat the expense of the rest. Where the lines of political division are\r\nvertical, the men of each occupation and of every social standing\r\nseparating according to their vocations and principles, the result\r\nis healthy and normal. Just so far, however, as the lines are drawn\r\nhorizontally, the result is unhealthy, and in the long run disastrous,\r\nfor such a division means that men are pitted against one another in\r\naccordance with the blind and selfish interests of the moment. Each is\r\nthus placed over against his neighbor in an attitude of greedy class\r\nhostility, which becomes the mainspring of his conduct, instead of each\r\nbasing his political action upon his own convictions as to what is\r\nadvisable and what inadvisable, and upon his own disinterested sense\r\nof devotion to the interests of the whole community as he sees them.\r\nRepublics have fallen in the past primarily because the parties that\r\ncontrolled them divided along the lines of class, so that inevitably\r\nthe triumph of one or the other implied the supremacy of a part over\r\nthe whole. The result might be an oligarchy, or it might be mob rule;\r\nit mattered little which, as regards the ultimate effect, for in both\r\ncases tyranny and anarchy were sure to alternate. The failure of the\r\nGreek and Italian republics was fundamentally due to this cause.\r\nSwitzerland has flourished because the divisions upon which her\r\npolitical issues have been fought have not been primarily those of\r\nmere caste or social class, and America will flourish and will become\r\ngreater than any empire because, in the long run, in this country, any\r\nparty which strives to found itself upon sectional or class jealousy\r\nand hostility must go down before the good sense of the people.\r\n\r\nThe only way to provide against the evils of a horizontal cleavage in\r\npolitics is to encourage the growth of fellow-feeling, of a feeling\r\nbased on the relations of man to man, and not of class to class. In\r\nthe country districts this is not very difficult. In the neighborhood\r\nwhere I live, on the Fourth of July the four Protestant ministers and\r\nthe Catholic priest speak from the same platform, the children of all\r\nof us go to the same district school, and the landowner and the hired\r\nman take the same views, not merely of politics, but of duck-shooting\r\nand of international yacht races. Naturally in such a community there\r\nis small chance for class division. There is a slight feeling against\r\nthe mere summer residents, precisely because there is not much sympathy\r\nwith them, and because they do not share in our local interests; but\r\notherwise there are enough objects in common to put all much on the\r\nsame plane of interest in various important particulars, and each man\r\nhas too much self-respect to feel particularly jealous of any other\r\nman. Moreover, as the community is small and consists for the most part\r\nof persons who have dwelt long in the land, while those of foreign\r\nancestry, instead of keeping by themselves, have intermarried with the\r\nnatives, there is still a realizing sense of kinship among the men\r\nwho follow the different occupations. The characteristic family names\r\nare often borne by men of widely different fortunes, ranging from the\r\nlocal bayman through the captain of the oyster-sloop, the sail-maker,\r\nor the wheelright, to the owner of what the countryside may know as the\r\nmanor-house—which probably contains one of the innumerable rooms in\r\nwhich Washington is said to have slept. We have sharp rivalries, and\r\nour politics are by no means always what they should be, but at least\r\nwe do not divide on class lines, for the very good reason that there\r\nhas been no crystallization into classes.\r\n\r\nThis condition prevails in essentials throughout the country\r\ndistricts of New York, which are politically very much the healthiest\r\ndistricts. Any man who has served in the Legislature realizes that the\r\ncountry members form, on the whole, a very sound and healthy body of\r\nlegislators. Any man who has gone about much to the county fairs in\r\nNew York—almost the only place where the farm folks gather in large\r\nnumbers—can not but have been struck by the high character of the\r\naverage countryman. He is a fine fellow, rugged, hard-working, shrewd,\r\nand keenly alive to the fundamental virtues. He and his brethren of the\r\nsmaller towns and villages, in ordinary circumstances, take very little\r\naccount, indeed, of any caste difference; they greet each man strictly\r\non his merits as a man, and therefore form a community in which there\r\nis singularly little caste spirit, and in which men associate on\r\na thoroughly healthy and American ground of common ideals, common\r\nconvictions, and common sympathies.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this can not be said of the larger cities, where the\r\nconditions of life are so complicated that there has been an extreme\r\ndifferentiation and specialization in every species of occupation,\r\nwhether of business or pleasure. The people of a certain degree of\r\nwealth and of a certain occupation may never come into any real contact\r\nwith the people of another occupation, of another social standing.\r\nThe tendency is for the relations always to be between class and\r\nclass instead of between individual and individual. This produces the\r\nthoroughly unhealthy belief that it is for the interest of one class as\r\nagainst another to have its class representatives dominant in public\r\nlife. The ills of any such system are obvious. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe enormous mass of our legislation and administration ought to be\r\nconcerned with matters that are strictly for the commonweal; and where\r\nspecial legislation or administration is needed, as it often must be,\r\nfor a certain class, the need can be met primarily by mere honesty and\r\ncommon sense. But if men are elected solely from any caste, or on any\r\ncaste theory, the voter gradually substitutes the theory of allegiance\r\nto the caste for the theory of allegiance to the commonwealth as\r\na whole, and instead of demanding as fundamental the qualities of\r\nprobity and broad intelligence—which are the indispensable qualities\r\nin securing the welfare of the whole—as the first consideration, he\r\ndemands, as a substitute, zeal in the service, or apparent service of\r\nthe class, which is quite compatible with gross corruption outside.\r\nIn short, we get back to the conditions which foredoomed democracy to\r\nfailure in the ancient Greek and mediæval republics, where party lines\r\nwere horizontal and class warred against class, each in consequence\r\nnecessarily substituting devotion to the interest of a class for\r\ndevotion to the interest of the state and to the elementary ideas of\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nThe only way to avoid the growth of these evils is, so far as may\r\nbe, to help in the creation of conditions which will permit mutual\r\nunderstanding and fellow-feeling between the members of different\r\nclasses. To do this it is absolutely necessary that there should be\r\nnatural association between the members for a common end or with a\r\ncommon purpose. As long as men are separated by their caste lines,\r\neach body having its own amusements, interests, and occupations, they\r\nare certain to regard one another with that instinctive distrust which\r\nthey feel for foreigners. There are exceptions to the rule, but it is\r\na rule. The average man, when he has no means of being brought into\r\ncontact with another, or of gaining any insight into that other’s ideas\r\nand aspirations, either ignores these ideas and aspirations completely,\r\nor else feels toward them a more or less tepid dislike. The result\r\nis a complete and perhaps fatal misunderstanding, due primarily to\r\nthe fact that the capacity for fellow-feeling is given no opportunity\r\nto flourish. On the other hand, if the men can be mixed together in\r\nsome way that will loosen the class or caste bonds and put each on\r\nhis merits as an individual man, there is certain to be a regrouping\r\nindependent of caste lines. A tie may remain between the members of\r\na caste, based merely upon the similarity of their habits of life;\r\nbut this will be much less strong than the ties based on identity of\r\npassion, of principle, or of ways of looking at life. Any man who has\r\never, for his good fortune, been obliged to work with men in masses,\r\nin some place or under some condition or in some association where\r\nthe dislocation of caste was complete, must recognize the truth of\r\nthis as apparent. Every mining-camp, every successful volunteer\r\nregiment, proves it. In such cases there is always some object which\r\nmust be attained, and the men interested in its attainment have to\r\ndevelop their own leaders and their own ties of association, while\r\nthe would-be leader can succeed only by selecting for assistants the\r\nmen whose peculiar capacities fit them to do the best work in the\r\nvarious emergencies that arise. Under such circumstances the men who\r\nwork together for the achievement of a common result in which they are\r\nintensely interested are very soon certain to disregard, and, indeed,\r\nto forget, the creed or race origin or antecedent social standing or\r\nclass occupation of the man who is either their friend or their foe.\r\nThey get down to the naked bed-rock of character and capacity.\r\n\r\nThis is to a large extent true of the party organizations in a great\r\ncity, and, indeed, of all serious political organizations. If they are\r\nto be successful they must necessarily be democratic, in the sense that\r\neach man is treated strictly on his merits as a man. No one can succeed\r\nwho attempts to go in on any other basis; above all, no one can succeed\r\nif he goes in feeling that, instead of merely doing his duty, he is\r\nconferring a favor upon the community, and is therefore warranted in\r\nadopting an attitude of condescension toward his fellows. It is often\r\nquite as irritating to be patronized as to be plundered; as reformers\r\nhave more than once discovered when the mass of the voters stolidly\r\nvoted against them, and in favor of a gang of familiar scoundrels,\r\nchiefly because they had no sense of fellow-feeling with their would-be\r\nbenefactors.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to patronize is certain to be eradicated as soon as any\r\nman goes into politics in a practical and not in a dilettante fashion.\r\nHe speedily finds that the quality of successful management, the power\r\nto handle men and secure results, may exist in seemingly unlikely\r\npersons. If he intends to carry a caucus or primary, or elect a given\r\ncandidate, or secure a certain piece of legislation or administration,\r\nhe will have to find out and work with innumerable allies, and make\r\nuse of innumerable subordinates. Given that he and they have a common\r\nobject, the one test that he must apply to them is as to their ability\r\nto help in achieving that object. The result is that in a very short\r\ntime the men whose purposes are the same forget about all differences,\r\nsave in capacity to carry out the purpose. The banker who is interested\r\nin seeing a certain nomination made or a certain election carried\r\nforgets everything but his community of interest with the retail\r\nbutcher who is a leader along his section of the avenue, or the starter\r\nwho can control a considerable number of the motormen; and in return\r\nthe butcher and the starter accept the banker quite naturally as an\r\nally whom they may follow or lead, as circumstances dictate. In other\r\nwords, all three grow to feel in common on certain important subjects,\r\nand this fellow-feeling has results as far-reaching as they are healthy.\r\n\r\nGood thus follows from mere ordinary political affiliation. A man\r\nwho has taken an active part in the political life of a great city\r\npossesses an incalculable advantage over his fellow-citizens who have\r\nnot so taken part, because normally he has more understanding than they\r\ncan possibly have of the attitude of mind, the passions, prejudices,\r\nhopes, and animosities of his fellow-citizens, with whom he would not\r\nordinarily be brought into business or social contact. Of course there\r\nare plenty of exceptions to this rule. A man who is drawn into politics\r\nfrom absolutely selfish reasons, and especially a rich man who merely\r\ndesires to buy political promotion, may know absolutely nothing that is\r\nof value as to any but the basest side of the human nature with which\r\nhis sphere of contact has been enlarged; and, on the other hand, a\r\nwise employer of labor, or a philanthropist in whom zeal and judgment\r\nbalance each other, may know far more than most politicians. But the\r\nfact remains that the effect of political life, and of the associations\r\nthat it brings, is of very great benefit in producing a better\r\nunderstanding and a keener fellow-feeling among men who otherwise\r\nwould know one another not at all, or else as members of alien bodies\r\nor classes.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, how much more is it true if the same habit of\r\nassociation for a common purpose can be applied where the purpose\r\nis really of the highest! Much is accomplished in this way by the\r\nuniversity settlements and similar associations. Wherever these\r\nassociations are entered into in a healthy and sane spirit, the good\r\nthey do is incalculable, from the simple fact that they bring together\r\nin pursuit of a worthy common object men of excellent character, who\r\nwould never otherwise meet. It is of just as much importance to the\r\none as to the other that the man from Hester Street or the Bowery or\r\nAvenue B, and the man from the Riverside Drive or Fifth Avenue, should\r\nhave some meeting-ground where they can grow to understand one another\r\nas an incident of working for a common end. Of course if, on the one\r\nhand, the work is entered into in a patronizing spirit, no good will\r\nresult; and, on the other hand, if the zealous enthusiast loses his\r\nsanity, only harm will follow. There is much dreadful misery in a great\r\ncity, and a high-spirited, generous young man, when first brought into\r\ncontact with it, has his sympathies so excited that he is very apt\r\nto become a socialist, or turn to the advocacy of any wild scheme,\r\ncourting a plunge from bad to worse, exactly as do too many of the\r\nleaders of the discontent around him. His sanity and cool-headedness\r\nwill be thoroughly tried, and if he loses them his power for good will\r\nvanish.\r\n\r\nBut this is merely to state one form of a general truth. If a man\r\npermits largeness of heart to degenerate into softness of head, he\r\ninevitably becomes a nuisance in any relation of life. If sympathy\r\nbecomes distorted and morbid, it hampers instead of helping the effort\r\ntoward social betterment. Yet without sympathy, without fellow-feeling,\r\nno permanent good can be accomplished. In any healthy community there\r\nmust be a solidarity of sentiment and a knowledge of solidarity of\r\ninterest among the different members. Where this solidarity ceases\r\nto exist, where there is no fellow-feeling, the community is ripe\r\nfor disaster. Of course the fellow-feeling may be of value much in\r\nproportion as it is unconscious. A sentiment that is easy and natural\r\nis far better than one which has to be artificially stimulated. But\r\nthe artificial stimulus is better than none, and with fellow-feeling,\r\nas with all other emotions, what is started artificially may become\r\nquite natural in its continuance. With most men courage is largely\r\nan acquired habit, and on the first occasions when it is called for\r\nit necessitates the exercise of will-power and self-control; but by\r\nexercise it gradually becomes almost automatic.\r\n\r\nSo it is with fellow-feeling. A man who conscientiously endeavors to\r\nthrow in his lot with those about him, to make his interests theirs,\r\nto put himself in a position where he and they have a common object,\r\nwill at first feel a little self-conscious, will realize too plainly\r\nhis own aims. But with exercise this will pass off. He will speedily\r\nfind that the fellow-feeling which at first he had to stimulate was\r\nreally existent, though latent, and is capable of a very healthy\r\ngrowth. It can, of course, become normal only when the man himself\r\nbecomes genuinely interested in the object which he and his fellows\r\nare striving to attain. It is therefore obviously desirable that this\r\nobject should possess a real and vital interest for every one. Such is\r\nthe case with a proper political association.\r\n\r\nMuch has been done, not merely by the ordinary political associations,\r\nbut by the city clubs, civic federations, and the like, and very much\r\nmore can be done. Of course there is danger of any such association\r\nbeing perverted either by knavery or folly. When a partisan political\r\norganization becomes merely an association for purposes of plunder and\r\npatronage, it may be a menace instead of a help to a community; and\r\nwhen a non-partisan political organization falls under the control of\r\nthe fantastic extremists always attracted to such movements, in its\r\nturn it becomes either useless or noxious. But if these organizations,\r\npartisan or non-partisan, are conducted along the lines of sanity and\r\nhonesty, they produce a good more far-reaching than their promoters\r\nsuppose, and achieve results of greater importance than those\r\nimmediately aimed at.\r\n\r\nIt is an excellent thing to win a triumph for good government at a\r\ngiven election; but it is a far better thing gradually to build up that\r\nspirit of fellow-feeling among American citizens, which, in the long\r\nrun, is absolutely necessary if we are to see the principles of virile\r\nhonesty and robust common-sense triumph in our civic life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIC HELPFULNESS\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED IN THE “CENTURY,” OCTOBER, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Lecky’s profoundly suggestive book, “The Map of Life,” referred\r\nto by me in a former article, he emphasizes the change that has been\r\ngradually coming over the religious attitude of the world because of\r\nthe growing importance laid upon conduct as compared with dogma. In\r\nthis country we are long past the stage of regarding it as any part of\r\nthe State’s duty to enforce a particular religious dogma; and more and\r\nmore the professors of the different creeds themselves are beginning\r\ntacitly to acknowledge that the prime worth of a creed is to be gauged\r\nby the standard of conduct it exacts among its followers toward their\r\nfellows. The creed which each man in his heart believes to be essential\r\nto his own salvation is for him alone to determine; but we have a right\r\nto pass judgment upon his actions toward those about him.\r\n\r\nTried by this standard, the religious teachers of the community\r\nstand most honorably high. It is probable that no other class of our\r\ncitizens do anything like the amount of disinterested labor for\r\ntheir fellow-men. To those who are associated with them at close\r\nquarters this statement will seem so obviously a truism as to rank\r\namong the platitudes. But there is a far from inconsiderable body of\r\npublic opinion which, to judge by the speeches, writings, and jests\r\nin which it delights, has no conception of this state of things. If\r\nsuch people would but take the trouble to follow out the actual life\r\nof a hard-worked clergyman or priest, I think they would become a\r\nlittle ashamed of the tone of flippancy they are so prone to adopt when\r\nspeaking about them.\r\n\r\nIn the country districts the minister of the gospel is normally the\r\nassociate and leader of his congregation and in close personal touch\r\nwith them. He shares in and partially directs their intellectual\r\nand moral life, and is responsive to their spiritual needs. If they\r\nare prosperous, he is prosperous. If the community be poor and\r\nhard-working, he shares the poverty and works as hard as any one.\r\nAs fine a figure as I can call to mind is that of one such country\r\nclergyman in a poor farming community not far from the capital of the\r\nState of New York—a vigorous old man, who works on his farm six days\r\nin the week, and on the seventh preaches what he himself has been\r\npracticing. The farm work does not occupy all of the week-days, for\r\nthere is not a spiritual need of his parishioners that he neglects. He\r\nvisits them, looks after them if they are sick, baptizes the children,\r\ncomforts those in sorrow, and is ready with shrewd advice for those\r\nwho need aid; in short, shows himself from week’s end to week’s end\r\na thoroughly sincere, earnest, hard-working old Christian. This is\r\nperhaps the healthiest type. It is in keeping with the surroundings,\r\nfor in the country districts the quality of self-help is very highly\r\ndeveloped, and there is little use for the great organized charities.\r\nNeighbors know one another. The poorest and the richest are more or\r\nless in touch, and charitable feelings find a natural and simple\r\nexpression in the homely methods of performing charitable duties. This\r\ndoes not mean that there is not room for an immense amount of work in\r\ncountry communities and in villages and small towns. Every now and\r\nthen, in traveling over the State, one comes upon a public library, a\r\nYoung Men’s Christian Association building, or some similar structure\r\nwhich has been put up by a man born in the place, who has made his\r\nmoney elsewhere, and feels he would like to have some memorial in his\r\nold home. Such a gift is of far-reaching benefit. Almost better is what\r\nis done in the way of circulating libraries and the like by the united\r\naction of those men and women who appreciate clearly the intellectual\r\nneeds of the people who live far from the great centres of our rather\r\nfeverish modern civilization; for in country life it is necessary to\r\nguard, not against mental fever, but against lack of mental stimulus\r\nand interests.\r\n\r\nIn cities the conditions are very different, both as regards the needs\r\nand as regards the way it is possible to meet these needs. There is\r\nmuch less feeling of essential community of interest, and poverty of\r\nthe body is lamentably visible among great masses. There are districts\r\npopulated to the point of congestion, where hardly any one is above\r\nthe level of poverty, though this poverty does not by any means always\r\nimply misery. Where it does mean misery it must be met by organization,\r\nand, above all, by the disinterested, endless labor of those who,\r\nby choice, and to do good, live in the midst of it, temporarily or\r\npermanently. Very many men and women spend part of their lives or do\r\npart of their life-work under such circumstances, and conspicuous among\r\nthem are clergymen and priests.\r\n\r\nOnly those who have seen something of such work at close quarters\r\nrealize how much of it goes on quietly and without the slightest\r\noutside show, and how much it represents to many lives that else would\r\nbe passed in gray squalor. It is not necessary to give the names of\r\nthe living, or I could enumerate among my personal acquaintance fifty\r\nclergymen and priests, men of every church, of every degree of wealth,\r\neach of whom cheerfully and quietly, year in and year out, does his\r\nshare, and more than his share, of the unending work which he feels\r\nis imposed upon him alike by Christianity and by that form of applied\r\nChristianity which we call good citizenship. Far more than that number\r\nof women, in and out of religious bodies, who do to the full as much\r\nwork, could be mentioned. Of course, for every one thus mentioned there\r\nwould be a hundred, or many hundreds, unmentioned. Perhaps there is no\r\nharm in alluding to one man who is dead. Very early in my career as a\r\npolice commissioner of the City of New York I was brought in contact\r\nwith Father Casserly of the Paulist Fathers. After he had made up his\r\nmind that I was really trying to get things decent in the department,\r\nand to see that law and order prevailed, and that crime and vice were\r\nwarred against in practical fashion, he became very intimate with\r\nme, helping me in every way, and unconsciously giving me an insight\r\ninto his own work and his own character. Continually, in one way and\r\nanother, I came across what Father Casserly was doing, always in the\r\nway of showing the intense human sympathy and interest he was taking\r\nin the lives about him. If one of the boys of a family was wild, it\r\nwas Father Casserly who planned methods of steadying him. If, on the\r\nother hand, a steady boy met with some misfortune,—lost his place, or\r\nsomething of the kind,—it was Father Casserly who went and stated\r\nthe facts to the employer. The Paulist Fathers had always been among\r\nthe most efficient foes of the abuses of the liquor traffic. They\r\nnever hesitated to interfere with saloons, dance-houses, and the like.\r\nOne secret of their influence with our Police Board was that, as they\r\ncontinually went about among their people and knew them all, and as\r\nthey were entirely disinterested, they could be trusted to tell who\r\ndid right and who did wrong among the instruments of the law. One of\r\nthe perplexing matters in dealing with policemen is that, as they are\r\nalways in hostile contact with criminals and would-be criminals, who\r\nare sure to lie about them, it is next to impossible to tell when\r\naccusations against them are false and when they are true; for the\r\ngood man who does his duty is certain to have scoundrelly foes, and\r\nthe bad man who blackmails these same scoundrels usually has nothing\r\nbut the same evidence against him. But Father Casserly and the rest of\r\nhis order knew the policemen personally, and we found we could trust\r\nthem implicitly to tell exactly who was good and who was not. Whether\r\nthe man were Protestant, Catholic, or Jew, if he was a faithful public\r\nservant they would so report him; and if he was unfaithful he would\r\nbe reported as such wholly without regard to his creed. We had this\r\nexperience with an honorably large number of priests and clergymen.\r\nOnce in the same batch of promotions from sergeant to captain there\r\nwas a Protestant to whom our attention had been drawn by the earnest\r\npraise of Fathers Casserly and Doyle, and a Catholic who had first been\r\nbrought to our notice by the advocacy of Bishop Potter.\r\n\r\nThere were other ways in which clergymen helped our Police Board. We\r\nwanted at one time to get plenty of strong, honest young men for the\r\npolice force, and did not want to draw them from among the ordinary\r\ntypes of ward heeler. Two fertile recruiting-grounds proved to be, one\r\na Catholic church and the other a Methodist church. The rector of the\r\nformer, Dr. Wall, had a temperance lyceum for the young men of his\r\nparish; the pastor of the latter had a congregation made out of a bit\r\nof old native America suddenly overlapped by the growth of the city,\r\nand his wheelwrights, ship-carpenters, baymen, and coasting-sailors\r\ngave us the same good type of officer that we got from among the\r\nmechanics, motormen, and blacksmiths who came from Dr. Wall’s lyceum.\r\nAmong our other close friends was another Methodist preacher, who had\r\nonce been a reporter, but who had felt stirred by an irresistible\r\nimpulse to leave his profession and devote his life to the East Side,\r\nwhere he ministered to the wants of those who would not go to the\r\nfashionable churches, and for whom no other church was especially\r\nprepared. In connection with his work, one of the things that was\r\nespecially pleasing was the way in which he had gone in not only with\r\nthe rest of the Protestant clergy and the non-sectarian philanthropic\r\nworkers of the district, but with the Catholic clergy, joining hands in\r\nthe fight against the seething evils of the slum. One of his Catholic\r\nallies, by the way, a certain Brother A——, was doing an immense\r\namount for the Italian children of his parish. He had a large parochial\r\nschool, originally attended by the children of Irish parents. Gradually\r\nthe Irish had moved uptown, and had been supplanted by the Italians. It\r\nwas his life-work to lift these little Italians over the first painful\r\nsteps on the road toward American citizenship.\r\n\r\nAgain, let me call to mind an institution, not in New York, but in\r\nAlbany, where the sisters of a religious organization devote their\r\nentire lives to helping girls who either have slipped, and would go\r\ndown to be trampled under foot in the blackest mire if they were not\r\nhelped, or who, by force of their surroundings, would surely slip if\r\nthe hand were not held out to them in time. It is the kind of work\r\nthe doing of which is of infinite importance both from the standpoint\r\nof the state and from the standpoint of the individual; yet it is a\r\nwork which, to be successful, must emphatically be a labor of love.\r\nMost men and women, even among those who appreciate the need of the\r\nwork and who are not wholly insensible to the demands made upon them\r\nby the spirit of brotherly love for mankind, lack either the time,\r\nthe opportunity, or the moral and mental qualities to succeed in such\r\nwork; and to very many the sheer distaste of it would prevent their\r\ndoing it well. There is nothing attractive in it save for those who are\r\nentirely earnest and disinterested. There is no reputation, there is\r\nnot even any notoriety, to be gained from it. Surely people who realize\r\nthat such work ought to be done, and who realize also how exceedingly\r\ndistasteful it would be for them to do it, ought to feel a sense of the\r\nmost profound gratitude to those who with whole-hearted sincerity have\r\nundertaken it, and should support them in every way. This particular\r\ninstitution is under the management of a creed not my own, but few\r\nthings gave me greater pleasure than to sign a bill increasing its\r\npower and usefulness. Compared with the vital necessity of reclaiming\r\nthese poor hunted creatures to paths of womanliness and wholesome\r\nliving, it is of infinitesimal importance along the lines of which\r\ncreed these paths lead.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the best type of philanthropic work is that which helps\r\nmen and women who are willing and able to help themselves; for\r\nfundamentally this aid is simply what each of us should be all the\r\ntime both giving and receiving. Every man and woman in the land ought\r\nto prize above almost every other quality the capacity for self-help;\r\nand yet every man and woman in the land will at some time or other\r\nbe sorely in need of the help of others, and at some time or other\r\nwill find that he or she can in turn give help even to the strongest.\r\nThe quality of self-help is so splendid a quality that nothing can\r\ncompensate for its loss; yet, like every virtue, it can be twisted into\r\na fault, and it becomes a fault if carried to the point of cold-hearted\r\narrogance, of inability to understand that now and then the strongest\r\nmay be in need of aid, and that for this reason alone, if for no other,\r\nthe strong should always be glad of the chance in turn to aid the weak.\r\n\r\nThe Young Men’s Christian Associations and the Young Women’s\r\nChristian Associations, which have now spread over all the country,\r\nare invaluable because they can reach every one. I am certainly a\r\nbeneficiary myself, having not infrequently used them as clubs or\r\nreading-rooms when I was in some city in which I had but little or no\r\npersonal acquaintance. In part they develop the good qualities of those\r\nwho join them; in part they do what is even more valuable, that is,\r\nsimply give opportunity for the men or women to develop the qualities\r\nthemselves. In most cases they provide reading-rooms and gymnasiums,\r\nand therefore furnish a means for a man or woman to pass his or her\r\nleisure hours in profit or amusement as seems best. The average\r\nindividual will not spend the hours in which he is not working in doing\r\nsomething that is unpleasant, and absolutely the only way permanently\r\nto draw average men or women from occupations and amusements that\r\nare unhealthy for soul or body is to furnish an alternative which\r\nthey will accept. To forbid all amusements, or to treat innocent and\r\nvicious amusements as on the same plane, simply ensures recruits for\r\nthe vicious amusements. The Young Men’s and Young Women’s Christian\r\nAssociations would have demonstrated their value a hundredfold over\r\nif they had done nothing more than furnish reading-rooms, gymnasiums,\r\nand places where, especially after nightfall, those without homes,\r\nor without attractive homes, could go without receiving injury. They\r\nfurnish meeting-grounds for many young men who otherwise would be\r\ndriven, perhaps to the saloon, or if not, then to some cigar-store or\r\nother lounging-place, where at the best the conversation would not\r\nbe elevating, and at the worst companionships might be formed which\r\nwould lead to future disaster. In addition to this the associations\r\ngive every opportunity for self-improvement to those who care to\r\ntake advantage of the opportunity, and an astonishing number do take\r\nadvantage of it.\r\n\r\nMention was made above of some of the sources from which at times\r\nwe drew policemen while engaged in managing the New York Police\r\nDepartment. Several came from Young Men’s Christian Associations. One\r\nof them whom we got from the Bowery Branch of the Young Men’s Christian\r\nAssociation I remember particularly. I had gone around there one night,\r\nand the secretary mentioned to me that they had a young man who had\r\njust rescued a woman from a burning building, showing great strength,\r\ncoolness, and courage. The story interested me, and I asked him to\r\nsend for the young fellow. When he turned up he proved to be a Jew,\r\nOtto R——, who, when very young, had come over with his people from\r\nRussia at the time of one of the waves of persecution in that country.\r\nHe was evidently physically of the right type, and as he had been\r\nstudying in the association classes for some time he was also mentally\r\nfit, while his feat at the fire showed he had good moral qualities. We\r\nwere going to hold the examinations in a few days, and I told him to\r\ntry them. Sure enough, he passed and was appointed. He made one of the\r\nbest policemen we put on. As a result of his appointment, which meant\r\ntripling the salary he had been earning, and making an immense bound in\r\nsocial standing, he was able to keep his mother and old grandmother in\r\ncomfort, and see to the starting of his small brothers and sisters in\r\nlife; for he was already a good son and brother, so that it was not\r\nsurprising that he made a good policeman.\r\n\r\nI have not dwelt on the work of the State charitable institutions, or\r\nof those who are paid to do charitable work as officers and otherwise.\r\nBut it is bare justice to point out that the great majority of those\r\nthus paid have gone into the work, not for the sake of the money, but\r\nfor the sake of the work itself, though, being dependent upon their own\r\nexertions for a livelihood, they are obliged to receive some recompense\r\nfor their services.\r\n\r\nThere is one class of public servants, however, not employed directly\r\nas philanthropic agents, whose work, nevertheless, is as truly\r\nphilanthropic in character as that of any man or woman existing. I\r\nallude to the public-school teachers whose schools lie in the poorer\r\nquarters of the city. In dealing with any body of men and women general\r\nstatements must be made cautiously, and it must always be understood\r\nthat there are numerous exceptions. Speaking generally, however, the\r\nwomen teachers—I mention these because they are more numerous than\r\nthe men—who carry on their work in the poorer districts of the great\r\ncities form as high-principled and useful a body of citizens as is\r\nto be found in the entire community, and render an amount of service\r\nwhich can hardly be paralleled by that of any other equal number of men\r\nor women. Most women who lead lives actively devoted to intelligent\r\nwork for others grow to have a certain look of serene and high purpose\r\nwhich stamps them at once. This look is generally seen, for instance,\r\namong the higher types of women doctors, trained nurses, and of those\r\nwho devote their lives to work among the poor; and it is precisely\r\nthis look which one so often sees on the faces of those public-school\r\nteachers who have grown to regard the welfare of their pupils as\r\nthe vital interest of their own lives. It is not merely the regular\r\nday-work the school-teachers do, but the amount of attention they pay\r\noutside their regular classes; the influence they have in shaping\r\nthe lives of the boys, and perhaps even more of the girls, brought\r\nin contact with them; the care they take of the younger, and the way\r\nthey unconsciously hold up ideals to the elder boys and girls, to whom\r\nthey often represent the most tangible embodiment of what is best in\r\nAmerican life. They are a great force for producing good citizenship.\r\nAbove all things, they represent the most potent power in Americanizing\r\nas well as in humanizing the children of the newcomers of every grade\r\nwho arrive here from Europe. Where the immigrant parents are able to\r\nmake their way in the world, their children have no more difficulty\r\nthan the children of the native-born in becoming part of American life,\r\nin sharing all its privileges and in doing all its duties. But the\r\nchildren of the very poor of foreign birth would be handicapped almost\r\nas much as their parents, were it not for the public schools and the\r\nstart thus given them. Loyalty to the flag is taught by precept and\r\npractice in all these public schools, and loyalty to the principles of\r\ngood citizenship is also taught in no merely perfunctory manner.\r\n\r\nHere I hardly touch upon the “little red schoolhouse” out in the\r\ncountry districts simply because in the country districts all of\r\nour children go to the same schools, and thereby get an inestimable\r\nknowledge of the solidarity of our American life. I have touched on\r\nthis in a former article, and I can here only say that it would be\r\nimpossible to overestimate the good done by the association this\r\nengenders, and the excellent educational work of the teachers. We\r\nalways feel that we have given our children no small advantage by the\r\nmere fact of allowing them to go to these little district schools,\r\nwhere they all have the same treatment and are all tried by the same\r\nstandard. But with us in the country the district school is only\r\nphilanthropic in that excellent sense in which all joint effort for the\r\ncommon good is philanthropic.\r\n\r\nA very wholesome effect has been produced in great cities by the\r\nuniversity settlements, college settlements, and similar efforts to\r\ndo practical good by bringing closer together the more and the less\r\nfortunate in life. It is no easy task to make movements of this\r\nkind succeed. If managed in a spirit of patronizing condescension,\r\nor with ignorance of the desires, needs, and passions of those round\r\nabout, little good indeed will come from them. The fact that, instead\r\nof little, much good does in reality result, is due to the entirely\r\npractical methods and the spirit of comradeship shown by those foremost\r\nin these organizations. One particularly good feature has been their\r\ntendency to get into politics. Of course this has its drawbacks,\r\nbut they are outweighed by the advantages. Clean politics is simply\r\none form of applied good citizenship. No man can be a really good\r\ncitizen unless he takes a lively interest in politics from a high\r\nstandpoint. Moreover, the minute that a move is made in politics, the\r\npeople who are helped and those who would help them grow to have a\r\ncommon interest which is genuine and absorbing instead of being in any\r\ndegree artificial, and this will bring them together as nothing else\r\nwould. Part of the good that results from such community of feeling\r\nis precisely like the good that results from the community of feeling\r\nabout a club, football team, or baseball nine. This in itself has a\r\ngood side; but there is an even better side, due to the fact that\r\ndisinterested motives are appealed to, and that men are made to feel\r\nthat they are working for others, for the community as a whole as well\r\nas for themselves.\r\n\r\nThere remain the host of philanthropic workers who can not be classed\r\nin any of the above-mentioned classes. They do most good when they are\r\nin touch with some organization, although, in addition, the strongest\r\nwill keep some of their leisure time for work on individual lines to\r\nmeet the cases where no organized relief will accomplish anything.\r\nPhilanthropy has undoubtedly been a good deal discredited both by\r\nthe exceedingly noxious individuals who go into it with ostentation\r\nto make a reputation, and by the only less noxious persons who are\r\nfoolish and indiscriminate givers. Anything that encourages pauperism,\r\nanything that relaxes the manly fibre and lowers self-respect,\r\nis an unmixed evil. The soup-kitchen style of philanthropy is as\r\nthoroughly demoralizing as most forms of vice or oppression, and it\r\nis of course particularly revolting when some corporation or private\r\nindividual undertakes it, not even in a spirit of foolish charity,\r\nbut for purposes of self-advertisement. In a time of sudden and\r\nwidespread disaster, caused by a flood, a blizzard, an earthquake, or\r\nan epidemic, there may be ample reason for the extension of charity\r\non the largest scale to every one who needs it. But these conditions\r\nare wholly exceptional, and the methods of relief employed to meet\r\nthem must also be treated as wholly exceptional. In charity the one\r\nthing always to be remembered is that, while any man may slip and\r\nshould at once be helped to rise to his feet, yet no man can be\r\ncarried with advantage either to him or to the community. The greatest\r\npossible good can be done by the extension of a helping hand at the\r\nright moment, but the attempt to carry any one permanently can end in\r\nnothing but harm. The really hard-working philanthropists, who spend\r\ntheir lives in doing good to their neighbors, do not, as a rule,\r\nbelong to the “mushy” class, and thoroughly realize the unwisdom of\r\nfoolish and indiscriminate giving, or of wild and crude plans of social\r\nreformations. The young enthusiast who is for the first time brought\r\ninto contact with the terrible suffering and stunting degradation which\r\nare so evident in many parts of our great cities is apt to become so\r\nappalled as to lose his head. If there is a twist in his moral or\r\nmental make-up, he will never regain his poise; but if he is sound\r\nand healthy he will soon realize that things being bad affords no\r\njustification for making them infinitely worse, and that the only safe\r\nrule is for each man to strive to do his duty in a spirit of sanity and\r\nwholesome common-sense. No one of us can make the world move on very\r\nfar, but it moves at all only when each one of a very large number does\r\nhis duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER AND SUCCESS\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED IN THE “OUTLOOK,” MARCH 31, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nA year or two ago I was speaking to a famous Yale professor, one of\r\nthe most noted scholars in the country, and one who is even more than\r\na scholar, because he is in every sense of the word a man. We had been\r\ndiscussing the Yale-Harvard foot-ball teams, and he remarked of a\r\ncertain player: “I told them not to take him, for he was slack in his\r\nstudies, and my experience is that, as a rule, the man who is slack in\r\nhis studies will be slack in his foot-ball work; it is character that\r\ncounts in both.”\r\n\r\nBodily vigor is good, and vigor of intellect is even better, but far\r\nabove both is character. It is true, of course, that a genius may,\r\non certain lines, do more than a brave and manly fellow who is not\r\na genius; and so, in sports, vast physical strength may overcome\r\nweakness, even though the puny body may have in it the heart of a\r\nlion. But, in the long run, in the great battle of life, no brilliancy\r\nof intellect, no perfection of bodily development, will count when\r\nweighed in the balance against that assemblage of virtues, active and\r\npassive, of moral qualities, which we group together under the name of\r\ncharacter; and if between any two contestants, even in college sport or\r\nin college work, the difference in character on the right side is as\r\ngreat as the difference of intellect or strength the other way, it is\r\nthe character side that will win.\r\n\r\nOf course this does not mean that either intellect or bodily vigor can\r\nsafely be neglected. On the contrary, it means that both should be\r\ndeveloped, and that not the least of the benefits of developing both\r\ncomes from the indirect effect which this development itself has upon\r\nthe character. In very rude and ignorant communities all schooling is\r\nmore or less looked down upon; but there are now very few places indeed\r\nin the United States where elementary schooling is not considered a\r\nnecessity. There are any number of men, however, priding themselves\r\nupon being “hard-headed” and “practical,” who sneer at book-learning\r\nand at every form of higher education, under the impression that the\r\nadditional mental culture is at best useless, and is ordinarily harmful\r\nin practical life. Not long ago two of the wealthiest men in the United\r\nStates publicly committed themselves to the proposition that to go to\r\ncollege was a positive disadvantage for a young man who strove for\r\nsuccess. Now, of course, the very most successful men we have ever had,\r\nmen like Lincoln, had no chance to go to college, but did have such\r\nindomitable tenacity and such keen appreciation of the value of wisdom\r\nthat they set to work and learned for themselves far more than they\r\ncould have been taught in any academy. On the other hand, boys of weak\r\nfibre, who go to high school or college instead of going to work after\r\ngetting through the primary schools, may be seriously damaged instead\r\nof benefited. But, as a rule, if the boy has in him the right stuff, it\r\nis a great advantage to him should his circumstances be so fortunate\r\nas to enable him to get the years of additional mental training. The\r\ntrouble with the two rich men whose views are above quoted was that,\r\nowing largely perhaps to their own defects in early training, they did\r\nnot know what success really was. Their speeches merely betrayed their\r\nown limitations, and did not furnish any argument against education.\r\nSuccess must always include, as its first element, earning a competence\r\nfor the support of the man himself, and for the bringing up of those\r\ndependent upon him. In the vast majority of cases it ought to include\r\nfinancially rather more than this. But the acquisition of wealth is\r\nnot in the least the only test of success. After a certain amount of\r\nwealth has been accumulated, the accumulation of more is of very little\r\nconsequence indeed from the standpoint of success, as success should\r\nbe understood both by the community and the individual. Wealthy men who\r\nuse their wealth aright are a great power for good in the community,\r\nand help to upbuild that material national prosperity which must\r\nunderlie national greatness; but if this were the only kind of success,\r\nthe nation would be indeed poorly off. Successful statesmen, soldiers,\r\nsailors, explorers, historians, poets, and scientific men are also\r\nessential to national greatness, and, in fact, very much more essential\r\nthan any mere successful business man can possibly be. The average man,\r\ninto whom the average boy develops, is, of course, not going to be a\r\nmarvel in any line, but, if he only chooses to try, he can be very\r\ngood in any line, and the chances of his doing good work are immensely\r\nincreased if he has trained his mind. Of course, if, as a result of\r\nhis high-school, academy, or college experience, he gets to thinking\r\nthat the only kind of learning is that to be found in books, he will do\r\nvery little; but if he keeps his mental balance,—that is, if he shows\r\ncharacter,—he will understand both what learning can do and what it\r\ncan not, and he will be all the better the more he can get.\r\n\r\nA good deal the same thing is true of bodily development. Exactly\r\nas one kind of man sneers at college work because he does not think\r\nit bears any immediate fruit in money-getting, so another type of\r\nman sneers at college sports because he does not see their immediate\r\neffect for good in practical life. Of course, if they are carried to\r\nan excessive degree, they are altogether bad. It is a good thing for a\r\nboy to have captained his school or college eleven, but it is a very\r\nbad thing if, twenty years afterward, all that can be said of him is\r\nthat he has continued to take an interest in foot-ball, base-ball, or\r\nboxing, and has with him the memory that he was once captain. A very\r\nacute observer has pointed out that, not impossibly, excessive devotion\r\nto sports and games has proved a serious detriment in the British\r\narmy, by leading the officers and even the men to neglect the hard,\r\npractical work of their profession for the sake of racing, foot-ball,\r\nbase-ball, polo, and tennis—until they received a very rude awakening\r\nat the hands of the Boers. Of course this means merely that any healthy\r\npursuit can be abused. The student in a college who “crams” in order\r\nto stand at the head of his class, and neglects his health and stunts\r\nhis development by working for high marks, may do himself much damage;\r\nbut all that he proves is that the abuse of study is wrong. The fact\r\nremains that the study itself is essential. So it is with vigorous\r\npastimes. If rowing or foot-ball or base-ball is treated as the end of\r\nlife by any considerable section of a community, then that community\r\nshows itself to be in an unhealthy condition. If treated as it should\r\nbe,—that is, as good, healthy play,—it is of great benefit, not only\r\nto the body, but in its effect upon character. To study hard implies\r\ncharacter in the student, and to work hard at a sport which entails\r\nsevere physical exertion and steady training also implies character.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of qualities go to make up character, for, emphatically, the\r\nterm should include the positive no less than the negative virtues. If\r\nwe say of a boy or a man, “He is of good character,” we mean that he\r\ndoes not do a great many things that are wrong, and we also mean that\r\nhe does do a great many things which imply much effort of will and\r\nreadiness to face what is disagreeable. He must not steal, he must not\r\nbe intemperate, he must not be vicious in any way; he must not be mean\r\nor brutal; he must not bully the weak. In fact, he must refrain from\r\nwhatever is evil. But besides refraining from evil, he must do good.\r\nHe must be brave and energetic; he must be resolute and persevering.\r\nThe Bible always inculcates the need of the positive no less than\r\nthe negative virtues, although certain people who profess to teach\r\nChristianity are apt to dwell wholly on the negative. We are bidden\r\nnot merely to be harmless as doves, but also as wise as serpents. It\r\nis very much easier to carry out the former part of the order than the\r\nlatter; while, on the other hand, it is of much more importance for\r\nthe good of mankind that our goodness should be accompanied by wisdom\r\nthan that we should merely be harmless. If with the serpent wisdom we\r\nunite the serpent guile, terrible will be the damage we do; and if,\r\nwith the best of intentions, we can only manage to deserve the epithet\r\nof “harmless,” it is hardly worth while to have lived in the world at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no more important component of character than\r\nsteadfast resolution. The boy who is going to make a great man, or is\r\ngoing to count in any way in after life, must make up his mind not\r\nmerely to overcome a thousand obstacles, but to win in spite of a\r\nthousand repulses or defeats. He may be able to wrest success along\r\nthe lines on which he originally started. He may have to try something\r\nentirely new. On the one hand, he must not be volatile and irresolute,\r\nand, on the other hand, he must not fear to try a new line because he\r\nhas failed in another. Grant did well as a boy and well as a young\r\nman; then came a period of trouble and failure, and then the Civil War\r\nand his opportunity; and he grasped it, and rose until his name is\r\namong the greatest in our history. Young Lincoln, struggling against\r\nincalculable odds, worked his way up, trying one thing and another\r\nuntil he, too, struck out boldly into the turbulent torrent of our\r\nnational life, at a time when only the boldest and wisest could so\r\ncarry themselves as to win success and honor; and from the struggle he\r\nwon both death and honor, and stands for evermore among the greatest of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nCharacter is shown in peace no less than in war. As the greatest\r\nfertility of invention, the greatest perfection of armament, will not\r\nmake soldiers out of cowards, so no mental training and no bodily\r\nvigor will make a nation great if it lacks the fundamental principles\r\nof honesty and moral cleanliness. After the death of Alexander the\r\nGreat nearly all of the then civilized world was divided among the\r\nGreek monarchies ruled by his companions and their successors. This\r\nGreek world was very brilliant and very wealthy. It contained haughty\r\nmilitary empires, and huge trading cities, under republican government,\r\nwhich attained the highest pitch of commercial and industrial\r\nprosperity. Art flourished to an extraordinary degree; science advanced\r\nas never before. There were academies for men of letters; there were\r\nmany orators, many philosophers. Merchants and business men throve\r\napace, and for a long period the Greek soldiers kept the superiority\r\nand renown they had won under the mighty conqueror of the East. But\r\nthe heart of the people was incurably false, incurably treacherous and\r\ndebased. Almost every statesman had his price, almost every soldier was\r\na mercenary who, for a sufficient inducement, would betray any cause.\r\nMoral corruption ate into the whole social and domestic fabric, until,\r\na little more than a century after the death of Alexander, the empire\r\nwhich he had left had become a mere glittering shell, which went down\r\nlike a house of cards on impact with the Romans; for the Romans, with\r\nall their faults, were then a thoroughly manly race—a race of strong,\r\nvirile character.\r\n\r\nAlike for the nation and the individual, the one indispensable\r\nrequisite is character—character that does and dares as well as\r\nendures, character that is active in the performance of virtue no less\r\nthan firm in the refusal to do aught that is vicious or degraded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH AND NINTH COMMANDMENTS IN POLITICS\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED IN THE “OUTLOOK,” MAY 12, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two commandments which are specially applicable in public life are\r\nthe eighth and the ninth. Not only every politician, high or low, but\r\nevery citizen interested in politics, and especially every man who, in\r\na newspaper or on the stump, advocates or condemns any public policy or\r\nany public man, should remember always that the two cardinal points in\r\nhis doctrine ought to be, “Thou shalt not steal,” and “Thou shalt not\r\nbear false witness against thy neighbor.” He should also, of course,\r\nremember that the multitude of men who break the moral law expressed\r\nin these two commandments are not to be justified because they keep\r\nout of the clutches of the human law. Robbery and theft, perjury and\r\nsubornation of perjury, are crimes punishable by the courts; but many\r\na man who technically never commits any one of these crimes is yet\r\nmorally quite as guilty as is his less adroit but not more wicked,\r\nand possibly infinitely less dangerous, brother who gets into the\r\npenitentiary.\r\n\r\nAs regards the eighth commandment, while the remark of one of the\r\nfounders of our government, that the whole art of politics consists\r\nin being honest, is an overstatement, it remains true that absolute\r\nhonesty is what Cromwell would have called a “fundamental” of healthy\r\npolitical life. We can afford to differ on the currency, the tariff,\r\nand foreign policy; but we can not afford to differ on the question of\r\nhonesty if we expect our Republic permanently to endure. No community\r\nis healthy where it is ever necessary to distinguish one politician\r\namong his fellows because “he is honest.” Honesty is not so much a\r\ncredit as an absolute prerequisite to efficient service to the public.\r\nUnless a man is honest we have no right to keep him in public life, it\r\nmatters not how brilliant his capacity, it hardly matters how great\r\nhis power of doing good service on certain lines may be. Probably\r\nvery few men will disagree with this statement in the abstract, yet\r\nin the concrete there is much wavering about it. The number of public\r\nservants who actually take bribes is not very numerous outside of\r\ncertain well-known centres of festering corruption. But the temptation\r\nto be dishonest often comes in insidious ways. There are not a few\r\npublic men who, though they would repel with indignation an offer\r\nof a bribe, will give certain corporations special legislative and\r\nexecutive privileges because they have contributed heavily to campaign\r\nfunds; will permit loose and extravagant work because a contractor has\r\npolitical influence; or, at any rate, will permit a public servant to\r\ntake public money without rendering an adequate return, by conniving\r\nat inefficient service on the part of men who are protected by\r\nprominent party leaders. Various degrees of moral guilt are involved\r\nin the multitudinous actions of this kind; but, after all, directly or\r\nindirectly, every such case comes dangerously near the border-line of\r\nthe commandment which, in forbidding theft, certainly by implication\r\nforbids the connivance at theft, or the failure to punish it. One of\r\nthe favorite schemes of reformers is to devise some method by which\r\nbig corporations can be prevented from making heavy subscriptions to\r\ncampaign funds, and thereby acquiring improper influence. But the best\r\nway to prevent them from making contributions for improper purposes\r\nis simply to elect as public servants, not professional denouncers\r\nof corporations,—for such men are in practice usually their most\r\nservile tools,—but men who say, and mean, that they will neither be\r\nfor nor against corporations; that, on the one hand, they will not\r\nbe frightened from doing them justice by popular clamor, or, on the\r\nother hand, led by any interest whatsoever into doing them more than\r\njustice. At the Anti-Trust Conference last summer Mr. Bryan commented,\r\nwith a sneer, on the fact that “of course” New York would not pass\r\na law prohibiting contributions by corporations. He was right in\r\nthinking that New York, while it retains rational civic habits, will\r\nnot pass ridiculous legislation which can not be made effective, and\r\nwhich is merely intended to deceive during the campaign the voters\r\nleast capable of thought. But there will not be the slightest need for\r\nsuch legislation if only the public spirit is sufficiently healthy,\r\nsufficiently removed alike from corruption and from demagogy, to see\r\nthat each corporation receives its exact rights and nothing more;\r\nand this is exactly what is now being done in New York by men whom\r\ndishonest corporations dread a hundred times more than they dread the\r\ndemagogic agitators who are a terror merely to honest corporations.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, not enough that a public official should be honest.\r\nNo amount of honesty will avail if he is not also brave and wise. The\r\nweakling and the coward can not be saved by honesty alone; but without\r\nhonesty the brave and able man is merely a civic wild beast who should\r\nbe hunted down by every lover of righteousness. No man who is corrupt,\r\nno man who condones corruption in others, can possibly do his duty\r\nby the community. When this truth is accepted as axiomatic in our\r\npolitics, then, and not till then, shall we see such a moral uplifting\r\nof the people as will render, for instance, Tammany rule in New York,\r\nas Tammany rule now is, no more possible than it would be possible to\r\nrevive the robber baronage of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nGreat is the danger to our country from the failure among our public\r\nmen to live up to the eighth commandment, from the callousness in the\r\npublic which permits such shortcomings. Yet it is not exaggeration to\r\nsay that the danger is quite as great from those who year in and year\r\nout violate the ninth commandment by bearing false witness against the\r\nhonest man, and who thereby degrade him and elevate the dishonest man\r\nuntil they are both on the same level. The public is quite as much\r\nharmed in the one case as in the other, by the one set of wrong-doers\r\nas by the other. “Liar” is just as ugly a word as “thief,” because\r\nit implies the presence of just as ugly a sin in one case as in the\r\nother. If a man lies under oath or procures the lie of another under\r\noath, if he perjures himself or suborns perjury, he is guilty under\r\nthe statute law. Under the higher law, under the great law of morality\r\nand righteousness, he is precisely as guilty if, instead of lying in a\r\ncourt, he lies in a newspaper or on the stump; and in all probability\r\nthe evil effects of his conduct are infinitely more wide-spread and\r\nmore pernicious. The difference between perjury and mendacity is not\r\nin the least one of morals or ethics. It is simply one of legal forms.\r\n\r\nThe same man may break both commandments, or one group of men may be\r\ntempted to break one and another group of men the other. In our civic\r\nlife the worst offenders against the law of honesty owe no small\r\npart of their immunity to those who sin against the law by bearing\r\nfalse witness against their honest neighbors. The sin is, of course,\r\npeculiarly revolting when coupled with hypocrisy, when it is committed\r\nin the name of morality. Few politicians do as much harm as the\r\nnewspaper editor, the clergyman, or the lay reformer who, day in and\r\nday out, by virulent and untruthful invective aimed at the upholders of\r\nhonesty, weakens them for the benefit of the frankly vicious. We need\r\nfearless criticism of dishonest men, and of honest men on any point\r\nwhere they go wrong; but even more do we need criticism which shall be\r\ntruthful both in what it says and in what it leaves unsaid—truthful\r\nin words and truthful in the impression it designs to leave upon the\r\nreaders’ or hearers’ minds.\r\n\r\nWe need absolute honesty in public life; and we shall not get it until\r\nwe remember that truth-telling must go hand in hand with it, and that\r\nit is quite as important not to tell an untruth about a decent man as\r\nit is to tell the truth about one who is not decent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEST AND THE GOOD\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED IN THE “CHURCHMAN,” MARCH 17, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the people to whom we are all under a very real debt of\r\nobligation for the help they give to those seeking for good government\r\nat Albany is Bishop Doane. All of us who at the State capital have\r\nbeen painfully striving to wrest, often from adverse conditions, the\r\nbest results obtainable, are strengthened and heartened in every way\r\nby the active interest the bishop takes in every good cause, the keen\r\nintelligence with which he sees “the instant need of things,” and the\r\nsane and wholesome spirit, as remote from fanaticism as from cynicism,\r\nin which he approaches all public questions.\r\n\r\nQuite unconsciously the bishop the other day gave an admirable\r\nsumming up of his own attitude in quoting an extract from the “Life”\r\nof Archbishop Benson. In a letter which the archbishop wrote to his\r\nchancellor in regard to a bill regulating patronage in the Church of\r\nEngland occurs the following passage:\r\n\r\n“The bill does not, of course, represent my ideal, but it is a careful\r\ncollection of points which could be claimed, which it would be\r\nindecent to refuse, and which would make a considerable difference\r\nabout our powers of dealing rightly with cases. Gain that platform, and\r\nit would be a footing for more ideal measures. I do not want the best\r\nto be any more the deadly enemy of the good. We climb through degrees\r\nof comparison.”\r\n\r\nThis is really a description as excellent as it is epigrammatic of\r\nthe attitude which must be maintained by every public man, by every\r\nleader and guide of public thought, who hopes to accomplish work of\r\nreal worth to the community. It is a melancholy fact that many of the\r\nworst laws put upon the statute-books have been put there with the\r\nbest of intentions by thoroughly well-meaning people. Mere desire\r\nto do right can no more by itself make a good statesman than it can\r\nmake a good general. Of course it is entirely unnecessary to say that\r\nnothing atones for the lack of this desire to do right. Exactly as the\r\nbrilliant military ability of an Arnold merely makes his treason the\r\nmore abhorrent, so our statesmanship can not be put upon the proper\r\nplane of purity and ability until the condemnation visited upon a\r\ntraitor like Arnold is visited with no less severity upon the statesman\r\nwho betrays the people by corruption. The one is as great an offence as\r\nthe other. Military power is at an end when the honor of the soldier\r\ncan no longer be trusted; and, in the right sense of the word, civic\r\ngreatness is at an end when civic righteousness is no longer its\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, every one knows that a soldier must be more than merely\r\nhonorable before he is fit to do credit to the country; and just the\r\nsame thing is true of a statesman. He must have high ideals, and the\r\nleader of public opinion in the pulpit, in the press, on the platform,\r\nor on the stump must preach high ideals. But the possession or\r\npreaching of these high ideals may not only be useless, but a source of\r\npositive harm, if unaccompanied by practical good sense, if they do not\r\nlead to the effort to get the best possible when the perfect best is\r\nnot attainable—and in this life the perfect best rarely is attainable.\r\nEvery leader of a great reform has to contend, on the one hand, with\r\nthe open, avowed enemies of the reform, and, on the other hand, with\r\nits extreme advocates, who wish the impossible, and who join hands with\r\ntheir extreme opponents to defeat the rational friends of the reform.\r\nOf course the typical instance of this kind of conduct was afforded by\r\nWendell Phillips when in 1864 he added his weight, slight though it\r\nwas, to the copperhead opposition to the re-election of Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe alliance, between Blifil and Black George is world-old. Blifil\r\nalways acts in the name of morality. Often, of course, he is not\r\nmoral at all. It is a great mistake to think that the extremist is a\r\nbetter man than the moderate. Usually the difference is not that he\r\nis morally stronger, but that he is intellectually weaker. He is not\r\nmore virtuous. He is simply more foolish. This is notably true in our\r\nAmerican life of many of those who are most pessimistic in denouncing\r\nthe condition of our politics. Certainly there is infinite room for\r\nimprovement, infinite need of fearless and trenchant criticism; but\r\nthe improvement can only come through intelligent and straightforward\r\neffort. It is set back by those extremists who by their action always\r\ninvite reaction, and, above all, by those worst enemies of our public\r\nhonesty who by their incessant attacks upon good men give the utmost\r\npossible assistance to the bad.\r\n\r\nOffenders of this type need but a short shrift. Though extremists\r\nafter a fashion; they are morally worse instead of better than the\r\nmoderates. There remains, however, a considerable group of men who\r\nare really striving for the best, and who mistakenly, though in good\r\nfaith, permit the best to be the enemy of the good. Under very rare\r\nconditions their attitude may be right, and because it is thus right\r\nonce in a hundred times they are apt to be blind to the harm they do\r\nthe other ninety-nine times. These men need, above all, to realize\r\nthat healthy growth can not normally come through revolution. A\r\nrevolution is sometimes necessary, but if revolutions become habitual\r\nthe country in which they take place is going down-hill. Hysteria in\r\nany form is incompatible with sane and healthy endeavor. We must never\r\ncompromise in a way that means retrogression. But in moving forward\r\nwe must realize that normally the condition of sure progress is that\r\nit shall not be so fast as to ensure a revolt and a stoppage of the\r\nupward course. In this country especially, where what we have now to\r\ncontend with is not so much any one concrete evil as a general lowering\r\nof the standards, we must remember that to keep these standards\r\nhigh does not at all imply that they should be put upon impossible\r\npositions—positions which must ultimately be abandoned. There can\r\nbe no compromise on the great fundamental principles of morality. A\r\npublic man who directly or indirectly breaks the eighth commandment is\r\njust as guilty as an editor or a speaker who breaks the ninth, and it\r\nmatters little whether the fault be due to venality in the one case or\r\nto morbid vanity and mean envy in the other. If a man is dishonest he\r\nshould be driven from public life. If a course of policy is vicious\r\nand produces harm it should be reversed at any cost. But when we come\r\nto the countless measures and efforts for doing good, let us keep ever\r\nclearly in mind that while we must always strive for the utmost good\r\nthat can be obtained, and must be content with no less, yet that we\r\ndo only harm if, by intemperate championship of the impossible good,\r\nwe cut ourselves off from the opportunity to work a real abatement of\r\nexisting and menacing evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROMISE AND PERFORMANCE\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED IN THE “OUTLOOK,” JULY 28, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is customary to express wonder and horror at the cynical baseness\r\nof the doctrines of Machiavelli. Both the wonder and the horror are\r\njustified,—though it would perhaps be wiser to keep them for the\r\nsociety which the Italian described rather than for the describer\r\nhimself,—but it is somewhat astonishing that there should be so little\r\ninsistence upon the fact that Machiavelli rests his whole system upon\r\nhis contemptuous belief in the folly and low civic morality of the\r\nmultitude, and their demand for fine promises and their indifference to\r\nperformance. Thus he says: “It is necessary to be a great deceiver and\r\nhypocrite; for men are so simple and yield so readily to the wants of\r\nthe moment that he who will trick shall always find another who will\r\nsuffer himself to be tricked.... Therefore a ruler must take great care\r\nthat no word shall slip from his mouth that shall not be full of piety,\r\ntrust, humanity, religion, and simple faith, and he must appear to eye\r\nand ear all compact of these, ... because the vulgar are always caught\r\nby appearance and by the event, and in this world there are none but\r\nthe vulgar.”\r\n\r\nIt therefore appears that Machiavelli’s system is predicated partly on\r\nthe entire indifference to performance of promise by the prince and\r\npartly upon a greedy demand for impossible promises among the people.\r\nThe infamy of the conduct championed by Machiavelli as proper for\r\npublic men is usually what rivets the attention, but the folly which\r\nalone makes such infamy possible is quite as well worthy of study.\r\nHypocrisy is a peculiarly revolting vice alike in public and private\r\nlife; and in public life—at least in high position—it can only be\r\npracticed on a large scale for any length of time in those places where\r\nthe people in mass really warrant Machiavelli’s description, and are\r\ncontent with a complete divorce between promise and performance.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to say which is the surest way of bringing about\r\nsuch a complete divorce: on the one hand, the tolerance in a public man\r\nof the nonperformance of promises which can be kept; or, on the other\r\nhand, the insistence by the public upon promises which they either know\r\nor ought to know can not be kept. When in public speech or in a party\r\nplatform a policy is outlined which it is known can not or will not be\r\npursued, the fact is a reflection not only upon the speaker and the\r\nplatform-maker, but upon the public feeling to which they appeal. When\r\na section of the people demand from a candidate promises which he can\r\nnot believe that he will be able to fulfil and, on his refusal, support\r\nsome man who cheerfully guarantees an immediate millennium, why, under\r\nsuch circumstances the people are striving to bring about in America\r\nsome of the conditions of public life which produced the profligacy and\r\ntyranny of mediæval Italy. Such conduct means that the capacity for\r\nself-government has atrophied; and the hard-headed common-sense with\r\nwhich the American people, as a whole, refuse to sanction such conduct\r\nis the best possible proof and guarantee of their capacity to perform\r\nthe high and difficult task of administering the greatest Republic upon\r\nwhich the sun has ever shone.\r\n\r\nThere are always politicians willing, on the one hand, to promise\r\neverything to the people, and, on the other, to perform everything\r\nfor the machine or the boss, with chuckling delight in the success of\r\ntheir efforts to hoodwink the former and serve the latter. Now, not\r\nonly should such politicians be regarded as infamous, but the people\r\nwho are hoodwinked by them should share the blame. The man who is taken\r\nin by, or demands, impossible promises is not much less culpable than\r\nthe politician who deliberately makes such promises and then breaks\r\nfaith. Thus when any public man says that he “will never compromise\r\nunder any conditions,” he is certain to receive the applause of a few\r\nemotional people who do not think correctly, and the one fact about him\r\nthat can be instantly asserted as true beyond peradventure is that, if\r\nhe is a serious personage at all, he is deliberately lying, while it\r\nis only less certain that he will be guilty of base and dishonorable\r\ncompromise when the opportunity arises. “Compromise” is so often used\r\nin a bad sense that it is difficult to remember that properly it merely\r\ndescribes the process of reaching an agreement. Naturally there are\r\ncertain subjects on which no man can compromise. For instance, there\r\nmust be no compromise under any circumstances with official corruption,\r\nand of course no man should hesitate to say as much. Again, an honest\r\npolitician is entirely justified in promising on the stump that he will\r\nmake no compromise on any question of right and wrong. This promise he\r\ncan and ought to make good. But when questions of policy arise—and\r\nmost questions, from the tariff to municipal ownership of public\r\nutilities and the franchise tax, are primarily questions of policy—he\r\nwill have to come to some kind of working agreement with his fellows,\r\nand if he says that he will not, he either deliberately utters what he\r\nknows to be false, or else he ensures for himself the humiliation of\r\nbeing forced to break his word. No decent politician need compromise in\r\nany way save as Washington and Lincoln did. He need not go nearly as\r\nfar as Hamilton, Jefferson, and Jackson went; but some distance he must\r\ngo if he expects to accomplish anything.\r\n\r\nAgain, take the case of those who promise an impossible good to the\r\ncommunity as a whole if a given course of legislation is adopted. The\r\nman who makes such a promise may be a well-meaning but unbalanced\r\nenthusiast, or he may be merely a designing demagogue. In either case\r\nthe people who listen to and believe him are not to be excused, though\r\nthey may be pitied. Softness of heart is an admirable quality, but when\r\nit extends its area until it also becomes softness of head, its results\r\nare anything but admirable. It is a good thing to combine a warm heart\r\nwith a cool head. People really fit for self-government will not be\r\nmisled by over-effusiveness in promise, and, on the other hand, they\r\nwill demand that every proper promise shall be made good.\r\n\r\nWise legislation and upright administration can undoubtedly work\r\nvery great good to a community, and, above all, can give to each\r\nindividual the chance to do the best work for himself. But ultimately\r\nthe individual’s own faculties must form the chief factor in working\r\nout his own salvation. In the last analysis it is the thrift, energy,\r\nself-mastery, and business intelligence of each man which have most\r\nto do with deciding whether he rises or falls. It is easy enough\r\nto devise a scheme of government which shall absolutely nullify all\r\nthese qualities and ensure failure to everybody, whether he deserves\r\nsuccess or not. But the best scheme of government can do little more\r\nthan provide against injustice, and then let the individual rise or\r\nfall on his own merits. Of course something can be done by the State\r\nacting in its collective capacity, and in certain instances such action\r\nmay be necessary to remedy real wrong. Gross misconduct of individuals\r\nor corporations may make it necessary for the State or some of its\r\nsubdivisions to assume the charge of what are called public utilities.\r\nBut when all that can be done in this way has been done, when every\r\nindividual has been saved so far as the State can save him from the\r\ntyranny of any other man or body of men, the individual’s own qualities\r\nof body and mind, his own strength of heart and hand, will remain the\r\ndetermining conditions in his career. The people who trust to or exact\r\npromises that, if a certain political leader is followed or a certain\r\npublic policy adopted, this great truth will cease to operate, are not\r\nmerely leaning on a broken reed, but are working for their own undoing.\r\n\r\nSo much for the men who by their demands for the impossible encourage\r\nthe promise of the impossible, whether in the domain of economic\r\nlegislation or of legislation which has for its object the promotion\r\nof morality. The other side is that no man should be held excusable\r\nif he does not perform what he promises, unless for the best and most\r\nsufficient reason. This should be especially true of every politician.\r\nIt shows a thoroughly unhealthy state of mind when the public pardons\r\nwith a laugh failure to keep a distinct pledge, on the ground that a\r\npolitician can not be expected to confine himself to the truth when on\r\nthe stump or the platform. A man should no more be excused for lying\r\non the stump than for lying off the stump. Of course matters may so\r\nchange that it may be impossible for him, or highly inadvisable for\r\nthe country, that he should try to do what he in good faith said he\r\nwas going to do. But the necessity for the change should be made very\r\nevident, and it should be well understood that such a case is the\r\nexception and not the rule. As a rule, and speaking with due regard\r\nto the exceptions, it should be taken as axiomatic that when a man in\r\npublic life pledges himself to a certain course of action he shall as a\r\nmatter of course do what he said he would do, and shall not be held to\r\nhave acted honorably if he does otherwise.\r\n\r\nAll great fundamental truths are apt to sound rather trite, and yet\r\nin spite of their triteness they need to be reiterated over and over\r\nagain. The visionary or the self-seeking knave who promises the golden\r\nimpossible, and the credulous dupe who is taken in by such a promise,\r\nand who in clutching at the impossible loses the chance of securing the\r\nreal though lesser good, are as old as the political organizations of\r\nmankind. Throughout the history of the world the nations who have done\r\nbest in self-government are those who have demanded from their public\r\nmen only the promise of what can actually be done for righteousness and\r\nhonesty, and who have sternly insisted that such promise must be kept\r\nin letter and in spirit.\r\n\r\nSo it is with the general question of obtaining good government. We\r\ncan not trust the mere doctrinaire; we can not trust the mere closet\r\nreformer, nor yet his acrid brother who himself does nothing, but who\r\nrails at those who endure the heat and burden of the day. Yet we can\r\ntrust still less those base beings who treat politics only as a game\r\nout of which to wrong a soiled livelihood, and in whose vocabulary the\r\nword “practical” has come to be a synonym for whatever is mean and\r\ncorrupt. A man is worthless unless he has in him a lofty devotion to an\r\nideal, and he is worthless also unless he strives to realize this ideal\r\nby practical methods. He must promise, both to himself and to others,\r\nonly what he can perform; but what really can be performed he must\r\npromise, and such promise he must at all hazards make good.\r\n\r\nThe problems that confront us in this age are, after all, in\r\ntheir essence the same as those that have always confronted free\r\npeoples striving to secure and to keep free government. No political\r\nphilosopher of the present day can put the case more clearly than it\r\nwas put by the wonderful old Greeks. Says Aristotle: “Two principles\r\nhave to be kept in view: what is possible, what is becoming; at these\r\nevery man ought to aim.” Plato expresses precisely the same idea:\r\n“Those who are not schooled and practiced in truth [who are not honest\r\nand upright men] can never manage aright the government, nor yet can\r\nthose who spend their lives as closet philosophers; because the former\r\nhave no high purpose to guide their actions, while the latter keep\r\naloof from public life, having the idea that even while yet living they\r\nhave been translated to the Islands of the Blest.... [Men must] both\r\ncontemplate the good and try actually to achieve it. Thus the state\r\nwill be settled as a reality, and not as a dream, like most of those\r\ninhabited by persons fighting about shadows.”[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Translated freely and condensed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN BOY\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED IN “ST. NICHOLAS,” MAY, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course what we have a right to expect of the American boy is that he\r\nshall turn out to be a good American man. Now, the chances are strong\r\nthat he won’t be much of a man unless he is a good deal of a boy. He\r\nmust not be a coward or a weakling, a bully, a shirk, or a prig. He\r\nmust work hard and play hard. He must be clean-minded and clean-lived,\r\nand able to hold his own under all circumstances and against all\r\ncomers. It is only on these conditions that he will grow into the kind\r\nof American man of whom America can be really proud.\r\n\r\nThere are always in life countless tendencies for good and for\r\nevil, and each succeeding generation sees some of these tendencies\r\nstrengthened and some weakened; nor is it by any means always,\r\nalas! that the tendencies for evil are weakened and those for good\r\nstrengthened. But during the last few decades there certainly have\r\nbeen some notable changes for good in boy life. The great growth in\r\nthe love of athletic sports, for instance, while fraught with danger\r\nif it becomes one-sided and unhealthy, has beyond all question had an\r\nexcellent effect in increased manliness. Forty or fifty years ago the\r\nwriter on American morals was sure to deplore the effeminacy and luxury\r\nof young Americans who were born of rich parents. The boy who was well\r\noff then, especially in the big Eastern cities, lived too luxuriously,\r\ntook to billiards as his chief innocent recreation, and felt small\r\nshame in his inability to take part in rough pastimes and field-sports.\r\nNowadays, whatever other faults the son of rich parents may tend to\r\ndevelop, he is at least forced by the opinion of all his associates of\r\nhis own age to bear himself well in manly exercises and to develop his\r\nbody—and therefore, to a certain extent, his character—in the rough\r\nsports which call for pluck, endurance, and physical address.\r\n\r\nOf course boys who live under such fortunate conditions that they have\r\nto do either a good deal of outdoor work or a good deal of what might\r\nbe called natural outdoor play do not need this athletic development.\r\nIn the Civil War the soldiers who came from the prairie and the\r\nbackwoods and the rugged farms where stumps still dotted the clearings,\r\nand who had learned to ride in their infancy, to shoot as soon as they\r\ncould handle a rifle, and to camp out whenever they got the chance,\r\nwere better fitted for military work than any set of mere school or\r\ncollege athletes could possibly be. Moreover, to mis-estimate athletics\r\nis equally bad whether their importance is magnified or minimized. The\r\nGreeks were famous athletes, and as long as their athletic training\r\nhad a normal place in their lives, it was a good thing. But it was a\r\nvery bad thing when they kept up their athletic games while letting\r\nthe stern qualities of soldiership and statesmanship sink into disuse.\r\nSome of the younger readers of this book will certainly sometime read\r\nthe famous letters of the younger Pliny, a Roman who wrote, with what\r\nseems to us a curiously modern touch, in the first century of the\r\npresent era. His correspondence with the Emperor Trajan is particularly\r\ninteresting; and not the least noteworthy thing in it is the tone of\r\ncontempt with which he speaks of the Greek athletic sports, treating\r\nthem as the diversions of an unwarlike people which it was safe to\r\nencourage in order to keep the Greeks from turning into anything\r\nformidable. So at one time the Persian kings had to forbid polo,\r\nbecause soldiers neglected their proper duties for the fascinations\r\nof the game. We can not expect the best work from soldiers who have\r\ncarried to an unhealthy extreme the sports and pastimes which would be\r\nhealthy if indulged in with moderation, and have neglected to learn\r\nas they should the business of their profession. A soldier needs to\r\nknow how to shoot and take cover and shift for himself—not to box or\r\nplay foot-ball. There is, of course, always the risk of thus mistaking\r\nmeans for ends. Fox-hunting is a first-class sport; but one of the\r\nmost absurd things in real life is to note the bated breath with which\r\ncertain excellent fox-hunters, otherwise of quite healthy minds, speak\r\nof this admirable but not over-important pastime. They tend to make\r\nit almost as much of a fetich as, in the last century, the French and\r\nGerman nobles made the chase of the stag, when they carried hunting\r\nand game-preserving to a point which was ruinous to the national\r\nlife. Fox-hunting is very good as a pastime, but it is about as poor\r\na business as can be followed by any man of intelligence. Certain\r\nwriters about it are fond of quoting the anecdote of a fox-hunter who,\r\nin the days of the English civil war, was discovered pursuing his\r\nfavorite sport just before a great battle between the Cavaliers and\r\nthe Puritans, and right between their lines as they came together.\r\nThese writers apparently consider it a merit in this man that when his\r\ncountry was in a death-grapple, instead of taking arms and hurrying to\r\nthe defence of the cause he believed right, he should placidly have\r\ngone about his usual sports. Of course, in reality the chief serious\r\nuse of fox-hunting is to encourage manliness and vigor, and to keep\r\nmen hardy, so that at need they can show themselves fit to take part\r\nin work or strife for their native land. When a man so far confuses\r\nends and means as to think that fox-hunting, or polo, or foot-ball,\r\nor whatever else the sport may be, is to be itself taken as the end,\r\ninstead of as the mere means of preparation to do work that counts when\r\nthe time arises, when the occasion calls—why, that man had better\r\nabandon sport altogether.\r\n\r\nNo boy can afford to neglect his work, and with a boy work, as a rule,\r\nmeans study. Of course there are occasionally brilliant successes in\r\nlife where the man has been worthless as a student when a boy. To\r\ntake these exceptions as examples would be as unsafe as it would be\r\nto advocate blindness because some blind men have won undying honor\r\nby triumphing over their physical infirmity and accomplishing great\r\nresults in the world. I am no advocate of senseless and excessive\r\ncramming in studies, but a boy should work, and should work hard,\r\nat his lessons—in the first place, for the sake of what he will\r\nlearn, and in the next place, for the sake of the effect upon his own\r\ncharacter of resolutely settling down to learn it. Shiftlessness,\r\nslackness, indifference in studying, are almost certain to mean\r\ninability to get on in other walks of life. Of course, as a boy grows\r\nolder it is a good thing if he can shape his studies in the direction\r\ntoward which he has a natural bent; but whether he can do this or\r\nnot, he must put his whole heart into them. I do not believe in\r\nmischief-doing in school hours, or in the kind of animal spirits that\r\nresults in making bad scholars; and I believe that those boys who take\r\npart in rough, hard play outside of school will not find any need for\r\nhorse-play in school. While they study they should study just as hard\r\nas they play foot-ball in a match game. It is wise to obey the homely\r\nold adage, “Work while you work; play while you play.”\r\n\r\nA boy needs both physical and moral courage. Neither can take the\r\nplace of the other. When boys become men they will find out that there\r\nare some soldiers very brave in the field who have proved timid and\r\nworthless as politicians, and some politicians who show an entire\r\nreadiness to take chances and assume responsibilities in civil affairs,\r\nbut who lack the fighting edge when opposed to physical danger. In\r\neach case, with the soldiers and politicians alike, there is but half\r\na virtue. The possession of the courage of the soldier does not excuse\r\nthe lack of courage in the statesman and even less does the possession\r\nof the courage of the statesman excuse shrinking on the field of\r\nbattle. Now, this is all just as true of boys. A coward who will take a\r\nblow without returning it is a contemptible creature; but, after all,\r\nhe is hardly as contemptible as the boy who dares not stand up for what\r\nhe deems right against the sneers of his companions who are themselves\r\nwrong. Ridicule is one of the favorite weapons of wickedness, and it is\r\nsometimes incomprehensible how good and brave boys will be influenced\r\nfor evil by the jeers of associates who have no one quality that calls\r\nfor respect, but who affect to laugh at the very traits which ought to\r\nbe peculiarly the cause for pride.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to be a prig. There is no need for a boy to preach\r\nabout his own good conduct and virtue. If he does he will make himself\r\noffensive and ridiculous. But there is urgent need that he should\r\npractice decency; that he should be clean and straight, honest and\r\ntruthful, gentle and tender, as well as brave. If he can once get to a\r\nproper understanding of things, he will have a far more hearty contempt\r\nfor the boy who has begun a course of feeble dissipation, or who is\r\nuntruthful, or mean, or dishonest, or cruel, than this boy and his\r\nfellows can possibly, in return, feel for him. The very fact that the\r\nboy should be manly and able to hold his own, that he should be ashamed\r\nto submit to bullying without instant retaliation, should, in return,\r\nmake him abhor any form of bullying, cruelty, or brutality.\r\n\r\nThere are two delightful books, Thomas Hughes’s “Tom Brown at Rugby,”\r\nand Aldrich’s “Story of a Bad Boy,” which I hope every boy still\r\nreads; and I think American boys will always feel more in sympathy\r\nwith Aldrich’s story, because there is in it none of the fagging, and\r\nthe bullying which goes with fagging, the account of which, and the\r\nacceptance of which, always puzzle an American admirer of Tom Brown.\r\n\r\nThere is the same contrast between two stories of Kipling’s. One,\r\ncalled “Captains Courageous,” describes in the liveliest way just what\r\na boy should be and do. The hero is painted in the beginning as the\r\nspoiled, over-indulged child of wealthy parents, of a type which we do\r\nsometimes unfortunately see, and than which there exist few things more\r\nobjectionable on the face of the broad earth. This boy is afterward\r\nthrown on his own resources, amid wholesome surroundings, and is forced\r\nto work hard among boys and men who are real boys and real men doing\r\nreal work. The effect is invaluable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if one wishes to find types of boys to be avoided\r\nwith utter dislike, one will find them in another story by Kipling,\r\ncalled “Stalky & Co.,” a story which ought never to have been written,\r\nfor there is hardly a single form of meanness which it does not seem to\r\nextol, or of school mismanagement which it does not seem to applaud.\r\nBullies do not make brave men; and boys or men of foul life can not\r\nbecome good citizens, good Americans, until they change; and even\r\nafter the change scars will be left on their souls.\r\n\r\nThe boy can best become a good man by being a good boy—not a\r\ngoody-goody boy, but just a plain good boy. I do not mean that he\r\nmust love only the negative virtues; I mean he must love the positive\r\nvirtues also. “Good,” in the largest sense, should include whatever is\r\nfine, straightforward, clean, brave, and manly. The best boys I know\r\n—the best men I know—are good at their studies or their business,\r\nfearless and stalwart, hated and feared by all that is wicked and\r\ndepraved, incapable of submitting to wrong-doing, and equally incapable\r\nof being aught but tender to the weak and helpless. A healthy-minded\r\nboy should feel hearty contempt for the coward, and even more hearty\r\nindignation for the boy who bullies girls or small boys, or tortures\r\nanimals. One prime reason for abhorring cowards is because every good\r\nboy should have it in him to thrash the objectionable boy as the need\r\narises.\r\n\r\nOf course the effect that a thoroughly manly, thoroughly straight and\r\nupright boy can have upon the companions of his own age, and upon those\r\nwho are younger, is incalculable. If he is not thoroughly manly, then\r\nthey will not respect him, and his good qualities will count for but\r\nlittle; while, of course, if he is mean, cruel, or wicked, then his\r\nphysical strength and force of mind merely make him so much the more\r\nobjectionable a member of society. He can not do good work if he is not\r\nstrong and does not try with his whole heart and soul to count in any\r\ncontest; and his strength will be a curse to himself and to every one\r\nelse if he does not have thorough command over himself and over his\r\nown evil passions, and if he does not use his strength on the side of\r\ndecency, justice, and fair dealing.\r\n\r\nIn short, in life, as in a foot-ball game, the principle to follow is:\r\n\r\nHit the line hard; don’t foul and don’t shirk, but hit the line hard!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY PREPAREDNESS AND UNPREPAREDNESS\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED IN THE “CENTURY,” NOVEMBER, 1899\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, M. Pierre Loti, member of\r\nthe French Academy and cultivated exponent of the hopes and beliefs of\r\nthe average citizen of Continental Europe in regard to the contest, was\r\nat Madrid. Dewey’s victory caused him grief; but he consoled himself,\r\nafter watching a parade of the Spanish troops, by remarking: “They are\r\nindeed still the solid and splendid Spanish troops, heroic in every\r\nepoch—it needs only to look at them to divine the woe that awaits the\r\nAmerican shopkeepers when brought face to face with such soldiers.”\r\nThe excellent M. Loti had already explained Manila by vague references\r\nto American bombs loaded with petroleum, and to a devilish mechanical\r\ningenuity wholly unaccompanied by either humanity or courage, and he\r\nstill allowed himself to dwell on the hope that there were reserved for\r\nAmerica _des surprises sanglantes_.\r\n\r\nM. Loti’s views on military matters need not detain us, for his\r\nattitude toward the war was merely the attitude of Continental Europe\r\ngenerally, in striking contrast to that of England. But it is a curious\r\nfact that his view reflects not unfairly two different opinions, which\r\ntwo different classes of our people would have expressed before the\r\nevent—opinions singularly falsified by the fact. Our pessimists feared\r\nthat we had lost courage and fighting capacity; some of our optimists\r\nasserted that we needed neither, in view of our marvelous wealth and\r\nextraordinary inventiveness and mechanical skill. The national trait of\r\n“smartness,” used in the Yankee sense of the word, has very good and\r\nvery bad sides. Among the latter is its tendency to create the belief\r\nthat we need not prepare for war, because somehow we shall be able\r\nto win by some novel patent device, some new trick or new invention\r\ndeveloped on the spur of the moment by the ingenuity of our people. In\r\nthis way it is hoped to provide a substitute for preparedness—that\r\nis, for years of patient and faithful attention to detail in advance.\r\nIt is even sometimes said that these mechanical devices will be of so\r\nterrible a character as to nullify the courage which has always in the\r\npast been the prime factor in winning battles.\r\n\r\nNow, as all sound military judges knew in advance must inevitably be\r\nthe case, the experience of the Spanish War completely falsified every\r\nprediction of this kind. We did not win through any special ingenuity.\r\nNot a device of any kind was improvised during or immediately before\r\nthe war which was of any practical service. The “bombs enveloped\r\nin petroleum” had no existence save in the brains of the Spaniards\r\nand their more credulous sympathizers. Our navy won because of its\r\npreparedness and because of the splendid seamanship and gunnery which\r\nhad been handed down as traditional in the service, and had been\r\nperfected by the most careful work. The army, at the only point where\r\nit was seriously opposed, did its work by sheer dogged courage and\r\nhard fighting, in spite of an unpreparedness which almost brought\r\ndisaster upon it, and would without doubt actually have done so had not\r\nthe defects and shortcomings of the Spanish administration been even\r\ngreater than our own.\r\n\r\nWe won the war in a very short time, and without having to expend\r\nmore than the merest fraction of our strength. The navy was shown to\r\nbe in good shape; and Secretary Root, to whom the wisdom of President\r\nMcKinley has intrusted the War Department, has already shown himself as\r\ngood a man as ever held the portfolio—a man whose administration is\r\ncertain to be of inestimable service to the army and to the country. In\r\nconsequence, too many of our people show signs of thinking that, after\r\nall, everything was all right, and is all right now; that we need not\r\nbother ourselves to learn any lessons that are not agreeable to us, and\r\nthat if in the future we get into a war with a more formidable power\r\nthan Spain, we shall pull through somehow. Such a view is unjust to the\r\nnation, and particularly unjust to the splendid men of the army and of\r\nthe navy, who would be sacrificed to it, should we ever engage in a\r\nserious war without having learned the lessons that the year 1898 ought\r\nto have taught.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to get an explanation of the efficiency of our navy in 1898,\r\nand of the astonishing ease with which its victories were won, we\r\nmust go a long way back of that year, and study not only its history,\r\nbut the history of the Spanish navy for many decades. Of course any\r\nsuch study must begin with a prompt admission of the splendid natural\r\nquality of our officers and men. On the bridge, in the gun-turrets, in\r\nthe engine-room, and behind the quick-firers, every one alike, from the\r\nhighest to the lowest, was eager for the war, and was in heart, mind,\r\nand body, of the very type which makes the best kind of fighting man.\r\nMany of the officers of our ships have mentioned to me that during the\r\nwar punishments almost ceased, because the men who got into scrapes in\r\ntimes of peace were so aroused and excited by the chance of battle that\r\ntheir behavior was perfect. We read now and then of foreign services\r\nwhere men hate their officers, have no community of interest with them,\r\nand no desire to fight for the flag. Most emphatically such is not the\r\ncase in our service. The discipline is just but not severe, unless\r\nseverity is imperatively called for. As a whole, the officers have the\r\nwelfare of the men very much at heart, and take care of their bodies\r\nwith the same forethought that they show in training them for battle.\r\nThe physique of the men is excellent, and to it are joined eagerness to\r\nlearn, and readiness to take risks and to stand danger unmoved.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, all this, though indispensable as a base, would mean\r\nnothing whatever for the efficiency of the navy without years of\r\ncareful preparation and training. A warship is such a complicated\r\nmachine, and such highly specialized training is self-evidently\r\nneeded to command it, that our naval commanders, unlike our military\r\ncommanders, are freed from having to combat the exasperating belief\r\nthat the average civilian could at short notice do their work. Of\r\ncourse, in reality a special order of ability and special training are\r\nneeded to enable a man to command troops successfully; but the need is\r\nnot so obvious as on shipboard. No civilian could be five minutes on a\r\nbattleship without realizing his unfitness to command it; but there are\r\nany number of civilians who firmly believe they can command regiments,\r\nwhen they have not a single trait, natural or acquired, that really\r\nfits them for the task. A blunder in the one case meets with instant,\r\nopen, and terrible punishment; in the other, it is at the moment only\r\na source of laughter or exasperation to the few, ominous though it may\r\nbe for the future. A colonel who issued the wrong order would cause\r\nconfusion. A ship-captain by such an order might wreck his ship. It\r\nfollows that the navy is comparatively free in time of war from the\r\npresence in the higher ranks of men utterly unfit to perform their\r\nduties. The nation realizes that it can not improvise naval officers\r\neven out of first-rate skippers of merchantmen and passenger-steamers.\r\nSuch men could be used to a certain extent as under-officers to meet a\r\nsudden and great emergency; but at best they would met it imperfectly,\r\nand this the public at large understands.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, some failure to understand that much the same\r\ncondition prevails among ordinary seamen. The public speakers and\r\nnewspaper writers who may be loudest in clamoring for war are often\r\nprecisely the men who clamor against preparations for war. Whether\r\nfrom sheer ignorance or from demagogy, they frequently assert that, as\r\nthis is the day of mechanics, even on the sea, and as we have a large\r\nmechanical population, we could at once fit out any number of vessels\r\nwith men who would from the first do their duty thoroughly and well.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, though the sea-mechanic has replaced the\r\nsailorman, yet it is almost as necessary as ever that a man should have\r\nthe sea habit in order to be of use aboard ship; and it is infinitely\r\nmore necessary than in former times that a man-of-war’s-man should have\r\nespecial training with his guns before he can use them aright. In the\r\nold days cannon were very simple; sighting was done roughly; and the\r\nordinary merchant seaman speedily grew fit to do his share of work on\r\na frigate. Nowadays men must be carefully trained for a considerable\r\nspace of time before they can be of any assistance whatever in handling\r\nand getting good results from the formidable engines of destruction on\r\nbattleship, cruiser, and torpedo-boat. Crews can not be improvised.\r\nTo get the very best work out of them, they should all be composed of\r\ntrained and seasoned men; and in any event they should not be sent\r\nagainst a formidable adversary unless each crew has for a nucleus a\r\nlarge body of such men filling all the important positions. From time\r\nimmemorial it has proved impossible to improvise so much as a makeshift\r\nnavy for use against a formidable naval opponent. Any such effort must\r\nmeet with disaster.\r\n\r\nMost fortunately, the United States had grown to realize this some\r\ntime before the Spanish War broke out. After the gigantic Civil War\r\nthe reaction from the strain of the contest was such that our navy\r\nwas permitted to go to pieces. Fifteen years after the close of the\r\ncontest in which Farragut took rank as one of the great admirals of\r\nall time, the splendid navy of which he was the chief ornament had\r\nbecome an object of derision, to every third-rate power in Europe and\r\nSouth America. The elderly monitors and wooden steamers, with their\r\nold-fashioned smooth-bore guns, would have been as incompetent to face\r\nthe modern ships of the period as the _Congress_ and the _Cumberland_\r\nwere to face the _Merrimac_. Our men were as brave as ever, but in war\r\ntheir courage would have been of no more avail than the splendid valor\r\nof the men who sank with their guns firing and flags flying when the\r\ngreat Confederate ironclad came out to Hampton Roads.\r\n\r\nAt last the nation awoke from its lethargy. In 1883, under the\r\nAdministration of President Arthur, when Secretary Chandler was in\r\nthe Navy Department, the work was begun. The first step taken was the\r\nrefusal to repair the more antiquated wooden ships, and the building\r\nof new steel ships to replace them. One of the ships thus laid down\r\nwas the _Boston_, which was in Dewey’s fleet. It is therefore merely\r\nthe literal truth to say that the preparations which made Dewey’s\r\nvictory possible began just fifteen years before the famous day when\r\nhe steamed into Manila Bay. Every Senator and Congressman who voted an\r\nappropriation which enabled Secretary Chandler to begin the upbuilding\r\nof the new navy, the President who advised the course, the Secretary\r\nwho had the direct management of it, the shipbuilder in whose yard the\r\nship was constructed, the skilled experts who planned her hull, engine,\r\nand guns, and the skilled workmen who worked out these plans, all alike\r\nare entitled to their share in the credit of the great Manila victory.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the men can never be known by name, but the fact that\r\nthey did well their part in the deed is of vastly more importance than\r\nthe obtaining of any reward for it, whether by way of recognition\r\nor otherwise; and this fact will always remain. Nevertheless, it is\r\nimportant for our own future that, so far as possible, we should\r\nrecognize the men who did well. This is peculiarly important in the\r\ncase of Congress, whose action has been the indispensable prerequisite\r\nfor every effort to build up the navy, as Congress provided the means\r\nfor each step.\r\n\r\nAs there was always a division in Congress, while in the popular mind\r\nthe whole body is apt to be held accountable for any deed, good or\r\nill, done by the majority, it is much to be wished, in the interest\r\nof justice, that some special historian of the navy would take out\r\nfrom the records the votes, and here and there the speeches, for\r\nand against the successive measures by which the navy was built up.\r\nEvery man who by vote and voice from time to time took part in adding\r\nto our fleet, in buying the armor, in preparing the gun-factories,\r\nin increasing the personnel and enabling it to practice, deserves\r\nwell of the whole nation, and a record of his action should be kept,\r\nthat his children may feel proud of him. No less clearly should we\r\nunderstand that throughout these fifteen years the men who, whether\r\nfrom honest but misguided motives, from short-sightedness, from lack\r\nof patriotism, or from demagogy, opposed the building up of the navy,\r\nhave deserved ill of the nation, exactly as did those men who recently\r\nprevented the purchase of armor for the battleships, or, under the\r\nlead of Senator Gorman, prevented the establishment of our army on the\r\nfooting necessary for our national needs. If disaster comes through\r\nlack of preparedness, the fault necessarily lies far less with the\r\nmen under whom the disaster actually occurs than with those to whose\r\nwrong-headedness or short-sighted indifference in time past the lack of\r\npreparedness is due.\r\n\r\nThe mistakes, the blunders, and the shortcomings in the army management\r\nduring the summer of 1898 should be credited mainly, not to any one in\r\noffice in 1898, but to the public servants of the people, and therefore\r\nto the people themselves, who permitted the army to rust since the\r\nCivil War with a wholly faulty administration, and with no chance\r\nwhatever to perfect itself by practice, as the navy was perfected. In\r\nlike manner, any trouble that may come upon the army, and therefore\r\nupon the nation, in the next few years, will be due to the failure to\r\nprovide for a thoroughly reorganized regular army of adequate size in\r\n1898; and for this failure the members in the Senate and the House who\r\ntook the lead against increasing the regular army, and reorganizing\r\nit, will be primarily responsible. On them will rest the blame of any\r\ncheck to the national arms, and the honor that will undoubtedly be won\r\nfor the flag by our army will have been won in spite of their sinister\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1898, when our battleships were lying off Havana and the\r\nSpanish torpedo-boat destroyers were crossing the ocean, our best\r\ncommanders felt justifiable anxiety because we had no destroyers to\r\nguard our fleet against the Spanish destroyers. Thanks to the blunders\r\nand lack of initiative of the Spaniards, they made no good use whatever\r\nof their formidable boats, sending them against our ships in daylight,\r\nwhen it was hopeless to expect anything from them.\r\n\r\nBut in war it is unsafe to trust to the blunders of the adversary to\r\noffset our own blunders. Many a naval officer, when with improvised\r\ncraft of small real worth he was trying to guard our battleships\r\nagainst the terrible possibilities of an attack by torpedo-boat\r\ndestroyers in the darkness, must have thought with bitterness how\r\na year before, when Senator Lodge and those who thought like him\r\nwere striving to secure an adequate support of large, high-class\r\ntorpedo-boats, the majority of the Senate followed the lead of\r\nSenator Gorman in opposition. So in the future, if what we all most\r\nearnestly hope will not happen does happen, and we are engaged in war\r\nwith some formidable sea power, any failure of our arms resulting\r\nfrom an inadequate number of battleships, or imperfectly prepared\r\nbattleships, will have to be credited to those members of Congress who\r\nopposed increasing the number of ships, or opposed giving them proper\r\narmament, for no matter what reason. On the other hand, the national\r\nconsciousness of capacity to vindicate national honor must be due\r\nmainly to the action of those Congressmen who have in fact built up our\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\nSecretary Chandler was succeeded by a line of men, each of whom,\r\nhowever he might differ from the others politically and personally,\r\nsincerely desired and strove hard for the upbuilding of the navy. Under\r\nMessrs. Whitney, Tracy, Herbert, and Long the work has gone steadily\r\nforward, thanks, of course, to the fact that successive Congresses,\r\nDemocratic and Republican alike, have permitted it to go forward.\r\n\r\nBut the appropriation of money and the building of ships were not\r\nenough. We must keep steadily in mind that not only was it necessary to\r\nbuild the navy, but it was equally necessary to train our officers and\r\nmen aboard it by actual practice. If in 1883 we had been able suddenly\r\nto purchase our present battleships, cruisers, and torpedo-boats,\r\nthey could not have been handled with any degree of efficiency by our\r\nofficers and crews as they then were. Still less would it be possible\r\nto handle them by improvised crews. In an emergency bodies of men like\r\nour naval militia can do special bits of work excellently, and, thanks\r\nto their high average of character and intellect, they are remarkably\r\ngood makeshifts, but it would be folly to expect from them all that is\r\nexpected from a veteran crew of trained man-of-war’s-men. And if we are\r\never pitted ship for ship on equal terms against the first-class navy\r\nof a first-class power, we shall need our best captains and our best\r\ncrews if we are to win.\r\n\r\nAs fast as the new navy was built we had to break in the men to\r\nhandle it. The young officers who first took hold and developed the\r\npossibilities of our torpedo-boats, for instance, really deserve as\r\nmuch credit as their successors have rightly received for handling\r\nthem with dash and skill during the war. The admirals who first\r\nexercised the new ships in squadrons were giving the training without\r\nwhich Dewey and Sampson would have found their tasks incomparably\r\nmore difficult. As for the ordinary officers and seamen, of course\r\nit was their incessant practice in handling the ships and the guns\r\nat sea, in all kinds of weather, both alone and in company, year in\r\nand year out, that made them able to keep up the never-relaxing night\r\nblockade at Santiago, to steam into Manila Bay in the darkness, to\r\nprevent breakdowns and make repairs of the machinery, and finally to\r\nhit what they aimed at when the battle was on. In the naval bureaus\r\nthe great bulk of what in the army would be called staff places are\r\nheld by line officers. The men who made ready the guns were the same\r\nmen who afterward used them. In the Engineering Bureau were the men\r\nwho had handled or were to handle the engines in action. The Bureau of\r\nNavigation, the Bureau of Equipment, the Bureau of Information, were\r\nheld by men who had commanded ships in actual service, or who were\r\nthus to command them against the Spaniards. The head of the Bureau of\r\nNavigation is the chief of staff, and he has always been an officer of\r\ndistinction, detailed, like all of the other bureau chiefs, for special\r\nservice. From the highest to the lowest officer, every naval man had\r\nseen and taken part, during time of peace, in the work which he would\r\nhave to do in time of war. The commodores and captains who took active\r\npart in the war had commanded fleets in sea service, or at the least\r\nhad been in command of single ships in these fleets. There was not one\r\nthing they were to do in war which they had not done in peace, save\r\nactually receive the enemy’s fire.\r\n\r\nContrast this with the army. The material in the army is exactly as\r\ngood as that in the navy, and in the lower ranks the excellence is as\r\ngreat. In no service, ashore or afloat, in the world could better men\r\nof their grade be found than the lieutenants, and indeed the captains,\r\nof the infantry and dismounted cavalry at Santiago. But in the army\r\nthe staff bureaus are permanent positions, instead of being held, as\r\nof course they should be, by officers detailed from the line, with the\r\nneeds of the line and experiences of actual service fresh in their\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nThe artillery had for thirty-five years had no field-practice that was\r\nin the slightest degree adequate to its needs, or that compared in any\r\nway with the practice received by the different companies and troops\r\nof the infantry and cavalry. The bureaus in Washington were absolutely\r\nenmeshed in red tape, and were held for the most part by elderly men,\r\nof fine records in the past, who were no longer fit to break through\r\nroutine and to show the extraordinary energy, business capacity,\r\ninitiative, and willingness to accept responsibility which were needed.\r\nFinally, the higher officers had been absolutely denied that chance to\r\npractice their profession to which the higher officers of the navy had\r\nlong been accustomed. Every time a warship goes to sea and cruises\r\naround the world, its captain has just such an experience as the\r\ncolonel of a regiment would have if sent off for a six or eight months’\r\nmarch, and if during those six or eight months he incessantly practiced\r\nhis regiment in every item of duty which it would have to perform in\r\nbattle. Every warship in the American navy, and not a single regiment\r\nin the American army, had had this experience.\r\n\r\nEvery naval captain had exercised command for long periods, under\r\nconditions which made up nine tenths of what he would have to encounter\r\nin war. Hardly a colonel had such an experience to his credit. The\r\nregiments were not even assembled, but were scattered by companies\r\nhere and there. After a man ceased being a junior captain he usually\r\nhad hardly any chance for field-service; it was the lieutenants and\r\njunior captains who did most of the field work in the West of recent\r\nyears. Of course there were exceptions; even at Santiago there were\r\ngenerals and colonels who showed themselves not only good fighters,\r\nbut masters of their profession; and in the Philippines the war has\r\ndeveloped admirable leaders, so that now we have ready the right man;\r\nbut the general rule remains true. The best man alive, if allowed to\r\nrust at a three-company post, or in a garrison near some big city, for\r\nten or fifteen years, will find himself in straits if suddenly called\r\nto command a division, or mayhap even an army-corps, on a foreign\r\nexpedition, especially when not one of his important subordinates has\r\never so much as seen five thousand troops gathered, fed, sheltered,\r\nmanœuvred, and shipped. The marvel is, not that there was blundering,\r\nbut that there was so little, in the late war with Spain.\r\n\r\nCaptain (now Colonel) John Bigelow, Jr., in his account of his personal\r\nexperiences in command of a troop of cavalry during the Santiago\r\ncampaign, has pictured the welter of confusion during that campaign,\r\nand the utter lack of organization, and of that skilled leadership\r\nwhich can come only through practice. His book should be studied by\r\nevery man who wishes to see our army made what it should be. In the\r\nSantiago campaign the army was more than once uncomfortably near grave\r\ndisaster, from which it was saved by the remarkable fighting qualities\r\nof its individual fractions, and, above all, by the incompetency of its\r\nfoes. To go against a well-organized, well-handled, well-led foreign\r\nfoe under such conditions would inevitably have meant failure and\r\nhumiliation. Of course party demagogues and the thoughtless generally\r\nare sure to credit these disasters to the people under whom they occur,\r\nto the Secretary, or to the commander of the army.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the blame must rest in all such cases far less\r\nwith them than with those responsible for the existence of the system.\r\nEven if we had the best Secretary of War the country could supply\r\nand the best general the army could furnish, it would be impossible\r\nfor them offhand to get good results if the nation, through its\r\nrepresentatives, had failed to make adequate provision for a proper\r\narmy, and to provide for the reorganization of the army and for its\r\npractice in time of peace. The whole staff system, and much else,\r\nshould be remodeled. Above all, the army should be practiced in mass\r\nin the actual work of marching and camping. Only thus will it be\r\npossible to train the commanders, the quartermasters, the commissaries,\r\nthe doctors, so that they may by actual experience learn to do their\r\nduties, as naval officers by actual experience have learned to do\r\ntheirs. Only thus can we do full justice to as splendid and gallant a\r\nbody of men as any nation ever had the good luck to include among its\r\narmed defenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRAL DEWEY\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED IN “McCLURE’S MAGAZINE,” OCTOBER, 1899\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey has done more than add a glorious page to our history;\r\nmore even than do a deed the memory of which will always be an\r\ninspiration to his countrymen, and especially his countrymen of his own\r\nprofession. He has also taught us a lesson which should have profound\r\npractical effects, if only we are willing to learn it aright.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he partly grasped and partly made his opportunity.\r\nOf course, in a certain sense, no man can absolutely make an\r\nopportunity. There were a number of admirals who, during the dozen\r\nyears preceding the Spanish War, were retired without the opportunity\r\nof ever coming where it was possible to distinguish themselves; and it\r\nmay be that some of these lacked nothing but the chance. Nevertheless,\r\nwhen the chance does come, only the great man can see it instantly\r\nand use it aright. In the second place, it must always be remembered\r\nthat the power of using the chance aright comes only to the man who\r\nhas faithfully and for long years made ready himself and his weapons\r\nfor the possible need. Finally, and most important of all, it should\r\never be kept in mind that the man who does a great work must almost\r\ninvariably owe the possibility of doing it to the faithful work of\r\nother men, either at the time or long before. Without his brilliancy\r\ntheir labor might be wasted, but without their labor his brilliancy\r\nwould be of no avail.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that it was a mere accident that Dewey happened to be\r\nin command of the Asiatic Squadron when the war with Spain broke out.\r\nThis is not the fact. He was sent to command it in the fall of 1897,\r\nbecause, to use the very language employed at the time, it was deemed\r\nwise to have there a man “who could go into Manila if necessary.” He\r\nowed the appointment to the high professional reputation he enjoyed,\r\nand to the character he had established for willingness to accept\r\nresponsibility, for sound judgment, and for entire fearlessness.\r\n\r\nProbably the best way (although no way is infallible) to tell the worth\r\nof a naval commander as yet untried in war is to get at the estimate\r\nin which he is held by the best fighting men who would have to serve\r\nunder him. In the summer of 1897 there were in Washington captains and\r\ncommanders who later won honor for themselves and their country in the\r\nwar with Spain, and who were already known for the dash and skill with\r\nwhich they handled their ships, the excellence of their gun practice,\r\nthe good discipline of their crews, and their eager desire to win\r\nhonorable renown. All these men were a unit in their faith in the then\r\nCommodore Dewey, in their desire to serve under him, should the chance\r\narise, and in their unquestioning belief that he was the man to meet an\r\nemergency in a way that would do credit to the flag.\r\n\r\nAn excellent test is afforded by the readiness which the man has shown\r\nto take responsibility in any emergency in the past. One factor in\r\nAdmiral Dewey’s appointment—of which he is very possibly ignorant—was\r\nthe way in which he had taken responsibility in purchasing coal for the\r\nsquadron that was to have been used against Chile, if war with Chile\r\nhad broken out, at the time General Harrison was President. A service\r\nwill do well or ill at the outbreak of war very much in proportion to\r\nthe way it has been prepared to meet the outbreak during the preceding\r\nmonths. Now, it is often impossible to say whether the symptoms that\r\nseem to forbode war will or will not be followed by war. At one time,\r\nunder President Harrison, we seemed as near war with Chile as ever we\r\nseemed to war with Spain under President McKinley. Therefore, when war\r\nthreatens, preparations must be made in any event; for the evil of\r\nwhat proves to be the needless expenditure of money in one instance\r\nis not to be weighed for a moment against the failure to prepare in\r\nthe other. But only a limited number of men have the moral courage to\r\nmake these preparations, because there is always risk to the individual\r\nmaking them. Laws and regulations must be stretched when an emergency\r\narises, and yet there is always some danger to the person who stretches\r\nthem; and, moreover, in time of sudden need, some indispensable article\r\ncan very possibly only be obtained at an altogether exorbitant price.\r\nIf war comes, and the article, whether it be a cargo of coal, or a\r\ncollier, or an auxiliary naval vessel, proves its usefulness, no\r\ncomplaint is ever made. But if the war does not come, then some small\r\ndemagogue, some cheap economist, or some undersized superior who is\r\nafraid of taking the responsibility himself, may blame the man who\r\nbought the article and say that he exceeded his authority; that he\r\nshowed more zeal than discretion in not waiting for a few days, etc.\r\nThese are the risks which must be taken, and the men who take them\r\nshould be singled out for reward and for duty. Admiral Dewey’s whole\r\naction in connection with the question of coal-supply for our fleet\r\nduring the Chilean scare marked him as one of these men.\r\n\r\nNo one who has not some knowledge of the army and navy will appreciate\r\nhow much this means. It is necessary to have a complete system of\r\nchecks upon the actions, and especially upon the expenditures, of\r\nthe army and navy; but the present system is at times altogether too\r\ncomplete, especially in war. The efficiency of the quartermasters\r\nand commissary officers of the army in the war with Spain was very\r\nseriously marred by their perfectly justifiable fear that the slightest\r\ndeparture from the requirements of the red-tape regulations of peace\r\nwould result in the docking of their own pay by men more concerned in\r\nenforcing the letter of the law than in seeing the army clothed and\r\nfed. In the navy, before the passage of the Personnel Bill, a positive\r\npremium was put on a man’s doing nothing but keep out of trouble; for\r\nif only he could avoid a court-martial, his promotions would take\r\ncare of themselves, so that from the selfish standpoint no possible\r\ngood could come to him from taking risks, while they might cause him\r\nvery great harm. The best officers in the service recognized the\r\nmenace that this state of affairs meant to the service, and strove to\r\ncounterbalance it in every way. No small part of the good done by the\r\nadmirable War College, under Captains Mahan, Taylor, and Goodrich, lay\r\nin their insistence upon the need of the naval officer’s instantly\r\naccepting responsibility in any crisis, and doing what was best for the\r\nflag, even though it was probable the action might be disavowed by his\r\nimmediate superiors, and though it might result in his own personal\r\ninconvenience and detriment. This was taught not merely as an abstract\r\ntheory, but with direct reference to concrete cases; for instance,\r\nwith reference to taking possession of Hawaii, if a revolution should\r\nby chance break out there during the presence of an American warship,\r\nor if the warship of a foreign power attempted to interfere with the\r\naffairs of the island.\r\n\r\nFor the work which Dewey had to do willingness to accept responsibility\r\nwas a prime requisite. A man afraid to vary in times of emergency from\r\nthe regulations laid down in time of peace would never even have got\r\nthe coal with which to steam to Manila from Hong Kong the instant the\r\ncrisis came. We were peculiarly fortunate in our Secretary of the Navy,\r\nMr. Long; but the best Secretary that ever held the navy portfolio\r\ncould not successfully direct operations on the other side of the\r\nworld. All that he could do was to choose a good man, give him the\r\nlargest possible liberty of action, and back him up in every way; and\r\nthis Secretary Long did. But if the man chosen had been timid about\r\ntaking risks, nothing that could be done for him would have availed.\r\nSuch a man would not have disobeyed orders. The danger would have been\r\nof precisely the contrary character. He would scrupulously have done\r\njust whatever he was told to do, and then would have sat down and\r\nwaited for further instructions, so as to protect himself if something\r\nhappened to go wrong. An infinity of excuses can always be found for\r\nnon-action.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey was sent to command the fleet on the Asiatic station\r\nprimarily because he had such a record in the past that the best\r\nofficers in the navy believed him to be peculiarly a man of the\r\nfighting temperament and fit to meet emergencies, and because he had\r\nshown his willingness to assume heavy responsibilities. How amply he\r\njustified his choice it is not necessary to say. On our roll of naval\r\nheroes his name will stand second to that of Farragut alone, and no\r\nman since the Civil War, whether soldier or civilian, has added so\r\nmuch to the honorable renown of the nation or has deserved so well of\r\nit. For our own sakes, and in particular for the sake of any naval\r\nofficer who in the future may be called upon to do such a piece of\r\nwork as Dewey did, let us keep in mind the further fact that he could\r\nnot have accomplished his feat if he had not had first-class vessels\r\nand excellently trained men; if his warships had not been so good, and\r\nhis captains and crews such thorough masters of their art. A man of\r\nless daring courage than Dewey would never have done what he did; but\r\nthe courage itself was not enough. The Spaniards, too, had courage.\r\nWhat they lacked was energy, training, forethought. They fought their\r\nvessels until they burned or sank; but their gunnery was so poor that\r\nthey did not kill a man in the American fleet. Even Dewey’s splendid\r\ncapacity would not have enabled him to win the battle of Manila Bay\r\nhad it not been for the traditional energy and seamanship of our\r\nnaval service, so well illustrated in his captains, and the excellent\r\ngun-practice of the crews, the result of years of steady training.\r\nFurthermore, even this excellence in the personnel would not have\r\navailed if under a succession of Secretaries of the Navy, and through\r\nthe wisdom of a succession of Congresses, the material of the navy had\r\nnot been built up as it actually was.\r\n\r\nIf war with Spain had broken out fifteen years before it did,—that\r\nis, in the year 1883, before our new navy was built,—it would have\r\nbeen physically impossible to get the results we actually did get. At\r\nthat time our navy consisted of a collection of rusty monitors and\r\nantiquated wooden ships left over from the Civil War, which could\r\nnot possibly have been matched against even the navy of Spain. Every\r\nproposal to increase the navy was then violently opposed with exactly\r\nthe same arguments used nowadays by the men who oppose building up our\r\narmy. The Congressmen who rallied to the support of Senator Gorman in\r\nhis refusal to furnish an adequate army to take care of the Philippines\r\nand meet the new national needs, or who defeated the proposition to\r\nbuy armor-plate for the new ships, assumed precisely the ground that\r\nwas taken by the men who, prior to 1883, had succeeded in preventing\r\nthe rebuilding of the navy. Both alike did all they could to prevent\r\nthe upholding of the national honor in times of emergency. There were\r\nthe usual arguments: that we were a great peaceful people, and would\r\nnever have to go to war; that if we had a navy or army we should\r\nbe tempted to use it and therefore embark in a career of military\r\nconquest; that there was no need of regulars anyhow, because we could\r\nalways raise volunteers to do anything; that war was a barbarous method\r\nof settling disputes, and too expensive to undertake even to avoid\r\nnational disgrace, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut fortunately the men of sturdy common sense and sound patriotism\r\nproved victors, and the new navy was begun. Its upbuilding was not a\r\nparty matter. The first ships were laid down under Secretary Chandler;\r\nSecretary Whitney continued the work; Secretary Tracy carried it still\r\nfurther; so did Secretary Herbert, and then Secretary Long. Congress\r\nafter Congress voted the necessary money. We have never had as many\r\nships as a nation of such size and such vast interests really needs;\r\nbut still by degrees we have acquired a small fleet of battleships,\r\ncruisers, gunboats, and torpedo-boats, all excellent of their class.\r\nThe squadron with which Dewey entered Manila Bay included ships laid\r\ndown or launched under Secretaries Chandler, Whitney, Tracy, and\r\nHerbert; and all four of these Secretaries, their naval architects,\r\nthe chiefs of bureaus, the young engineers and constructors, the\r\noutside contractors, the shipyard men like Roach, Cramp, and Scott,\r\nand, finally and emphatically, the Congressmen who during these fifteen\r\nyears voted the supplies, are entitled to take a just pride in their\r\nshare of the glory of the achievement. Every man in Congress whose\r\nvote made possible the building of the _Olympia_, the _Baltimore_,\r\nthe _Raleigh_, or the putting aboard them and their sister ships the\r\nmodern eight-inch or rapid-fire five-inch guns, or the giving them the\r\nbest engines and the means where with to practice their crews at the\r\ntargets—every such man has the right to tell his children that he did\r\nhis part in securing Dewey’s victory, and that, save for the action of\r\nhim and his fellows, it could not have been won. This is no less true\r\nof the man who planned the ships and of the other men, whether in the\r\ngovernment service or in private employment, who built them, from the\r\nhead of the great business concern which put up an armor-plate factory\r\ndown to the iron-worker who conscientiously and skilfully did his part\r\non gun-shield or gun.\r\n\r\nSo much for the men who furnished the material and the means for\r\nassembling and practicing the personnel. The same praise must be given\r\nthe men who actually drilled the personnel, part of which Dewey used.\r\nIf our ships had merely been built and then laid up, if officers and\r\ncrews had not been exercised season after season in all weathers on\r\nthe high seas in handling their ships both separately and in squadron,\r\nand in practicing with the guns, all the excellent material would\r\nhave availed us little. Exactly as it is of no use to give an army\r\nthe best arms and equipment if it is not also given the chance to\r\npractice with its arms and equipment, so the finest ships and the best\r\nnatural sailors and fighters are useless to a navy if the most ample\r\nopportunity for training is not allowed. Only incessant practice will\r\nmake a good gunner; though, inasmuch as there are natural marksmen as\r\nwell as men who never can become good marksmen, there should always be\r\nthe widest intelligence displayed in the choice of gunners. Not only is\r\nit impossible for a man to learn how to handle a ship or do his duty\r\naboard her save by long cruises at sea, but it is also impossible for a\r\ngood single-ship captain to be an efficient unit in a fleet unless he\r\nis accustomed to manœuvre as part of a fleet.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly true of the naval service that the excellence of any\r\nportion of it in a given crisis will depend mainly upon the excellence\r\nof the whole body, and so the triumph of any part is legitimately\r\nfelt to reflect honor upon the whole and to have been participated\r\nin by every one. Dewey’s captains could not have followed him with\r\nthe precision they displayed, could not have shown the excellent gun\r\npractice they did show—in short, the victory would not have been\r\npossible had it not been for the unwearied training and practice given\r\nthe navy during the dozen years previous by the admirals, the captains,\r\nand the crews who incessantly and in all weathers kept their vessels\r\nexercised, singly and in squadron, until the men on the bridge, the\r\nmen in the gun-turrets, and the men in the engine-rooms knew how to do\r\ntheir work perfectly, alone or together. Every officer and man, from\r\nthe highest to the lowest, who did his full duty in raising the navy to\r\nthe standard of efficiency it had reached on May 1, 1898, is entitled\r\nto feel some personal share in the glory won by Dewey and Dewey’s men.\r\nIt would have been absolutely impossible not merely to improvise either\r\nthe material or the personnel with which Dewey fought, but to have\r\nproduced them in any limited number of years. A thoroughly good navy\r\ntakes a long time to build up, and the best officer embodies always the\r\ntraditions of a first-class service. Ships take years to build, crews\r\ntake years before they become thoroughly expert, while the officers not\r\nonly have to pass their early youth in a course of special training,\r\nbut can not possibly rise to supreme excellence in their profession\r\nunless they make it their life-work.\r\n\r\nWe should therefore keep in mind that the hero can not win save for the\r\nforethought, energy, courage, and capacity of countless other men. Yet\r\nwe must keep in mind also that all this forethought, energy, courage,\r\nand capacity will be wasted unless at the supreme moment some man of\r\nthe heroic type arises capable of using to the best advantage the\r\npowers lying ready to hand. Whether it is Nelson, the greatest of all\r\nadmirals, at Aboukir, Copenhagen, or Trafalgar; or Farragut, second\r\nonly to Nelson, at New Orleans or Mobile; or Dewey at Manila—the great\r\noccasion must meet with the great man, or the result will be at worst a\r\nfailure, at best an indecisive success. The nation must make ready the\r\ntools and train the men to use them, but at the crisis a great triumph\r\ncan be achieved only should some heroic man appear. Therefore it is\r\nright and seemly to pay homage of deep respect and admiration to the\r\nman when he does appear.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey performed one of the great feats of all time. At the very\r\noutset of the Spanish War he struck one of the two decisive blows which\r\nbrought the war to a conclusion, and as his was the first fight, his\r\nsuccess exercised an incalculable effect upon the whole conflict. He\r\nset the note of the war. He had carefully prepared for action during\r\nthe months he was on the Asiatic coast. He had his plans thoroughly\r\nmatured, and he struck the instant that war was declared. There was no\r\ndelay, no hesitation. As soon as news came that he was to move, his\r\nwar-steamers turned their bows toward Manila Bay. There was nothing to\r\nshow whether or not Spanish mines and forts would be efficient; but\r\nDewey, cautious as he was at the right time, had not a particle of fear\r\nof taking risks when the need arose. In the tropic night he steamed\r\npast the forts, and then on over the mines to where the Spanish vessels\r\nlay. What material inferiority there was on the Spanish side was nearly\r\nmade up by the forts and mines. The overwhelming difference was moral,\r\nnot material. It was the difference in the two commanders, in the\r\nofficers and crews of the two fleets, and in the naval service, afloat\r\nand ashore, of the two nations. On the one side there had been thorough\r\npreparation; on the other, none that was adequate. It would be idle to\r\nrecapitulate the results. Steaming in with cool steadiness, Dewey’s\r\nfleet cut the Spaniards to pieces, while the Americans were practically\r\nunhurt. Then Dewey drew off to breakfast, satisfied himself that he had\r\nenough ammunition, and returned to stamp out what embers of resistance\r\nwere still feebly smouldering.\r\n\r\nThe victory ensured the fall of the Philippines, for Manila surrendered\r\nas soon as our land forces arrived and were in position to press their\r\nattack home. The work, however, was by no means done, and Dewey’s\r\ndiplomacy and firmness were given full scope for the year he remained\r\nin Manila waters, not only in dealing with Spaniards and insurgents,\r\nbut in making it evident that we would tolerate no interference from\r\nany hostile European power. It is not yet the time to show how much he\r\ndid in this last respect. Suffice it to say that by his firmness he\r\neffectually frustrated any attempt to interfere with our rights, while\r\nby his tact he avoided giving needless offence, and he acted in hearty\r\naccord with our cordial well-wishers, the English naval and diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives in the islands.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey comes back to his native land having won the right to a\r\ngreeting such as has been given to no other man since the Civil War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT\r\n\r\nSPEECH DELIVERED AT GALENA, ILLINOIS, APRIL 27, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the long run every great nation instinctively recognizes the men\r\nwho peculiarly and pre-eminently represent its own type of greatness.\r\nHere in our country we have had many public men of high rank—soldiers,\r\norators, constructive statesmen, and popular leaders. We have even had\r\ngreat philosophers who were also leaders of popular thought. Each one\r\nof these men has had his own group of devoted followers, and some of\r\nthem have at times swayed the nation with a power such as the foremost\r\nof all hardly wielded. Yet as the generations slip away, as the dust\r\nof conflict settles, and as through the clearing air we look back with\r\nkeener wisdom into the nation’s past, mightiest among the mighty dead\r\nloom the three great figures of Washington, Lincoln, and Grant. There\r\nare great men also in the second rank; for in any gallery of merely\r\nnational heroes Franklin and Hamilton, Jefferson and Jackson, would\r\nsurely have their place. But these three greatest men have taken their\r\nplace among the great men of all nations, the great men of all time.\r\nThey stood supreme in the two great crises of our history, on the two\r\ngreat occasions when we stood in the van of all humanity and struck\r\nthe most effective blows that have ever been struck for the cause of\r\nhuman freedom under the law, for that spirit of orderly liberty which\r\nmust stand at the base of every wise movement to secure to each man his\r\nrights, and to guard each from being wronged by his fellows.\r\n\r\nWashington fought in the earlier struggle, and it was his good fortune\r\nto win the highest renown alike as soldier and statesman. In the second\r\nand even greater struggle the deeds of Lincoln the statesman were made\r\ngood by those of Grant the soldier, and later Grant himself took up the\r\nwork that dropped from Lincoln’s tired hands when the assassin’s bullet\r\nwent home, and the sad, patient, kindly eyes were closed forever.\r\n\r\nIt was no mere accident that made our three mightiest men, two of them\r\nsoldiers, and one the great war President. It is only through work and\r\nstrife that either nation or individual moves on to greatness. The\r\ngreat man is always the man of mighty effort, and usually the man whom\r\ngrinding need has trained to mighty effort. Rest and peace are good\r\nthings, are great blessings, but only if they come honorably; and it\r\nis those who fearlessly turn away from them, when they have not been\r\nearned, who in the long run deserve best of their country. In the\r\nsweat of our brows do we eat bread, and though the sweat is bitter at\r\ntimes, yet it is far more bitter to eat the bread that is unearned,\r\nunwon, undeserved. America must nerve herself for labor and peril. The\r\nmen who have made our national greatness are those who faced danger and\r\novercame it, who met difficulties and surmounted them, not those whose\r\nlines were cast in such pleasant places that toil and dread were ever\r\nfar from them.\r\n\r\nNeither was it an accident that our three leaders were men who, while\r\nthey did not shrink from war, were nevertheless heartily men of peace.\r\nThe man who will not fight to avert or undo wrong is but a poor\r\ncreature; but, after all, he is less dangerous than the man who fights\r\non the side of wrong. Again and again in a nation’s history the time\r\nmay, and indeed sometimes must, come when the nation’s highest duty is\r\nwar. But peace must be the normal condition, or the nation will come\r\nto a bloody doom. Twice in great crises, in 1776 and 1861, and twice\r\nin lesser crises, in 1812 and 1898, the nation was called to arms in\r\nthe name of all that makes the words “honor,” “freedom,” and “justice”\r\nother than empty sounds. On each occasion the net result of the war\r\nwas greatly for the benefit of mankind. But on each occasion this net\r\nresult was of benefit only because after the war came peace, came\r\njustice and order and liberty. If the Revolution had been followed\r\nby bloody anarchy, if the Declaration of Independence had not been\r\nsupplemented by the adoption of the Constitution, if the freedom won\r\nby the sword of Washington had not been supplemented by the stable and\r\norderly government which Washington was instrumental in founding, then\r\nwe should have but added to the chaos of the world, and our victories\r\nwould have told against and not for the betterment of mankind. So it\r\nwas with the Civil War. If the four iron years had not been followed by\r\npeace, they would not have been justified. If the great silent soldier,\r\nthe Hammer of the North, had struck the shackles off the slave only,\r\nas so many conquerors in civil strife before him had done, to rivet\r\nthem around the wrists of freemen, then the war would have been fought\r\nin vain, and worse than in vain. If the Union, which so many men shed\r\ntheir blood to restore, were not now a union in fact, then the precious\r\nblood would have been wasted. But it was not wasted; for the work of\r\npeace has made good the work of war, and North and South, East and\r\nWest, we are now one people in fact as well as in name; one in purpose,\r\nin fellow-feeling, and in high resolve, as we stand to greet the new\r\ncentury, and, high of heart, to face the mighty tasks which the coming\r\nyears will surely bring.\r\n\r\nGrant and his fellow-soldiers who fought through the war, and his\r\nfellow-statesmen who completed the work partly done by the soldiers,\r\nnot only left us the heritage of a reunited country and of a land\r\nfrom which slavery had been banished, but left us what was quite as\r\nimportant, the great memory of their great deeds, to serve forever\r\nas an example and an inspiration, to spur us on so that we may not\r\nfall below the level reached by our fathers. The rough, strong poet\r\nof democracy has sung of Grant as “the man of mighty days, and equal\r\nto the days.” The days are less mighty now, and that is all the more\r\nreason why we should show ourselves equal to them. We meet here to pay\r\nglad homage to the memory of our illustrious dead; but let us keep ever\r\nclear before our minds the fact that mere lip-loyalty is no loyalty at\r\nall, and that the only homage that counts is the homage of deeds, not\r\nof words. It is but an idle waste of time to celebrate the memory of\r\nthe dead unless we, the living, in our lives strive to show ourselves\r\nnot unworthy of them. If the careers of Washington and Grant are not\r\nvital and full of meaning to us, if they are merely part of the storied\r\npast, and stir us to no eager emulation in the ceaseless, endless war\r\nfor right against wrong, then the root of right thinking is not in us;\r\nand where we do not think right we can not act right.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose in this address to sketch, in even the briefest\r\nmanner, the life and deeds of Grant. It is not even my purpose to\r\ntouch on the points where his influence has told so tremendously in\r\nthe making of our history. It is part of the man’s greatness that now\r\nwe can use his career purely for illustration. We can take for granted\r\nthe fact that each American who knows the history of the country must\r\nknow the history of this man, at least in its broad outline; and that\r\nwe no more need to explain Vicksburg and Appomattox than we need to\r\nexplain Yorktown. I shall ask attention, not to Grant’s life, but to\r\nthe lessons taught by that life as we of to-day should learn them.\r\n\r\nForemost of all is the lesson of tenacity, of stubborn fixity of\r\npurpose. In the Union armies there were generals as brilliant as\r\nGrant, but none with his iron determination. This quality he showed\r\nas President no less than as general. He was no more to be influenced\r\nby a hostile majority in Congress into abandoning his attitude in\r\nfavor of a sound and stable currency than he was to be influenced by\r\ncheck or repulse into releasing his grip on beleaguered Richmond. It\r\nis this element of unshakable strength to which we are apt specially\r\nto refer when we praise a man in the simplest and most effective\r\nway, by praising him as a man. It is the one quality which we can\r\nleast afford to lose. It is the only quality the lack of which is\r\nas unpardonable in the nation as in the man. It is the antithesis\r\nof levity, fickleness, volatility, of undue exaltation, of undue\r\ndepression, of hysteria and neuroticism in all their myriad forms. The\r\nlesson of unyielding, unflinching, unfaltering perseverance in the\r\ncourse upon which the nation has entered is one very necessary for a\r\ngeneration whose preachers sometimes dwell overmuch on the policies\r\nof the moment. There are not a few public men, not a few men who try\r\nto mold opinion within Congress and without, on the stump and in the\r\ndaily press, who seem to aim at instability, who pander to and thereby\r\nincrease the thirst for overstatement of each situation as it arises,\r\nwhose effort is, accordingly, to make the people move in zigzags\r\ninstead of in a straight line. We all saw this in the Spanish War,\r\nwhen the very men who at one time branded as traitors everybody who\r\nsaid there was anything wrong in the army at another time branded as\r\ntraitors everybody who said there was anything right. Of course such an\r\nattitude is as unhealthy on one side as on the other, and it is equally\r\ndestructive of any effort to do away with abuse.\r\n\r\nHysterics of this kind may have all the results of extreme timidity.\r\nA nation that has not the power of endurance, the power of dogged\r\ninsistence on a determined policy, come weal or woe, has lost one chief\r\nelement of greatness. The people who wish to abandon the Philippines\r\nbecause we have had heavy skirmishing out there, or who think that\r\nour rule is a failure whenever they discover some sporadic upgrowth of\r\nevil, would do well to remember the two long years of disaster this\r\nnation suffered before the July morning when the news was flashed to\r\nthe waiting millions that Vicksburg had fallen in the West and that in\r\nthe East the splendid soldiery of Lee had recoiled at last from the\r\nlow hills of Gettysburg. Even after this nearly two years more were\r\nto pass before the end came at Appomattox. Throughout this time the\r\ncry of prophets of disaster never ceased. The peace-at-any-price men\r\nnever wearied of declaiming against the war, of describing the evils\r\nof conquest and subjugation as worse than any possible benefits that\r\ncould result therefrom. The hysterical minority, passed alternately\r\nfrom unreasoning confidence to unreasoning despair; and at times they\r\neven infected for the moment many of their sober, steady countrymen.\r\nEighteen months after the war began the State and Congressional\r\nelections went heavily against the war party, and two years later the\r\nopposition party actually waged the Presidential campaign on the issue\r\nthat the war was a failure. Meanwhile there was plenty of blundering\r\nat the front, plenty of mistakes at Washington. The country was saved\r\nby the fact that our people, as a whole, were steadfast and unshaken.\r\nBoth at Washington and at the front the leaders were men of undaunted\r\nresolution, who would not abandon the policy to which the nation was\r\ndefinitely committed, who regarded disaster as merely a spur to fresh\r\neffort, who saw in each blunder merely something to be retrieved, and\r\nnot a reason for abandoning the long-determined course. Above all,\r\nthe great mass of the people possessed a tough and stubborn fibre of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThere was then, as always, ample room for criticism, and there was\r\nevery reason why the mistakes should be corrected. But in the long\r\nrun our gratitude was due primarily, not to the critics, not to the\r\nfault-finders, but to the men who actually did the work; not to the\r\nmen of negative policy, but to those who struggled toward the given\r\ngoal. Merciful oblivion has swallowed up the names of those who railed\r\nat the men who were saving the Union, while it has given us the memory\r\nof these same men as a heritage of honor forever; and brightest among\r\ntheir names flame those of Lincoln and Grant, the steadfast, the\r\nunswerving, the enduring, the finally triumphant.\r\n\r\nGrant’s supreme virtue as a soldier was his doggedness, the quality\r\nwhich found expression in his famous phrases of “unconditional\r\nsurrender” and “fighting it out on this line if it takes all summer.”\r\nHe was a master of strategy and tactics, but he was also a master\r\nof hard hitting, of that “continuous hammering” which finally broke\r\nthrough even Lee’s guard. While an armed foe was in the field, it\r\nnever occurred to Grant that any question could be so important as his\r\noverthrow. He felt nothing but impatient contempt for the weak souls\r\nwho wished to hold parley with the enemy while that enemy was still\r\ncapable of resistance.\r\n\r\nThere is a fine lesson in this to the people who have been asking us\r\nto invite the certain destruction of our power in the Philippines, and\r\ntherefore the certain destruction of the islands themselves, by putting\r\nany concession on our part ahead of the duty of reducing the islands\r\nto quiet at all costs and of stamping out the last embers of armed\r\nresistance. At the time of the Civil War the only way to secure peace\r\nwas to fight for it, and it would have been a crime against humanity to\r\nhave stopped fighting before peace was conquered. So in the far less\r\nimportant, but still very important, crisis which confronts us to-day,\r\nit would be a crime against humanity if, whether from weakness or from\r\nmistaken sentimentalism, we failed to perceive that in the Philippines\r\nthe all-important duty is to restore order; because peace, and the\r\ngradually increasing measure of self-government for the islands which\r\nwill follow peace, can only come when armed resistance has completely\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nGrant was no brawler, no lover of fighting for fighting’s sake. He\r\nwas a plain, quiet man, not seeking for glory; but a man who, when\r\naroused, was always in deadly earnest, and who never shrank from duty.\r\nHe was slow to strike, but he never struck softly. He was not in the\r\nleast of the type which gets up mass-meetings, makes inflammatory\r\nspeeches or passes inflammatory resolutions, and then permits\r\nover-forcible talk to be followed by over-feeble action. His promise\r\nsquared with his performance. His deeds made good his words. He did\r\nnot denounce an evil in strained and hyperbolic language; but when he\r\ndid denounce it, he strove to make his denunciation effective by his\r\naction. He did not plunge lightly into war, but once in, he saw the\r\nwar through, and when it was over, it was over entirely. Unsparing\r\nin battle, he was very merciful in victory. There was no let-up in\r\nhis grim attack, his grim pursuit, until the last body of armed foes\r\nsurrendered. But that feat once accomplished, his first thought was\r\nfor the valiant defeated; to let them take back their horses to their\r\nlittle homes because they would need them to work on their farms.\r\nGrant, the champion whose sword was sharpest in the great fight for\r\nliberty, was no less sternly insistent upon the need of order and of\r\nobedience to law. No stouter foe of anarchy in every form ever lived\r\nwithin our borders. The man who more than any other, save Lincoln, had\r\nchanged us into a nation whose citizens were all freemen, realized\r\nentirely that these freemen would remain free only while they kept\r\nmastery over their own evil passions. He saw that lawlessness in all\r\nits forms was the handmaiden of tyranny. No nation ever yet retained\r\nits freedom for any length of time after losing its respect for the\r\nlaw, after losing the law-abiding spirit, the spirit that really makes\r\norderly liberty.\r\n\r\nGrant, in short, stood for the great elementary virtues, for justice,\r\nfor freedom, for order, for unyielding resolution, for manliness\r\nin its broadest and highest sense. His greatness was not so much\r\ngreatness of intellect as greatness of character, including in the\r\nword “character” all the strong, virile virtues. It is character that\r\ncounts in a nation as in a man. It is a good thing to have a keen, fine\r\nintellectual development in a nation, to produce orators, artists,\r\nsuccessful business men; but it is an infinitely greater thing to\r\nhave those solid qualities which we group together under the name of\r\ncharacter—sobriety, steadfastness, the sense of obligation toward\r\none’s neighbor and one’s God, hard common-sense, and, combined with it,\r\nthe lift of generous enthusiasm toward whatever is right. These are the\r\nqualities which go to make up true national greatness, and these were\r\nthe qualities which Grant possessed in an eminent degree.\r\n\r\nWe have come here, then, to realize what the mighty dead did for the\r\nnation, what the dead did for us who are now living. Let us in return\r\ntry to shape our deeds so that the America of the future shall justify\r\nby her career the lives of the great men of her past. Every man who\r\ndoes his duty as a soldier, as a statesman, or as a private citizen\r\nis paying to Grant’s memory the kind of homage that is best worth\r\npaying. We have difficulties and dangers enough in the present, and it\r\nis the way we face them which it to determine whether or not we are\r\nfit descendants of the men of the mighty past. We must not flinch from\r\nour duties abroad merely because we have even more important duties\r\nat home. That these home duties are the most important of all every\r\nthinking man will freely acknowledge. We must do our duty to ourselves\r\nand our brethren in the complex social life of the time. We must\r\npossess the spirit of broad humanity, deep charity, and loving-kindness\r\nfor our fellowmen, and must remember, at the same time, that this\r\nspirit is really the absolute antithesis of mere sentimentalism, of\r\nsoup-kitchen, pauperizing philanthropy, and of legislation which is\r\ninspired either by foolish mock benevolence or by class greed or class\r\nhate. We need to be possessed of the spirit of justice and of the\r\nspirit which recognizes in work and not ease the proper end of effort.\r\n\r\nOf course the all-important thing to keep in mind is that if we\r\nhave not both strength and virtue we shall fail. Indeed, in the old\r\nacceptation of the word, virtue included strength and courage, for the\r\nclear-sighted men at the dawn of our era knew that the passive virtues\r\ncould not by themselves avail, that wisdom without courage would sink\r\ninto mere cunning, and courage without morality into ruthless, lawless,\r\nself-destructive ferocity. The iron Roman made himself lord of the\r\nworld because to the courage of the barbarian he opposed a courage as\r\nfierce and an infinitely keener mind; while his civilized rivals, the\r\nkeen-witted Greek and Carthaginian, though of even finer intellect,\r\nhad let corruption eat into their brilliant civilizations until their\r\nstrength had been corroded as if by acid. In short, the Roman had\r\ncharacter as well as masterful genius, and when pitted against peoples\r\neither of less genius or of less character, these peoples went down.\r\n\r\nAs the ages roll by, the eternal problem forever fronting each man\r\nand each race forever shifts its outward shape, and yet at the bottom\r\nit is always the same. There are dangers of peace and dangers of war;\r\ndangers of excess in militarism and of excess by the avoidance of duty\r\nthat implies militarism; dangers of slow dry-rot, and dangers which\r\nbecome acute only in great crises. When these crises come, the nation\r\nwill triumph or sink accordingly as it produces or fails to produce\r\nstatesmen like Lincoln and soldiers like Grant, and accordingly as\r\nit does or does not back them in their efforts. We do not need men of\r\nunsteady brilliancy or erratic power—unbalanced men. The men we need\r\nare the men of strong, earnest, solid character—the men who possess\r\nthe homely virtues, and who to these virtues add rugged courage,\r\nrugged honesty, and high resolve. Grant, with his self-poise, his\r\nself-command, his self-mastery; Grant, who loved peace and did not\r\nfear war, who would not draw the sword if he could honorably keep it\r\nsheathed, but who, when once he had drawn it, would not return it to\r\nthe sheath until the weary years had brought the blood-won victory;\r\nGrant, who had no thought after the fight was won save of leading the\r\nlife led by other Americans, and who aspired to the Presidency only as\r\nZachary Taylor or Andrew Jackson had aspired to it—Grant was of a type\r\nupon which the men of to-day can well afford to model themselves. As I\r\nhave already said, our first duty, our most important work, is setting\r\nour own house in order. We must be true to ourselves, or else, in the\r\nlong run, we shall be false to all others. The Republic can not stand\r\nif honesty and decency do not prevail alike in public and private life;\r\nif we do not set ourselves seriously at work to solve the tremendous\r\nsocial problems forced upon us by the far-sweeping industrial changes\r\nof the last two generations.\r\n\r\nBut in considering the life of Grant it is peculiarly appropriate to\r\nremember that, besides the regeneration in political and social life\r\nwithin our own borders, we must also face what has come upon us from\r\nwithout. No friendliness with other nations, no good will for them or\r\nby them, can take the place of national self-reliance. No alliance, no\r\ninoffensive conduct on our part, would supply, in time of need, the\r\nfailure in ability to hold our own with the strong hand. We must work\r\nout our own destiny by our own strength. A vigorous young nation like\r\nours does not always stand still. Now and then there comes a time when\r\nit is sure either to shrink or to expand. Grant saw to it that we did\r\nnot shrink, and therefore we had to expand when the inevitable moment\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nGreat duties face us in the islands where the Stars and Stripes now\r\nfloat in place of the arrogant flag of Spain. As we perform those\r\nduties well or ill, so will we, in large part, determine our right to\r\na place among the great nations of the earth. We have got to meet them\r\nin the very spirit of Grant. If we are frightened at the task, above\r\nall, if we are cowed or disheartened by any check, or by the clamor of\r\nthe sensation-monger, we shall show ourselves weaklings unfit to invoke\r\nthe memories of the stalwart men who fought to a finish the great\r\nCivil War. If we do not rule wisely, and if our rule is not in the\r\ninterest of the peoples who have come under our guardianship, then we\r\nhad best never to have begun the effort at all. As a nation we shall\r\nhave to choose our representatives in these islands as carefully as\r\nGrant chose the generals who were to serve at the vital points under\r\nhim. Fortunately, so far the choice has been most wise. No nation has\r\never sent a better man than we sent to Cuba when President McKinley\r\nappointed as governor-general of that island Leonard Wood; and now, in\r\nsending Judge Taft at the head of the Commission to the Philippines,\r\nthe President has again chosen the very best man to be found in all the\r\nUnited States for the purpose in view.\r\n\r\nPart of Grant’s great strength lay in the fact that he faced facts as\r\nthey were, and not as he wished they might be. He was not originally\r\nan abolitionist, and he probably could not originally have defined his\r\nviews as to State sovereignty; but when the Civil War was on, he saw\r\nthat the only thing to do was to fight it to a finish and establish by\r\nforce of arms the Constitutional right to put down rebellion. It is\r\njust the same thing nowadays with expansion. It has come, and it has\r\ncome to stay, whether we wish it or not. Certain duties have fallen to\r\nus as a legacy of the war with Spain, and we can not avoid performing\r\nthem. All we can decide is whether we will perform them well or ill. We\r\ncan not leave the Philippines. We have got to stay there, establish\r\norder, and then give the inhabitants as much self-government as they\r\nshow they can use to advantage. We can not run away if we would. We\r\nhave got to see the work through, because we are not a nation of\r\nweaklings. We are strong men, and we intend to do our duty.\r\n\r\nTo do our duty—that is the sum and substance of the whole matter.\r\nWe are not trying to win glory. We are not trying to do anything\r\nespecially brilliant or unusual. We are setting ourselves vigorously at\r\neach task as the task arises, and we are trying to face each difficulty\r\nas Grant faced innumerable and infinitely greater difficulties. The\r\nsure way to succeed is to set about our work in the spirit that\r\nmarked the great soldier whose life we this day celebrate: the spirit\r\nof devotion to duty, of determination to deal fairly, justly, and\r\nfearlessly with all men, and of iron resolution never to abandon\r\nany task once begun until it has been brought to a successful and\r\ntriumphant conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO AMERICAS\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT THE FORMAL OPENING OF THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION, BUFFALO,\r\nMAY 20, 1901\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-day we formally open this great exposition by the shores of the\r\nmighty inland seas of the North, where all the peoples of the Western\r\nHemisphere have joined to show what they have done in art, science, and\r\nindustrial invention, what they have been able to accomplish with their\r\nmanifold resources and their infinitely varied individual and national\r\nqualities. Such an exposition, held at the opening of this new century,\r\ninevitably suggests two trains of thought. It should make us think\r\nseriously and solemnly of our several duties to one another as citizens\r\nof the different nations of this Western Hemisphere, and also of our\r\nduties each to the nation to which he personally belongs.\r\n\r\nThe century upon which we have just entered must inevitably be one of\r\ntremendous triumph or of tremendous failure for the whole human race,\r\nbecause, to an infinitely greater extent than ever before, humanity is\r\nknit together in all its parts, for weal or woe. All about us there are\r\ninnumerable tendencies that tell for good, and innumerable tendencies\r\nthat tell for evil. It is, of course, a mere truism to say that our\r\nown acts must determine which set of tendencies shall overcome the\r\nother. In order to act wisely we must first see clearly. There is no\r\nplace among us for the mere pessimist; no man who looks at life with\r\na vision that sees all things black or gray can do aught healthful in\r\nmolding the destiny of a mighty and vigorous people. But there is just\r\nas little use for the foolish optimist who refuses to face the many and\r\nreal evils that exist, and who fails to see that the only way to ensure\r\nthe triumph of righteousness in the future is to war against all that\r\nis base, weak, and unlovely in the present.\r\n\r\nThere are certain things so obvious as to seem commonplace, which,\r\nnevertheless, must be kept constantly before us if we are to preserve\r\nour just sense of proportion. This twentieth century is big with\r\nthe fate of the nations of mankind, because the fate of each is now\r\ninterwoven with the fate of all to a degree never even approached in\r\nany previous stage of history. No better proof could be given than by\r\nthis very exposition. A century ago no such exposition could have even\r\nbeen thought of. The larger part of the territory represented here\r\nto-day by so many free nations was not even mapped, and very much of it\r\nwas unknown to the hardiest explorer. The influence of America upon Old\r\nWorld affairs was imponderable. World politics still meant European\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nAll that is now changed, not merely by what has happened here in\r\nAmerica, but by what has happened elsewhere. It is not necessary for\r\nus here to consider the giant changes which have come elsewhere in\r\nthe globe; to treat of the rise in the South Seas of the great free\r\ncommonwealths of Australia and New Zealand; of the way in which Japan\r\nhas been rejuvenated and has advanced by leaps and bounds to a position\r\namong the leading civilized powers; of the problems, affecting the\r\nmajor portion of mankind, which call imperiously for solution in parts\r\nof the Old World which, a century ago, were barely known to Europe,\r\neven by rumor. Our present concern is not with the Old World, but with\r\nour own Western Hemisphere, America. We meet to-day, representing the\r\npeople of this continent, from the Dominion of Canada in the north, to\r\nChile and the Argentine in the south; representing peoples who have\r\ntraveled far and fast in the last century, because in them has been\r\npractically shown that it is the spirit of adventure which is the maker\r\nof commonwealths; peoples who are learning and striving to put in\r\npractice the vital truth that freedom is the necessary first step, but\r\nonly the first step, in successful free government.\r\n\r\nDuring the last century we have on the whole made long strides in\r\nthe right direction, but we have very much yet to learn. We all look\r\nforward to the day when there shall be a nearer approximation than\r\nthere has ever yet been to the brotherhood of man and the peace of the\r\nworld. More and more we are learning that to love one’s country above\r\nall others is in no way incompatible with respecting and wishing well\r\nto all others, and that, as between man and man, so between nation\r\nand nation, there should live the great law of right. These are the\r\ngoals toward which we strive; and let us at least earnestly endeavor\r\nto realize them here on this continent. From Hudson Bay to the Straits\r\nof Magellan, we, the men of the two Americas, have been conquering the\r\nwilderness, carving it into state and province, and seeking to build\r\nup in state and province governments which shall combine industrial\r\nprosperity and moral well-being. Let us ever most vividly remember the\r\nfalsity of the belief that any one of us is to be permanently benefited\r\nby the hurt of another. Let us strive to have our public men treat as\r\naxiomatic the truth that it is for the interest of every commonwealth\r\nin the Western Hemisphere to see every other commonwealth grow in\r\nriches and in happiness, in material wealth and in the sober, strong,\r\nself-respecting manliness, without which material wealth avails so\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nTo-day on behalf of the United States I welcome you here—you, our\r\nbrothers of the North and you, our brothers of the South; we wish you\r\nwell; we wish you all prosperity; and we say to you that we earnestly\r\nhope for your well-being, not only for your own sakes, but also for our\r\nown, for it is a benefit to each of us to have the others do well. The\r\nrelations between us now are those of cordial friendship, and it is\r\nto the interest of all alike that this friendship should ever remain\r\nunbroken. Nor is there the least chance of its being broken, provided\r\nonly that all of us alike act with full recognition of the vital need\r\nthat each should realize that his own interests can best be served by\r\nserving the interests of others.\r\n\r\nYou, men of Canada, are doing substantially the same work that we of\r\nthis Republic are doing, and face substantially the same problems that\r\nwe also face. Yours is the world of the merchant, the manufacturer and\r\nmechanic, the farmer, the ranchman, and the miner; you are subduing the\r\nprairie and the forest, tilling farm-land, building cities, striving\r\nto raise ever higher the standard of right, to bring ever nearer the\r\nday when true justice shall obtain between man and man; and we wish\r\nGodspeed to you and yours, and may the kindliest ties of good will\r\nalways exist between us.\r\n\r\nTo you of the republics south of us, I wish to say a special word.\r\nI believe with all my heart in the Monroe Doctrine. This doctrine\r\nis not to be invoked for the aggrandizement of any one of us here\r\non this continent at the expense of any one else on this continent.\r\nIt should be regarded simply as a great international Pan-American\r\npolicy, vital to the interests of all of us. The United States has, and\r\nought to have, and must ever have, only the desire to see her sister\r\ncommonwealths in the Western Hemisphere continue to flourish, and the\r\ndetermination that no Old World power shall acquire new territory here\r\non this Western Continent. We of the two Americas must be left to work\r\nout our own salvation along our own lines; and if we are wise we will\r\nmake it understood as a cardinal feature of our joint foreign policy\r\nthat, on the one hand, we will not submit to territorial aggrandizement\r\non this continent by any Old World power, and that, on the other hand,\r\namong ourselves each nation must scrupulously regard the rights and\r\ninterests of the others, so that, instead of any one of us committing\r\nthe criminal folly of trying to rise at the expense of our neighbors,\r\nwe shall all strive upward in honest and manly brotherhood, shoulder to\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nA word now especially to my own fellow-countrymen. I think that we\r\nhave all of us reason to be satisfied with the showing made in this\r\nExposition, as in the great expositions of the past, of the results of\r\nthe enterprise, the shrewd daring, the business energy and capacity,\r\nand the artistic and, above all, the wonderful mechanical skill and\r\ninventiveness of our people. In all of this we have legitimate cause\r\nto feel a noble pride, and a still nobler pride in the showing made of\r\nwhat we have done in such matters as our system of widespread popular\r\neducation and in the field of philanthropy, especially in that best\r\nkind of philanthropy which teaches each man to help lift both himself\r\nand his neighbor by joining with that neighbor hand in hand in a common\r\neffort for the common good.\r\n\r\nBut we should err greatly, we should err in the most fatal of ways,\r\nby wilful blindness to whatever is not pleasant, if, while justly\r\nproud of our achievements, we failed to realize that we had plenty of\r\nshortcomings to remedy, that there are terrible problems before us,\r\nwhich we must work out right, under the gravest national penalties\r\nif we fail. It can not be too often repeated that there is no patent\r\ndevice for securing good government; that after all is said and done,\r\nafter we have given full credit to every scheme for increasing our\r\nmaterial prosperity, to every effort of the lawmaker to provide a\r\nsystem under which each man shall be best secured in his own rights,\r\nit yet remains true that the great factor in working out the success\r\nof this giant Republic of the Western Continent must be the possession\r\nof those qualities of essential virtue and essential manliness which\r\nhave built up every great and mighty people of the past, and the lack\r\nof which always has brought, and always will bring, the proudest of\r\nnations crashing down to ruin. Here in this Exposition, on the Stadium\r\nand on the pylons of the bridge, you have written certain sentences to\r\nwhich we all must subscribe, and to which we must live up if we are\r\nin any way or measure to do our duty: “Who shuns the dust and sweat\r\nof the contest, on his brow falls not the cool shade of the olive,”\r\nand “A free State exists only in the virtue of the citizen.” We all\r\naccept these statements in theory; but if we do not live up to them in\r\npractice, then there is no health in us. Take the two together always.\r\nIn our eager, restless life of effort but little can be done by that\r\ncloistered virtue of which Milton spoke with such fine contempt. We\r\nneed the rough, strong qualities that make a man fit to play his part\r\nwell among men. Yet we need to remember even more that no ability, no\r\nstrength and force, no power of intellect or power of wealth, shall\r\navail us, if we have not the root of right living in us, if we do not\r\npay more than a mere lip-loyalty to the old, old commonplace virtues,\r\nwhich stand at the foundation of all social and political well-being.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to say what we ought to do, but it is hard to do it; and yet\r\nno scheme can be devised which will save us from the need of doing just\r\nthis hard work. Not merely must each of us strive to do his duty; in\r\naddition it is imperatively necessary also to establish a strong and\r\nintelligent public opinion which will require each to do his duty. If\r\nany man here falls short he should not only feel ashamed of himself,\r\nbut in some way he ought also to be made conscious of the condemnation\r\nof his fellows, and this no matter what form his shortcoming takes.\r\nDoing our duty is, of course, incumbent on every one of us alike; yet\r\nthe heaviest blame for dereliction should fall on the man who sins\r\nagainst the light, the man to whom much has been given, and from whom,\r\ntherefore, we have a right to expect much in return. We should hold to\r\na peculiarly rigid accountability those men who in public life, or as\r\neditors of great papers, or as owners of vast fortunes, or as leaders\r\nand molders of opinion in the pulpit, or on the platform, or at the\r\nbar, are guilty of wrongdoing, no matter what form that wrongdoing may\r\ntake.\r\n\r\nIn addition, however, to the problems which, under protean shapes,\r\nare yet fundamentally the same for all nations and for all times,\r\nthere are others which especially need our attention, because they are\r\nthe especial productions of our present industrial civilization. The\r\ntremendous industrial development of the nineteenth century has not\r\nonly conferred great benefits upon us of the twentieth, but it has\r\nalso exposed us to grave dangers. This highly complex movement has had\r\nmany sides, some good and some bad, and has produced an absolutely\r\nnovel set of phenomena. To secure from them the best results will tax\r\nto the utmost the resources of the statesman, the economist, and the\r\nsocial reformer. There has been an immense relative growth of urban\r\npopulation, and, in consequence, an immense growth of the body of\r\nwages-workers, together with an accumulation of enormous fortunes which\r\nmore and more tend to express their power through great corporations\r\nthat are themselves guided by some master mind of the business world.\r\nAs a result, we are confronted by a formidable series of perplexing\r\nproblems, with which it is absolutely necessary to deal, and yet with\r\nwhich it is not merely useless, but in the highest degree unwise and\r\ndangerous to deal, save with wisdom, insight, and self-restraint.\r\n\r\nThere are certain truths which are so commonplace as to be axiomatic,\r\nand yet so important that we can not keep them too vividly before our\r\nminds. The true welfare of the nation is indissolubly bound up with\r\nthe welfare of the farmer and the wage-worker—of the man who tills\r\nthe soil, and of the mechanic, the handicraftsman, the laborer. If we\r\ncan ensure the prosperity of these two classes we need not trouble\r\nourselves about the prosperity of the rest, for that will follow as a\r\nmatter of course.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is equally true that the prosperity of any of\r\nus can best be attained by measures that will promote the prosperity\r\nof all. The poorest motto upon which an American can act is the motto\r\nof “Some men down,” and the safest to follow is that of “All men up.”\r\nA good deal can and ought to be done by law. For instance, the State\r\nand, if necessary, the nation should by law assume ample power of\r\nsupervising and regulating the acts of any corporation (which can be\r\nbut its creature), and generally of those immense business enterprises\r\nwhich exist only because of the safety and protection to property\r\nguaranteed by our system of government. Yet it is equally true that,\r\nwhile this power should exist, it should be used sparingly and with\r\nself-restraint. Modern industrial competition is very keen between\r\nnation and nation, and now that our country is striding forward with\r\nthe pace of a giant to take the leading position in the international\r\nindustrial world, we should beware how we fetter our limbs, how\r\nwe cramp our Titan strength. While striving to prevent industrial\r\ninjustice at home, we must not bring upon ourselves industrial weakness\r\nabroad. This is a task for which we need the finest abilities of the\r\nstatesman, the student, the patriot, and the far-seeing lover of\r\nmankind. It is a task in which we shall fail with absolute certainty\r\nif we approach it after having surrendered ourselves to the guidance\r\nof the demagogue, or to the doctrinaire, of the well-meaning man\r\nwho thinks feebly, or of the cunning self-seeker who endeavors to\r\nrise by committing that worst of crimes against our people—the\r\ncrime of inflaming brother against brother, one American against his\r\nfellow-Americans.\r\n\r\nMy fellow-countrymen, bad laws are evil things, good laws are\r\nnecessary; and a clean, fearless, common-sense administration of the\r\nlaws is even more necessary; but what we need most of all is to look\r\nto our own selves to see that our consciences as individuals, that our\r\ncollective national conscience, may respond instantly to every appeal\r\nfor high action, for lofty and generous endeavor. There must and shall\r\nbe no falling off in the national traits of hardihood and manliness;\r\nand we must keep ever bright the love of justice, the spirit of strong\r\nbrotherly friendship for one’s fellows, which we hope and believe will\r\nhereafter stand as typical of the men who make up this, the mightiest\r\nRepublic upon which the sun has ever shone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANHOOD AND STATEHOOD\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT THE QUARTER-CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF STATEHOOD IN COLORADO,\r\nAT COLORADO SPRINGS, AUGUST 2, 1901\r\n\r\n\r\nThis anniversary, which marks the completion by Colorado of her first\r\nquarter-century of Statehood, is of interest not only to her sisters,\r\nthe States of the Rocky Mountain region, but to our whole country.\r\nWith the exception of the admission to Statehood of California, no\r\nother event emphasized in such dramatic fashion the full meaning of the\r\ngrowth of our country as did the incoming of Colorado.\r\n\r\nIt is a law of our intellectual development that the greatest and most\r\nimportant truths, when once we have become thoroughly familiar with\r\nthem, often because of that very familiarity grow dim in our minds. The\r\nwestward spread of our people across this continent has been so rapid,\r\nand so great has been their success in taming the rugged wilderness,\r\nturning the gray desert into green fertility, and filling the waste and\r\nlonely places with the eager, thronging, crowded life of our industrial\r\ncivilization, that we have begun to accept it all as part of the order\r\nof Nature. Moreover, it now seems to us equally a matter of course that\r\nwhen a sufficient number of the citizens of our common country have\r\nthus entered into and taken possession of some great tract of empty\r\nwilderness, they should be permitted to enter the Union as a State on\r\nan absolute equality with the older States, having the same right both\r\nto manage their own local affairs as they deem best, and to exercise\r\ntheir full share of control over all the affairs of whatever kind or\r\nsort in which the nation is interested as a whole. The youngest and the\r\noldest States stand on an exact level in one indissoluble and perpetual\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nTo us nowadays these processes seem so natural that it is only by a\r\nmental wrench that we conceive of any other as possible. Yet they\r\nare really wholly modern and of purely American development. When, a\r\ncentury before Colorado became a State, the original thirteen States\r\nbegan the great experiment of a free and independent Republic on this\r\ncontinent, the processes which we now accept in such matter-of-course\r\nfashion were looked upon as abnormal and revolutionary. It is our own\r\nsuccess here in America that has brought about the complete alteration\r\nin feeling. The chief factor in producing the Revolution, and later\r\nin producing the War of 1812, was the inability of the mother country\r\nto understand that the freemen who went forth to conquer a continent\r\nshould be encouraged in that work, and could not and ought not to be\r\nexpected to toil only for the profit or glory of others. When the\r\nfirst Continental Congress assembled, the British Government, like\r\nevery other government of Europe at that time, simply did not know\r\nhow to look upon the general question of the progress of the colonies\r\nsave from the standpoint of the people who had stayed at home. The\r\nspread of the hardy, venturesome backwoodsmen was to most of the\r\nstatesmen of London a matter of anxiety rather than of pride, and\r\nthe famous Quebec Act of 1774 was in part designed with the purpose\r\nof keeping the English-speaking settlements permanently east of the\r\nAlleghanies, and preserving the mighty and beautiful valley of the Ohio\r\nas a hunting-ground for savages, a preserve for the great fur-trading\r\ncompanies; and as late as 1812 this project was partially revived.\r\n\r\nMore extraordinary still, even after independence was achieved, and a\r\nfirm Union accomplished under that wonderful document, the Constitution\r\nadopted in 1789, we still see traces of the same feeling lingering\r\nhere and there in our own country. There were plenty of men in the\r\nseaboard States who looked with what seems to us ludicrous apprehension\r\nat the steady westward growth of our people. Grave Senators and\r\nRepresentatives expressed dire foreboding as to the ruin which would\r\nresult from admitting the communities growing up along the Ohio to\r\na full equality with the older States; and when Louisiana was given\r\nStatehood, they insisted that that very fact dissolved the Union. When\r\nour people had began to settle in the Mississippi Valley, Jefferson\r\nhimself accepted with equanimity the view that probably it would not be\r\npossible to keep regions so infinitely remote as the Mississippi and\r\nthe Atlantic Coast in the same Union. Later even such a stanch Union\r\nman and firm believer in Western growth as fearless old Tom Benton of\r\nMissouri thought that it would be folly to try to extend the national\r\nlimits westward of the Rocky Mountains. In 1830 our then best-known man\r\nof letters and historian, Washington Irving, prophesied that for ages\r\nto come the country upon which we now stand would be inhabited simply\r\nby roving tribes of nomads.\r\n\r\nThe mental attitude of all these good people need not surprise anybody.\r\nThere was nothing in the past by which to judge either the task before\r\nthis country, or the way in which that task was to be done. As Lowell\r\nfinely said, on this continent we have made new States as Old World men\r\npitch tents. Even the most far-seeing statesmen, those most gifted with\r\nthe imagination needed by really great statesmen, could not at first\r\ngrasp what the process really meant. Slowly and with incredible labor\r\nthe backwoodsmen of the old colonies hewed their way through the dense\r\nforests from the tide-water region to the crests of the Alleghanies.\r\nBut by the time the Alleghanies were reached, about at the moment when\r\nour national life began, the movement had gained wonderful momentum.\r\nThenceforward it advanced by leaps and bounds, and the frontier pushed\r\nwestward across the continent with ever-increasing rapidity until the\r\nday came when it vanished entirely. Our greatest statesmen have always\r\nbeen those who _believed in the nation_—who had faith in the power of\r\nour people to spread until they should become the mightiest among the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\n\r\nUnder any governmental system which was known to Europe, the problem\r\noffered by the westward thrust, across a continent, of so masterful\r\nand liberty-loving a race as ours would have been insoluble. The great\r\ncivilized and colonizing races of antiquity, the Greeks and the Romans,\r\nhad been utterly unable to devise a scheme under which when their\r\nrace spread it might be possible to preserve both national unity and\r\nlocal and individual freedom. When a Hellenic or Latin city sent off\r\na colony, one of two things happened. Either the colony was kept in\r\npolitical subjection to the city or state of which it was an offshoot,\r\nor else it became a wholly independent and alien, and often a hostile,\r\nnation. Both systems were fraught with disaster. With the Greeks race\r\nunity was sacrificed to local independence, and as a result the Greek\r\nworld became the easy prey of foreign conquerors. The Romans kept\r\nnational unity, but only by means of a crushing centralized despotism.\r\n\r\nWhen the modern world entered upon the marvelous era of expansion which\r\nbegan with the discoveries of Columbus, the nations were able to devise\r\nno new plan. All the great colonizing powers, England, France, Spain,\r\nPortugal, Holland, and Russia, managed their colonies primarily in the\r\ninterest of the home country. Some did better than others,—England\r\nprobably best and Spain worst,—but in no case were the colonists\r\ntreated as citizens of equal rights in a common country. Our ancestors,\r\nwho were at once the strongest and the most liberty-loving among all\r\nthe peoples who had been thrust out into new continents, were the first\r\nto revolt against this system; and the lesson taught by their success\r\nhas been thoroughly learned.\r\n\r\nIn applying the new principles to our conditions we have found the\r\nFederal Constitution a nearly perfect instrument. The system of a\r\nclosely knit and indestructible union of free commonwealths has enabled\r\nus to do what neither Greek nor Roman in their greatest days could\r\ndo. We have preserved the complete unity of an expanding race without\r\nimpairing in the slightest degree the liberty of the individual.\r\nWhen in a given locality the settlers became sufficiently numerous,\r\nthey were admitted to Statehood, and thenceforward shared all the\r\nrights and all the duties of the citizens of the older States. As with\r\nColumbus and the egg, the expedient seems obvious enough nowadays, but\r\nthen it was so novel that a couple of generations had to pass before\r\nwe ourselves thoroughly grasped all its features. At last we grew to\r\naccept as axiomatic the two facts of national union and local and\r\npersonal freedom. As whatever is axiomatic seems commonplace, we now\r\ntend to accept what has been accomplished as a mere matter-of-course\r\nincident, of no great moment. The very completeness with which\r\nthe vitally important task has been done almost blinds us to the\r\nextraordinary nature of the achievement.\r\n\r\nYou, the men of Colorado, and, above all, the older among those whom I\r\nam now addressing, have been engaged in doing the great typical work\r\nof our people. Save only the preservation of the Union itself, no\r\nother task has been so important as the conquest and settlement of the\r\nWest. This conquest and settlement has been the stupendous feat of our\r\nrace for the century that has just closed. It stands supreme among all\r\nsuch feats. The same kind of thing has been in Australia and Canada,\r\nbut upon a less important scale, while the Russian advance in Siberia\r\nhas been incomparably slower. In all the history of mankind there is\r\nnothing that quite parallels the way in which our people have filled\r\na vacant continent with self-governing commonwealths, knit into one\r\nnation. And of all this marvelous history perhaps the most wonderful\r\nportion is that which deals with the way in which the Pacific Coast and\r\nthe Rocky Mountains were settled.\r\n\r\nThe men who founded these communities showed practically by their\r\nlife-work that it is indeed the spirit of adventure which is the\r\nmaker of commonwealths. Their traits of daring and hardihood and iron\r\nendurance are not merely indispensable traits for pioneers; they are\r\nalso traits which must go to the make-up of every mighty and successful\r\npeople. You and your fathers who built up the West did more even than\r\nyou thought; for you shaped thereby the destiny of the whole Republic,\r\nand as a necessary corollary profoundly influenced the course of events\r\nthroughout the world. More and more as the years go by this Republic\r\nwill find its guidance in the thought and action of the West, because\r\nthe conditions of development in the West have steadily tended to\r\naccentuate the peculiarly American characteristics of its people.\r\n\r\nThere was scant room for the coward and the weakling in the ranks of\r\nthe adventurous frontiersmen—the pioneer settlers who first broke up\r\nthe wild prairie soil, who first hewed their way into the primeval\r\nforest, who guided their white-topped wagons across the endless leagues\r\nof Indian-haunted desolation, and explored every remote mountain-chain\r\nin the restless quest for metal wealth. Behind them came the men\r\nwho completed the work they had roughly begun: who drove the great\r\nrailroad systems over plain and desert and mountain pass; who stocked\r\nthe teeming ranches, and under irrigation saw the bright green of the\r\nalfalfa and the yellow of the golden stubble supplant the gray of the\r\nsage-brush desert; who have built great populous cities—cities in\r\nwhich every art and science of civilization are carried to the highest\r\npoint—on tracts which, when the nineteenth century had passed its\r\nmeridian, were still known only to the grim trappers and hunters and\r\nthe red lords of the wilderness with whom they waged eternal war.\r\n\r\nSuch is the record of which we are so proud. It is a record of men who\r\ngreatly dared and greatly did; a record of wanderings wider and more\r\ndangerous than those of the Vikings; a record of endless feats of arms,\r\nof victory after victory in the ceaseless strife waged against wild man\r\nand wild nature. The winning of the West was the great epic feat in the\r\nhistory of our race.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, a right to meet to-day in a spirit of just pride in\r\nthe past. But when we pay homage to the hardy, grim, resolute men\r\nwho, with incredible toil and risk, laid deep the foundations of the\r\ncivilization that we inherit, let us steadily remember that the only\r\nhomage that counts is the homage of deeds—not merely of words. It is\r\nwell to gather here to show that we remember what has been done in the\r\npast by the Western pioneers of our people, and that we glory in the\r\ngreatness for which they prepared the way. But lip-loyalty by itself\r\navails very little, whether it is expressed concerning a nation or an\r\nideal. It would be a sad and evil thing for this country if ever the\r\nday came when we considered the great deeds of our forefathers as an\r\nexcuse for our resting slothfully satisfied with what has been already\r\ndone. On the contrary, they should be an inspiration and appeal,\r\nsummoning us to show that we too have courage and strength; that we\r\ntoo are ready to dare greatly if the need arises; and, above all, that\r\nwe are firmly bent upon that steady performance of every-day duty\r\nwhich, in the long run, is of such incredible worth in the formation of\r\nnational character.\r\n\r\nThe old iron days have gone, the days when the weakling died as the\r\npenalty of inability to hold his own in the rough warfare against his\r\nsurroundings. We live in softer times. Let us see to it that, while we\r\ntake advantage of every gentler and more humanizing tendency of the\r\nage, we yet preserve the iron quality which made our forefathers and\r\npredecessors fit to do the deeds they did. It will of necessity find\r\na different expression now, but the quality itself remains just as\r\nnecessary as ever. Surely you men of the West, you men who with stout\r\nheart, cool head, and ready hand have wrought out your own success and\r\nbuilt up these great new commonwealths, surely you need no reminder\r\nof the fact that if either man or nation wishes to play a great part\r\nin the world there must be no dallying with the life of lazy ease.\r\nIn the abounding energy and intensity of existence in our mighty\r\ndemocratic Republic there is small space indeed for the idler, for\r\nthe luxury-loving man who prizes ease more than hard, triumph-crowned\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nWe hold work not as a curse but as a blessing, and we regard the idler\r\nwith scornful pity. It would be in the highest degree undesirable that\r\nwe should all work in the same way or at the same things, and for the\r\nsake of the real greatness of the nation we should in the fullest and\r\nmost cordial way recognize the fact that some of the most needed work\r\nmust, from its very nature, be unremunerative in a material sense.\r\nEach man must choose so far as the conditions allow him the path to\r\nwhich he is bidden by his own peculiar powers and inclinations. But if\r\nhe is a man he must in some way or shape do a man’s work. If, after\r\nmaking all the effort that his strength of body and of mind permits,\r\nhe yet honorably fails, why, he is still entitled to a certain share\r\nof respect because he has made the effort. But if he does not make the\r\neffort, or if he makes it half-heartedly and recoils from the labor,\r\nthe risk, or the irksome monotony of his task, why, he has forfeited\r\nall right to our respect, and has shown himself a mere cumberer of the\r\nearth. It is not given to us all to succeed, but it is given to us all\r\nto strive manfully to deserve success.\r\n\r\nWe need, then, the iron qualities that must go with true manhood. We\r\nneed the positive virtues of resolution, of courage, of indomitable\r\nwill, of power to do without shrinking the rough work that must always\r\nbe done, and to persevere through the long days of slow progress or of\r\nseeming failure which always come before any final triumph, no matter\r\nhow brilliant. But we need more than these qualities. This country can\r\nnot afford to have its sons less than men; but neither can it afford to\r\nhave them other than good men. If courage and strength and intellect\r\nare unaccompanied by the moral purpose, the moral sense, they become\r\nmerely forms of expression for unscrupulous force and unscrupulous\r\ncunning. If the strong man has not in him the lift toward lofty things\r\nhis strength makes him only a curse to himself and to his neighbor. All\r\nthis is true in private life, and it is no less true in public life. If\r\nWashington and Lincoln had not had in them the whipcord fibre of moral\r\nand mental strength, the soul that steels itself to endure disaster\r\nunshaken and with grim resolve to wrest victory from defeat, then the\r\none could not have founded, nor the other preserved, our mighty Federal\r\nUnion. The least touch of flabbiness, of unhealthy softness, in either\r\nwould have meant ruin for this nation, and therefore the downfall of\r\nthe proudest hope of mankind. But no less is it true that had either\r\nbeen influenced by self-seeking ambition, by callous disregard of\r\nothers, by contempt for the moral law, he would have dashed us down\r\ninto the black gulf of failure. Woe to all of us if ever as a people we\r\ngrow to condone evil because it is successful. We can no more afford\r\nto lose social and civic decency and honesty than we can afford to\r\nlose the qualities of courage and strength. It is the merest truism to\r\nsay that the nation rests upon the individual, upon the family—upon\r\nindividual manliness and womanliness, using the words in their widest\r\nand fullest meaning.\r\n\r\nTo be a good husband or good wife, a good neighbor and friend, to be\r\nhard-working and upright in business and social relations, to bring\r\nup many healthy children—to be and to do all this is to lay the\r\nfoundations of good citizenship as they must be laid. But we can not\r\nstop even with this. Each of us has not only his duty to himself,\r\nhis family, and his neighbors, but his duty to the State and to the\r\nnation. We are in honor bound each to strive according to his or her\r\nstrength to bring ever nearer the day when justice and wisdom shall\r\nobtain in public life as in private life. We can not retain the\r\nfull measure of our self-respect if we can not retain pride in our\r\ncitizenship. For the sake not only of ourselves but of our children\r\nand our children’s children we must see that this nation stands for\r\nstrength and honesty both at home and abroad. In our internal policy we\r\ncan not afford to rest satisfied until all that the government can do\r\nhas been done to secure fair dealing and equal justice as between man\r\nand man. In the great part which hereafter, whether we will or not, we\r\nmust play in the world at large, let us see to it that we neither do\r\nwrong nor shrink from doing right because the right is difficult; that\r\non the one hand we inflict no injury, and that on the other we have a\r\ndue regard for the honor and the interest of our mighty nation; and\r\nthat we keep unsullied the renown of the flag which beyond all others\r\nof the present time or of the ages of the past stands for confident\r\nfaith in the future welfare and greatness of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROTHERHOOD AND THE HEROIC VIRTUES\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT VETERANS’ REUNION, BURLINGTON, VERMONT, SEPTEMBER 5, 1901\r\n\r\n\r\nI speak to you to-night less as men of Vermont than as members of\r\nthe Grand Army which saved the Union. But at the outset I must pay a\r\nspecial tribute to your State. Vermont was not a rich State, compared\r\nwith many States, and she had sent out so many tens of thousands of\r\nher sons to the West that it is not improbable that as many men of\r\nVermont birth served in the regiments of other States as in those of\r\nher own State. Yet, notwithstanding this drain, your gallant State\r\nwas surpassed by no other State of the North, either in the number\r\nof men according to her population which she sent into the army, or\r\nin the relative extent of her financial support of the war. Too much\r\ncan not be said of the high quality of the Vermont soldiers; and one\r\ncontributing factor in securing this high quality was the good sense\r\nwhich continually sent recruits into the already existing regiments\r\ninstead of forming new ones.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to express the full measure of obligation under\r\nwhich this country is to the men who from ’61 to ’65 took up the most\r\nterrible and vitally necessary task which has ever fallen to the lot\r\nof any generation of men in the Western Hemisphere. Other men have\r\nrendered great service to the country, but the service you rendered\r\nwas not merely great—it was incalculable. Other men by their lives\r\nor their deaths have kept unstained our honor, have wrought marvels\r\nfor our interest, have led us forward to triumph, or warded off\r\ndisaster from us; other men have marshaled our ranks upward across the\r\nstony slopes of greatness. But you did more, for you saved us from\r\nannihilation. We can feel proud of what others did only because of\r\nwhat you did. It was given to you, when the mighty days came, to do\r\nthe mighty deeds for which the days called, and if your deeds had been\r\nleft undone, all that had been already accomplished would have turned\r\ninto apples of Sodom under our teeth. The glory of Washington and the\r\nmajesty of Marshall would have crumbled into meaningless dust if you\r\nand your comrades had not buttressed their work with your strength of\r\nsteel, your courage of fire. The Declaration of Independence would now\r\nsound like a windy platitude, the Constitution of the United States\r\nwould ring as false as if drawn by the Abbé Sieyès in the days of the\r\nFrench Terror, if your stern valor had not proved the truth of the one\r\nand made good the promise of the other. In our history there have been\r\nother victorious struggles for right, on the field of battle and in\r\ncivic strife. To have failed in these other struggles would have meant\r\nbitter shame and grievous loss. But you fought in the one struggle\r\nwhere failure meant death and destruction to our people; meant that our\r\nwhole past history would be crossed out of the records of successful\r\nendeavor with the red and black lines of failure; meant that not one\r\nman in all this wide country would now be holding his head upright as a\r\nfree citizen of a mighty and glorious Republic.\r\n\r\nAll this you did, and therefore you are entitled to the homage of all\r\nmen who have not forgotten in their blindness either the awful nature\r\nof the crisis, or the worth of priceless service rendered in the hour\r\nof direst need.\r\n\r\nYou met a great need, that vanished because of your success. You have\r\nleft us many memories, to be prized for evermore. You have taught us\r\nmany lessons, and none more important than the lesson of brotherhood.\r\nThe realization of the underlying brotherhood of our people, the\r\nfeeling that there should be among them an essential unity of purpose\r\nand sympathy, must be kept close at heart if we are to do our work well\r\nhere in our American life. You have taught us both by what you did on\r\nthe tented fields, and by what you have done since in civic life, how\r\nthis spirit of brotherhood can be made a living, a vital force.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, you have left us the right of brotherhood with\r\nthe gallant men who wore the gray in the ranks against which you were\r\npitted. At the opening of this new century, all of us, the children\r\nof a reunited country, have a right to glory in the countless deeds\r\nof valor done alike by the men of the North and the men of the South.\r\nWe can retain an ever-growing sense of the all-importance, not merely\r\nto our people but to mankind, of the Union victory, while giving the\r\nfreest and heartiest recognition to the sincerity and self-devotion of\r\nthose Americans, our fellow-countrymen, who then fought against the\r\nstars in their courses. Now there is none left, North or South, who\r\ndoes not take joy and pride in the Union; and when three years ago we\r\nonce more had to face a foreign enemy, the heart of every true American\r\nthrilled with pride to see veterans who had fought in the Confederate\r\nuniform once more appear under Uncle Sam’s colors, side by side with\r\ntheir former foes, and leading to victory under the famous old flag the\r\nsons both of those who had worn the blue and of those who had worn the\r\ngray.\r\n\r\nBut there are other ways in which you have taught the lesson of\r\nbrotherhood. In our highly complex, highly specialized industrial\r\nlife of to-day there are many tendencies for good and there are also\r\nmany tendencies for evil. Chief among the latter is the way in which,\r\nin great industrial centres, the segregation of interests invites a\r\nsegregation of sympathies. In our old American life, and in the country\r\ndistricts where to-day the old conditions still largely obtain, there\r\nwas and is no such sharp and rigid demarcation between different\r\ngroups of citizens. In most country districts at the present day not\r\nonly have the people many feelings in common, but, what is quite as\r\nimportant, they are perfectly aware that they have these feelings in\r\ncommon. In the cities the divergence of real interests is nothing like\r\nas great as is commonly supposed; but it does exist, and, above all,\r\nthere is a tendency to forget or ignore the community of interest.\r\nThere is comparatively little neighborliness, and life is so busy and\r\nthe population so crowded that it is impossible for the average man\r\nto get into touch with any of his fellow-citizens save those in his\r\nimmediate little group. In consequence there tends to grow up a feeling\r\nof estrangement between different groups, of forgetfulness of the great\r\nprimal needs and primal passions that are common to all of us.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore of the utmost benefit to have men thrown together under\r\ncircumstances which force them to realize their community of interest,\r\nespecially where the community of interest arises from community of\r\ndevotion to a lofty ideal. The great Civil War rendered precisely this\r\nservice. It drew into the field a very large proportion of the adult\r\nmale population, and it lasted so long that its lessons were thoroughly\r\ndriven home. In our other wars the same lessons, or nearly the same\r\nlessons, have been taught, but upon so much smaller a scale that the\r\neffect is in no shape or way comparable. In the Civil War, merchant\r\nand clerk, manufacturer and mechanic, farmer and hired man, capitalist\r\nand wage-worker, city man and country man, Easterner and Westerner,\r\nwent into the army together, faced toil and risk and hardship side by\r\nside, died with the same fortitude, and felt the same disinterested\r\nthrill of triumph when the victory came. In our modern life there are\r\nonly a few occupations where risk has to be feared, and there are many\r\noccupations where no exhausting labor has to be faced; and so there are\r\nplenty of us who can be benefited by a little actual experience with\r\nthe rough side of things. It was a good thing, a very good thing, to\r\nhave a great mass of our people learn what it was to face death and\r\nendure toil together, and all on an exact level. You whom I am now\r\naddressing remember well, do you not, the weary, foot-sore marches\r\nunder the burning sun, when the blankets seemed too heavy to carry, and\r\nthen the shivering sleep in the trenches, when the mud froze after dark\r\nand the blankets seemed altogether too light instead of too heavy?\r\nYou remember the scanty fare, and you remember, above all, how you got\r\nto estimate each of your fellows by what there was in him and not by\r\nanything adventitious in his surroundings. It was of vital importance\r\nto you that the men of your left and your right should do their duty;\r\nthat they should come forward when the order was to advance; that they\r\nshould keep the lines with ceaseless vigilance and fortitude if on the\r\ndefensive. You neither knew nor cared what had been their occupations,\r\nor whether they were in worldly ways well off or the reverse. What you\r\ndesired to know about them was to be sure that they would “stay put”\r\nwhen the crisis came. Was not this so? You know it was.\r\n\r\nMoreover, all these qualities of fine heroism and stubborn endurance\r\nwere displayed in a spirit of devotion to a lofty ideal, and not for\r\nmaterial gain. The average man who fought in our armies during the\r\nCivil War could have gained much more money if he had stayed in civil\r\nlife. When the end came his sole reward was to feel that the Union\r\nhad been saved, and the flag which had been rent in sunder once more\r\nmade whole. Nothing was more noteworthy than the marvelous way in\r\nwhich, once the war was ended, the great armies which had fought it\r\nto a triumphant conclusion disbanded, and were instantly lost in the\r\ncurrent of our civil life. The soldier turned at once to the task\r\nof earning his own livelihood. But he carried within him memories of\r\ninestimable benefit to himself, and he bequeathed to us who come after\r\nhim the priceless heritage of his example. From the major-general to\r\nthe private in the ranks each came back to civil life with the proud\r\nconsciousness of duty well done, and all with a feeling of community\r\nof interest which they could have gained in no other way. Each knew\r\nwhat work was, what danger was. Each came back with his own power for\r\nlabor and endurance strengthened, and yet with his sympathy for others\r\nquickened. From that day to this the men who fought in the great war\r\nhave inevitably had in them a spirit to which appeal for any lofty\r\ncause could be made with the confident knowledge that there would\r\nbe immediate and eager response. In the breasts of the men who saw\r\nAppomattox there was no room for the growth of the jealous, greedy,\r\nsullen envy which makes anarchy, which has bred the red Commune. They\r\nhad gone down to the root of things, and knew how to judge and value,\r\neach man his neighbor, whether that neighbor was rich or poor, neither\r\nenvying him because of his wealth nor despising him because of his\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nThe lesson taught by the great war could only be imperfectly taught by\r\nany lesser war. Nevertheless, not a little good has been done even by\r\nsuch struggles as that which ended in ensuring independence to Cuba,\r\nand in giving to the Philippines a freedom to which they could never\r\nhave attained had we permitted them to fall into anarchy or under\r\ntyranny. It was a pleasant thing to see the way in which men came\r\nforward from every walk of life, from every section of the country,\r\nas soon as the call to arms occurred. The need was small and easily\r\nmet, and not one in a hundred of the ardent young fellows who pressed\r\nforward to enter the army had a chance to see any service whatever. But\r\nit was good to see that the spirit of ’61 had not been lost. Perhaps\r\nthe best feature of the whole movement was the eagerness with which\r\nmen went into the ranks, anxious only to serve their country and to do\r\ntheir share of the work without regard to anything in the way of reward\r\nor position; for, gentlemen, it is upon the efficiency of the enlisted\r\nman, upon the way he does his duty, that the efficiency of the whole\r\narmy really depends, and the prime work of the officer is, after all,\r\nonly to develop, foster, and direct the good qualities of the men under\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWell, this rush into the ranks not only had a very good side, but\r\nalso at times an amusing side. I remember one characteristic incident\r\nwhich occurred on board one of our naval vessels. Several of these\r\nvessels were officered and manned chiefly from the naval militia of\r\nthe different States, the commander and executive officer and a few\r\nveterans here and there among the crew being the only ones that came\r\nfrom the regular service. The naval militia contained every type of\r\nman, from bankers with a taste for yachting to longshoremen, and they\r\nall went in and did their best. But of course it was a little hard\r\nfor some of them to adjust themselves to their surroundings. One of\r\nthe vessels in question, toward the end of the war, returned from the\r\nSpanish Main and anchored in one of our big ports. Early one morning\r\na hard-looking and seemingly rather dejected member of the crew was\r\nengaged in “squeegeeing” the quarter-deck, when the captain came up\r\nand, noticing a large and handsome yacht near by (I shall not use the\r\nreal name of the yacht), remarked to himself: “I wonder what boat that\r\nis?” The man with the squeegee touched his cap and said in answer:\r\n“The _Dawn_, sir.” “How do you know that?” quoth the captain, looking\r\nat him. “Because I own her, sir,” responded the man with the squeegee,\r\nagain touching his cap; and the conversation ended.\r\n\r\nNow, it was a first-rate thing for that man himself to have served his\r\ntrick, not merely as the man behind the gun, but as the man with the\r\nsqueegee; and is was a mighty good thing for the country that he should\r\ndo it. In our volunteer regiments we had scores of enlisted men of\r\nindependent means serving under officers many of whom were dependent\r\nfor their daily bread upon the work of their hands or brain from month\r\nto month. It was a good thing for both classes to be brought together\r\non such terms. It showed that we of this generation had not wholly\r\nforgotten the lesson taught by you who fought to a finish the great\r\nCivil War. And there is no danger to the future of this country just\r\nso long as that lesson is remembered in all its bearings, civil and\r\nmilitary.\r\n\r\nYour history, rightly studied, will teach us the time-worn truth\r\nthat in war, as in peace, we need chiefly the every-day, commonplace\r\nvirtues, and above all, an unflagging sense of duty. Yet in dwelling\r\nupon the lessons for our ordinary conduct which we can learn from your\r\nexperience, we must never forget that it also shows us what should be\r\nour model in times that are not ordinary, in the times that try men’s\r\nsouls. We need to have within us the splendid heroic virtues which\r\nalone avail in the mighty crises, the terrible catastrophes whereby\r\na nation is either purified as if by fire, or else consumed forever\r\nin the flames. When you of the Civil War sprang forward at Abraham\r\nLincoln’s call to put all that life holds dear, and life itself, in the\r\nscale with the nation’s honor, you were able to do what you did because\r\nyou had in you not only the qualities that make good citizens, but in\r\naddition the high and intense traits, the deep passion and enthusiasm,\r\nwhich go to make up those heroes who are fit to deal with iron days.\r\nWe can never as a nation afford to forget that, back of our reason, our\r\nunderstanding, and our common-sense, there must lie, in full strength,\r\nthe tremendous fundamental passions, which are not often needed, but\r\nwhich every truly great race must have as a well-spring of motive in\r\ntime of need.\r\n\r\nI shall end by quoting to you in substance certain words from a\r\nminister of the gospel, a most witty man, who was also a philosopher\r\nand a man of profound wisdom, Sydney Smith:\r\n\r\n“The history of the world shows us that men are not to be counted by\r\ntheir numbers, but by the fire and vigor of their passions; by their\r\ndeep sense of injury; by their memory of past glory; by their eagerness\r\nfor fresh fame; by their clear and steady resolution of either ceasing\r\nto live, or of achieving a particular object, which, when it is once\r\nformed, strikes off a load of manacles and chains, and gives free\r\nspace to all heavenly and heroic feelings. All great and extraordinary\r\nactions come from the heart. There are seasons in human affairs when\r\nqualities, fit enough to conduct the common business of life, are\r\nfeeble and useless, when men must trust to emotion for that safety\r\nwhich reason at such times can never give. These are the feelings\r\nwhich led the ten thousand over the Carduchian mountains; these are\r\nthe feelings by which a handful of Greeks broke in pieces the power\r\nof Persia; and in the fens of the Dutch and in the mountains of the\r\nSwiss these feelings defended happiness and revenged the oppressions of\r\nman! God calls all the passions out in their keenness and vigor for the\r\npresent safety of mankind, anger and revenge and the heroic mind, and a\r\nreadiness to suffer—all the secret strength, all the invisible array\r\nof the feelings—all that nature has reserved for the great scenes of\r\nthe world. When the usual hopes and the common aids of man are all\r\ngone, nothing remains under God but those passions which have often\r\nproved the best ministers of His purpose and the surest protectors of\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL DUTIES\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT MINNESOTA STATE FAIR, SEPT. 2, 1901\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his admirable series of studies of twentieth-century problems, Dr.\r\nLyman Abbott has pointed out that we are a nation of pioneers; that the\r\nfirst colonists to our shores were pioneers, and that pioneers selected\r\nout from among the descendants of these early pioneers, mingled with\r\nothers selected afresh from the Old World, pushed westward into the\r\nwilderness and laid the foundations for new commonwealths. They were\r\nmen of hope and expectation, of enterprise and energy; for the men of\r\ndull content or more dull despair had no part in the great movement\r\ninto and across the New World. Our country has been populated by\r\npioneers, and therefore it has in it more energy, more enterprise, more\r\nexpansive power than any other in the wide world.\r\n\r\nYou whom I am now addressing stand for the most part but one generation\r\nremoved from these pioneers. You are typical Americans, for you have\r\ndone the great, the characteristic, the typical work of our American\r\nlife. In making homes and carving out careers for yourselves and your\r\nchildren, you have built up this State. Throughout our history the\r\nsuccess of the home-maker has been but another name for the upbuilding\r\nof the nation. The men who with axe in the forests and pick in the\r\nmountains and plow on the prairies pushed to completion the dominion of\r\nour people over the American wilderness have given the definite shape\r\nto our nation. They have shown the qualities of daring, endurance,\r\nand far-sightedness, of eager desire for victory and stubborn refusal\r\nto accept defeat, which go to make up the essential manliness of the\r\nAmerican character. Above all, they have recognized in practical form\r\nthe fundamental law of success in American life—the law of worthy\r\nwork, the law of high, resolute endeavor. We have but little room among\r\nour people for the timid, the irresolute, and the idle; and it is no\r\nless true that there is scant room in the world at large for the nation\r\nwith mighty thews that dares not to be great.\r\n\r\nSurely in speaking to the sons of the men who actually did the rough\r\nand hard and infinitely glorious work of making the great Northwest\r\nwhat it now is, I need hardly insist upon the righteousness of this\r\ndoctrine. In your own vigorous lives you show by every act how scant is\r\nyour patience with those who do not see in the life of effort the life\r\nsupremely worth living. Sometimes we hear those who do not work spoken\r\nof with envy. Surely the wilfully idle need arouse in the breast of a\r\nhealthy man no emotion stronger than that of contempt—at the outside\r\nno emotion stronger than angry contempt. The feeling of envy would have\r\nin it an admission of inferiority on our part, to which the men who\r\nknow not the sterner joys of life are not entitled. Poverty is a bitter\r\nthing; but it is not as bitter as the existence of restless vacuity\r\nand physical, moral, and intellectual flabbiness, to which those doom\r\nthemselves who elect to spend all their years in that vainest of all\r\nvain pursuits—the pursuit of mere pleasure as a sufficient end in\r\nitself. The wilfully idle man, like the wilfully barren woman, has no\r\nplace in a sane, healthy, and vigorous community. Moreover, the gross\r\nand hideous selfishness for which each stands defeats even its own\r\nmiserable aims. Exactly as infinitely the happiest woman is she who has\r\nborne and brought up many healthy children, so infinitely the happiest\r\nman is he who has toiled hard and successfully in his life-work. The\r\nwork may be done in a thousand different ways—with the brain or the\r\nhands, in the study, the field, or the workshop—if it is honest work,\r\nhonestly done and well worth doing, that is all we have a right to ask.\r\nEvery father and mother here, if they are wise, will bring up their\r\nchildren not to shirk difficulties, but to meet them and overcome them;\r\nnot to strive after a life of ignoble ease, but to strive to do their\r\nduty, first to themselves and their families, and then to the whole\r\nState; and this duty must inevitably take the shape of work in some\r\nform or other. You, the sons of the pioneers, if you are true to your\r\nancestry, must make your lives as worthy as they made theirs. They\r\nsought for true success, and therefore they did not seek ease. They\r\nknew that success comes only to those who lead the life of endeavor.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the simple acceptance of this fundamental fact\r\nof American life, this acknowledgment that the law of work is the\r\nfundamental law of our being, will help us to start aright in facing\r\nnot a few of the problems that confront us from without and from\r\nwithin. As regards internal affairs, it should teach us the prime need\r\nof remembering that, after all has been said and done, the chief factor\r\nin any man’s success or failure must be his own character—that is, the\r\nsum of his common-sense, his courage, his virile energy and capacity.\r\nNothing can take the place of this individual factor.\r\n\r\nI do not for a moment mean that much can not be done to supplement\r\nit. Besides each one of us working individually, all of us have got\r\nto work together. We can not possibly do our best work as a nation\r\nunless all of us know how to act in combination as well as how to act\r\neach individually for himself. The acting in combination can take many\r\nforms, but of course its most effective form must be when it comes\r\nin the shape of law—that is, of action by the community as a whole\r\nthrough the law-making body.\r\n\r\nBut it is not possible ever to ensure prosperity merely by law.\r\nSomething for good can be done by law, and a bad law can do an\r\ninfinity of mischief; but, after all, the best law can only prevent\r\nwrong and injustice, and give to the thrifty, the far-seeing, and the\r\nhard-working a chance to exercise to best advantage their special\r\nand peculiar abilities. No hard-and-fast rule can be laid down as to\r\nwhere our legislation shall stop in interfering between man and man,\r\nbetween interest and interest. All that can be said is that it is\r\nhighly undesirable, on the one hand, to weaken individual initiative,\r\nand, on the other hand, that in a constantly increasing number of cases\r\nwe shall find it necessary in the future to shackle cunning as in\r\nthe past we have shackled force. It is not only highly desirable but\r\nnecessary that there should be legislation which shall carefully shield\r\nthe interests of wage-workers, and which shall discriminate in favor\r\nof the honest and humane employer by removing the disadvantage under\r\nwhich he stands when compared with unscrupulous competitors who have no\r\nconscience and will do right only under fear of punishment.\r\n\r\nNor can legislation stop only with what are termed labor questions.\r\nThe vast individual and corporate fortunes, the vast combinations of\r\ncapital, which have marked the development of our industrial system,\r\ncreate new conditions and necessitate a change from the old attitude\r\nof the State and the nation toward property. It is probably true that\r\nthe large majority of the fortunes that now exist in this country have\r\nbeen amassed not by injuring our people, but as an incident to the\r\nconferring of great benefits upon the community; and this, no matter\r\nwhat may have been the conscious purpose of those amassing them. There\r\nis but the scantiest justification for most of the outcry against the\r\nmen of wealth _as such_; and it ought to be unnecessary to state that\r\nany appeal which directly or indirectly leads to suspicion and hatred\r\namong ourselves, which tends to limit opportunity, and therefore to\r\nshut the door of success against poor men of talent, and, finally,\r\nwhich entails the possibility of lawlessness and violence, is an attack\r\nupon the fundamental properties of American citizenship. Our interests\r\nare at bottom common; in the long run we go up or go down together.\r\nYet more and more it is evident that the State, and if necessary the\r\nNation, must possess the right of supervision and control as regards\r\nthe great corporations which are its creatures, particularly as regards\r\nthe great business combinations which derive a portion of their\r\nimportance from the existence of some monopolistic tendency. The right\r\nshould be exercised with caution and self-restraint; but it should\r\nexist, so that it may be invoked if the need arises.\r\n\r\nSo much for our duties, each to himself and each to his neighbor,\r\nwithin the limits of our own country. But our country, as it strides\r\nforward with ever-increasing rapidity to a foremost place among the\r\nworld powers, must necessarily find, more and more, that it has world\r\nduties also. There are excellent people who believe that we can shirk\r\nthese duties and yet retain our self-respect; but these good people are\r\nin error. Other good people seek to deter us from treading the path of\r\nhard but lofty duty by bidding us remember that all nations that have\r\nachieved greatness, that have expanded and played their part as world\r\npowers, have in the end passed away. So they have; and so have all\r\nothers. The weak and the stationary have vanished as surely as, and\r\nmore rapidly than, those whose citizens felt within them the lift that\r\nimpels generous souls to great and noble effort. This is only another\r\nway of stating the universal law of death, which is itself part of the\r\nuniversal law of life. The man who works, the man who does great deeds,\r\nin the end dies as surely as the veriest idler who cumbers the earth’s\r\nsurface; but he leaves behind him the great fact that he has done his\r\nwork well. So it is with nations. While the nation that has dared to be\r\ngreat, that has had the will and the power to change the destiny of\r\nthe ages, in the end must die, yet no less surely the nation that has\r\nplayed the part of the weakling must also die; and whereas the nation\r\nthat has done nothing leaves nothing behind it, the nation that has\r\ndone a great work really continues, though in changed form, to live\r\nfor evermore. The Roman has passed away exactly as all the nations of\r\nantiquity which did not expand when he expanded have passed away; but\r\ntheir very memory has vanished, while he himself is still a living\r\nforce throughout the wide world in our entire civilization of to-day,\r\nand will so continue through countless generations, through untold ages.\r\n\r\nIt is because we believe with all our heart and soul in the greatness\r\nof this country, because we feel the thrill of hardy life in our\r\nveins, and are confident that to us is given the privilege of playing\r\na leading part in the century that has just opened, that we hail with\r\neager delight the opportunity to do whatever task Providence may\r\nallot us. We admit with all sincerity that our first duty is within\r\nour own household; that we must not merely talk, but act, in favor of\r\ncleanliness and decency and righteousness, in all political, social,\r\nand civic matters. No prosperity and no glory can save a nation that\r\nis rotten at heart. We must ever keep the core of our national being\r\nsound, and see to it that not only our citizens in private life, but,\r\nabove all, our statesmen in public life, practice the old, commonplace\r\nvirtues which from time immemorial have lain at the root of all true\r\nnational well-being. Yet while this is our first duty, it is not our\r\nwhole duty. Exactly as each man, while doing first his duty to his wife\r\nand the children within his home, must yet, if he hopes to amount to\r\nmuch, strive mightily in the world outside his home, so our nation,\r\nwhile first of all seeing to its own domestic well-being, must not\r\nshrink from playing its part among the great nations without. Our\r\nduty may take many forms in the future as it has taken many forms in\r\nthe past. Nor is it possible to lay down a hard-and-fast rule for all\r\ncases. We must ever face the fact of our shifting national needs, of\r\nthe always-changing opportunities that present themselves. But we may\r\nbe certain of one thing: whether we wish it or not, we can not avoid\r\nhereafter having duties to do in the face of other nations. All that we\r\ncan do is to settle whether we shall perform these duties well or ill.\r\n\r\nRight here let me make as vigorous a plea as I know how in favor of\r\nsaying nothing that we do not mean, and of acting without hesitation up\r\nto whatever we say. A good many of you are probably acquainted with the\r\nold proverb: “Speak softly and carry a big stick—you will go far.” If\r\na man continually blusters, if he lacks civility, a big stick will not\r\nsave him from trouble; and neither will speaking softly avail, if back\r\nof the softness there does not lie strength, power. In private life\r\nthere are few beings more obnoxious than the man who is always loudly\r\nboasting; and if the boaster is not prepared to back up his words his\r\nposition becomes absolutely contemptible. So it is with the nation. It\r\nis both foolish and undignified to indulge in undue self-glorification,\r\nand, above all, in loose-tongued denunciation of other peoples.\r\nWhenever on any point we come in contact with a foreign power, I hope\r\nthat we shall always strive to speak courteously and respectfully\r\nof that foreign power. Let us make it evident that we intend to do\r\njustice. Then let us make it equally evident that we will not tolerate\r\ninjustice being done to us in return. Let us further make it evident\r\nthat we use no words which we are not prepared to back up with deeds,\r\nand that while our speech is always moderate, we are ready and willing\r\nto make it good. Such an attitude will be the surest possible guarantee\r\nof that self-respecting peace, the attainment of which is and must ever\r\nbe the prime aim of a self-governing people.\r\n\r\nThis is the attitude we should take as regards the Monroe Doctrine.\r\nThere is not the least need of blustering about it. Still less should\r\nit be used as a pretext for our own aggrandizement at the expense of\r\nany other American state. But, most emphatically, we must make it\r\nevident that we intend on this point ever to maintain the old American\r\nposition. Indeed, it is hard to understand how any man can take any\r\nother position, now that we are all looking forward to the building\r\nof the Isthmian Canal. The Monroe Doctrine is not international law;\r\nbut there is no necessity that it should be. All that is needful is\r\nthat it should continue to be a cardinal feature of American policy\r\non this continent; and the Spanish-American states should, in their\r\nown interests, champion it as strongly as we do. We do not by this\r\ndoctrine intend to sanction any policy of aggression by one American\r\ncommonwealth at the expense of any other, nor any policy of commercial\r\ndiscrimination against any foreign power whatsoever. Commercially, as\r\nfar as this doctrine is concerned, all we wish is a fair field and no\r\nfavor; but if we are wise we shall strenuously insist that under no\r\npretext whatsoever shall there be any territorial aggrandizement on\r\nAmerican soil by any European power, and this, no matter what form the\r\nterritorial aggrandizement may take.\r\n\r\nWe most earnestly hope and believe that the chance of our having any\r\nhostile military complication with any foreign power is very small. But\r\nthat there will come a strain, a jar, here and there, from commercial\r\nand agricultural—that is, from industrial—competition, is almost\r\ninevitable. Here again we must remember that our first duty is to our\r\nown people, and yet that we can best get justice by doing justice. We\r\nmust continue the policy that has been so brilliantly successful in\r\nthe past, and so shape our economic system as to give every advantage\r\nto the skill, energy, and intelligence of our farmers, merchants,\r\nmanufacturers, and wage-workers; and yet we must also remember, in\r\ndealing with other nations, that benefits must be given where benefits\r\nare sought. It is not possible to dogmatize as to the exact way of\r\nattaining this end, for the exact conditions can not be foretold. In\r\nthe long run, one of our prime needs is stability and continuity of\r\neconomic policy; and yet, through treaty or by direct legislation, it\r\nmay, at least in certain cases, become advantageous to supplement our\r\npresent policy by a system of reciprocal benefit and obligation.\r\n\r\nThroughout a large part of our national career our history has been\r\none of expansion, the expansion being of different kinds at different\r\ntimes. This expansion is not a matter of regret, but of pride. It\r\nis vain to tell a people as masterful as ours that the spirit of\r\nenterprise is not safe. The true American has never feared to run risks\r\nwhen the prize to be won was of sufficient value. No nation capable\r\nof self-government, and of developing by its own efforts a sane and\r\norderly civilization, no matter how small it may be, has anything to\r\nfear from us. Our dealings with Cuba illustrate this, and should be\r\nforever a subject of just national pride. We speak in no spirit of\r\narrogance when we state as a simple historic fact that never in recent\r\ntimes has any great nation acted with such disinterestedness as we\r\nhave shown in Cuba. We freed the island from the Spanish yoke. We then\r\nearnestly did our best to help the Cubans in the establishment of free\r\neducation, of law and order, of material prosperity, of the cleanliness\r\nnecessary to sanitary well-being in their great cities. We did all\r\nthis at great expense of treasure, at some expense of life; and now\r\nwe are establishing them in a free and independent commonwealth, and\r\nhave asked in return nothing whatever save that at no time shall their\r\nindependence be prostituted to the advantage of some foreign rival of\r\nours, or so as to menace our well-being. To have failed to ask this\r\nwould have amounted to national stultification on our part.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines we have brought peace, and we are at this moment\r\ngiving them such freedom and self-government as they could never under\r\nany conceivable conditions have obtained had we turned them loose to\r\nsink into a welter of blood and confusion, or to become the prey of\r\nsome strong tyranny without or within. The bare recital of the facts\r\nis sufficient to show that we did our duty; and what prouder title\r\nto honor can a nation have than to have done its duty? We have done\r\nour duty ourselves, and we have done the higher duty of promoting\r\nthe civilization of mankind. The first essential of civilization is\r\nlaw. Anarchy is simply the handmaiden and forerunner of tyranny and\r\ndespotism. Law and order enforced with justice and by strength lie\r\nat the foundations of civilization. Law must be based upon justice,\r\nelse it can not stand, and it must be enforced with resolute firmness,\r\nbecause weakness in enforcing it means in the end that there is no\r\njustice and no law, nothing but the rule of disorderly and unscrupulous\r\nstrength. Without the habit of orderly obedience to the law, without\r\nthe stern enforcement of the laws at the expense of those who defiantly\r\nresist them, there can be no possible progress, moral or material,\r\nin civilization. There can be no weakening of the law-abiding spirit\r\nhere at home, if we are permanently to succeed; and just as little can\r\nwe afford to show weakness abroad. Lawlessness and anarchy were put\r\ndown in the Philippines as a prerequisite to introducing the reign of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nBarbarism has, and can have, no place in a civilized world. It is our\r\nduty toward the people living in barbarism to see that they are freed\r\nfrom their chains, and we can free them only by destroying barbarism\r\nitself. The missionary, the merchant, and the soldier may each have\r\nto play a part in this destruction, and in the consequent uplifting\r\nof the people. Exactly as it is the duty of a civilized power\r\nscrupulously to respect the rights of all weaker civilized powers and\r\ngladly to help those who are struggling toward civilization, so it is\r\nits duty to put down savagery and barbarism. As in such a work human\r\ninstruments must be used, and as human instruments are imperfect, this\r\nmeans that at times there will be injustice; that at times merchant or\r\nsoldier, or even missionary, may do wrong. Let us instantly condemn\r\nand rectify such wrong when it occurs, and if possible punish the\r\nwrongdoer. But shame, thrice shame to us, if we are so foolish as to\r\nmake such occasional wrongdoing an excuse for failing to perform a\r\ngreat and righteous task. Not only in our own land, but throughout the\r\nworld, throughout all history, the advance of civilization has been of\r\nincalculable benefit to mankind, and those through whom it has advanced\r\ndeserve the highest honor. All honor to the missionary, all honor to\r\nthe soldier, all honor to the merchant who now in our own day have done\r\nso much to bring light into the world’s dark places.\r\n\r\nLet me insist again, for fear of possible misconstruction, upon the\r\nfact that our duty is twofold, and that we must raise others while\r\nwe are benefiting ourselves. In bringing order to the Philippines,\r\nour soldiers added a new page to the honor-roll of American history,\r\nand they incalculably benefited the islanders themselves. Under the\r\nwise administration of Governor Taft the islands now enjoy a peace\r\nand liberty of which they have hitherto never even dreamed. But this\r\npeace and liberty under the law must be supplemented by material, by\r\nindustrial development. Every encouragement should be given to their\r\ncommercial development, to the introduction of American industries and\r\nproducts; not merely because this will be a good thing for our people,\r\nbut infinitely more because it will be of incalculable benefit to the\r\npeople in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nWe shall make mistakes; and if we let these mistakes frighten us\r\nfrom our work we shall show ourselves weaklings. Half a century\r\nago Minnesota and the two Dakotas were Indian hunting-grounds. We\r\ncommitted plenty of blunders, and now and then worse than blunders, in\r\nour dealings with the Indians. But who does not admit at the present\r\nday that we were right in wresting from barbarism and adding to\r\ncivilization the territory out of which we have made these beautiful\r\nStates? And now we are civilizing the Indian and putting him on a level\r\nto which he could never have attained under the old conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines let us remember that the spirit and not the\r\nmere form of government is the essential matter. The Tagalogs have\r\na hundredfold the freedom under us that they would have if we had\r\nabandoned the islands. We are not trying to subjugate a people; we\r\nare trying to develop them and make them a law-abiding, industrious,\r\nand educated people, and we hope ultimately a self-governing people.\r\nIn short, in the work we have done we are but carrying out the true\r\nprinciples of our democracy. We work in a spirit of self-respect for\r\nourselves and of good-will toward others, in a spirit of love for and\r\nof infinite faith in mankind. We do not blindly refuse to face the\r\nevils that exist, or the shortcomings inherent in humanity; but across\r\nblundering and shirking, across selfishness and meanness of motive,\r\nacross short-sightedness and cowardice, we gaze steadfastly toward the\r\nfar horizon of golden triumph. If you will study our past history as\r\na nation you will see we have made many blunders and have been guilty\r\nof many shortcomings, and yet that we have always in the end come\r\nout victorious because we have refused to be daunted by blunders and\r\ndefeats, have recognized them, but have persevered in spite of them.\r\nSo it must be in the future. We gird up our loins as a nation, with\r\nthe stern purpose to play our part manfully in winning the ultimate\r\ntriumph; and therefore we turn scornfully aside from the paths of mere\r\nease and idleness, and with unfaltering steps tread the rough road of\r\nendeavor, smiting down and battling for the right, as Greatheart smote\r\nand battled in Bunyan’s immortal story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LABOR QUESTION\r\n\r\nAT THE CHICAGO LABOR DAY PICNIC, SEPT. 3, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest problem, the most far-reaching in its stupendous\r\nimportance, is that problem, or rather that group of problems, which\r\nwe have grown to speak of as the labor question. It must be always a\r\npeculiar privilege for any thoughtful public man to address a body of\r\nmen predominantly composed of wage-workers, for the foundation of our\r\nwhole social structure rests upon the material and moral well-being,\r\nthe intelligence, the foresight, the sanity, the sense of duty, and\r\nthe wholesome patriotism of the wage-worker. This is doubly the case\r\nnow; for, in addition to each man’s individual action, you have learned\r\nthe great lesson of acting in combination. It would be impossible to\r\noverestimate the far-reaching influences of, and, on the whole, the\r\namount of good done through your associations.\r\n\r\nIn addressing you, the one thing that I wish to avoid is any mere\r\nglittering generality, any mere high-sounding phraseology, and, above\r\nall, any appeal whatsoever made in a demagogic spirit, or in a spirit\r\nof mere emotionalism. When we come to dealing with our social and\r\nindustrial needs, remedies, rights and wrongs, a ton of oratory is not\r\nworth an ounce of hard-headed, kindly common-sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fundamental law of healthy political life in this great Republic\r\nis that each man shall in deed, and not merely in word, be treated\r\nstrictly on his worth as a man; that each shall do full justice to his\r\nfellow, and in return shall exact full justice from him. Each group\r\nof men has its special interests; and yet the higher, the broader and\r\ndeeper interests are those which apply to all men alike; for the spirit\r\nof brotherhood in American citizenship, when rightly understood and\r\nrightly applied, is more important than aught else. Let us scrupulously\r\nguard the special interests of the wage-worker, the farmer, the\r\nmanufacturer, and the merchant, giving to each man his due and also\r\nseeing that he does not wrong his fellows; but let us keep ever clearly\r\nbefore our minds the great fact that, where the deepest chords are\r\ntouched, the interests of all are alike and must be guarded alike.\r\n\r\nWe must beware of any attempt to make hatred in any form the basis\r\nof action. Most emphatically each of us needs to stand up for his\r\nown rights; all men and all groups of men are bound to retain their\r\nself-respect, and, demanding this same respect from others, to see\r\nthat they are not injured and that they have secured to them the\r\nfullest liberty of thought and action. But to feed fat a grudge against\r\nothers, while it may or may not harm them, is sure in the long run to\r\ndo infinitely greater harm to the man himself.\r\n\r\nThe more a healthy American sees of his fellow-Americans the greater\r\ngrows his conviction that our chief troubles come from mutual\r\nmisunderstanding, from failure to appreciate one another’s point of\r\nview. In other words, the great need is fellow-feeling, sympathy,\r\nbrotherhood; and all this naturally comes by association. It is,\r\ntherefore, of vital importance that there should be such association.\r\nThe most serious disadvantage in city life is the tendency of each\r\nman to keep isolated in his own little set, and to look upon the\r\nvast majority of his fellow-citizens indifferently, so that he soon\r\ncomes to forget that they have the same red blood, the same loves and\r\nhates, the same likes and dislikes, the same desire for good, and the\r\nsame perpetual tendency, ever needing to be checked and corrected, to\r\nlapse from good into evil. If only our people can be thrown together,\r\nwhere they act on a common ground with the same motives, and have the\r\nsame objects, we need not have much fear of their failing to acquire\r\na genuine respect for one another; and with such respect there must\r\nfinally come fair play for all.\r\n\r\nThe first time I ever labored alongside of and got thrown into intimate\r\ncompanionship with men who were mighty men of their hands was in the\r\ncattle country of the Northwest. I soon grew to have an immense liking\r\nand respect for my associates, and as I knew them, and did not know\r\nsimilar workers in other parts of the country, it seemed to me that the\r\nranch-owner was a great deal better than any Eastern business man, and\r\nthat the cowpuncher stood on a corresponding altitude compared with any\r\nof his brethren in the East.\r\n\r\nWell, after a little while I was thrown into close relations with the\r\nfarmers, and it did not take long before I had moved them up alongside\r\nof my beloved cowmen; and I made up my mind that _they_ really formed\r\nthe backbone of the land. Then, because of certain circumstances, I was\r\nthrown into intimate contact with railroad men, and I gradually came to\r\nthe conclusion that these railroad men were about the finest citizens\r\nthere were anywhere around. Then, in the course of some official work,\r\nI was thrown into close contact with a number of the carpenters,\r\nblacksmiths, and men in the building trades, that is, skilled mechanics\r\nof a high order, and it was not long before I had them on the same\r\npedestal with the others. By that time it began to dawn on me that the\r\ndifference was not in the men but in my own point of view, and that\r\nif any man is thrown into close contact with any large body of our\r\nfellow-citizens it is apt to be the man’s own fault if he does not grow\r\nto feel for them a very hearty regard and, moreover, grow to understand\r\nthat, on the great questions that lie at the root of human well-being,\r\nhe and they feel alike.\r\n\r\nOur prime need as a nation is that every American should understand and\r\nwork with his fellow-citizens, getting into touch with them, so that\r\nby actual contact he may learn that fundamentally he and they have the\r\nsame interests, needs, and aspirations.\r\n\r\nOf course different sections of the community have different needs. The\r\ngravest questions that are before us, the questions that are for all\r\ntime, affect us all alike. But there are separate needs that affect\r\nseparate groups of men, just as there are separate needs that affect\r\neach individual man. It is just as unwise to forget the one fact as it\r\nis to forget the other. The specialization of our modern industrial\r\nlife, its high development and complex character, means a corresponding\r\nspecialization in needs and interests. While we should, so long as we\r\ncan safely do so, give to each individual the largest possible liberty,\r\na liberty which necessarily includes initiative and responsibility, yet\r\nwe must not hesitate to interfere whenever it is clearly seen that harm\r\ncomes from excessive individualism. We can not afford to be empirical\r\none way or the other. In the country districts the surroundings are\r\nsuch that a man can usually work out his own fate by himself to the\r\nbest advantage. In our cities, or where men congregate in masses, it is\r\noften necessary to work in combination, that is, through associations;\r\nand here it is that we can see the great good conferred by labor\r\norganizations, by trade-unions. Of course, if managed unwisely, the\r\nvery power of such a union or organization makes it capable of doing\r\nmuch harm; but, on the whole, it would be hard to overestimate the\r\ngood these organizations have done in the past, and still harder to\r\nestimate the good they can do in the future if handled with resolution,\r\nforethought, honesty, and sanity.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to lay down a hard-and-fast rule, logically perfect,\r\nas to when the State shall interfere, and when the individual must be\r\nleft unhampered and unhelped.\r\n\r\nWe have exactly the same right to regulate the conditions of life\r\nand work in factories and tenement-houses that we have to regulate\r\nfire-escapes and the like in other houses. In certain communities the\r\nexistence of a thoroughly efficient department of factory inspection is\r\njust as essential as the establishment of a fire department. How far\r\nwe shall go in regulating the hours of labor, or the liabilities of\r\nemployers, is a matter of expediency, and each case must be determined\r\non its own merits, exactly as it is a matter of expediency to\r\ndetermine what so-called “public utilities” the community shall itself\r\nown and what ones it shall leave to private or corporate ownership,\r\nsecuring to itself merely the right to regulate. Sometimes one course\r\nis expedient, sometimes the other.\r\n\r\nIn my own State during the last half-dozen years we have made a number\r\nof notable strides in labor legislation, and, with very few exceptions,\r\nthe laws have worked well. This is, of course, partly because we have\r\nnot tried to do too much and have proceeded cautiously, feeling our\r\nway, and, while always advancing, yet taking each step in advance only\r\nwhen we were satisfied that the step already taken was in the right\r\ndirection. To invite reaction by unregulated zeal is never wise, and is\r\nsometimes fatal.\r\n\r\nIn New York our action has been along two lines. In the first place,\r\nwe determined that as an employer of labor the State should set a good\r\nexample to other employers. We do not intend to permit the people’s\r\nmoney to be squandered or to tolerate any work that is not the best.\r\nBut we think that, while rigidly insisting upon good work, we should\r\nsee that there is fair play in return. Accordingly, we have adopted\r\nan eight-hour law for the State employees and for all contractors\r\nwho do State work, and we have also adopted a law requiring that the\r\nfair market rate of wages shall be given. I am glad to say that both\r\nmeasures have so far, on the whole, worked well. Of course there have\r\nbeen individual difficulties, mostly where the work is intermittent,\r\nas, for instance, among lock-tenders on the canals, where it is\r\nvery difficult to define what eight hours’ work means. But, on the\r\nwhole, the result has been good. The practical experiment of working\r\nmen for eight hours has been advantageous to the State. Poor work\r\nis always dear, whether poorly paid or not, and good work is always\r\nwell worth having; and as a mere question of expediency, aside even\r\nfrom the question of humanity, we find that we can obtain the best\r\nwork by paying fair wages and permitting the work to go on only for a\r\nreasonable time.\r\n\r\nThe other side of our labor legislation has been that affecting the\r\nwage-workers who do not work for the State. Here we have acted in\r\nthree different ways: through the Bureau of Labor Statistics, through\r\nthe Board of Mediation and Arbitration, and through the Department of\r\nFactory Inspection.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two years the Board of Mediation and Arbitration have\r\nbeen especially successful. Not only have they succeeded in settling\r\nmany strikes after they were started, but they have succeeded in\r\npreventing a much larger number of strikes before they got fairly under\r\nway. Where possible it is always better to mediate before the strike\r\nbegins than to try to arbitrate when the fight is on and both sides\r\nhave grown stubborn and bitter.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics has done more than merely gather the\r\nstatistics, for by keeping in close touch with all the leading labor\r\ninterests it has kept them informed on countless matters that were\r\nreally of vital concern to them. Incidentally, one pleasing feature\r\nof the work of this bureau has been the steady upward tendency shown\r\nduring the last four, years both in amount of wages received and in the\r\nquantity and steadiness of employment. No other man has benefited so\r\nmuch as the wage-worker by the growth in prosperity during these years.\r\n\r\nThe Factory Inspection Department deals chiefly, of course, with\r\nconditions in great cities. One very important phase of its work during\r\nthe last two years has been the enforcement of the anti-sweatshop\r\nlaw, which is primarily designed to do away with the tenement-house\r\nfactory. The conditions of life in some of the congested tenement-house\r\ndistricts, notably in New York City, had become such as to demand\r\naction by the State. As with other reforms, in order to make it stable\r\nand permanent, it had to be gradual. It proceeded by evolution, not\r\nrevolution. But progress has been steady, and wherever needed it\r\nhas been radical. Much remains to be done, but the condition of the\r\ndwellers in the congested districts has been markedly improved, to the\r\ngreat benefit not only of themselves, but of the whole community.\r\n\r\nA word on the general question. In the first place, in addressing an\r\naudience like this I do not have to say that the law of life is work,\r\nand that work in itself, so far from being a hardship, is a great\r\nblessing, provided, always, it is carried on under conditions which\r\npreserve a man’s self-respect and which allow him to develop his own\r\ncharacter and rear his children so that he and they, as well as the\r\nwhole community of which he and they are part, may steadily move\r\nonward and upward. The idler, rich or poor, is at best a useless and\r\nis generally a noxious member of the community. To whom much has been\r\ngiven, from him much is rightfully expected, and a heavy burden of\r\nresponsibility rests upon the man of means to justify by his actions\r\nthe social conditions which have rendered it possible for him or his\r\nforefathers to accumulate and to keep the property he enjoys. He is\r\nnot to be excused if he does not render full measure of service to the\r\nState and to the community at large. There are many ways in which this\r\nservice can be rendered,—in art, in literature, in philanthropy, as\r\na statesman, as a solider,—but in some way he is in honor bound to\r\nrender it, so that benefit may accrue to his brethren who have been\r\nless favored by fortune than he has been. In short, he must work, and\r\nwork not only for himself, but for others. If he does not work, he\r\nfails not only in his duty to the rest of the community, but he fails\r\nsignally in his duty to himself. There is no need of envying the idle.\r\nOrdinarily, we can afford to treat them with impatient contempt; for\r\nwhen they fail to do their duty they fail to get from life the highest\r\nand keenest pleasure that life can give.\r\n\r\nTo do our duty—that is the summing up of the whole matter. We must do\r\nour duty by ourselves and we must do our duty by our neighbors. Every\r\ngood citizen, whatever his condition, owes his first service to those\r\nwho are nearest to him, who are dependent upon him, to his wife, and\r\nhis children; next he owes his duty to his fellow-citizens, and this\r\nduty he must perform both to his individual neighbor and to the State,\r\nwhich is simply a form of expression for all his neighbors combined.\r\nHe must keep his self-respect and exact the respect of others. It is\r\neminently wise and proper to strive for such leisure in our lives as\r\nwill give a chance for self-improvement; but woe to the man who seeks,\r\nor trains up his children to seek, idleness instead of the chance to\r\ndo good work. No worse wrong can be done by a man to his children than\r\nto teach them to go through life endeavoring to shirk difficulties\r\ninstead of meeting them and overcoming them. You men here in the West\r\nhave built up this country not by seeking to avoid work, but by doing\r\nit well; not by flinching from every difficulty, but by triumphing\r\nover each as it arose and making out of it a stepping-stone to further\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nWe must all learn the two lessons—the lesson of self-help and the\r\nlesson of giving help to and receiving help from our brother. There is\r\nnot a man of us who does not sometimes slip, who does not sometimes\r\nneed a helping hand; and woe to him who, when the chance comes, fails\r\nto stretch out that helping hand. Yet, though each man can and ought\r\nthus to be helped at times, he is lost beyond redemption if he becomes\r\nso dependent upon outside help that he feels that his own exertions\r\nare secondary. Any man at times will stumble, and it is then our\r\nduty to lift him up and set him on his feet again; but no man can be\r\npermanently carried, for if he expects to be carried he shows that he\r\nis not worth carrying.\r\n\r\nBefore us loom industrial problems vast in their importance and their\r\ncomplexity. The last half-century has been one of extraordinary social\r\nand industrial development. The changes have been far-reaching; some\r\nof them for good, and some of them for evil. It is not given to the\r\nwisest of us to see into the future with absolute clearness. No man can\r\nbe certain that he has found the entire solution of this infinitely\r\ngreat and intricate problem, and yet each man of us, if he would do\r\nhis duty, must strive manfully so far as in him lies to help bring\r\nabout that solution. It is not as yet possible to say what shall be the\r\nexact limit of influence allowed the State, or what limit shall be set\r\nto that right of individual initiative so dear to the hearts of the\r\nAmerican people. All we can say is that the need has been shown on the\r\none hand for action by the people, in their collective capacity through\r\nthe State, in many matters; that in other matters much can be done by\r\nassociations of different groups of individuals, as in trade-unions\r\nand similar organizations; and that in other matters it remains now as\r\ntrue as ever that final success will be for the man who trusts in the\r\nstruggle only to his cool, head, his brave heart, and his strong right\r\narm. There are spheres in which the State can properly act, and spheres\r\nin which a free field must be given to individual initiative.\r\n\r\nThough the conditions of life have grown so puzzling in their\r\ncomplexity, though the changes have been so vast, yet we may remain\r\nabsolutely sure of one thing, that now, as ever in the past, and as\r\nit ever will be in the future, there can be no substitute for the\r\nelemental virtues, for the elemental qualities to which we allude\r\nwhen we speak of a man as not only a good man but as emphatically\r\na man. We can build up the standard of individual citizenship and\r\nindividual well-being, we can raise the national standard and make it\r\nwhat it can and shall be made, only by each of us steadfastly keeping\r\nin mind that there can be no substitute for the world-old, humdrum,\r\ncommonplace qualities of truth, justice and courage, thrift, industry,\r\ncommon-sense, and genuine sympathy with and fellow-feeling for others.\r\nThe nation is the aggregate of the individuals composing it, and each\r\nindividual American ever raises the nation higher when he so conducts\r\nhimself as to wrong no man, to suffer no wrong from others, and to show\r\nboth his sturdy capacity for self-help and his readiness to extend a\r\nhelping hand to the neighbor sinking under a burden too heavy for him\r\nto bear.\r\n\r\nThe one fact which all of us need to keep steadfastly before our eyes\r\nis the need that performance should square with promise if good work\r\nis to be done, whether in the industrial or in the political world.\r\nNothing does more to promote mental dishonesty and moral insincerity\r\nthan the habit either of promising the impossible, or of demanding the\r\nperformance of the impossible, or finally, of failing to keep a promise\r\nthat has been made; and it makes not the slightest difference whether\r\nit is a promise made on the stump or off the stump. Remember that there\r\nare two sides to the wrong thus committed. There is, first, the wrong\r\nof failing to keep a promise made, and, in the next place, there is the\r\nwrong of demanding the impossible, and therefore forcing or permitting\r\nweak or unscrupulous men to make a promise which they either know, or\r\nshould know, can not be kept. No small part of our troubles in dealing\r\nwith many of the gravest social questions, such as the so-called labor\r\nquestion, the trust question, and others like them, arises from these\r\ntwo attitudes. We can do a great deal when we undertake, soberly, to do\r\nthe possible. When we undertake the impossible, we too often fail to do\r\nanything at all. The success of the law for the taxation of franchises\r\nrecently enacted in New York State, a measure which has resulted in\r\nputting upon the assessment books nearly $200,000,000 worth of property\r\nwhich had theretofore escaped taxation, is an illustration of how much\r\ncan be accomplished when effort is made along sane and sober lines,\r\nwith care not to promise the impossible but to make performance square\r\nwith promise, and with insistence on the fact that honesty is never\r\none-sided, and that in dealing with corporations it is necessary\r\nboth to do to them and to exact from them full and complete justice.\r\nThe success of this effort, made in a resolute but also a temperate\r\nand reasonable spirit, shows what can be done when such a problem\r\nis approached in a sound and healthy manner. It offers a striking\r\ncontrast to the complete breakdown of the species of crude and violent\r\nanti-trust legislation which has been so often attempted, and which has\r\nalways failed, because of its very crudeness and violence, to make any\r\nimpression upon the real and dangerous evils which have excited such\r\njust popular resentment.\r\n\r\nI thank you for listening to me. I have come here to-day not to preach\r\nto you, but partly to tell you how these matters look and seem to me,\r\nand partly to set forth certain facts which seem to me to show the\r\nessential community that there is among all of us who strive in good\r\nfaith to do our duty as American citizens. No man can do his duty who\r\ndoes not work, and the work may take many different shapes, mental\r\nand physical; but of this you can rest assured, that this work can be\r\ndone well for the nation only when each of us approaches his separate\r\ntask, not only with the determination to do it, but with the knowledge\r\nthat his fellow, when he in his turn does his task, has fundamentally\r\nthe same rights and the same duties, and that while each must work for\r\nhimself, yet each must also work for the common welfare of all.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we shall all go up or go down together. Some may go up\r\nor go down further than others, but, disregarding special exceptions,\r\nthe rule is that we must all share in common something of whatever\r\nadversity or whatever prosperity is in store for the nation as a whole.\r\nIn the long run each section of the community will rise or fall as the\r\ncommunity rises or falls. If hard times come to the nation, whether\r\nas the result of natural causes or because they are invited by our\r\nown folly, all of us will suffer. Certain of us will suffer more, and\r\nothers less, but all will suffer somewhat. If, on the other hand, under\r\nProvidence, our own energy and good sense bring prosperity to us,\r\nall will share in that prosperity. We will not all share alike, but\r\nsomething each one of us will get. Let us strive to make the conditions\r\nof life such that as nearly as possible each man shall receive the\r\nshare to which he is honestly entitled and no more; and let us remember\r\nat the same time that our efforts must be to build up, rather than to\r\nstrike down, and that we can best help ourselves, not at the expense of\r\nothers, but by heartily working with them for the common good of each\r\nand all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN CITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\nADDRESS BEFORE THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, CARNEGIE HALL,\r\nNEW YORK, DECEMBER 30, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar pleasure to me to come before you to-night to greet\r\nyou and to bear testimony to the great good that has been done by these\r\nYoung Men’s and Young Women’s Christian Associations throughout the\r\nUnited States. More and more we are getting to recognize the law of\r\ncombination. This is true of many phases in our industrial life, and it\r\nis equally true of the world of philanthropic effort. Nowhere is it,\r\nor will it ever be, possible to supplant individual effort, individual\r\ninitiative; but in addition to this there must be work in combination.\r\nMore and more this is recognized as true not only in charitable work\r\nproper, but in that best form of philanthropic endeavor where we all do\r\ngood to ourselves by all joining together to do good to one another.\r\nThis is exactly what is done in your associations.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that there are several reasons why you are entitled to\r\nespecial recognition from all who are interested in the betterment of\r\nour American social system. First and foremost, your organization\r\nrecognizes the vital need of brotherhood, the most vital of all our\r\nneeds here in this great Republic. The existence of a Young Men’s or\r\nYoung Women’s Christian Association is certain proof that some people\r\nat least recognize in practical shape the identity of aspiration and\r\ninterest, both in things material and in things higher, which with us\r\nmust be widespread through the masses of our people if our national\r\nlife is to attain full development. This spirit of brotherhood\r\nrecognizes of necessity both the need of self-help and also the need\r\nof helping others in the only way which ever ultimately does great\r\ngood, that is, of helping them to help themselves. Every man of us\r\nneeds such help at some time or other, and each of us should be glad\r\nto stretch out his hand to a brother who stumbles. But while every man\r\nneeds at times to be lifted up when he stumbles, no man can afford to\r\nlet himself be carried, and it is worth no man’s while to try thus to\r\ncarry some one else. The man who lies down, who will not try to walk,\r\nhas become a mere cumberer of the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nThese Associations of yours try to make men self-helpful and to help\r\nthem when they are self-helpful. They do not try merely to carry them,\r\nto benefit them for the moment at the cost of their future undoing.\r\nThis means that all in any way connected with them not merely retain\r\nbut increase their self-respect. Any man who takes part in the work\r\nof such an organization is benefited to some extent and benefits the\r\ncommunity to some extent—of course, always with the proviso that the\r\norganization is well managed and is run on a business basis, as well as\r\nwith a philanthropic purpose.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of brotherhood is necessarily as remote from a patronizing\r\nspirit, on the one hand, as from a spirit of envy and malice, on the\r\nother. The best work for our uplifting must be done by ourselves,\r\nand yet with brotherly kindness for our neighbor. In such work, and\r\ntherefore in the kind of work done by the Young Men’s Christian\r\nAssociations, we all stand on the self-respecting basis of mutual\r\nbenefit and common effort. All of us who take part in any such work,\r\nin whatever measure, both receive and confer benefits. This is true of\r\nthe founder and giver, and it is no less true of every man who takes\r\nadvantage of what the founder and giver have done. These bodies make us\r\nall realize how much we have in common, and how much we can do when we\r\nwork in common. I doubt if it is possible to overestimate the good done\r\nby the mere fact of association with a common interest and for a common\r\nend, and when the common interest is high and the common end peculiarly\r\nworthy, the good done is of course many times increased.\r\n\r\nBesides developing this sense of brotherhood, the feeling which breeds\r\nrespect both for one’s self and for others, your Associations have a\r\npeculiar value in showing what can be done by acting in combination\r\nwithout aid from the State. While on the one hand it has become\r\nevident that under the conditions of modern life we can not allow an\r\nunlimited individualism which may work harm to the community, it is no\r\nless evident that the sphere of the State’s action should be extended\r\nvery cautiously, and so far as possible only where it will not crush\r\nout healthy individual initiative. Voluntary action by individuals\r\nin the form of associations of any kind for mutual betterment or\r\nmutual advantage often offers a way to avoid alike the dangers of\r\nState control and the dangers of excessive individualism. This is\r\nparticularly true of efforts for that most important of all forms of\r\nbetterment, moral betterment—the moral betterment which usually brings\r\nmaterial betterment in its train.\r\n\r\nIt is only in this way, by all of us working together in a spirit of\r\nbrotherhood, by each doing his part for the betterment of himself and\r\nof others, that it is possible for us to solve the tremendous problems\r\nwith which as a nation we are now confronted. Our industrial life\r\nhas become so complex, its rate of movement so very rapid, and the\r\nspecialization and differentiation so intense that we find ourselves\r\nface to face with conditions that were practically unknown in this\r\nnation half a century ago. The power of the forces of evil has been\r\ngreatly increased, and it is necessary for our self-preservation that\r\nwe should similarly strengthen the forces for good. We are all of us\r\nbound to work toward this end. No one of us can do everything, but each\r\nof us can do something, and if we work together the aggregate of these\r\nsomethings will be very considerable.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, a thousand different ways in which the work can\r\nbe done, and each man must choose as his tastes and his powers bid\r\nhim, if he is to do the best of which he is capable. But all the kinds\r\nof work must be carried along on certain definite lines if good is to\r\ncome. All the work must be attempted as on the whole this Young Men’s\r\nChristian Association work has been done, that is, in a spirit of good\r\nwill toward all and not of hatred toward some; in a spirit in which to\r\nbroad charity for mankind there is added a keen and healthy sanity of\r\nmind. We must retain our self-respect, each and all of us, and we must\r\nbeware alike of mushy sentimentality and of envy and hatred.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be necessary for me to warn you against mere\r\nsentimentality, against the philanthropy and charity which are not\r\nmerely insufficient but harmful. It is eminently desirable that we\r\nshould none of us be hard-hearted, but it is no less desirable that\r\nwe should not be soft-headed. I really do not know which quality is\r\nmost productive of evil to mankind in the long run, hardness of heart\r\nor softness of head. Naked charity is not what we permanently want.\r\nThere are of course certain classes, such as young children, widows\r\nwith large families, or crippled or very aged people, or even strong\r\nmen temporarily crushed by stunning misfortune, on whose behalf we\r\nmay have to make a frank and direct appeal to charity, and who can be\r\nthe recipients of it without any loss of self-respect. But taking us\r\nas a whole, taking the mass of Americans, we do not want charity, we\r\ndo not want sentimentality; we merely want to learn how to act both\r\nindividually and together in such fashion as to enable us to hold our\r\nown in the world, to do good to others according to the measure of our\r\nopportunities, and to receive good from others in ways which will not\r\nentail on our part any loss of self-respect.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be unnecessary to say that any man who tries to solve the\r\ngreat problems that confront us by an appeal to anger and passion, to\r\nignorance and folly, to malice and envy, is not, and never can be,\r\naught but an enemy of the very people he professes to befriend. In the\r\nwords of Lowell, it is far safer to adopt “All men up” than “Some men\r\ndown” for a motto. Speaking broadly, we can not in the long run benefit\r\none man by the downfall of another. Our energies, as a rule, can be\r\nemployed to much better advantage in uplifting some than in pulling\r\ndown others. Of course there must sometimes be pulling down, too. We\r\nhave no business to blink evils, and where it is necessary that the\r\nknife should be used, let it be used unsparingly, but let it be used\r\nintelligently. When there is need of a drastic remedy, apply it, but do\r\nnot apply it in the spirit of hate. Normally a pound of construction is\r\nworth a ton of destruction.\r\n\r\nThere is degradation to us if we feel envy and malice and hatred toward\r\nour neighbor for any cause; and if we envy him merely his riches, we\r\nshow we have ourselves low ideals. Money is a good thing. It is a\r\nfoolish affectation to deny it. But it is not the only good thing,\r\nand after a certain amount has been amassed it ceases to be the chief\r\neven of material good things. It is far better, for instance, to do\r\nwell a bit of work which is well worth doing, than to have a large\r\nfortune. I do not care whether this work is that of an engineer on a\r\ngreat railroad, or captain of a fishing-boat, or foreman in a factory\r\nor machine-shop, or section boss, or division chief, or assistant\r\nastronomer in an observatory, or a second lieutenant somewhere in China\r\nor the Philippines—each has an important piece of work to do, and if\r\nhe is really interested in it, and has the right stuff in him, he will\r\nbe altogether too proud of what he is doing, and too intent on doing\r\nit well, to waste his time in envying others.\r\n\r\nFrom the days when the chosen people received the Decalogue to our own,\r\nenvy and malice have been recognized as evils, and woe to those who\r\nappeal to them. To break the Tenth Commandment is no more moral now\r\nthan it has been for the past thirty centuries. The vice of envy is not\r\nonly a dangerous but also a mean vice, for it is always a confession\r\nof inferiority. It may provoke conduct which will be fruitful of\r\nwrongdoing to others, and it must cause misery to the man who feels\r\nit. It will not be any the less fruitful of wrong and misery if, as\r\nis so often the case with evil motives, it adopts some high-sounding\r\nalias. The truth is that each one of us has in him certain passions and\r\ninstincts which if they gained the upper hand in his soul would mean\r\nthat the wild beast had come uppermost in him. Envy, malice, and hatred\r\nare such passions, and they are just as bad if directed against a class\r\nor group of men as if directed against an individual. What we need in\r\nour leaders and teachers is help in suppressing such feelings, help in\r\narousing and directing the feelings that are their extreme opposites.\r\nWoe to us as a nation if we ever follow the lead of men who seek not\r\nto smother but to inflame the wild-beast qualities of the human heart!\r\nIn social and industrial no less than in political reform we can do\r\nhealthy work, work fit for a free Republic, fit for self-governing\r\ndemocracy, only by treading in the footsteps of Washington and Franklin\r\nand Adams and Patrick Henry, and not in the steps of Marat and\r\nRobespierre.\r\n\r\nSo far, what I have had to say has dealt mainly with our relations\r\nto one another in what may be called the service of the State. But\r\nthe basis of good citizenship is the home. A man must be a good son,\r\nhusband, and father, a woman a good daughter, wife, and mother, first\r\nand foremost. There must be no shirking of duties in big things or\r\nin little things. The man who will not work hard for his wife and\r\nhis little ones, the woman who shrinks from bearing and rearing many\r\nhealthy children, these have no place among the men and women who are\r\nstriving upward and onward. Of course the family is the foundation of\r\nall things in the State. Sins against pure and healthy family life\r\nare those which of all others are sure in the end to be visited most\r\nheavily upon the nation in which they take place. We must beware,\r\nmoreover, not merely of the great sins, but of the lesser ones which\r\nwhen taken together cause such an appalling aggregate of misery\r\nand wrong. The drunkard, the lewd liver, the coward, the liar, the\r\ndishonest man, the man who is brutal to or neglectful of parents,\r\nwife, or children—of all of these the shrift should be short when we\r\nspeak of decent citizenship. Every ounce of effort for good in your\r\nAssociations is part of the ceaseless war against the traits which\r\nproduce such men. But in addition to condemning the grosser forms of\r\nevil we must not forget to condemn also the evils of bad temper, lack\r\nof gentleness, nagging and whining fretfulness, lack of consideration\r\nfor others—the evils of selfishness in all its myriad forms. Each man\r\nor woman must remember his or her duty to all around, and especially to\r\nthose closest and nearest, and such remembrance is the best possible\r\npreparation for doing duty for the State as a whole.\r\n\r\nWe ask that these Associations, and the men and women who take part\r\nin them, practice the Christian doctrines which are preached from\r\nevery true pulpit. The Decalogue and the Golden Rule must stand as the\r\nfoundation of every successful effort to better either our social or\r\nour political life. “Fear the Lord and walk in his ways” and “Love thy\r\nneighbor as thyself”—when we practice these two precepts, the reign\r\nof social and civic righteousness will be close at hand. Christianity\r\nteaches not only that each of us must so live as to save his own soul,\r\nbut that each must also strive to do his whole duty by his neighbor. We\r\ncan not live up to these teachings as we should; for in the presence\r\nof infinite might and infinite wisdom, the strength of the strongest\r\nman is but weakness, and the keenest of mortal eyes see but dimly.\r\nBut each of us can at least strive, as light and strength are given\r\nhim, toward the ideal. Effort along any one line will not suffice. We\r\nmust not only be good, but strong. We must not only be high-minded,\r\nbut brave-hearted. We must think loftily, and we must also work hard.\r\nIt is not written in the Holy Book that we must merely be harmless\r\nas doves. It is also written that we must be wise as serpents. Craft\r\nunaccompanied by conscience makes the crafty man a social wild beast\r\nwho preys on the community and must be hunted out of it. Gentleness and\r\nsweetness unbacked by strength and high resolve are almost impotent for\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThe true Christian is the true citizen, lofty of purpose, resolute in\r\nendeavor, ready for a hero’s deeds, but never looking down on his task\r\nbecause it is cast in the day of small things; scornful of baseness,\r\nawake to his own duties as well as to his rights, following the higher\r\nlaw with reverence, and in this world doing all that in him lies, so\r\nthat when death comes he may feel that mankind is in some degree better\r\nbecause he has lived.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME TWELVE",
