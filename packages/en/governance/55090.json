BRANCH’S\r\n                               ALLIGATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n Volume I.—No. 20        SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 4,           Price 2 Cents.\r\n                                  1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        And they Stoned Stephen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are told by the Holy Scriptures that one of the Apostles, who,\r\npreaching integrity and truth to the Pharisees of old, offended those\r\nwho belonged to the Tabernacle of libertines, was brought before the\r\ncouncil, which, by arousing public sentiment in a seditious manner,\r\ncaused Stephen to be stoned. And in our modern day they have likewise\r\nstoned Stephen by placing him, unaccustomed to toil, and guiltless of\r\nall crime, save the free exercise of opinion, to labor in a quarry along\r\nwith felons, thieves, and other obnoxious convicts; and in this wise\r\nhave our modern Pharisees stoned Stephen.\r\n\r\nThe Warden of the Penitentiary, suffering from din of public opinion,\r\nhas seen proper to extenuate his conduct by stating that he was\r\ncompelled, by rigidity of duty, thus to place Mr. Branch in a position\r\nof labor. Thus has he communicated his thoughts for publication to the\r\neditor of the _Sunday Mercury_, and when he uttered them he was well\r\naware that they were a mere subterfuge to avoid personal indignity. And\r\nnow we challenge the Warden to show one single word in his instructions\r\nrendering it compulsory upon him to employ any one soul in the quarrying\r\nof stone. On the contrary, his instructions particularly enjoin upon him\r\nthe exercise of moderation and forbearance as a taskmaster, and most\r\nexplicitly direct that no prisoner, incapable of physical labor, shall\r\nbe employed at manual servitude. The law of the State, despite the\r\ntendencies of Mr. Fitch, recognizes every being, created in human form,\r\nto be possessed of a soul, as well as being of value to the\r\ncommonwealth; for a man incarcerated in the penitentiary, is not devoid\r\nof civil life as is the case with a convict to the State prison, and\r\nwherefore then did he stone Stephen?\r\n\r\nMr. Fitch, the Warden, may remember that a woman, convicted of the most\r\nbrutal of crimes, which the law unfortunately has left unvisited by\r\nproper punishment, that of the murder of the innocents, as yet unborn,\r\nwas, during her residence at the Island, favored not only with the\r\ncomforts, but the luxuries of an easy existence. And still they stoned\r\nStephen.\r\n\r\nThe Warden, in addition to this instance of the famous Madame Restell,\r\nmay remember that a French gentleman, convicted of a most gross and\r\nobscene libel upon the Rev. Mr. Verien, was not only suffered to remain\r\nin idleness, and without the prison clothes, but was absolutely lodged\r\nin the Warden’s house, remunerating him for his comfortable existence by\r\ninstructing his daughters in a knowledge of the French tongue. And still\r\nthey stoned Stephen!\r\n\r\nThe Warden may remember, moreover, that Mr. Judson, convicted of a\r\nmisdemeanor in exciting the Astor Place riot, was allowed two days of\r\nweekly absence to attend the publication of a journal by him published—a\r\nfact notorious to every reader of _Ned Buntline’s Own_. And still they\r\nstoned Stephen!\r\n\r\nWe are sorry that the Warden so far committed himself as intentionally\r\nto persecute a harmless, unoffensive man, whose true crime is a steady\r\nadherence to truth. Allow us to assure him that while we admire his\r\npenitence for the moment, we cannot forgive the fact that he stoned\r\nStephen!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Is the Atlantic Telegraph Actually Complete?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is still doubted by many whether the Atlantic cable is actually laid\r\nand perfect, as is reported. There is, we believe, no actual proof of\r\nthe fact, beyond that in the hands of those who have a pecuniary\r\ninterest in its being completed. It is said that the Queen’s message and\r\nthe President’s reply have been transmitted. Have they? Who knows?\r\n\r\nMr. Field has notified the public that the line will not be opened for\r\nits use in much less than a month—that he also has resigned the\r\ndirectorship. Has he sold his stock, and thus disqualified himself from\r\nholding office? And will most of the stock have changed hands within the\r\nmonth? And will something have happened to the cable in the meantime to\r\nrender it useless? Will the directors prove the fact of the cable being\r\nsecurely laid and in working order, by transmitting a message and\r\nreturning an answer, if it is but a single sentence? If they are able to\r\ntransmit one word they can do this. It would certainly be too bad if it\r\nshould prove to be a Kidd salvage affair. Then all the gas which has\r\nbeen evolved, and all the powder burnt in the extreme jollification,\r\nwould be a total loss; together with part of the City Hall, and Justice\r\ninto the bargain. We certainly would advise those who have been lately\r\ncanonized to show these surmises to be false before their honors grow\r\ndim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      A Commotion in the Jarsies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ALLIGATOR, feeling himself some pumpkins, on Sunday last, ventured\r\nupon an excursion to the Jarsies, as much from a desire to have\r\nuniversal absolution by a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Quietus, as\r\nfrom a longing to fraternize with the gallant Zouave, so particularly\r\nenamored with the “blunt.” Basking in the smiles, literal and liquid, of\r\nthe Hotel Napoleon, and, sunned by the presence of the fair hostess, the\r\nAlligator was enwrapt in a pleasant revery, much after the owl-like\r\nmanner, in which the sedate and philosophical Peter Cooper presides over\r\na reform convention. But his repose was broken by learning the\r\nastounding fact that the Jersies, and especially Hoboken, was in a state\r\nof political insurrection, and that for the moment the authority of\r\nJames Buchanan, President of these United States, was despised,\r\ncontemned and absolutely denounced,—and even one rebel, unconscious of\r\nthe Alligator’s presence, absolutely expressed a fervent desire to punch\r\nthat dignitary’s venerable head. It seems from all that we can glean,\r\nthat the Executive of this Republic, feeling the salvation of the\r\ncountry to depend upon the electors of Hoboken and the parts\r\ncircumjacent, directed the renomination of the representative in\r\nCongress, at present representing that district. This, it seems, was too\r\nmuch for Jersey patience, exhausted as it is from passive submission to\r\nthe tyranny of Camden and Amboy; and, therefore, Hoboken has raised the\r\nstandard of revolt in the person of a learned judge, who is to mount the\r\nstump to vindicate the honor of Jersey, and perhaps of its lightning.\r\nHow the unterrified democracy will survive this disaffection, we are at\r\na loss to imagine—for the loss of Hoboken, which familiarly styles\r\nitself our sister city, and a very infant of a sister at that, must be a\r\nbitter pill to an Administration in a tight place. One hope only is\r\nleft. Cannot the President induce John McKeon to reduce the rebellious\r\npeople to a perpetual slumber by one of his soporific orations; and even\r\nshould this fail, perchance Mr. Justice Whitley might be induced to talk\r\nto them for half an hour. We are convinced that the people of Jersey\r\nwould do anything rather than submit to this final calamity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            To Our Readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the past few weeks, it has been currently reported in some\r\nquarters, that D. W. JOBSON, Esq., is now conducting the _Alligator_.\r\n\r\nThat is not so. Mr. JOBSON never had—has not now, and, for aught we know\r\nat present, never will have anything to do with the _Alligator_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Answers to Correspondents.\r\n\r\n\r\n “VAN.”—Your communication will appear in our next issue, it being\r\n   received too late to be of use for the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ALLIGATOR.\r\n                 New York, Saturday, September 4, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      More Advice to Mr. Barnard.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Recorder Barnard sat in Solomonic judgment on Stephen H.\r\nBranch, he evidently forgot for the moment the dignity of a judge, and\r\nassumed the questionable attributes of a politician. That Mr. Recorder\r\nBarnard is nominally a lawyer we will admit, for he comes under all\r\nprovisions of the New Code, which creates lawyers with the celerity of\r\nmachinery; but that he understands the law, we emphatically deny. Before\r\nMr. Barnard mounted the Bench, was his name ever known to the community\r\nas a successful barrister? Was he ever intrusted with any important\r\ncivil or criminal case? Did he ever make a speech the most common-place\r\nreporter thought worthy of being reproduced in type? Not one of those\r\ntests of popularity, which appertain to the career of the most common of\r\nattorneys, seem to apply to the case of our learned Recorder, upon whose\r\nbrow honor and glory have stumbled as it were by accident.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnard, in sentencing Mr. Branch, evidently desired to impress the\r\npublic mind with an idea of his individual authority; forgetting that he\r\nwas armed with the sword of mercy, he wielded only that of justice, and\r\nwith a vindictiveness, as reckless as it was violent, loaned himself to\r\nthe wishes of partizan leaders, who daily stand in dread of exposure\r\nfrom an unbridled press. As vermin cannot dwell in certain atmospheres,\r\nthese men stifle coming in contact with the air of a free press; and it\r\nis to them we owe the bitter persecution of free opinion, as is\r\nglowingly instanced in the judgment passed upon Branch. A self-same\r\npunishment would have been meted out to any offending editor, who may\r\ntouch the dignity of the confederated band, who thus attempt to throttle\r\nspeech, whose freedom should be indigenous to the soil.\r\n\r\nHow long has Mr. Barnard learned that a convicted editor is a mere\r\nfelon? That he should be maltreated, disgraced, and placed even below\r\nthe level of thieves and malefactors? The case of Mr. Branch is probably\r\nthe first on record, wherein a man condemned for libel was compelled to\r\nsubmit to prison discipline, intended only for a minor class of felons.\r\nBut as this case has occurred, it has afforded to our people a fair\r\nopportunity of judging upon the irresponsibility, we will not say\r\nimbecility, of an elective judiciary. Catch the most insignificant\r\nerrand-boy in the nearest lawyer’s den, and he will give you a better\r\nlegal, if not more humane, exposition of the true genius of the laws\r\nthan was publicly enunciated by Mr. Recorder Barnard, who indirectly\r\nrepudiated pure maxims of jurisprudence, and substituted vagaries of\r\nvengeance. Let us, therefore, profit by this casual display of\r\nsentiment; for say we to all quarters of the city, with a voice as of\r\nthat of a watchman in the hour of alarm, that none, not even the pure\r\nand guileless, are safe while fantasies such as these are suffered to be\r\nfulminated from a criminal bench. And likewise mind, we draw a grave\r\ndistinction between our civil and criminal judiciary. Unfortunately, the\r\nhighest and most respected of our judges are occupied solely with the\r\nrights of property, and we have committed the rights of the person to\r\nthe most obscure of obscure attorneys, accidentally thrust from pure\r\npartizan influence upon the Bench. While the truly learned Justice\r\nClerke, a lawyer such as the way of Christian life would make him, is\r\nsimply occupied in matters of dollars and cents, our lives, our persons,\r\nour future, immaculate, are intrusted to the supervision of such learned\r\npundits as Mr. Recorder Barnard and City Judge Russell.\r\n\r\nLiberty of speech is a right, paramount to that of every other\r\nconsideration; it has been treasured as the key-stone to the great,\r\nunwritten Constitution of Britain and of our own land; it is the vital\r\nessence of our political existence, and its abuse has been judicially\r\ntolerated that the spirit shall be perpetuated. But as Mr. Recorder\r\nBarnard has not probably indulged in the intellectual luxury of perusing\r\nHallam’s Constitutional History—such a work being unknown to the New\r\nCode—we will excuse him from any implied admiration of that respect,\r\nyea, adoration, for personal rights, which animated the manly soul of\r\nAlgernon Sidney and fired the patriotism of John Hampden.\r\n\r\nWe simply wish to inform Mr. Recorder Barnard that he labors under a\r\ndelusion when he presumes libel to be a misdemeanor in the literal sense\r\nof the word, and although the law may be virtually misconstrued in such\r\na wise as to authorize interpretation that it may verge upon\r\nmisdemeanor, still the practice of Courts, presided over by Kent, by\r\nEldon, and by Camden, has essentially abrogated any such pretence in\r\nfact. In meeting out to Mr. Branch the doom of a common thief, in\r\ndisgracing and degrading him before the eyes of a community, he\r\nattempted in a feeble way, it may be observed, to instruct and\r\nenlighten. Mr. Barnard and his satellites not only erred in tempor, but\r\nin absolute legality. They have reaped a harvest of glory in the\r\nunmurmured cases of a sympathetic public who will profit by the lesson\r\nwe have received, and hence forward seek not such servants as these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Law’s Delay.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was confidently expected that a revision of the judgment upon Mr.\r\nBranch would have been had in the early part of this week. We, however,\r\nlearn from Mr. Ashmead, that the Court being pre-occupied by civil\r\nbusiness, have postponed consideration of his motion until the month of\r\nSeptember, when the learned counsellor feels assured that the relief he\r\nprays for will be granted, and a new trial be had.\r\n\r\nIn this sacrifice of personal rights to the emolument of that of\r\nproperty, we notice the inconsistency of the law which thus creates an\r\ninvidious distinction between things animate and inanimate. Here, then,\r\nwe have a person kept in jail, in a state of vexatious misery, while the\r\nCourt is occupied by the consideration of some quarrel of Smith and\r\nJones over a bale of cotton, or some other triviality in a commercial\r\npoint of view. Now, the most valuable of all rights is that of\r\nlocomotion, and the dearest of all writs is that of _habeas corpus_,\r\ninstituted expressly for the relief of the individual from unjust\r\ndetention. And still all the provisions of this famous act are\r\nneutralized the instant the prisoner gets into the clutches of the\r\njudiciary, whose slow motions are too often a cause of unintentional\r\nwrong-doing.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the People _vs._ Haines, the prisoner served his time out\r\nin the State Prison, and was afterward granted a new trial and found not\r\nguilty. Ashley, tried for forgery, served eighteen months, when upon a\r\nnew trial he was found guiltless of the crime charged upon him. Much as\r\nwe talk about the freedom of our institutions, the rights of prisoners\r\nare too little respected by the tardy process of legal procedure. We\r\ntrust that when the new constitution be framed that preference will be\r\ngiven to all cases involving personal liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                The First of September—let us remember.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was observed by an English writer the heart of an alderman lays in\r\nhis belly. It may be true of an English alderman, but with ours the\r\ncentre of all affections rests in the pocket—touch him there, and you\r\ndraw his life’s blood. Dining is the mere relaxation with our aldermanic\r\ncouncil, by which they occasionally while away the fatigues of\r\nmathematical calculations on the gross profits of contracts. They eat\r\nnot as a matter of duty, but from absolute necessity. We are to have a\r\nmunicipal banquet on the first of September, to testify our joy at the\r\nsuccessful laying of the Atlantic Cable; and the same gentlemen, who did\r\nthe mourning over James Munroe, have kindly condescended to do our\r\nmerriment over the cable. Our Aldermen have acute sensations; at one\r\nmoment they are plunged in the depths of woe, at another they are\r\nfrantic with delight. In a word, they do everything, even praise God,\r\nnot in church, but at the Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\nWe being of the poorer class feeders on pork and beans, are not expected\r\nto have stomachs, capable of being with fat capon lined, so we, tax\r\npayers will have to imagine the splendor of the scene, seen through the\r\ngloomy columns of a morning newspaper. And therefore let us riot in\r\nimagination and taste the pleasures of the honor in anticipation.\r\n\r\nWe see before us, seated in his chair of state, the great Puttyman, and\r\nwe worship his Worship like unto the mighty Bendimeer, for him to speak,\r\nfor us to hear. And as the words of humid eloquence are distilled from\r\nhis lips, we will wonder how we could unfold so sound, unvarnished a\r\ntale, and admit that painting spoils the lily and the rose, until\r\nweighed down by the profundity of magisterial love, we unconsciously\r\ndroop to balmy slumber. And then we shall have Alderman Clancy, whose\r\nsoft persuasive tones shall wake thunders of applause, as he extols the\r\nfighting glories of the Sixth, and promises that if the cable has\r\nnecessity of gallant defenders, he knows a band ready to fight for it.\r\n\r\nAnd then there will be the grave and illustrious Peter, who will act the\r\npart of the skeleton at the Egyptian feast, with an occasional smile as\r\na token of our approaching smile. He will make but few remarks; the most\r\ntelling of which will be a short sentence, offering the use of the\r\nbasement cellar of the Institute wherein to coil away the tail end of\r\nthe cable.\r\n\r\nAnd then we will have Simeon Draper, the facetious prince of diners-out,\r\nwhose portly presence was never known to fail a municipal feast. He will\r\nilluminate us with jokes, such as were wont to enliven the monotony of\r\nan Alms House board. And then we will mourn to think that some day must\r\ncome when the Corporation Yorick will be no more.\r\n\r\nIt will be a great feast!—a revelry of wit, humor, and sentiment; a\r\ngathering together of all imaginable elements of greatness, from every\r\nquarter of the city, and it is only to be regretted that the Lord Mayor\r\nof London and him of Dublin cannot be sent, per the cable, to\r\nparticipate in the scene of self-glorification, it would afford them\r\nsuch an instructive lesson in the principles of municipal democracy. But\r\nas they are requested to dine simultaneously with our body corporate, so\r\nshall the _Alligator_, in an humble manner, it must be conceded, for we\r\ndine at our own expense—a consideration not entering into the heads of\r\nour authorities. At the exact moment when Simeon Draper cracks his sixth\r\njoke, the _Alligator_ will honor Waterman with a command for “ein\r\nlager!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Long Branch and Short Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Branch rusticates upon the Island, Long Branch has had the honor\r\nof a most distinguished assembly, lay, clerical and divine. While\r\nAlderman Clancy, pink of municipal Nestors, has consented to bloom away\r\nfrom Blossom Lodge, and here to perform the duties of the Mayoralty, his\r\nHonor, the great Puttyman, comfortably dozes to the music of Jersey\r\nmusquitos, his repose only broken by the unwelcome intrusion of John\r\nMcKeon—the leanest of Pharoah’s lean kine. His Honor and the inevitable\r\nJohn, although doubtlessly the master spirits of the mysterious\r\nconference held at the Branch, and which will probably be elucidated\r\nafter the next election, however played second fiddle to Archbishop\r\nHughes, a venerable prelate, who, well aware of the qualities of putty,\r\ncan mould it at his will. What Peter Cooper does at the conference\r\nbeyond yarning, it is difficult to imagine, his peculiarities being\r\ngenerally limited to that operation of the muscles. If these worthy\r\ngentlemen can conceive that they can use the Archbishop for their\r\npolitical purposes, they are slightly mistaken, for that enthusiastic\r\nprelate is too old a bird to be caught by any kind of chaff, and we\r\ndoubt whether Puttyman & Co. can manufacture salt enough from the\r\nAtlantic ocean to be placed on his venerable tail. We may remind this\r\nscheming crew, that, some years ago Governor Seward and his private\r\ngovernor, Thurlow Weed, attempted a sale of the worthy Archbishop, who,\r\nin return for the compliment, bought himself in and sold out his\r\nwould-be purchasers at a remarkably low figure. With this decided case\r\nbefore their eyes, we beg to caution poor Puttyman and Peter to keep\r\ntheir eyes skinned, otherwise they may be found embalmed within the new\r\nCathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           All for a Quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe read in the daily prints that a gentleman by the name of Hoey, while\r\nreturning from Rockaway, in company with a gentleman and lady, in\r\npassing a turnpike gate, gave the girl, attending the bar, a coin which\r\nhe presumed to be a good American quarter dollar, but which the girl\r\npronounced to be bad. The turnpike man, who chances to be a justice of\r\nthe peace, immediately caused the arrest of all parties, who were forced\r\nto send to Rockaway for bail. Even after the arrival of the bail the\r\nparty were detained several hours from lack of the necessary printed\r\nblanks, while Mr. Justice and turnpike man Pearsall, copied the process\r\nfrom a musty law tome. It is needless to add that upon the appearance of\r\nMr. Hoey and counsel from New York, all proceedings were dismissed as\r\nfrivolous.\r\n\r\nGross as this outrage may appear at the first blush, and intense as was\r\nthe stupidity of the Long Island Dogberry, it can be daily paralleled by\r\nthe actions of our own law courts, especially when we extract our police\r\nmagistrates from barrooms and grogeries. Now one question: Have we one\r\nsingle police magistrate in this city who ever swept out a lawyers\r\noffice, much less ever studied the profession? They are doubtlessly\r\nintelligent and well-meaning men, but then they are not lawyers, and\r\nconsequently unfit to be entrusted with the custody of our personal\r\nindependence. No right can be dearer than that of free locomotion, and\r\ntherefore we should be more particular in the selection of these judges,\r\nthan those controlling the right of property. Imprisonment, like the dew\r\nof heaven, falls alike upon the rich and the poor, and no citizen should\r\nbe jeopardized as to personal liberty and representation without the\r\nstrongest possible precaution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      News from a Watering Place.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Cooper, the learned, astute, and never to be forgotten Peter,\r\nfinds it to be invaluable to his health, to snuff the sea breeze in the\r\nclassic freshness of Long Branch. Archbishop John, fatigued with the\r\ncares of Cathedral dedication, found it likewise to his advantage to\r\nsmell the air in the same locality, and for fear of want of amusement he\r\nbrought with him the Vicar General of his diocese, and a brother of some\r\norder—probably of the Redemptorists, or of some other evangelical\r\npawnbrokers. And a very strange peculiarity in the atmosphere brought to\r\nthe self-same spot, our most illustrious municipal executive Daniel F.\r\nTiemann. And being mutual acquaintances, on Sunday last, they enjoyed a\r\nmost comfortable chat, regulating the moral, sanitary and religious\r\ncondition of our citizens, when Peter suddenly disappeared, and his body\r\nwas only recovered a few hours before nightfall, when he was discovered\r\nthoroughly impregnated with a speech, which he will probably transmit to\r\nposterity upon the walls of the Institute, but which in reality is the\r\npersonal property of Archbishop Hughes. And on the morrow Peter, like\r\nhis saintly namesake, being a fisher of fish as well as of men, went\r\nforth to angle with the Vicar General, and the tonsured monk, but what\r\ncaught he beside religious truths, which ever hang like diamonds upon\r\nthe voices of the Archbishop’s town friends, we regret to say we could\r\nnot learn. There must be something over refreshing in the air of Long\r\nBranch, some resuscitating principle which can allure to that spot such\r\na bevy of worthies, who, to while away their leisure, have probably\r\nsettled in every manner, not only the Apostolic succession, but Mayor\r\nTiemann’s re-election.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe would like some of our cotemporaries to tell us what the people have\r\ngained in the election of Daniel F. Tiemann and the defeat of Fernando\r\nWood. The latter is a statesman, a fine lawyer, quick perception,\r\nbrilliant talents, and with all the accusations against him, proved\r\nhimself an able, efficient magistrate. But Tiemann, what shall the\r\nhistorian say of him? Echo answers write—on his tomb stone—“Here lies\r\nthe paint manufacturer, Daniel F. Tiemann, who was unfortunately elected\r\nMayor of New York, through a mistake of his friends. He’s gone—speak\r\ngently of his errors—the city debt mourns—the people they say—nothing.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOwing to the large and increasing demand for the ALLIGATOR, we are\r\ninduced, by Mr. Branch’s friends, to enlarge, consequently next week\r\nwill appear a full grown monster—covering eight pages. Look out for next\r\nnumber. It will be rich and racy—full of spice.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAN AFTER-THOUGHT.—Mayor Tiemann, in his epistle to the Lord Mayor of\r\nLondon, remarks, with respect to the Atlantic Telegraph, that “to God be\r\nall praise.” We are glad that the Mayor has, like Saul of Tarsus, seen a\r\ngreat light, for last week Cyrus W.

We have lately discovered one fall\r\ninfinitely greater than the above—Mayor Tiemann’s fall from the good\r\nopinion of the citizens of New York into the arms of James Gordon\r\nBennett.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“A STICK!”—By all means, at all times, we would have our friends _stick_\r\nbeside us; but the assumed friend, who, seeking help, helped himself\r\nwith our _composing stick_, from _beside us_, may he soon need a\r\n_crutch_.—[D.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     A Pertinent Series of Queries.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Editor of the Alligator_:\r\n\r\n                                            NEW YORK, August 24, 1858.\r\n\r\n    SIR.—There are a few things which I, with many others of my\r\n    acquaintances, wish to know, relative to the assistant matron of\r\n    Randall’s Island, who figured so conspicuously in the press and in\r\n    our Court of Sessions for the last month past. Before putting the\r\n    questions, I would just say—as the subject of the note is a\r\n    lady—if this were the first piece of scandal the citizens of New\r\n    York had any knowledge of in connection with our city\r\n    appointments, I, for one, would have been the first to have had\r\n    this savory morsel consigned to the “tomb of all the Capulets.”\r\n    Unfortunately it is not so. It is a well known fact that those who\r\n    are fortunate enough to receive the patronage of the corporation\r\n    of New York, and of all the lesser organizations in any way\r\n    connected with our city, must, at least _possess one negative_\r\n    qualification—they must be thoroughly destitute of honesty. Add to\r\n    this a great talent for plundering the public treasury, drinking\r\n    any quantity of rum, talking profanely, and well skilled in\r\n    fistiana, drinking _swill milk_ and eating _swill-fed beef_, and,\r\n    in a word, in bamboozling everybody. It would appear, from\r\n    disclosures lately made in certain quarters, the qualifications of\r\n    the female portion of the appointees is in no way higher than the\r\n    male portion.\r\n\r\n    The first question is—Did the Ten Governors, or any of them,\r\n    _know_ that this woman cohabited, as alleged in the _Alligator_\r\n    and not disputed on the trial, with the individual represented as\r\n    her friend? If so, this is a sad spectacle to be exhibited before\r\n    our wives and daughters.\r\n\r\n    In the second place, why did Mayor, then Governor, Tiemann, if he\r\n    did not _know_, prevent this _particular friend_ from visiting the\r\n    Island, while he permitted all the lady’s other friends to visit\r\n    her?\r\n\r\n    In the third place, how came this lady to be in want of small sums\r\n    of money at different times, and how came she to make her wants\r\n    known to Governor Tiemann? And, far more wonderful still, that he\r\n    should supply them repeatedly without the former advance being\r\n    liquidated? This seems to me passing strange when we come to\r\n    reflect on the fact that this woman receives for her services on\r\n    the Island $800 per year; no small sum for an assistant matron.\r\n\r\n    In the fourth place, if all or any of the above be true—and it may\r\n    be true for any thing I know—(the trial of Branch did not at all\r\n    touch these questions)—why is the lady not removed from the\r\n    Island, for she is totally unfitted for the responsible situation\r\n    she now fills? If the charges be false, why does the lady not take\r\n    immediate steps to clear herself from this heinous scandal? The\r\n    public have a right to demand that she either clear her character\r\n    or that she be removed from the Island.\r\n\r\n                                                        A WORKING MAN.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    ☞ The _Sunday Mercury_ reads us a homily, and attempts to\r\n    whitewash the conduct of the Warden of the Penitentiary.

Branch undergoing sentence for libel._—Mr.\r\nAshmead said he had obtained a writ of error in this case. He was at\r\nfirst disposed to let the judgment be affirmed by this Court without\r\nargument, in order that it might go to the Court of Appeals, but he was\r\ninformed by Mr. Branch’s friends that he is failing so fast that the\r\nquestion is doubtful whether he will live until the Court of Appeals\r\nmeets.\r\n\r\nJudge Davies—There is no other business before the Court.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmead asked to have a day set down for the argument in this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nJudge Davies—No, sir; we cannot meet again until the third Monday in\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nMr. Sedgwick, Assistant District Attorney, could not consent to the case\r\ngoing on out of the regular order. He had no doubt but Mr. McKeon would\r\nlike to facilitate the argument; he was, however, out of town, and Mr.\r\nSedgwick could not name any day.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmead said that the defendant’s points were so very clear and the\r\nexceptions taken so indisputable that he had no doubt that the case\r\ncould be disposed of in fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. Sedgwick said the reason he could not consent was that Mr. Ashmead\r\nhad intimated that he would make no strenuous opposition to a judgment\r\nfor the people in this Court, in order that the case might go to the\r\nCourt of Appeals at the next term; Mr. McKeon had left town with that\r\nunderstanding, but a few days since Mr. Ashmead gave notice that he\r\nwould like to argue the questions here; counsel for the people were not\r\ntherefore prepared.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmead would consent to judgment for the people _pro forma_, but\r\nMr. Branch’s friends were importuning him to have the matter disposed\r\nof, as they feared he will not survive until the Court of Appeals meets\r\nin September.\r\n\r\nThe Court suggested that if Mr. Branch’s health was such that his life\r\nwas endangered, he could be admitted to bail.\r\n\r\nMr. Sedgwick said that he could be bailed by an order of the Court.\r\n\r\nJudge Davies said this Court would adjourn to to-morrow or Saturday, for\r\nthe purpose of hearing the argument, but Mr. Sedgwick could not say when\r\nMr. McKeon would return. Upon the suggestion of the Court, the case took\r\nthe regular order, to come before the General Term on the third Monday\r\nof September, which would give them time to go before the Court of\r\nAppeals on the fourth Tuesday of that month.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmead said that he had searched the books, and from the time of\r\nCharles the Second down to the present day, there is no such sentence to\r\nbe found on record.\r\n\r\nThe Court adjourned _sine die_.\r\n\r\nThe following is the substance of Mr. Ashmead’s points for Branch:\r\n\r\n1. In refusing to receive the testimony of the three witnesses who\r\noffered to prove that they told Branch the matters which he published,\r\nand which were charged as libellous, in order to rebut the implication\r\nof malice.\r\n\r\n2. In charging the jury that if the defendant justified or proved the\r\ntruth as to two of the parties charged, yet, that inasmuch as the\r\nindictment embraced a libel on three, he must still be found guilty.\r\n\r\n3. That the whole proceedings are _coram non judice_, the Court having\r\nno jurisdiction to originate bills in case of misdemeanor.\r\n\r\n4. In charging the jury that the law presumed malice from the\r\npublication of a libel, without instructing them at the same time that\r\nit was only a _prima facie_ presumption, and could be rebutted by\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBRANCH’S CONDITION.—A gentleman, upon whose statements we can place the\r\nutmost reliance, tells us that a day or two ago he visited Branch at\r\nBlackwell’s Island. After crossing the river and reaching the Island,\r\nthe gentleman was shown into a small office attached to the\r\nPenitentiary. At this place he saw one of the clerks present an order\r\nfrom one of the “Governors,” to be permitted to see Branch. After a few\r\nmoments the unfortunate Alligator, but still indomitable Branch,\r\npresented himself. His face was paler than when in the city, and his\r\ngeneral appearance was that of a man who was suffering from a want of\r\nnutritious food and the usual comforts of life. Branch was dressed in\r\nthe prison costume, his hair was cropped and his whiskers shaved. He\r\nstated that he was now employed in carrying the tools used by the people\r\nof the quarry, and that, although the work was not necessarily too\r\nsevere, yet the fact that he was confined all day amid the dust of the\r\nquarry, and fed on food which his system and appetite revolts at, he was\r\nrapidly losing his strength, and was threatened with a paralysis of his\r\nleft side. He stated that he had to get upon several times in the night\r\nto rub his limbs, and that his case was aggravated from the fact that he\r\nwas denied the use of slippers, and had consequently to stand on the\r\nstone floor whenever he was obliged to rise from his bed. He says that\r\nif the present severe discipline is not alleviated, he will not live six\r\nweeks, and his chest is severely affected by the dust of the quarry and\r\nthe hard labor he has to perform, without adequate food.—_Daily Times._\r\n\r\nA story is told by Sir Walter Scott, of a Scotch nobleman who had a very\r\nugly daughter called “Muckle Mouthed Meg,” whom nobody would look at.\r\nHaving caught a young man of good family on his estate in some scrape,\r\nhe had him tried and condemned to be hanged. When the young man appealed\r\nto him, he told him, “The only way I can save you is by your marrying my\r\nugly daughter.” The young man said he would be hanged first. When\r\nbrought out to the gallows and the rope was seen hanging ready, the\r\nyoung man cried out, “Let me have another look at her.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FALL ELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       STATE OF NEW YORK,              }\r\n                                OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE,      }\r\n                                               ALBANY, August 2, 1858. }\r\n\r\n _To the Sheriff of the County of New York_:\r\n\r\nSIR—NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN, THAT AT THE GENERAL Election to be held in\r\nthis State on the Tuesday succeeding the first Monday in November next,\r\nthe following officers are to be elected, to wit:\r\n\r\nA GOVERNOR, in the place of John A.
