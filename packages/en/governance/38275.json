They represent only two efforts within a brief but furious\r\nencounter that gave rise to the publication of no fewer than nine\r\nseparate poems. On Thursday, 23 October 1740, Thomas Cooper, \"one of the\r\nmost prolific printers and publishers of the pamphlet literature of the\r\neighteenth century,\"[1] published a savage denunciation of Walpole\r\ncalled _Are these things so?_[2] This pamphlet, which took the fictional\r\nform of an open letter from Alexander Pope, \"An Englishman in his\r\nGrotto,\" to Robert Walpole, \"A Great Man at Court,\" set off a round of\r\nverse writing among the party hacks of the day that vividly illustrates\r\nthe close relationship between literature and politics in the first half\r\nof the eighteenth century. Within the space of two months eight further\r\npamphlets directly related to this pamphlet and to Walpole's position as\r\nFirst Minister were published. Such a spate of literary activity is only\r\nremarkable, however, when compared with other ages. While it is\r\ninconceivable that the publication of any poem in our own day, even by a\r\nmajor writer, should arouse such a response, it is reasonably typical of\r\nthe first half of the eighteenth century that the publication of an\r\noccasional poem by a minor, indeed anonymous, writer should do so.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, 8 November, two weeks after the opening blast, Cooper\r\ndelivered a second volley, an equally fierce (although largely\r\nrepetitive) denunciation of Walpole entitled _Yes, they are:_.[3] A week\r\nlater still, on Saturday, 15 November, the first pro-Government riposte,\r\ncalled _What of That!_, was published,[4] followed three days later, on\r\n18 November, by a second reply, _The Weather-Menders: A proper Answer to\r\nAre these things so?_[5] The second edition of _What of That!_ was\r\npublished on the following Saturday, 22 November,[6] and a third\r\npro-Walpole poem entitled _They are Not_, was also published at about\r\nthis time.[7] At the end of November, or early in December, a reply to\r\nall three of these defences of Walpole appeared carrying the title,\r\n_Have at you All_.[8] On Tuesday, 2 December, the pro-Walpole forces\r\nreturned to the attack again with a poem entitled _What Things?_[9] This\r\nwas followed on Saturday, 6 December, by the second edition, \"corrected,\r\nwith the addition of twenty lines omitted in the former impressions\" of\r\n_Are these things so?_,[10] and on Thursday, 18 December, by yet another\r\nanti-Walpole poem, _The Great Man's Answer_[11] purporting to be \"by the\r\nauthor of _Are these things so?_.\" But the pro-Walpole forces were still\r\nnot silenced and two days later on Saturday, 20 December, published _A\r\nSupplement to Are these things so?_,[12] an attack on the Patriot\r\nopponents of the Ministry. A month later still, on Friday, 23 January\r\n1741,[13] the third edition of _They are Not_ was published. Hereafter\r\nthis particular controversy seemed to burn itself out, although an\r\nanonymous poem entitled _The Art of Poetry_, published on 17 March 1741,\r\ncontains a long attack on _Are these things so?_.\r\n\r\nThis confused battle is most easily summarized by saying that four\r\nseparate pamphlets (not counting second and third editions) were\r\npublished which attacked Walpole, and five which defended him. The poems\r\nattacking Walpole are far more poetically versatile than those defending\r\nhim and it is the two most interesting of these attacks that are\r\nreproduced here. Taken together, this series of nine pamphlets forms a\r\nseparate battle within that much larger and continuing war waged by Lord\r\nBolingbroke and the various supporters of the Patriot Opposition against\r\nSir Robert Walpole and the defenders of his Whig Ministry. From the\r\nfirst publication of _The Craftsman_ on 5 December 1726 to the final\r\nresignation of the \"Great Man\" on 11 February 1742 it is probably true\r\nto say that no English politician has ever been so continuously and so\r\nvirulently attacked by so eminent an assemblage of literary persons. Gay,\r\nSwift, Pope, Arbuthnot, Chesterfield, Lyttleton, Thomson, Fielding, and\r\nJohnson each entered the fray at various stages. The fact that Walpole\r\nrode out these attacks for so long is more of a comment on the\r\ndisorganized nature of the opposition politically and on the astute\r\nmanoeuvring of Walpole himself, than on the ineffectiveness of the\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nDuring the protracted span of this campaign there were only two periods\r\nduring which the supporters of the Patriot cause had any real chance of\r\ntoppling Walpole. The first came in 1733 when sustained opposition\r\nforced Walpole to drop his proposed Excise Scheme, while the second\r\noccurred five years later in 1738 and sprang from a new deterioration in\r\nAnglo-Spanish relations. Although Walpole did not finally resign until\r\n11 February 1742 his fall from power was a direct result of this\r\ndeterioration. His position in the House of Commons, and in the country\r\nat large, was never as assured in the last four years of his \"reign\" as\r\nit had been in the first seventeen.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlets reproduced here deal with Walpole's declining reputation\r\nand especially with his handling of Spanish policy. The causes of the\r\nEnglish differences with Spain go back to 1713 and the Treaty of Utrecht\r\nin which the South Sea Company had been granted, amongst other\r\nprivileges, the right to send one trading vessel a year to the Spanish\r\npossessions.[14] This right had been grossly abused by English merchants\r\neager to make large profits and a great number of English trading ships\r\nannually smuggled goods to Spanish America. The Spanish governors were\r\nonly too pleased to accept such contraband trade for by it they avoided\r\npayment of duties to the King of Spain. In order to defend themselves\r\nagainst this illegal traffic the Spanish authorities established a fleet\r\nof _guarda-costas_ to intercept, search, and, if necessary, punish the\r\nEnglish ships. The _guarda-costas_ did this with great effect and, on\r\noccasion, with considerable cruelty. The most notorious example\r\nconcerned the capture, near Jamaica in 1731, of Captain Robert Jenkins'\r\nship, the _Rebecca_, and the ensuing removal of one of Jenkins' ears. It\r\nwas with Jenkins' presentation of this ear, which \"wrapt up in cotton,\r\nhe always carried about him,\"[15] before the House of Commons seven years\r\nlater in March 1738 that Anglo-Spanish differences came to a head.\r\n\r\nThe Patriots demanded war and revenge: Walpole, however, was committed\r\nto a policy of peace. Accordingly, he spent the rest of the year trying\r\nto patch things up and the ill-fated Convention of Pardo concluded on 14\r\nJanuary 1739 was the result. The Convention involved compromise on both\r\nsides. England claimed that Spain owed her L343,277 by way of reparation\r\nfor damages done to English vessels, and Spain claimed that England owed\r\nher L180,000 by way of arrears on duties due to the King of Spain. This\r\nleft a balance of L163,277 and England agreed to accept L95,000 as a\r\ntotal discharge in return for payment within four months.[16]\r\n\r\nOn 1 February Walpole laid this Convention before Parliament, and,\r\ndespite vociferous opposition, it was eventually ratified on 9 March by\r\na vote of 244 to 214. As a result of this ratification a considerable\r\nsection of the opposition, under the leadership of Sir William Wyndham,\r\nimmediately seceded from Parliament. Feelings had never been higher. On\r\n15 May, one day after the payment had fallen due, Benjamin Keene, the\r\nBritish Minister in Madrid, was officially informed that the L95,000\r\nwould only be paid if Admiral Haddock removed his fleet from the\r\nMediterranean. England had no intention of recalling Haddock, for both\r\nGibraltar and Minorca would then remain defenceless, and Spain clearly\r\nhad no real intention of paying the money. From this point on war became\r\ninevitable and on 19 October 1739 the declaration was made \"and was\r\nreceived by all ranks and distinctions of men with a degree of\r\nenthusiasm and joy, which announced the general frenzy of the\r\nnation.\"[17] It was on hearing the church bells pealing at the news that\r\nWalpole made his famous remark: \"They now ring the bells, but they will\r\nsoon wring their hands.\"[18]\r\n\r\nOne month later, on 22 November, Admiral Vernon captured Porto Bello,\r\nthe port in which the _guarda-costas_ had been fitted out. The news\r\nof this victory did not arrive in England until nearly four months later\r\non 13 March 1740, but it brought with it great public excitement and\r\njubilation. Thus by the end of 1740 the revenge on the Spanish had\r\nbegun. Those who had demanded war seemed justified and Walpole had been\r\ndiscredited. This is the political background against which these\r\npamphlets are set.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBoth pamphlets have been attributed to James Miller, but the evidence\r\nfor such attribution is cumulative rather than definitive.[19] _Are\r\nthese things so?_ has been far more frequently attributed to Miller\r\nthan _The Great Man's Answer_. The earliest attribution is found in\r\nD. E. Baker's _Biographia Dramatica_ which, although it was not\r\npublished till 1812, was originally compiled by Baker sometime before\r\n1764.[20] Robert Watt also lists _Are these things so?_ as Miller's\r\nwork in his _Bibliotheca Britannica_, Edinburgh, 1824.[21] The entries\r\nunder Miller in the _CBEL_ and _DNB_ both accept these attributions as\r\ndoes the _British Museum Catalogue_. The evidence for attributing _The\r\nGreat Man's Answer_ to Miller is far more slender and rests largely on\r\nthe publisher's claim on the title page, which may well have been made\r\nfor the sake of promotion, that it is \"By the Author of _Are these\r\nthings so?_\".\r\n\r\nJames Miller, 1706-1744, is better known as a comic dramatist than as a\r\npoet. He was the son of a clergyman from Upcerne in Dorset, and was\r\neducated at Wadham College, Oxford, where he wrote a comedy, _The\r\nHumours of Oxford_, which was successfully performed at Drury Lane in\r\nJanuary 1730. On leaving Oxford he had been expected by his relations to\r\ngo into business, but \"not being able to endure the servile drudgery it\r\ndemanded,\" he took holy orders and continued to write plays \"to increase\r\nhis finances.\"[22] From 1730 until his death in 1744 he wrote ten plays,\r\nseveral of which were performed with considerable success.[23]\r\n\r\nBut it is as a poet that we are primarily interested in Miller. He was\r\nthe author of several occasional poems of which his _Harlequin Horace,\r\nor the Art of Modern Poetry_, 1731, was the best known. This poem, yet\r\nanother imitation of Horace's _Ars Poetica_ is an attack on John Rich,\r\nthe manager of Lincoln's Inn Fields and Covent-Garden. The poem is\r\nironically full of perverse modern advice on how to write poetry. Miller\r\nadopts the persona of a modern Grub Street poet who scorns the classical\r\nvalues. Consequently Pope, who insists on standards of excellence, is\r\nseen by the persona as the great enemy of modern poets. At the same time\r\nit is quite clear that for Miller himself Pope is the greatest of poets.\r\nThe poem includes an attack on Walpole (ll. 209-216), and perhaps it was\r\nthis that led the agents of the Ministry to make him the large offer\r\nreferred to in the biography of Miller found in Cibber's _Lives_. But,\r\nas the anonymous writer of this life goes on to point out, Miller \"had\r\nvirtue sufficient to withstand the temptation, though his circumstances\r\nat that time were far from being easy.\"[24]\r\n\r\nA second verse satire in the manner of Horace, _Seasonable Reproof_,\r\n1735, has also been attributed to Miller. The poem is a general satire\r\non Britain's \"State of Reprobation,\" and only makes a passing glance at\r\nWalpole. London has been so forsaken by people all rushing to the\r\nItalian opera that\r\n\r\n    By _Excisemen_, it might now be taken,\r\n    And great Sir _Bob_ ride through, and save his Bacon (ll. 6-7).\r\n\r\nBut more significant in our context is that, as Maynard Mack has shown,\r\nthe author creates a speaker \"who by his careful echoings of the\r\n_Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot_ seems to labor to be mistaken for Pope.\"[25]\r\n\r\nIf Miller was the author of both _Seasonable Reproof_ and _Are these\r\nthings so?_ his fascination with the persona of the poet in his grotto\r\nemerges as no sudden whim of wit, but as a continuing concern with the\r\nsymbolic significance of Pope's actual life. Furthermore, the poet who\r\nattacked Walpole so violently in October 1740 emerges as no upstart\r\nPatriot cashing in on Walpole's current unpopularity, but as a\r\nconsistent and courageous opponent of Walpole since at least 1731.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn _Are these things so?_ Pope is imagined to be speaking throughout,\r\nalthough he in turn imagines what Walpole might say at various points.\r\nThe poem is full of allusions and references intended to support the\r\npretense that Pope is speaking. In line eight the speaker says his\r\nluxury is \"lolling in my peaceful Grot\"; in lines fifteen and sixteen\r\nhe echoes Pope's famous claim in _To Fortescue_ that he is \"TO VIRTUE\r\nONLY and HER FRIENDS, A FRIEND,\"[26] when he says:\r\n\r\n    Close shut my Cottage-Gate, where none pretends\r\n    To lift the Latch but Virtue and her Friends;\r\n\r\nand in lines seventeen and eighteen he shows that he knew Walpole had\r\nonce visited Pope at Twickenham.[27]\r\n\r\nThese allusions to Pope's actual life have been carefully chosen by the\r\nauthor in order to give dramatic credibility to his chosen spokesman\r\nrather than to persuade the reader that Pope was the real author. The\r\nimpersonation of Pope is meant to be transparent: the poet is\r\ndemonstrating his versatility at imitating Pope and has considerable fun\r\nin doing so. The only evidence that could be brought in to support an\r\ninterpretation that stressed the author's serious intent to make Pope\r\nseem the real author concerns a Dublin reprint of the poem that actually\r\ncarried Pope's name as author on the title page. But it is extremely\r\nunlikely that the true author had anything to do with this since the\r\nDublin publisher did not even bother to incorporate the corrections and\r\nadditions that the poet had made to the second edition.\r\n\r\nTo point out that the device of creating a spokesman is meant to be seen\r\nthrough is not the same thing, however, as saying that the author could\r\nafford to admit his authorship. There were good reasons why the author\r\nof a poem that was primarily an attack on the First Minister, and who\r\nwas himself probably without any great influence or reputation, should\r\nneed to hide the fact of his authorship. For such a person the choice of\r\nPope as spokesman could hardly have been more appropriate.[28]\r\n\r\nIn May and July 1738 Pope had published his devastating attacks on the\r\nstate of the country known as _The Epilogue to the Satires_. On 31\r\nJanuary 1739 Paul Whitehead published his attack on the artificialities\r\nand disguises of Walpole's Ministry and the Court favourites in a poem\r\n(which Boswell refers to as \"brilliant and pointed\"[29]) called\r\n_Manners: A Satire_. At this point the government decided that it was\r\ntime they attempted to stop, or at least stem, these attacks. They were\r\nnot keen to confront Pope himself, but Whitehead presented a less\r\nformidable opponent.[30] Consequently, in February 1739, he and his\r\npublisher Robert Dodsley were summoned before the bar of the House of\r\nLords to account for the attacks on named individuals in _Manners_. On\r\nMonday, 12 February, the poem \"was voted scandalous, etc. by the Lords,\r\nand the author and publisher ordered into custody, where Mr. Dodsley,\r\nthe publisher, was a week; but Mr. Paul Whitehead, the author,\r\nabsconds.\"[31] Whitehead anticipated this summons when he wrote in the\r\npoem:\r\n\r\n    _Pope_ writes unhurt--but know, 'tis different quite\r\n    To beard the lion, and to crush the mite.\r\n    Safe may he dash the Statesman in each line,\r\n    Those dread his satire, who dare punish mine (p. 15).\r\n\r\nPope was then the ideal spokesman for our author's purposes: the mite\r\nmust dress up as the lion. It was admittedly almost two years since\r\nWhitehead's original summons, but the incident was well enough\r\nremembered to spur a gossip columnist writing in _The Daily Gazetteer_\r\non 11 November 1740 to suggest that Whitehead was the author of _Are\r\nthese things so?_ Whitehead, too, evidently felt the danger of the\r\nsituation for he deemed it necessary to publish a denial four days\r\nlater.[32]\r\n\r\nIn choosing Pope for his spokesman the author of _Are these things so?_\r\nshowed a full awareness of the political realities. He also showed a\r\ndetailed familiarity with Pope's life and work. There is nothing,\r\nhowever, to indicate that such knowledge was reciprocal, or even to\r\nindicate that Pope knew of the poem's existence. The only evidence that\r\nPope knew anything about Miller's work, if indeed Miller was the author,\r\ncomes in a letter Pope wrote to Caryll on 6 February 1731 in which he\r\npraises _Harlequin Horace_ although he does not seem to know the\r\nauthor's name.[33]\r\n\r\n_Are these things so?_ opens with Pope challenging Walpole to explain\r\nwhy Britain has fallen as low as she has and why France and Spain have\r\nbeen allowed \"to limit out her sea.\" Walpole is then imagined defending\r\nhis measures, especially the Excise Scheme, the Convention of Pardo,\r\nPlacement and the Secret Service. In the second half of the poem the\r\nsatirist repeats the charges and invites Walpole to turn his eyes inward\r\nand imagine that he dies guilty. Pope then begs Walpole to resign and,\r\nfailing that, begs the King to intervene. The poem closes in a positive\r\nway by turning from Walpole and listing other persons (all members of\r\nthe Opposition) that George II might appoint to a new Ministry.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition (23 October) these persons were given fictitious\r\nnames. The second edition (6 December) not only substituted their real\r\nnames but also added twenty lines at the end which included Cobham and\r\nArgyle in the list of worthies. It is this edition, which carries an\r\nAdvertisement explaining these changes, that we have reproduced here.\r\n\r\nFinally it seems helpful to append a few notes to help identify some of\r\nthe allusions. In line 63 (p. 4) the \"ONE more noble than the rest\" is\r\npresumably Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke who was stripped of his\r\ntitle by Act of Attainder in 1725. In line 73 (p. 5) the \"brave and\r\nhonest _Adm'ral_\" is Vernon who captured Porto Bello on 22 November\r\n1739. The \"_sturdy Beggars_\" mentioned in line 100 (p. 6), was the\r\nappelation used by Walpole in referring to the mob outside the door of\r\nParliament on 14 March 1733, and was taken up by the Opposition as\r\npertaining to all the merchants and individuals opposed to the\r\nExcise.[34] In line 129 (p. 8) the \"C--n----n\" is the Convention of Pardo\r\ndescribed earlier in this introduction. In line 139 (p. 8) the \"BROTHER\"\r\nreferred to is Horatio Walpole who was a frequent ambassador abroad for\r\nRobert Walpole's government. In line 218 (p. 12) \"HE whose _Fame_ to\r\nboth the Poles is known\" is George II.\r\n\r\nThe persons named at the end of the poem as possible replacements for\r\nWalpole are all persons who were at one time members of the Whig party\r\nbut who had joined the opposition because of their dislike for Walpole.\r\nJohn Carteret, Earl Granville (ll. 231-236, p. 13, and referred to as\r\nCamillus in the first edition), had a long struggle with Walpole for\r\ncontrol of the Whig party and joined the Opposition Whigs after he\r\nreturned from the lord lieutenancy of Ireland in 1730. It was Carteret\r\nwho was to move the unsuccessful resolution on 13 February 1741,\r\nrequesting the King to remove Walpole from his \"presence and counsels\r\nfor ever.\" William Pulteney, Earl of Bath (ll. 237-242, p. 13, and\r\nreferred to as Demosthenes in the first edition) was also an early ally\r\nof Walpole's who later broke with him to form the Patriot party. He\r\nbecame one of the editors of _The Craftsman_. Philip Stanhope, Earl of\r\nChesterfield (ll. 243-245, p. 13, and referred to as Atticus in the\r\nfirst edition) was also a lifelong Whig who joined Carteret in leading\r\nthe opposition to Walpole in the Lords. Hugh Hume, Lord Polwarth and\r\nEarl of Marchmont (ll. 246-257, p. 14, and referred to as \"that fam'd\r\n_Caledonian Youth_\" in the first edition), had been a persistent and\r\nrelentless opponent of Walpole in the Commons, but on the death of his\r\nfather in February 1740 had acceded to the Earldom of Marchmont and been\r\nunable to get elected as a representative peer. Although twenty years\r\nyounger than Pope (he was only 32 in 1740) he became a close friend and\r\nwas appointed an executor of his will. Pope refers to his friendship in\r\nhis _Verses on a Grotto_: \"And the bright Flame was shot thro'\r\nMARCHMONT'S Soul.\"[35] Sir Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham (ll. 258-261,\r\np. 14), was also a staunch Whig who broke with Walpole and joined the\r\nPatriots. He, too, was an intimate friend of Pope's who addressed the\r\nfirst moral essay to him and praised his famous gardens at Stowe in the\r\nfourth. John Campbell, Duke of Argyle (ll. 262-265, pp. 14-15) was a\r\ndistinguished soldier who joined the Opposition during the discussion of\r\nSpanish affairs. Both Pope and Thomson had celebrated his eloquence, and\r\nll. 262-263 here are a direct recollection of lines 86-87 in Pope's\r\n_Epilogue to the Satires: Dialogue II_:\r\n\r\n    ARGYLE, the State's whole Thunder born to wield,\r\n    And shake alike the Senate and the Field.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Carteret each of the persons named at the end of\r\nthe poem was either an acquaintance or a close friend of Pope's. We have\r\nhere one last example of the remarkable degree to which the author of\r\nthis pamphlet had assimilated the true facts of Pope's life into his\r\nfictional re-creation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccording to the title page, _The Great Man's Answer_ is by the same\r\nauthor as _Are these things so?_. Once again the setting is Pope's\r\ngrotto, but this time the poet engages Walpole in a direct dialogue. The\r\npoem begins with the poet being disturbed in his retreat by someone\r\n\"thundering at the gate.\" It is Walpole who has come to answer the\r\nquestions asked in _Are these things so?_. He maintains that Britain has\r\nnot fallen as low as Pope claims and that the Honour of the Fleet is\r\nstill intact. He defends his handling of Parliament, his fiscal\r\npolicies, his appointment of Placemen and Pensioners, his attitude to\r\nCommerce, and the self-aggrandisement involved in many of his contracts.\r\nThese defences, which only bring out a severer irony in Pope, lead up to\r\nWalpole's version of his own epitaph in contrast to that given him in\r\n_Are these things so?_. Where Pope had stressed his role as the\r\ngrave-digger of British Liberty, Walpole sees himself as the healer of\r\nfactions. Finally he falls back on his ultimate weapon of bribery. But\r\nhis offers of money, pension, place, title, and honour are turned down\r\nby the poet with increasing scorn, and the poem ends with appropriate\r\nfocus on Pope' incorruptibility.\r\n\r\nThe following notes are offered to help with the topical allusions.[36]\r\nThe poem opens with Pope directing his servant, John Serle (l. 7, p. 1),\r\nto see who is thundering at his gate. This is a playful allusion to the\r\nfamous opening of _An Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot_ where Serle had been\r\nurged to an exactly opposite course of action. The \"_Gazetteer_ Abuse\"\r\nscornfully mentioned by Pope (l. 37, p. 3) is a reference to _The Daily\r\nGazetteer_, a pro-Government newspaper which ran from 30 June 1735-20\r\nJune 1745. The incomplete words, \"Se--s\" (l. 66, p. 4) and \"P------ts!\"\r\n(l. 79, p. 5) refer to Senates and Parliaments respectively. Walpole's\r\nclaim (l. 89, p. 5) that \"_Gin_ would then be drank without control\"\r\nrefers to the government's Gin Act of 1736, which placed an excise of\r\nfive shillings a gallon on gin. His later claim that there would be \"No\r\n_License_ on the _Press_, or on the _Stage_\" (l. 98, p. 6) refers to the\r\nStage Licensing Act of 1737, which placed the theatre under the control\r\nof the Lord Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nFor Pope's ironic application of the epithet \"sturdy\" (l. 164, p. 9) to\r\nthe London Merchants see the notes to _Are these things so?_. Pope's\r\nmention of \"_Angria_\" (l. 204, p. 11) is a comparison of Walpole to a\r\nMahrattan pirate chief of the early part of the century. Walpole's\r\nintroduction to his own epitaph, \"They _best_ can speak it, who will\r\n_feel_ it most\" (l. 223, p. 12) is an allusion to Pope's _Eloisa to\r\nAbelard_ (l. 366): \"He best can paint 'em who shall feel 'em most.\"\r\n\r\n    UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN ONTARIO\r\n    London, Ontario, Canada\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO THE INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n[1] H.

See James T.\r\nHillhouse, \"The Man of Taste,\" _MLN_, XLIII (1928), 174-176. There is no\r\nevidence that Miller ever attacked Pope and, indeed, his political and\r\nliterary sympathies put him strongly on Pope's side.\r\n\r\n[24] Cibber, p. 333.\r\n\r\n[25] Maynard Mack, _The Garden and the City_ (Toronto, 1969), p. 190.\r\nMack is the first critic to pay any attention to these pamphlets and\r\nthis reprint is largely offered to supplement his illuminating and\r\nsuggestive book.\r\n\r\n[26] A. Pope, _The First Satire of the Second Book of Horace Imitated_\r\n(London, 1733), l. 121. It is perhaps interesting to note that according\r\nto J. V. Guerinot, _Pamphlet Attacks on Alexander Pope 1711-1744_\r\n(London, 1969), p. xlviii, \"No other line more infuriated the dunces,\r\nit was for them Pope's ultimate hypocrisy.\"\r\n\r\n[27] Walpole visited Pope sometime in the summer of 1725. See Pope's\r\nletter to Fortescue, 23 September 1725. _The Correspondence of Alexander\r\nPope_, ed. G. Sherburn (Oxford, 1956), II, 323.\r\n\r\n[28] For a full account of the ways in which Pope's actual retired life\r\nin his Twickenham villa, garden, and grotto became, in the 1730's,\r\nemblematic of the ideal of cultivated virtue, see Maynard Mack, _The\r\nGarden and the City_, especially Chapter VI.

Chapman (Oxford, 1953),\r\np. 91.\r\n\r\n[30] This assumption is based on Johnson's comment in his life of Pope\r\nthat \"the whole process was probably intended rather to intimidate Pope\r\nthan to punish Whitehead.\" S.

M._ _Corruption_, Sir!--pray use a milder Term;\r\n  'Tis only a Memento to be _firm_;\r\n  The Times are greatly alter'd--Years ago,\r\n  A Man would blush the World his _Price_ should know:\r\n  Scruple to own his _Voice_ was to be bought;\r\n  And meanly minded what the Million thought;\r\n  Our Age more _Prudent_, and _Sincere_ is grown,\r\n  The Hire they _wisely_ take, they _bravely_ own;\r\n  Laugh at the Fool, who let's his _Conscience_ stand,\r\n  To barr his Passage to the promis'd Land;\r\n  Or, sway'd by Prejudice, or puny Pride,\r\n  Thinks _Right_ and _Int'rest_ of a different Side.\r\n\r\n    _E. M._ _O Nation_ lost to Honour and to Shame!\r\n  So, then, Corruption now has chang'd its Name:\r\n  And what was once a paultry _Bribe_, to Day\r\n  Is gently stil'd an _Honourable_ Pay.\r\n  Blessings on that great Genius who has wrought\r\n  This strange Conversion--Who has bravely bought\r\n  Our Liberty from Virtue--Pray go on.\r\n    _G. M._ Of Commerce next you talk--pretend 'tis gone,\r\n  To _Foreign_ Climes--_Amen_, for what I care,\r\n  Perdition on the Merchants--They must dare!\r\n  To thwart my Purpose--I detest them--_E. M._ How!\r\n  _G. M._ Yes--And I think I'm _even_ with 'em now.\r\n  They would not be _convention'd_, nor _excis'd_,\r\n  But they shall feel the Scourge themselves advis'd;\r\n  They shall be swingingly _bewarr'd_, I'll swear;\r\n  And since they'd not my _little Finger_ bear,\r\n  My _Loins_ shall press 'em 'till they guilty plead,\r\n  And sue for Mercy at my Feet. _E. M._ Indeed!\r\n  _G. M._ Aye, trust me, shall they----_E. M._ But don't tell 'em so; }\r\n  For they're a stubborn _sturdy_ Gang you know,                      }\r\n  _G. M._ O! they'll be _supple_ when their Cash runs low.\r\n  Their _Purse_, which makes them proud and insolent,\r\n  A trav'ling with their Commerce shall be sent--\r\n  _E. M._ Take Care they don't send _you_ a trav'ling first;\r\n  _G. M._ No, Sir, I dare 'em now to do their Worst.\r\n  _Seven Sessions_ more I am at least secure--\r\n  _E. M._ Nay then you'll crush 'em quite?--But are you sure,\r\n  There is a _Spirit_, Sir? _G. M._ What Spirit pray?\r\n  A _Spirit_ that the _Treasury_ can't lay.\r\n  _E. M._ I'm answer'd Sir,--_G. M._ Next, Friend, one Word about\r\n  Those spiteful Innuendoes you throw out,\r\n  That squint at _Contracts_, _Forage_, and what not,\r\n  'Tis _more_ than Time that those Things were forgot.\r\n  You should not link the _present_ with the _past_--\r\n  _E. M._ Yes when they make one _glorious Whole_ at last;\r\n  When, tho' _Times differ_, _Actions_ still _agree_,\r\n  And what Men _were_ they _are_--What they _will_ be,\r\n  We safely may pronounce--_G. M._ Well, Sir, but why\r\n  On my dear Family and Friends this Cry?\r\n  Suppose they've Places, Wealth, and Titles too,\r\n  _Merit_ like Ours should surely have its _Due_.\r\n  That _squaemish_ Steward's of all Fools the worst,\r\n  That lays not up for his _own Houshold_ first;\r\n  Nor takes a _proper_ Care of those _staunch_ Friends,\r\n  By whose _good Services_ he gains his Ends.\r\n  Besides, who'd drudge the _Mill-Horse_ of the State;\r\n  Curst by the Vulgar, envy'd by the Great;\r\n  In one fastidious Round of Hurry live,\r\n  And join, in Toil, the _Matin_ with the _Eve_;\r\n  Be hourly plagu'd 'bout Pensions, Strings, Translations,\r\n  Or, worse! that _damn'd Affair_ of _Foreign_ Nations.\r\n  Make _War_ and _Treaties_ with alternate Pain:\r\n  First sweat to build, then to pull down again.\r\n  Who'd cringe at _Levees_, or in _Closets_--Oh!\r\n  Stoop to the _rough_ Remonstrance of the _Toe_?\r\n  Did not some Genius whisper, \"That's the Road\r\n  \"To Opulence, and Honours bless'd Abode;\r\n  \"Thus you may aggrandize yourself, and Race;\r\n  \"_Pension_ this _Knight_, or give that _Peer_ a _Place_.\"\r\n\r\n    _E. M._ So _Angria_, Sir, as justly might declare,\r\n  He _plunder'd_ only to _enrich_ his _Heir_;\r\n  Nor longer would his _Piracies_ pursue,\r\n  Than 'till he had _provided_ for his _Crew_.\r\n\r\n    _G.

M._ I'll say no more on't--_G.

And had they not, pray, _still_,\r\n  But that they greatly scorn'd to _league_ with those,\r\n  Who were at once their King's and Country's Foes?\r\n  _G. M._ Well, Sir, as there is nothing I can say\r\n  Will with your starch'd unbending Temper weigh;\r\n  My last _best_ Answer I'll in _Writing_ leave;\r\n  Pray mark it--_E. M._ How! May I my Eyes believe?\r\n  _G. M._ You may--I thought I should convince you, _E. M._ Yes,\r\n  That Fame for once spoke Truth--And as for _This_--\r\n  _G. M._ Furies! My _thousand Bank_, Sir, _E. M._ Thus I Tear,\r\n  Go, blend, _Corruption_, with _corrupting_ Air.\r\n  _G. M._ Amazing Frenzie! Well, if this won't do,\r\n  What think you of a _Pension_? _E. M._ As of _You_.\r\n  _G. M._ A _Place_--_E. M._ Be gone, _G. M._ A _Title_--_E. M._ is a _Lie_\r\n  When ill conferr'd _G. M._ A _Ribband_--_E. M._ I defie\r\n  Farewell then Fool--If you'll accept of _Neither_,\r\n  You and your _Country_ may be _damn'd_ together.\r\n\r\n_FINIS_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM ANDREWS CLARK\r\n    MEMORIAL LIBRARY\r\n    UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    THE AUGUSTAN REPRINT SOCIETY\r\n\r\n    PUBLICATIONS IN PRINT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE AUGUSTAN REPRINT SOCIETY\r\n\r\n    PUBLICATIONS IN PRINT\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n=1948-1949=\r\n\r\n16.
