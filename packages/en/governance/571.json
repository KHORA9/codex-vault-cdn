The Trust\r\nTerritory of the Pacific Islands became the independent nation of\r\nPalau. The gross domestic product (GDP) of all countries is now\r\npresented on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis rather than on the\r\nold exchange rate basis. There is a new entry on Age structure and the\r\nAirports entry now includes unpaved runways. The Communications\r\ncategory has been restructured and now includes the entries of\r\nTelephone system, Radio, and Television. The remainder of the entries\r\nin the former Communications category-Railroads, Highways, Inland\r\nwaterways, Pipelines, Ports, Merchant marine, and Airports-can now be\r\nfound under a new category called Transportation. There is a new\r\nappendix listing estimates of gross domestic product on an exchange\r\nrate basis for all nations. A reference map of the Republic of South\r\nAfrica is included. The electronic files used to produce the Factbook\r\nhave been restructured into a database. As a result, the formats of\r\nsome entries in this edition have been changed. Additional changes\r\nwill occur in the 1996 Factbook.\r\n\r\nAbbreviations: (see Appendix B for abbreviations for international\r\norganizations and groups and Appendix D for abbreviations for selected\r\ninternational environmental agreements)\r\navdp. -- avoirdupois\r\n    c.i.f. -- cost, insurance, and freight\r\n    CY -- calendar year\r\n    DWT -- deadweight ton\r\n    est. -- estimate\r\n    Ex-Im -- Export-Import Bank of the United States\r\n    f.o.b. -- free on board\r\n    FRG -- Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany); used for\r\n    information dated before 3 October 1990 or CY91\r\n    FSU -- former Soviet Union\r\n    FY -- fiscal year\r\n    FYROM -- The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\r\n    GDP -- gross domestic product\r\n    GDR -- German Democratic Republic (East Germany); used for\r\n    information dated before 3 October 1990 or CY91\r\n    GNP -- gross national product\r\n    GRT -- gross register ton\r\n    GWP -- gross world product\r\n    km -- kilometer\r\n    kW -- kilowatt\r\n    kWh -- kilowatt hour\r\n    m -- meter\r\n    NA -- not available\r\n    NEGL -- negligible\r\n    nm -- nautical mile\r\n    NZ -- New Zealand\r\n    ODA -- official development assistance\r\n    OOF -- other official flows\r\n    PDRY -- People's Democratic Republic of Yemen [Yemen (Aden) or\r\n    South Yemen]; used for information dated before 22 May 1990 or\r\n    CY91\r\n    sq km -- square kilometer\r\n    sq mi -- square mile\r\n    UAE -- United Arab Emirates\r\n    UK -- United Kingdom\r\n    US -- United States\r\n    USSR -- Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Union); used\r\n    for information dated before 25 December 1991\r\n    YAR -- Yemen Arab Republic [Yemen (Sanaa) or North Yemen]; used\r\n    for information dated before 22 May 1990 or CY91\r\n\r\nAdministrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and\r\nfirst-order administrative divisions are generally those approved by\r\nthe US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been\r\nreported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.\r\n\r\nAirports: Only airports with usable runways are included in this\r\nlisting. For airports with more than one runway, only the longest\r\nrunway is included. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,\r\nmaintenance, or air traffic control. Paved runways have concrete or\r\nasphalt surfaces; unpaved runways have grass, dirt, sand, or gravel\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\nArea: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by\r\ninternational boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate\r\nof all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or\r\ncoastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).\r\nComparative areas are based on total area equivalents. Most entities\r\nare compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states. The smaller\r\nentities are compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The\r\nMall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).\r\n\r\nBirth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per\r\n1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. Dates of\r\ninformation: In general, information available as of 1 January 1995 is\r\nused in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are\r\nestimates for 1 July 1995, with population growth rates estimated for\r\ncalendar year 1995. Major political events have been updated through\r\nApril 1995.\r\n\r\nDeath rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per\r\nl,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.\r\n\r\nDigraphs: The digraph is a two-letter \"country code\" that precisely\r\nidentifies every entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF,\r\nfor example, is the digraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized\r\ngeopolitical data element promulgated in the Federal Information\r\nProcessing Standards Publication (FIPS) 10-3 by the National Bureau of\r\nStandards (now called National Institute of Standards and Technology)\r\nat the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the Office of the\r\nGeographer at the US Department of State. The digraph is used to\r\neliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing,\r\nand dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful for\r\ninterchanging data between databases.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations\r\nwith 184 nations, including 178 of the 185 UN members (excluded UN\r\nmembers are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia,\r\nand the US itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with\r\n6 nations that are not in the UN - Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,\r\nSwitzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.\r\n\r\nEconomic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is\r\ndefined as financial assistance which is concessional in character,\r\nhas the main objective to promote economic development and welfare of\r\nLDCs, and contains a grant element of at least 25%. OOF transactions\r\nare also official government assistance, but with a main objective\r\nother than development and with a grant element less than 25%. OOF\r\ntransactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im Bank\r\ncredits), official equity and portfolio investment, and debt\r\nreorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional\r\nterms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are\r\ninitialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration\r\nof intent.\r\n\r\nEntities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special\r\nsovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not\r\nindependent, and others are not officially recognized by the US\r\nGovernment. \"Nation\" refers to a people politically organized into a\r\nsovereign state with a definite territory. \"Dependent area\" refers to\r\na broad category of political entities that are associated in some way\r\nwith a nation. Names used for page headings are usually the short-form\r\nnames as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. There are 266\r\nentities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:\r\n\r\nNATIONS\r\n184 -- UN members (excluding the former Yugoslavia, which is still\r\n    counted by the UN)\r\n    7 -- nations that are not members of the UN--Holy See, Kiribati,\r\n    Nauru, Serbia and Montenegro, Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu\r\n\r\nOTHER\r\n1 -- Taiwan\r\n\r\nDEPENDENT AREAS\r\n6 -- Australia--Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, Cocos\r\n    (Keeling) Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and McDonald\r\n    Islands, Norfolk Island\r\n    2 -- Denmark--Faroe Islands, Greenland\r\n    16 -- France--Bassas da India, Clipperton Island, Europa Island,\r\n    French Guiana, French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic\r\n    Lands, Glorioso Islands, Guadeloupe, Juan de Nova Island,\r\n    Martinique, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Reunion, Saint Pierre and\r\n    Miquelon, Tromelin Island, Wallis and Futuna\r\n    2 -- Netherlands--Aruba, Netherlands Antilles\r\n    3 -- New Zealand--Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau\r\n    3 -- Norway--Bouvet Island, Jan Mayen, Svalbard\r\n    1 -- Portugal--Macau\r\n    16 -- United Kingdom--Anguilla, Bermuda, British Indian Ocean\r\n    Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland\r\n    Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Isle of Man,\r\n    Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, South Georgia and the\r\n    South Sandwich Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands\r\n    14 -- United States--American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland\r\n    Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway\r\n    Islands, Navassa Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Palmyra Atoll,\r\n    Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Wake Island\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n6 -- Antarctica, Gaza Strip, Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, West\r\n    Bank, Western Sahara\r\n\r\nOTHER ENTITIES\r\n4 -- oceans--Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean\r\n\r\n    1 -- World\r\n    266 -- total\r\n\r\nExchange rate:\r\nThe official value of a nation's monetary unit at a given date or over\r\na given period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per US\r\ndollar and as determined by international market forces or official\r\nfiat.\r\n\r\nGDP methodology: In the \"Economy\" section, GDP dollar estimates for\r\nall countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)\r\ncalculations rather than from conversions at official currency\r\nexchange rates. The PPP method normally involves the use of\r\ninternational dollar price weights, which are applied to the\r\nquantities of goods and services produced in a given economy. In\r\naddition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries,\r\nthe statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying,\r\nand allowing for the quality of goods and services. The division of a\r\nGDP estimate in local currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in\r\ndollars gives the PPP conversion rate. On average, one thousand\r\ndollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one\r\nthousand dollars - converted to the local currency at the PPP\r\nconversion rate - will buy in the other country. Whereas PPP estimates\r\nfor OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing\r\ncountries are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP estimates\r\nare based on extrapolation of numbers published by the UN\r\nInternational Comparison Program and by Professors Robert Summers and\r\nAlan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues.\r\nCurrency exchange rates depend on a variety of international and\r\ndomestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic\r\noutput. In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate\r\nestimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP\r\nestimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by\r\n10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real\r\noutput has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14\r\ncountries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are\r\ntied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move,\r\nof course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One\r\nimportant caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a\r\npercentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially\r\nfrom the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as,\r\nfor example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of\r\nRussian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: The numbers for GDP\r\nand other economic data can not be chained together from successive\r\nvolumes of the Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring\r\nrod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or\r\ndifferent sources of information, and changes in national statistical\r\nmethods and practices.\r\n\r\nGross domestic product (GDP): The value of all final goods and\r\nservices produced within a nation in a given year.\r\n\r\nGross national product (GNP): The value of all final goods and\r\nservices produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned\r\nabroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production.\r\n\r\nGross world product (GWP): The aggregate value of all goods and\r\nservices produced worldwide in a given year.\r\n\r\nGrowth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population,\r\nresulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the\r\nbalance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be\r\npositive or negative.\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs - narcotics,\r\nstimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis.\r\nThese categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by\r\ndoctors as well as those illegally produced and sold outside medical\r\nchannels.\r\nCannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides\r\nhallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana\r\n(pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,\r\nMarinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).\r\nCoca (Erythroxylum coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the\r\nstimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,\r\nwhich comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,\r\nand cocoa butter.\r\nCocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.\r\nDepressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and\r\ninclude chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,\r\nphenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone\r\n(Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,\r\nValmid). Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical,\r\nmental, emotional, or behavioral change in an individual. Drug abuse\r\nis the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in\r\nphysical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an\r\nindividual. Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,\r\nself-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid,\r\nmicrodot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine\r\nvariants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog),\r\nphencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin,\r\npsilocyn).\r\nHashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant\r\n(Cannabis sativa).\r\nHeroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.\r\nMandrax is the Southwest Asian slang term for methaqualone, a\r\npharmaceutical depressant.\r\nMarijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis\r\nsativa).\r\nMethaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, in slang referred to as\r\nQuaaludes in North America or Mandrax in Southwest Asia Narcotics are\r\ndrugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium, opium\r\nderivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include\r\nopium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),\r\ncodeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC),\r\nand thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack),\r\nand hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine\r\nor Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose),\r\nand others (Darvon, Lomotil).\r\nOpium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium\r\npoppy. Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural\r\nand semisynthetic narcotics. Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid\r\nderived from the mature dried opium poppy.\r\nQat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of catha edulis\r\nthat is chewed or drunk as tea.\r\nQuaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a\r\npharmaceutical depressant.\r\nStimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and\r\nactivity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines\r\n(Desoxyn, Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate\r\n(Ritalin), and others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year\r\nold in a given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.\r\n\r\nInternational disputes: This category includes a wide variety of\r\nsituations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to\r\nunilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding\r\ndisputes over international boundaries and maritime boundaries has\r\nbeen reviewed by the Department of State. References to other\r\nsituations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such\r\nas resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.\r\nHowever, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance\r\nor recognition by the US Government.\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: The figure refers to the land area that is\r\nartificially supplied with water.\r\n\r\nLand use: The land surface is categorized as arable land - land\r\ncultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat,\r\nmaize, rice); permanent crops - land cultivated for crops that are not\r\nreplanted after each harvest (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and\r\npastures - land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops; forest\r\nand woodland - under dense or open stands of trees; and other - any\r\nland type not specifically mentioned above (urban areas, roads,\r\ndesert).\r\n\r\nLeaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who\r\nrepresents the state at official and ceremonial functions but is not\r\ninvolved with the day- to-day activities of the government. The head\r\nof government is the administrative leader who manages the day-to-day\r\nactivities of the government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief of\r\nstate, and the Prime Minister is the head of government. In the US,\r\nthe President is both the chief of state and the head of government.\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a\r\ngroup of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age\r\nremains constant in the future.\r\n\r\nLiteracy: There are no universal definitions and standards of\r\nliteracy. Unless otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most\r\ncommon definition - the ability to read and write at a specified age.\r\nDetailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the\r\nability to read and write is beyond the scope of this publication.\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some\r\nnational claims from being extended the full distance.\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All\r\ncommercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which\r\nexcludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. Also, a\r\ngrouping of merchant ships by nationality or register.\r\nCaptive register - A register of ships maintained by a territory,\r\npossession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships\r\nowned in the parent country; also referred to as an offshore register,\r\nthe offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive\r\nregister will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local\r\nvariant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation\r\nrules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive\r\nregister makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent\r\ncountry, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned\r\nabroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience\r\nregister, except that it is not the register of an independent state.\r\nFlag of convenience register - A national register offering\r\nregistration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major\r\nflags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue\r\nof low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal\r\nmanning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having\r\nrelatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag\r\nstate. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a\r\ngiven set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority\r\nof the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an\r\nopen register.\r\nFlag state - The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds\r\nlegal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or\r\nabroad. Flag state maritime legislation determines how a ship is\r\nmanned and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the\r\nregister.\r\nInternal register - A register of ships maintained as a subset of a\r\nnational register. Ships on the internal register fly the national\r\nflag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of\r\nmaritime rules from those on the main national register. These\r\ndifferences usually include lower taxation of profits, manning by\r\nforeign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state\r\n(when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International\r\nShip Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most\r\nnotable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental\r\nin stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and\r\nin attracting foreign owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.\r\nMerchant ship - A vessel that carries goods against payment of\r\nfreight; commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately\r\nrestricted to commercial vessels only.\r\nRegister - The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed\r\nwith the maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of\r\nsuch individual ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides\r\nit with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country\r\nin which registered (the flag state) regardless of the nationality of\r\nthe ship's ultimate owner.\r\n\r\nMoney figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US\r\ndollars unless otherwise indicated.\r\n\r\nNational product: The total output of goods and services in a country\r\nin a given year. See GDP methodology, Gross domestic product (GDP),\r\nand Gross national product (GNP).\r\n\r\nNet migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering\r\nand leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on\r\nmidyear population). An excess of persons entering the country is\r\nreferred to as net immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an\r\nexcess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (-9.26\r\nmigrants/1,000 population).\r\n\r\nPopulation: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based\r\non statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration\r\nsystems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on\r\nassumptions about future trends. Starting with the 1993 Factbook,\r\ndemographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have taken\r\ninto account the effects of the growing incidence of AIDS infections;\r\nin 1993 these countries were Burkina, Burundi, Central African\r\nRepublic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania,\r\nUganda, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Brazil, and Haiti.\r\n\r\nTelephone numbers: All telephone numbers presented in the Factbook\r\nconsist of the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where\r\nrequired) in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that\r\nis not presented is the international access code which varies from\r\ncountry to country. For example, an international direct dial phone\r\ncall placed from the United States to Madrid, Spain, would be as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where\r\n    011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls\r\n    (01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),\r\n    [34] is the country code for Spain,\r\n    (1) is the city code for Madrid,\r\n    577 is the local exchange,\r\n    and xxxx is the local telephone number.\r\n\r\nAn international direct dial phone call placed from another country to\r\nthe United States would be as follows:\r\n\r\ninternational access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx where\r\n    [1] is the country code for the United States,\r\n    (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,\r\n    939 is the local exchange,\r\n    and xxxx is the local telephone number.\r\n\r\nTotal fertility rate: The average number of children that would be\r\nborn per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing\r\nyears and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each\r\nage. Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless\r\nindicated as fiscal year (FY). FY93/94 refers to the fiscal year that\r\nbegan in calendar year 1993 and ended in calendar year 1994 as defined\r\nin the Fiscal Year entry of the Economy section for each nation.\r\nFY90-94 refers to the four fiscal years that began in calendar year\r\n1990 and ended in calendar year 1994.\r\n\r\nNote: Information for the US and US dependencies was compiled from\r\nmaterial in the public domain and does not represent Intelligence\r\nCommunity estimates. The Handbook of International Economic\r\nStatistics, published annually in September by the Central\r\nIntelligence Agency, contains detailed economic information for the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\r\ncountries, Eastern Europe, the newly independent republics of the\r\nformer nations of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and selected other\r\ncountries.

Economic considerations have played second fiddle to\r\n political and military upheavals during more than 15 years of war,\r\n including the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended\r\n 15 February 1989). Over the past decade, one-third of the population\r\n fled the country, with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million\r\n refugees and Iran about 3 million. About 1.4 million Afghan refugees\r\n remain in Pakistan and about 2 million in Iran. Another 1 million\r\n probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan.\r\n Although reliable data are unavailable, gross domestic product is\r\n lower than 13 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and\r\n the disruption of trade and transport.\r\n\r\nNational product: GDP $NA\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $NA\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 56.7% (1991)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA million (1991\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $188.2 million (f.o.b., 1991)\r\n commodities: fruits and nuts, handwoven carpets, wool, cotton, hides\r\n and pelts, precious and semi-precious gems\r\n partners: FSU countries, Pakistan, Iran, Germany, India, UK, Belgium,\r\n Luxembourg, Czechoslovakia\r\n\r\n Imports: $616.4 million (c.i.f., 1991)\r\n commodities: food and petroleum products;

The\r\n economy rebounded in 1993-94 after a severe depression accompanying\r\n the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in 1990 and\r\n 1991. Stabilization policies - including a strict monetary policy,\r\n public sector layoffs, and reduced social services - have improved the\r\n government's fiscal situation and reduced inflation. The recovery was\r\n spurred by the remittances of some 20% of the population which works\r\n abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP\r\n and help offset the large foreign trade deficit. Foreign assistance\r\n and humanitarian aid also supported the recovery. Most agricultural\r\n land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes.\r\n Albania's limited industrial sector, now less than one-sixth of GDP,\r\n continued to decline in 1994. A sharp fall in chromium prices reduced\r\n hard currency receipts from the mining sector. Large segments of the\r\n population, especially those living in urban areas, continue to depend\r\n on humanitarian aid to meet basic food requirements. Unemployment\r\n remains a severe problem accounting for approximately one-fifth of the\r\n work force. Growth is expected to continue in 1995, but could falter\r\n if Albania becomes involved in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,\r\n workers' remittances from Greece are reduced, or foreign assistance\r\n declines.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $3.8 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 11% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,110 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 16% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 18% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.1 billion\r\n expenditures: $1.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $70\r\n million (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $112 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: asphalt, metals and metallic ores, electricity, crude\r\n oil, vegetables, fruits, tobacco\r\n partners: Italy, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Germany,\r\n Greece, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary\r\n\r\n Imports: $621 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: machinery, consumer goods, grains\r\n partners: Italy, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Germany,\r\n Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece\r\n\r\n External debt: $920 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -10% (1993 est.);

Algiers'\r\n efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the\r\n Arab world began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged\r\n the country into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched\r\n a comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve macroeconomic\r\n stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy.\r\n Despite substantial progress toward macroeconomic adjustment, in 1992\r\n the reform drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political\r\n turmoil. In September 1993, a new government was formed, and one\r\n priority was the resumption and acceleration of the structural\r\n adjustment process.

Administration is carried\r\n out through consultative member meetings - the 18th Antarctic Treaty\r\n Consultative Meeting was in Japan in April 1993. Currently, there are\r\n 42 treaty member nations: 26 consultative and 16 acceding.\r\n Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim\r\n portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and\r\n 19 nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations that have made\r\n no claims have reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize\r\n the claims of others. The year in parentheses indicates when an\r\n acceding nation was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while\r\n no date indicates the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory.\r\n Claimant nations are - Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New\r\n Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations are -\r\n Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989),\r\n Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989),\r\n Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain\r\n (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay (1985), the US, and Russia.

Nevertheless, following decades of\r\n mismanagement and statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was\r\n plagued with huge external debts and recurring bouts of\r\n hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession, President\r\n MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring program\r\n that shows signs of putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable\r\n growth. Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar\r\n since April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20\r\n years. Argentines have responded to the relative price stability by\r\n repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry. The\r\n economy registered an impressive 6% advance in 1994, fueled largely by\r\n inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption spending.\r\n The government's major short term objective is encouraging exports,\r\n e.g., by reducing domestic costs of production. At the start of 1995,\r\n the government had to deal with the spillover from international\r\n financial movements associated with the devaluation of the Mexican\r\n peso. In addition, unemployment had become a serious issue for the\r\n government. Despite average annual 7% growth in 1991-94, unemployment\r\n surprisingly has doubled - due mostly to layoffs in government bureaus\r\n and in privatized industrial firms and utilities and, to a lesser\r\n degree, to illegal immigration. Much remains to be done in the 1990s\r\n in dismantling the old statist barriers to growth, extending the\r\n recent economic gains, and bringing down the rate of unemployment.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $270.8 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $7,990 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3.9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 12% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $48.46 billion\r\n expenditures: $46.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $3.5\r\n billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $15.7 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: meat, wheat, corn, oilseed, manufactures\r\n partners: US 12%, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Netherlands\r\n\r\n Imports: $21.4 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: machinery and equipment, chemicals, metals, fuels and\r\n lubricants, agricultural products\r\n partners: US 22%, Brazil, Germany, Bolivia, Japan, Italy, Netherlands\r\n\r\n External debt: $73 billion (April 1994)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 12.5% accounts for 31% of GDP (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 17,330,000 kW\r\n production: 54.8 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 1,610 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: food processing, motor vehicles, consumer durables,\r\n textiles, chemicals and petrochemicals, printing, metallurgy, steel\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for 8% of GDP (including fishing);

Armenia is a large\r\n food importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The\r\n economic decline in recent years (1991-94) has been particularly\r\n severe due to the ongoing conflict over the ethnic Armenian-dominated\r\n region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey have\r\n blockaded pipeline and railroad traffic to Armenia for its support of\r\n the Karabakh Armenians. This has left Armenia with chronic energy\r\n shortages because of a lack of capacity and frequent disruptions of\r\n natural gas deliveries through unstable Georgia, as well as\r\n difficulties in obtaining other types of fuel. In addition, bread is\r\n strictly rationed and there are shortages of other goods. In 1994, the\r\n economy seemed to bottom out.

Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major\r\n exporter of agricultural products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels.\r\n Primary products account for more than 60% of the value of total\r\n exports, so that, as in 1983-84, a downturn in world commodity prices\r\n can have a big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for\r\n increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in\r\n international markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered\r\n from the low growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD\r\n countries in the early 1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly\r\n from the prolonged recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor\r\n being weak world demand for Australia's exports. Growth picked up so\r\n strongly in 1994 that the government felt the need for fiscal and\r\n monetary tightening by yearend. Australia's GDP grew 6.4% in 1994,\r\n largely due to increases in industrial output and business investment.\r\n A severe drought in 1994 is expected to reduce the value of\r\n Australia's net farm production by $825 million in the twelve months\r\n through June 1995, but rising world commodity prices are likely to\r\n boost rural exports by 7.7% to $14.5 billion in 1995/96, according to\r\n government statistics.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $374.6 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 6.4% (1994)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $20,720 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 2.5% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 8.9% (December 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $83.8 billion\r\n expenditures: $92.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (FY93/94)\r\n\r\n Exports: $50.4 billion (1994)\r\n commodities: coal, gold, meat, wool, alumina, wheat, machinery and\r\n transport equipment\r\n partners: Japan 25%, US 11%, South Korea 6%, NZ 5.7%, UK, Taiwan,\r\n Singapore, Hong Kong (1992)\r\n\r\n Imports: $51.1 billion (1994)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment, computers and office\r\n machines, crude oil and petroleum products\r\n partners: US 23%, Japan 18%, UK 6%, Germany 5.7%, NZ 4% (1992)\r\n\r\n External debt: $147.2 billion (1994)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 3.9% (FY93/94);

Thanks to its raw material endowment, a\r\n technically skilled labor force, and strong links to German industrial\r\n firms, Austria occupies specialized niches in European industry and\r\n services (tourism, banking) and produces almost enough food to feed\r\n itself with only 8% of the labor force in agriculture. After 11\r\n consecutive years of growth, the Austrian economy experienced a mild\r\n recession in 1993, but growth resumed in 1994. Unemployment is 4.3%\r\n and will likely stay at that level as companies adjust to the\r\n competition of EU membership beginning 1 January 1995.

The Karabakh Armenians have declared\r\n independence and seized almost 20% of the country's territory,\r\n creating almost 1 million Azeri displaced persons in the process. Both\r\n sides have generally observed a Russian-mediated cease-fire in place\r\n since May 1994, and support the OSCE-mediated peace process, now\r\n entering its fourth year. Nevertheless, Baku and Xankandi\r\n (Stepanakert) remain far apart on most substantive issues from the\r\n placement and composition of a peacekeeping force to the enclave's\r\n ultimate political status, and prospects for a negotiated settlement\r\n remain dim.\r\n\r\n@Azerbaijan:Geography\r\n\r\n Location: Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran\r\n and Russia\r\n\r\n Map references: Commonwealth of Independent States - European States\r\n\r\n Area:\r\n total area: 86,600 sq km\r\n land area: 86,100 sq km\r\n comparative area: slightly larger than Maine\r\n note: includes the exclave of Naxcivan Autonomous Republic and the\r\n Nagorno-Karabakh region;

It resembles the\r\n Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim population, high\r\n structural unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's\r\n most prominent products are oil, cotton, and gas. Production from the\r\n Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline for several years, but\r\n the November 1994 ratification of the $7.5 billion oil deal with a\r\n consortium of Western companies should generate the funds needed to\r\n spur future industrial development. Azerbaijan accounted for 1.5% to\r\n 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet Union.\r\n Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet\r\n republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy,\r\n but its considerable energy resources brighten its long-term\r\n prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on economic\r\n reform, and old economic ties and structures have yet to be replaced.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $13.8 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -22% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,790 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 28% monthly average (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 0.9% includes officially registered unemployed;\r\n also large numbers of other unemployed and underemployed workers\r\n (December 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $167.5 million\r\n expenditures: $234.6 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994)\r\n\r\n Exports: $366 million to non-FSU countries (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: oil and gas, chemicals, oilfield equipment, textiles,\r\n cotton (1991)\r\n partners: mostly CIS and European countries\r\n\r\n Imports: $296 million from non-FSU countries (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n commodities: machinery and parts, consumer durables, foodstuffs,\r\n textiles (1991)\r\n partners: European countries\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -25% (1994)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 4,900,000 kW\r\n production: 17.5 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 2,270 kWh (1994)\r\n\r\n Industries: petroleum and natural gas, petroleum products, oilfield\r\n equipment;

Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing fortunes of\r\n oil since 1985, for example, during and following the Gulf crisis of\r\n 1990-91. With its highly developed communication and transport\r\n facilities Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms with\r\n business in the Gulf. A large share of exports consists of petroleum\r\n products made from imported crude. Prospects for 1995 are good, with\r\n private enterprise the main driving force, e.g., in banking and\r\n construction.

Its economy is overwhelmingly agricultural, with the\r\n cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the economy.\r\n Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, the\r\n inefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly growing labor force\r\n that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy\r\n resources (natural gas), and inadequate power supplies. Excellent rice\r\n crops and expansion of the export garment industry led to real growth\r\n of 4% in 1992 and again in 1993.

It also\r\n serves as a transport link for Russian oil exports to the Baltic\r\n states and Eastern and Western Europe. The breakup of the Soviet Union\r\n and its command economy has resulted in a sharp economic contraction\r\n as traditional trade ties have collapsed. The Belarusian government\r\n has lagged behind the governments of most other former Soviet states\r\n in economic reform, with privatization almost nonexistent. The system\r\n of state orders and distribution persists. In mid-1994, the Belarusian\r\n government embarked on an austerity program with IMF support to slash\r\n state credits and consumer subsidies in order to bring down the budget\r\n deficit and reduce inflation. However, despite its promising start,\r\n the regime's drive to reinvigorate the economy has fallen short, and\r\n the IMF has criticized its failure to implement the reforms that the\r\n Fund had negotiated. As a result, the IMF has suspended talks on\r\n introducing a stand-by arrangement. Economic relations with Russia,\r\n which will have an important bearing on the future course of the\r\n economy, will be strengthened if Minsk adopts the necessary\r\n legislation to implement a customs union agreed to in January 1995.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $53.4 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -20% (1994)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $5,130 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 29% per month (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 1.4% officially registered unemployed (December\r\n 1993);

Growth\r\n in real output has averaged a sound 4% in 1991-94 but this rate barely\r\n exceeds the rapid population growth of 3.3%. Inflation jumped to 35%\r\n in 1994 (compared to 3% in 1993) following the 50% currency\r\n devaluation in January. Commercial and transport activities, which\r\n make up almost 36% of GDP, are extremely vulnerable to developments in\r\n Nigeria as evidenced by decreased reexport trade in 1994 due to a\r\n severe contraction in Nigerian demand. The industrial sector accounts\r\n for less than 10% of GDP and mainly produces foods, beverages, cement,\r\n and textiles. Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral\r\n creditors has eased the external debt situation in recent years. The\r\n government, still burdened with money-losing state enterprises and a\r\n bloated civil service, is gradually implementing a World Bank\r\n supported structural adjustment program.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $6.7 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,260 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 35% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $272 million (1993 est.)\r\n expenditures: $375 million, including capital expenditures of $84\r\n million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $332 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: cotton, crude oil, palm products, cocoa\r\n partners: FRG 36%, France 16%, Spain 14%, Italy 8%, UK 4%\r\n\r\n Imports: $571 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco, petroleum products,\r\n intermediate goods, capital goods, light consumer goods\r\n partners: France 20%, Thailand 8%, Netherlands 7%, US 5%\r\n\r\n External debt: $1 billion (December 1990 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -0.7% (1988);

Agriculture consists\r\n largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains\r\n dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other\r\n infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned\r\n with India's through strong trade and monetary links. The industrial\r\n sector is small and technologically backward, with most production of\r\n the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as road\r\n construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower\r\n potential and its attraction for tourists are key resources; however,\r\n the government limits the number of tourists to 4,000 per year to\r\n minimize foreign influence. Much of the impetus for growth has come\r\n from large public-sector companies. Nevertheless, in recent years,\r\n Bhutan has shifted toward decentralized development planning and\r\n greater private initiative. The government privatized several large\r\n public-sector firms, is revamping its trade regime and liberalizing\r\n administerial procedures over industrial licensing. The government's\r\n industrial contribution to GDP decreased from 13% in 1988 to about 11%\r\n in 1993.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $1.2 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $700 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 10% (October 1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $52 million\r\n expenditures: $150 million, including capital expenditures of $95\r\n million (FY93/94 est.)\r\n note: the government of India finances nearly three-fifths of Bhutan's\r\n budget expenditures\r\n\r\n Exports: $66.8 million (f.o.b., FY93/94)\r\n commodities: cardamon, gypsum, timber, handicrafts, cement, fruit,\r\n electricity (to India), precious stones, spices\r\n partners: India 87%, Bangladesh\r\n\r\n Imports: $97.6 million (c.i.f., FY93/94 est.)\r\n commodities: fuel and lubricants, grain, machinery and parts,\r\n vehicles, fabrics, rice\r\n partners: India 79%, Japan, UK, Germany, US\r\n\r\n External debt: $141 million (October 1994)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 7.6% (1992 est.);

However, Bolivia has experienced\r\n generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro\r\n administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies which\r\n reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ\r\n Estenssoro was followed as President by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93) who\r\n continued the free-market policies of his predecessor, despite\r\n opposition from his own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor\r\n movement. By maintaining fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce\r\n inflation to 9.3% in 1993, while GDP grew by an annual average of\r\n 3.25% during his tenure. Inaugurated in August 1993, President SANCHEZ\r\n DE LOZADA has vowed to advance the market-oriented economic reforms he\r\n helped launch as PAZ Estenssoro's planning minister. His successes so\r\n far have included an inflation rate that continues to decrease - the\r\n 1994 rate of 8.5% was the lowest in ten years - the signing of a free\r\n trade agreement with Mexico, and progress on his unique privatization\r\n plan. The main privatization bill was passed by the Bolivian\r\n legislature in late March 1994. Related laws - one that establishes\r\n SIRESE, the regulatory agency that will oversee the privatizations,\r\n and another that outlines the rules for privatization in the\r\n electricity sector - were approved later in the year.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $18.3 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $2,370 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 8.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 6.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $3.75 billion\r\n expenditures: $3.75 billion, including capital expenditures of $556.2\r\n million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $1.1 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: metals 39%, natural gas 9%, soybeans 11%, jewelry 11%,\r\n wood 8%\r\n partners: US 26%, Argentina 15% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.21 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: capital goods 48%, chemicals 11%, petroleum 5%, food 5%\r\n (1993 est.)\r\n partners: US 24%, Argentina 13%, Brazil 11%, Japan 11% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n External debt: $4.2 billion (January 1995)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 756,200 kW\r\n production: 2.116 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 367 kWh (1994)\r\n\r\n Industries: mining, smelting, petroleum, food and beverage, tobacco,\r\n handicrafts, clothing;

Bosnia's Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia -\r\n responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic\r\n along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to 'greater Serbia'. In\r\n March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats reduced the number of warring\r\n factions from three to two by signing an agreement in Washington, DC,\r\n creating the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A group of rebel\r\n Muslims, however, continues to battle government forces in the\r\n northwest enclave of Bihac. A Contact Group of countries, the US, UK,\r\n France, Germany, and Russia, continues to seek a resolution between\r\n the Federation and the Bosnian Serbs. In July of 1994 the Contact\r\n Group presented a plan to the warring parties that roughly equally\r\n divides the country between the two, while maintaining Bosnia in its\r\n current internationally recognized borders. The Federation agreed to\r\n the plan almost immediately, while the Bosnian Serbs rejected it.\r\n\r\n@Bosnia And Herzegovina:Geography\r\n\r\n Location: Southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea and Croatia\r\n\r\n Map references: Ethnic Groups in Eastern Europe, Europe\r\n\r\n Area:\r\n total area: 51,233 sq km\r\n land area: 51,233 sq km\r\n comparative area: slightly larger than Tennessee\r\n\r\n Land boundaries: total 1,459 km, Croatia 932 km, Serbia and Montenegro\r\n 527 km (312 km with Serbia; 215 km with Montenegro)\r\n\r\n Coastline: 20 km\r\n\r\n Maritime claims: NA\r\n\r\n International disputes: as of January 1995, Bosnian Government and\r\n Bosnian Serb leaders remain far apart on territorial and\r\n constitutional solutions for Bosnia; the two sides did, however, sign\r\n a four-month cessation of hostilities agreement effective January 1;\r\n the Bosnian Serbs continue to reject the Contact Group Plan submitted\r\n by the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Russia, and\r\n accepted by the Bosnian Government, which stands firm in its desire to\r\n regain lost territory and preserve Bosnia as a multiethnic state\r\n within its current borders; Bosnian Serb forces control approximately\r\n 70% of Bosnian territory\r\n\r\n Climate: hot summers and cold winters; areas of high elevation have\r\n short, cool summers and long, severe winters; mild, rainy winters\r\n along coast\r\n\r\n Terrain: mountains and valleys\r\n\r\n Natural resources: coal, iron, bauxite, manganese, timber, wood\r\n products, copper, chromium, lead, zinc\r\n\r\n Land use:\r\n arable land: 20%\r\n permanent crops: 2%\r\n meadows and pastures: 25%\r\n forest and woodland: 36%\r\n other: 17%\r\n\r\n Irrigated land: NA sq km\r\n\r\n Environment:\r\n current issues: air pollution from metallurgical plants; sites for\r\n disposing of urban waste are limited; widespread casualties, water\r\n shortages, and destruction of infrastructure because of civil strife\r\n natural hazards: frequent and destructive earthquakes\r\n international agreements: party to - Air Pollution, Law of the Sea,\r\n Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone\r\n Layer Protection\r\n\r\n@Bosnia And Herzegovina:People\r\n\r\n Population: 3,201,823 (July 1995 est.)\r\n note: all data dealing with population is subject to considerable\r\n error because of the dislocations caused by military action and ethnic\r\n cleansing\r\n\r\n Age structure:\r\n 0-14 years: 22% (female 337,787; male 370,966)\r\n 15-64 years: 68% (female 1,082,357; male 1,085,610)\r\n 65 years and over: 10% (female 190,992; male 134,111) (July 1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Population growth rate: 0.65% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Birth rate: 11.29 births/1,000 population (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Death rate: 7.51 deaths/1,000 population (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Net migration rate: 2.72 migrant(s)/1,000 population (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Infant mortality rate: 11.6 deaths/1,000 live births (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Life expectancy at birth:\r\n total population: 75.47 years\r\n male: 72.75 years\r\n female: 78.37 years (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Total fertility rate: 1.65 children born/woman (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Nationality:\r\n noun: Bosnian(s), Herzegovinian(s)\r\n adjective: Bosnian, Herzegovinian\r\n\r\n Ethnic divisions: Muslim 38%, Serb 40%, Croat 22% (est.)\r\n\r\n Religions: Muslim 40%, Orthodox 31%, Catholic 15%, Protestant 4%,\r\n other 10%\r\n\r\n Languages: Serbo-Croatian 99%\r\n\r\n Literacy: NA%\r\n\r\n Labor force: 1,026,254\r\n by occupation: NA%\r\n\r\n@Bosnia And Herzegovina:Government\r\n\r\n Note: The US recognizes the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Although agriculture has been almost all in private hands,\r\n farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic traditionally\r\n has been a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly\r\n overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central\r\n planning and management. TITO had pushed the development of military\r\n industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large\r\n share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of February 1995, Bosnia and\r\n Herzegovina was being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic\r\n warfare that has caused production to plummet, unemployment and\r\n inflation to soar, and human misery to multiply. No economic\r\n statistics for 1992-94 are available, although output clearly has\r\n fallen substantially below the levels of earlier years and almost\r\n certainly is well below $1,000 per head. The country receives\r\n substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from the international\r\n community.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $NA\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $NA\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $NA\r\n commodities: NA\r\n partners: NA\r\n\r\n Imports: $NA\r\n commodities: NA\r\n partners: NA\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate NA%;

regularly produces\r\n less than 50% of food needs; the foothills of northern Bosnia support\r\n orchards, vineyards, livestock, and some wheat and corn; long winters\r\n and heavy precipitation leach soil fertility reducing agricultural\r\n output in the mountains;

Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80%\r\n of the population but supplies only about 50% of food needs and\r\n accounts for only 5% of GDP. Subsistence farming and cattle raising\r\n predominate. The driving force behind the rapid economic growth of the\r\n 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry. This sector, mostly on\r\n the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating 25% of GDP in 1980\r\n to 39% in 1994. No other sector has experienced such growth,\r\n especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and\r\n poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Hampered\r\n by a still sluggish diamond market in 1994, GDP grew by only 1%.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $4.3 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 1% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $3,130 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 10% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 25% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.7 billion\r\n expenditures: $1.99 billion, including capital expenditures of $652\r\n million (FY93/94)\r\n\r\n Exports: $1.8 billion (f.o.b. 1994)\r\n commodities: diamonds 78%, copper and nickel 6%, meat 5%\r\n partners: Switzerland, UK, SACU (Southern African Customs Union)\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.8 billion (c.i.f., 1992)\r\n commodities: foodstuffs, vehicles and transport equipment, textiles,\r\n petroleum products\r\n partners: Switzerland, SACU (Southern African Customs Union), UK, US\r\n\r\n External debt: $344 million (December 1991)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 4.6% (FY92/93);

In addition, the economy remained highly\r\n regulated, inward-looking, and protected by substantial trade and\r\n investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and mining\r\n facilities is divided among private interests - including several\r\n multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings\r\n are private, with the government channeling financing to this sector.\r\n Conflicts between large landholders and landless peasants have\r\n produced intermittent violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed\r\n office in March 1990, launched an ambitious reform program that sought\r\n to modernize and reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices,\r\n deregulating the economy, and opening it to increased foreign\r\n competition. Itamar FRANCO, who assumed the presidency following\r\n President COLLOR's resignation in December 1992, was out of step with\r\n COLLOR's reform agenda; initiatives to redress fiscal problems,\r\n privatize state enterprises, and liberalize trade and investment\r\n policies lost momentum. Galloping inflation - by June 1994 the monthly\r\n rate had risen to nearly 50% - had undermined economic stability. In\r\n response, the then finance minister, Fernando Henrique CARDOSO,\r\n launched the third phase of his stabilization plan, known as Plano\r\n Real, that called for a new currency, the real, which was introduced\r\n on 1 July 1994. Inflation subsequently dropped to under 3% per month\r\n through the end of 1994. The newly elected President CARDOSO has\r\n called for the implementation of sweeping market-oriented reform,\r\n including public sector and fiscal reform, privatization,\r\n deregulation, and elimination of barriers to increased foreign\r\n investment.

Many aspects of a market economy have been put in\r\n place and have begun to function, but much of the economy, especially\r\n the industrial sector, has yet to re-establish market links lost with\r\n the collapse of the other centrally planned Soviet Bloc economies. The\r\n prices of many imported industrial inputs, especially energy products,\r\n have risen markedly, and falling real wages have not sufficed to\r\n restore competitiveness. The government plans more extensive\r\n privatization in 1995 to improve the management of enterprises and to\r\n encourage foreign investment.

Government policy in the last six years, 1989-94, has\r\n aimed at revitalizing the economy after four decades of tight central\r\n planning. Thus, private activity has markedly increased; foreign\r\n investment has been encouraged, so far with moderate success; and\r\n efforts continue to increase the efficiency of state enterprises.\r\n Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly understated\r\n because of the volume of black market trade. A major ongoing problem\r\n is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal stability.

Its economic health\r\n depends on the coffee crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange\r\n earnings. The ability to pay for imports therefore continues to rest\r\n largely on the vagaries of the climate and the international coffee\r\n market. As part of its economic reform agenda, launched in February\r\n 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi is trying to diversify\r\n its agricultural exports, attract foreign investment in industry, and\r\n modernize government budgetary practices. Although the government\r\n remains committed to reforms, it fears new austerity measures would\r\n add to ethnic tensions.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $3.7 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -13.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $600 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 10% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $318 million\r\n expenditures: $326 million, including capital expenditures of $150\r\n million (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $68 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: coffee 81%, tea, cotton, hides, and skins\r\n partners: EC 57%, US 19%, Asia 1%\r\n\r\n Imports: $203 million (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: capital goods 31%, petroleum products 15%, foodstuffs,\r\n consumer goods\r\n partners: EC 45%, Asia 29%, US 2%\r\n\r\n External debt: $1.05 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 11% (1991 est.);

Government leaders are moving toward\r\n restoring fiscal and monetary discipline and have established good\r\n working relations with international financial institutions. Growth,\r\n starting from a low base, has been strong in 1991-94. Despite such\r\n positive developments, the reconstruction effort faces many tough\r\n challenges because of the persistence of internal political divisions\r\n and the related lack of confidence of foreign investors. Rural\r\n Cambodia, where 90% of about 9.5 million Khmer live, remains mired in\r\n poverty. The almost total lack of basic infrastructure in the\r\n countryside will hinder development and will contribute to a growing\r\n imbalance in growth between urban and rural areas over the near term.\r\n Moreover, the government's lack of experience in administering\r\n economic and technical assistance programs and rampant corruption\r\n among officials will slow the growth of critical public sector\r\n investment. Inflation for 1994 as a whole was less than a quarter of\r\n the 1992 rate and was declining during the year.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $6.4 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $630 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 26%-30% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $190 million\r\n expenditures: $365 million, including capital expenditures of $120\r\n million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $283.6 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: timber, rubber, soybeans, sesame\r\n partners: Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia\r\n\r\n Imports: $479.3 million (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: cigarettes, construction materials, petroleum products,\r\n machinery\r\n partners: Singapore, Vietnam, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia\r\n\r\n External debt: $383 million to OECD members (1993)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 7.9% (1993 est.);

Still,\r\n it faces many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped\r\n countries, such as political instability, a top-heavy civil service,\r\n and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. The\r\n development of the oil sector led rapid economic growth between 1970\r\n and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986, precipitated by steep\r\n declines in the prices of major exports: coffee, cocoa, and petroleum.\r\n Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and inefficiencies in\r\n fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-93, with support from the IMF\r\n and World Bank, the government began to introduce reforms designed to\r\n spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, and\r\n recapitalize the nation's banks. Political instability, following\r\n suspect elections in 1992, brought IMF/WB structural adjustment to a\r\n halt. Although the 50% devaluation of the currency in January 1994\r\n improved the potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and is\r\n the main barrier to economic improvement.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $15.7 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -2.9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,200 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): -0.8% (FY91/92)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 25% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.6 billion\r\n expenditures: $2.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $226\r\n million (FY92/93 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $1.6 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: petroleum products, lumber, cocoa beans, aluminum,\r\n coffee, cotton\r\n partners: EC (particularly France) about 40%, African countries, US\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.96 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: machines and electrical equipment, food, consumer goods,\r\n transport equipment\r\n partners: EC about 60% (France 38%, Germany 9%), African countries,\r\n Japan, US 5%\r\n\r\n External debt: $6 billion (1991)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -2.1% (FY90/91);

The economy is service\r\n oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for\r\n 60% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural\r\n areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 20%; the fishing sector\r\n accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing\r\n potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape Verde\r\n annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances from\r\n emigrants and foreign aid, which form important supplements to GDP.\r\n Economic reforms, launched by the new democratic government in 1991,\r\n are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting foreign\r\n investment to diversify the economy. Prospects for 1995 depend heavily\r\n on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and the momentum of the\r\n government's development program.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $410 million (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 3.5% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 7% (1992)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 26% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $174 million\r\n expenditures: $235 million, including capital expenditures of $165\r\n million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $4.4 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\n commodities: fish, bananas, hides and skins\r\n partners: Netherlands, Portugal, Angola\r\n\r\n Imports: $173 million (c.i.f., 1992 est.)\r\n commodities: foodstuffs, consumer goods, industrial products,\r\n transport equipment\r\n partners: Portugal, Netherlands, Germany, Spain\r\n\r\n External debt: $156 million (1991)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 3.6% (1990 est.);

The agricultural sector generates about half\r\n of GDP. Timber has accounted for about 26% of export earnings and the\r\n diamond industry for 54%. Important constraints to economic\r\n development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor\r\n transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of\r\n misdirected macroeconomic policies. A major plus is the large forest\r\n reserves, which the government is moving to protect from\r\n overexploitation. The 50% devaluation of the currencies of 14\r\n Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed effects on\r\n CAR's economy. While diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports\r\n increased - leading GDP to increase by 5.5% - inflation rose to 40%,\r\n fueled by the rising prices of imports on which the economy depends.\r\n CAR's poor resource base and primitive infrastructure will keep it\r\n dependent on multilateral donors and France for the foreseeable\r\n future.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $2.2 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $700 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 40% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 30% (1988 est.) in Bangui\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $175 million\r\n expenditures: $312 million, including capital expenditures of $122\r\n million (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $123.5 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\n commodities: diamonds, timber, cotton, coffee, tobacco\r\n partners: France, Belgium, Italy, Japan, US\r\n\r\n Imports: $165.1 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\n commodities: food, textiles, petroleum products, machinery, electrical\r\n equipment, motor vehicles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, consumer goods,\r\n industrial products\r\n partners: France, other EC countries, Japan, Algeria\r\n\r\n External debt: $859 million (1991)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 4% (1990 est.);

Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil,\r\n conflict with Libya, drought, and food shortages. Consequently the\r\n economy has shown little progress in recent years in overcoming a\r\n severe setback brought on by civil war in the late 1980s. More than\r\n 80% of the work force is involved in subsistence farming and fishing.\r\n Cotton is the major cash crop, accounting for at least half of\r\n exports. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid, especially food\r\n credits, given chronic shortages in several regions. Of all the\r\n Francophone countries in Africa, Chad has benefited the least from the\r\n 50% devaluation of their currencies on 12 January 1994. Despite an\r\n increase in external financial aid and favorable price increases for\r\n cotton - the primary source of foreign exchange - the corrupt and\r\n enfeebled government bureaucracy continues to dampen economic\r\n enterprise by neglecting payments to domestic suppliers and public\r\n sector salaries. Oil production in the Lake Chad area remains a\r\n distant prospect and the subsistence-driven economy probably will\r\n continue to limp along in the near term.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $2.8 billion (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 3.5% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $530 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): -4.1% (1992)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $120 million\r\n expenditures: $363 million, including capital expenditures of $104\r\n million (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $190 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\n commodities: cotton 48%, cattle 35%, textiles 5%, fish\r\n partners: France, Nigeria, Cameroon\r\n\r\n Imports: $261 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\n commodities: machinery and transportation equipment 39%, industrial\r\n goods 20%, petroleum products 13%, foodstuffs 9%;

Under the center-left government\r\n of President AYLWIN, which took power in March 1990, spending on\r\n social welfare rose steadily. At the same time business investment,\r\n exports, and consumer spending also grew substantially. The new\r\n president, FREI, who took office in March 1994, has emphasized social\r\n spending even more. Growth in 1991-94 has averaged 6.5% annually, with\r\n an estimated one million Chileans having moved out of poverty in the\r\n last four years. Copper remains vital to the health of the economy;\r\n Chile is the world's largest producer and exporter of copper. Success\r\n in meeting the government's goal of sustained annual growth of 5%\r\n depends on world copper prices, the level of confidence of foreign\r\n investors and creditors, and the government's own ability to maintain\r\n a conservative fiscal stance.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $97.7 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4.3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $7,010 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 8.7% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $10.9 billion\r\n expenditures: $10.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.2\r\n billion (1993)\r\n\r\n Exports: $11.5 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: copper 41%, other metals and minerals 8.7%, wood products\r\n 7.1%, fish and fishmeal 9.8%, fruits 8.4% (1991)\r\n partners: EC 29%, Japan 17%, US 16%, Argentina 5%, Brazil 5% (1992)\r\n\r\n Imports: $10.9 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: capital goods 25.2%, spare parts 24.8%, raw materials\r\n 15.4%, petroleum 10%, foodstuffs 5.7%\r\n partners: EC 24%, US 21%, Brazil 10%, Japan 10% (1992)\r\n\r\n External debt: $20 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 4.3% (1993 est.);

To this end the authorities switched to a system of household\r\n responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization,\r\n increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in\r\n industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in\r\n services and light manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased\r\n foreign trade and investment. The result has been a strong surge in\r\n production, particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s. Industry\r\n also has posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong\r\n Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and modern\r\n production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and\r\n export goods. Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On\r\n the darker side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid\r\n system the worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude,\r\n corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up\r\n inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked, retightening\r\n central controls at intervals. In 1992-94 annual growth of GDP\r\n accelerated, particularly in the coastal areas - to more than 10%\r\n annually according to official claims. In late 1993 China's leadership\r\n approved additional long-term reforms aimed at giving more play to\r\n market-oriented institutions and at strengthening the center's control\r\n over the financial system. In 1994 strong growth continued in the\r\n widening market-oriented areas of the economy. At the same time, the\r\n government struggled to (a) collect revenues due from provinces,\r\n businesses, and individuals; (b) keep inflation within bounds; (c)\r\n reduce extortion and other economic crimes; and (d) keep afloat the\r\n large state-owned enterprises, most of which had not participated in\r\n the vigorous expansion of the economy. From 60 to 100 million surplus\r\n rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities, many\r\n barely subsisting through part-time low-pay jobs. Popular resistance,\r\n changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have\r\n weakened China's population control program, which is essential to the\r\n nation's long-term economic viability. One of the most dangerous\r\n long-term threats to continued rapid economic growth is the\r\n deterioration in the environment, notably air pollution, soil erosion,\r\n and the steady fall of the water table especially in the north.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $2.9788 trillion\r\n (1994 estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992 by\r\n use of official Chinese growth statistics for 1993-94;

President\r\n SAMPER, who took office in August 1994, has pledged to maintain those\r\n reforms while expanding government assistance for poor Colombians, who\r\n continue to make up about 40% of the population. In an effort to bring\r\n down inflation, SAMPER has arranged a \"social pact\" with business and\r\n labor to curtail price hikes and trim inflation to 18%. The rapid\r\n development of oil, coal, and other nontraditional industries, along\r\n with copious inflows of capital and strengthening of prices for\r\n coffee, have helped keep growth at 5%-6%. Development of the massive\r\n Cusiana oilfield provides the means to sustain this level over the\r\n next several years. Exporters say, however, that their sales have been\r\n hampered by the appreciation of the Colombian peso, and farmers have\r\n sought government help in adjusting to greater foreign competition.\r\n Moreover, increased foreign investment and even greater domestic\r\n growth have been hindered by an inadequate energy and transportation\r\n infrastructure and by violence stemming from drug trafficking and\r\n persistent rural insurgency.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $172.4 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5.7% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $4,850 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 22.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 7.9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $16 billion (1995 est.)\r\n expenditures: $21 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $8.3 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: petroleum, coffee, coal, bananas, fresh cut flowers\r\n partners: US 39%, EC 25.7%, Japan 2.9%, Venezuela 8.5% (1992)\r\n\r\n Imports: $10.6 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: industrial equipment, transportation equipment, consumer\r\n goods, chemicals, paper products\r\n partners: US 36%, EC 18%, Brazil 4%, Venezuela 6.5%, Japan 8.7% (1992)\r\n\r\n External debt: $12.6 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 5% (1994 est.);

The low\r\n educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence\r\n level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence\r\n on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including\r\n fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the economy.\r\n It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and\r\n provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient in\r\n food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for 90% of imports.\r\n The government is struggling to upgrade education and technical\r\n training, to privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, to\r\n improve health services, to diversify exports, and to reduce the high\r\n population growth rate. Continued foreign support is essential if the\r\n goal of 4% annual GDP growth is to be reached in the late 1990s.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $370 million (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 0.9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $700 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 15% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 15.8% (1989)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $83 million\r\n expenditures: $92 million, including capital expenditures of $32\r\n million (1992)\r\n\r\n Exports: $13.7 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: vanilla, ylang-ylang, cloves, perfume oil, copra\r\n partners: US 44%, France 40%, Germany 6%, Africa 5% (1992)\r\n\r\n Imports: $40.9 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: rice and other foodstuffs, petroleum products, cement,\r\n consumer goods\r\n partners: France 34%, South Africa 14%, Kenya 8%, Japan 4% (1992)\r\n\r\n External debt: $160 million (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -6.5% (1989 est.);

A reform program, supported by the IMF and World Bank,\r\n ran into difficulties in 1990-91 because of problems in changing to a\r\n democratic political regime and a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has\r\n supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing about\r\n two-thirds of government revenues and exports.

Consequently,\r\n the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international\r\n prices for coffee and cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite\r\n attempts by the government to diversify, the economy is still largely\r\n dependent on agriculture and related industries. After several years\r\n of lagging performance, the Ivorian economy began a comeback in 1994,\r\n due to improved prices for cocoa and coffee, growth in non-traditional\r\n primary exports such as pineapples and rubber, trade and banking\r\n liberalization, offshore oil and gas discoveries, and generous\r\n external financing and debt rescheduling by multilateral lenders and\r\n France. The 50% devaluation in January 1994 caused a one time jump in\r\n the inflation rate. Government adherence to a renewed structural\r\n adjustment program has led to a budget surplus for the first time in\r\n several years, a smaller personnel budget, and an increase in public\r\n investment.

At present, Croatian Serb Separatists control approximately\r\n one-third of the Croatian territory, and one of the overriding\r\n determinants of Croatia's long-term political and economic prospects\r\n will be the resolution of this territorial dispute. Croatia faces\r\n serious economic problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime\r\n Communist mismanagement of the economy; large foreign debt; damage\r\n during the fighting to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings, and\r\n houses; the large refugee population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and\r\n the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former\r\n Yugoslav republics, as well as within its own territory. At the\r\n minimum, extensive Western aid and investment, especially in the\r\n tourist and oil industries, would seem necessary to revive the\r\n moribund economy. However, peace and political stability must come\r\n first; only then will recent government moves toward a\r\n \"market-friendly\" economy restore old levels of output. As of February\r\n 1995, fighting continues among Croats, Serbs, and Muslims, and\r\n national boundaries and final political arrangements are still in\r\n doubt.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $12.4 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 3.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $2,640 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 17% (December 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $3.9 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment 30%, other\r\n manufacturers 37%, chemicals 11%, food and live animals 9%, raw\r\n materials 6.5%, fuels and lubricants 5% (1990)\r\n partners: EC countries, Slovenia\r\n\r\n Imports: $4.7 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment 21%, fuels and\r\n lubricants 19%, food and live animals 16%, chemicals 14%, manufactured\r\n goods 13%, miscellaneous manufactured articles 9%, raw materials 6.5%,\r\n beverages and tobacco 1% (1990)\r\n partners: EC countries, Slovenia, FSU countries\r\n\r\n External debt: $2.9 billion (September 1994)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 3,570,000 kW\r\n production: NA kWh\r\n consumption per capita: NA kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: chemicals and plastics, machine tools, fabricated metal,\r\n electronics, pig iron and rolled steel products, aluminum reduction,\r\n paper, wood products (including furniture), building materials\r\n (including cement), textiles, shipbuilding, petroleum and petroleum\r\n refining, food processing and beverages\r\n\r\n Agriculture: Croatia normally produces a food surplus;

Total output in 1994 was\r\n only about half the output of 1989. The fall in output and in imports\r\n is reflected in the deterioration of food supplies, shortages of\r\n electricity, inability to get spare parts, and the replacement of\r\n motor-driven vehicles by bicycles and draft animals. Higher world\r\n market prices for sugar and nickel in 1994, however, resulted in a\r\n slight increase in export earnings for the first time in six years,\r\n despite lower production of both commodities. The growth of tourism\r\n slowed in late 1994 as a result of negative publicity surrounding the\r\n exodus of Cubans from the island and other international factors. The\r\n government continued its aggressive search for foreign investment and\r\n announced preliminary agreements to form large joint ventures with\r\n Mexican investors in telecommunications and oil refining. In mid-1994,\r\n the National Assembly began introducing several new taxes and price\r\n increases to stem growing excess liquidity and restore some of the\r\n peso's value as a monetary instrument. In October the government\r\n attempted to stimulate food production by permitting the sale of any\r\n surplus production (over state quotas) at unrestricted prices at\r\n designated markets. Similar but much smaller markets were also\r\n introduced for the sale of manufactured goods in December. The various\r\n government measures have influenced a remarkable appreciation of the\r\n black market value of the peso, from more than 100 pesos to the dollar\r\n in September 1994 to 40 pesos to the dollar in early 1995.

Industry contributes 14% to GDP and employs 29% of the\r\n labor force, while the service sector contributes 53% to GDP and\r\n employs 57% of the labor force. An average 6.8% rise in real GDP\r\n between 1986 and 1990 was temporarily checked in 1991, because of the\r\n adverse effects of the Gulf war on tourism. After surging 8.5% in\r\n 1992, growth slowed to 2.0% in 1993 - its lowest level in two decades\r\n - because of the decline in tourist arrivals associated with the\r\n recession in Western Europe, Cyprus' main trading partner, and the\r\n loss in export competitiveness due to a sharp rise in unit labor\r\n costs. Real GDP is likely to have picked up in 1994, and inflation is\r\n estimated to have risen to between 5% and 6%. The Turkish Cypriot\r\n economy has less than one-third the per capita GDP of the south.\r\n Because it is recognized only by Turkey, it has had much difficulty\r\n arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to\r\n invest there. The economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture,\r\n which employs one-quarter of the work force. Moreover, because the\r\n Turkish lira is legal tender, the Turkish Cypriot economy has suffered\r\n the same high inflation as mainland Turkey. The small, vulnerable\r\n economy is estimated to have experienced a sharp drop in growth during\r\n 1994 because of the severe economic crisis affecting the mainland. To\r\n compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey provides direct and\r\n indirect aid to nearly every sector; financial support has risen in\r\n value to about one-third of Turkish Cypriot GDP.\r\n\r\n National product:\r\n Greek area: GDP - purchasing power parity - $7.3 billion (1994 est.)\r\n Turkish area: GDP - purchasing power parity - $510 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate:\r\n Greek area: 5% (1994 est.)\r\n Turkish area: -4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita:\r\n Greek area: $12,500 (1994 est.)\r\n Turkish area: $3,500 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n Greek area: 4.8% (1993)\r\n Turkish area: 63.4% (1992)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate:\r\n Greek area: 2.3% (1993)\r\n Turkish area: 1.2% (1992)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: Greek area - $1.8 billion Turkish area - $285 million\r\n expenditures: Greek area - $2.4 billion, including capital\r\n expenditures of $400 million Turkish area - $377 million, including\r\n capital expenditures of $80 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $868 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: citrus, potatoes, grapes, wine, cement, clothing and\r\n shoes\r\n partners: UK 18%, Greece 9%, Lebanon 14%, Germany 6%\r\n\r\n Imports: $2.6 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: consumer goods, petroleum and lubricants, food and feed\r\n grains, machinery\r\n partners: UK 13%, Japan 9%, Italy 10%, Germany 8%, US 8%\r\n\r\n External debt: $2.4 billion (1993)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 0.1% (1993);

GDP grew 2% in 1994 after stagnating in\r\n 1993 and contracting nearly 20% since 1990. Prague's mass\r\n privatization program, including its innovative distribution of\r\n ownership shares to Czech citizens via 'coupon vouchers,' has made the\r\n most rapid progress in Eastern Europe. When coupon shares are\r\n distributed in early 1995, 75%-80% of the economy will be in private\r\n hands or partially privatized, according to the Czech government.\r\n Privatized companies still face major problems in restructuring; the\r\n number of annual bankruptcies quadrupled in 1994. In September 1994,\r\n Prague repaid $471 million in IMF loans five years ahead of schedule,\r\n making the Czech Republic the first East European country to pay off\r\n all IMF debts. Despite these outlays, hard-currency reserves in the\r\n banking system totaled more than $8.5 billion in October. Standard &\r\n Poor's boosted the Republic's credit rating to BBB+ in mid-1994 - up\r\n from a BBB rating that was already two steps higher than Hungary's and\r\n one step above Greece's rating. Prague forecasts a balanced budget, at\r\n least 3% GDP growth, 5% unemployment, and single-digit inflation for\r\n 1995. Inflationary pressures - primarily as a result of foreign bank\r\n lending to Czech enterprises but perhaps also due to eased currency\r\n convertibility controls - are likely to be the most troublesome issues\r\n in 1995. Continuing economic recovery in Western Europe should boost\r\n Czech exports and production but a substantial increase in prices\r\n could erode the Republic's comparative advantage in low wages and\r\n exchange rates. Prague already took steps in 1994 to increase control\r\n over banking policies to neutralize the impact of foreign inflows on\r\n the money supply. Although Czech unemployment is currently the lowest\r\n in Central Europe, it will probably increase 1-2 percentage points in\r\n 1995 as large state firms go bankrupt or are restructured and service\r\n sector growth slows.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $76.5 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 2.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $7,350 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 10.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 3.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $14 billion\r\n expenditures: $13.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $13.4 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment,\r\n chemicals, fuels, minerals, metals, agricultural products\r\n (January-November 1994)\r\n partners: Germany 28.7%, Slovakia 15.5%, Austria 7.9%, Italy 6.4%,\r\n France 3.2%, Russia 3.2%, Poland 3.1%, UK 2.9%, Netherlands 2.4%,\r\n Hungary 2.2%, US 2.1%, Belgium 1.3% (January-June 1994)\r\n\r\n Imports: $13.3 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods,\r\n chemicals, fuels and lubricants, raw materials, agricultural products\r\n (January-November 1994)\r\n partners: Germany 24.1%, Slovakia 15.6%, Russia 9.8%, Austria 7.6%,\r\n Italy 4.9%, France 3.6%, US 3.2%, Netherlands 2.9%, UK 2.8%, Poland\r\n 2.7%, Switzerland 2.2%, Belgium 2.0% (January-June 1994)\r\n\r\n External debt: $8.7 billion (October 1994)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 4.9% (January-September 1994)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 14.470,000 kW\r\n production: 56.3 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 4,842 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: fuels, ferrous metallurgy, machinery and equipment, coal,\r\n motor vehicles, glass, armaments\r\n\r\n Agriculture: largely self-sufficient in food production;

Denmark is self-sufficient in food\r\n production. The new center-left coalition government will concentrate\r\n on reducing the persistent high unemployment rate and the budget\r\n deficit as well as following the previous government's policies of\r\n maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. In the face\r\n of recent international market pressure on the Danish krone, the\r\n coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency. The coalition\r\n hopes to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax\r\n revenues; boost industrial competitiveness through labor market and\r\n tax reforms and increased research and development funds; and improve\r\n welfare services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays.\r\n Prime Minister RASMUSSEN's reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to\r\n the criteria for European integration by 1999; although Copenhagen has\r\n won from the European Union (EU) the right to opt out of the European\r\n Monetary Union (EMU) if a national referendum rejects it. Denmark is,\r\n in fact, one of the few EU countries likely to fit into the EMU on\r\n time. Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better than\r\n many West European countries. After posting 4.5% real GDP growth in\r\n 1994, Copenhagen is predicting a continued strong showing in 1995,\r\n with real GDP up by 3.2%. The government expects an upswing in\r\n business investment in 1995 to drive economic growth. Although\r\n unemployment is high, it remains stable compared to most European\r\n countries.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $103 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $19,860 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 12.3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $56.5 billion\r\n expenditures: $64.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $42.9 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: meat and meat products, dairy products, transport\r\n equipment (shipbuilding), fish, chemicals, industrial machinery\r\n partners: EC 54.3% (Germany 23.6%, UK 10.1%, France 5.7%), Sweden\r\n 10.5%, Norway 5.8%, US 4.9%, Japan 3.6% (1992)\r\n\r\n Imports: $37.1 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: petroleum, machinery and equipment, chemicals, grain and\r\n foodstuffs, textiles, paper\r\n partners: EC 53.4% (Germany 23.1%, UK 8.2%, France 5.6%), Sweden\r\n 10.8%, Norway 5.4%, US 5.7%, Japan 4.1% (1992)\r\n\r\n External debt: $40.9 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -2.5% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 10,030,000 kW\r\n production: 32 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 5,835 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: food processing, machinery and equipment, textiles and\r\n clothing, chemical products, electronics, construction, furniture, and\r\n other wood products, shipbuilding\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for 4% of GDP;

Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital\r\n city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall\r\n limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most food must be\r\n imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the\r\n region and an international transshipment and refueling center. It has\r\n few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore,\r\n heavily dependent on foreign assistance (an important supplement to\r\n GDP) to help support its balance of payments and to finance\r\n development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be\r\n a major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over\r\n the last six years because of recession, civil war, and a high\r\n population growth rate (including immigrants and refugees).\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $500 million (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,200 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 6% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: over 30% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $164 million\r\n expenditures: $201 million, including capital expenditures of $16\r\n million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $184 million (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: hides and skins, coffee (in transit)\r\n partners: Somalia 48%, Yemen 42%\r\n\r\n Imports: $384 million (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: foods, beverages, transport equipment, chemicals,\r\n petroleum products\r\n partners: France, UK, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, South Korea\r\n\r\n External debt: $227 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 3% (1991 est.);

Agriculture accounts for about 30%\r\n of GDP and employs 40% of the labor force. Principal products include\r\n bananas, citrus, mangoes, root crops, and coconuts. Development of the\r\n tourist industry remains difficult because of the rugged coastline and\r\n the lack of an international airport. In 1994 a tropical storm\r\n devastated the banana industry.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $200 million (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 1.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $2,260 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 1.6% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 15% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $70 million\r\n expenditures: $84 million, including capital expenditures of $26\r\n million (FY90/91 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $48.3 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: bananas, soap, bay oil, vegetables, grapefruit, oranges\r\n partners: UK 55%, CARICOM countries, Italy, US\r\n\r\n Imports: $98.8 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: manufactured goods, machinery and equipment, food,\r\n chemicals\r\n partners: US 25%, CARICOM, UK, Japan, Canada\r\n\r\n External debt: $92.8 million (1992)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -10% (1994 est.);

After posting an increase of nearly 8% in 1992, GDP growth\r\n fell to 3% in 1993 and 1994 as mining output decreased and erosion of\r\n real wages caused private consumption to decline. A pre-election boost\r\n in government spending in early 1994 led to the first government\r\n deficit in four years and bumped inflation up to 14% for the year.\r\n Continued dynamism in construction and the services sector, especially\r\n tourism, should keep the economy growing in 1995. Tourism,\r\n agriculture, and manufacturing for export remain key sectors of the\r\n economy.

Growth has been uneven in recent years because of fluctuations\r\n in prices for Ecuador's primary exports - oil and bananas - as well as\r\n because of government policies designed to curb inflation. President\r\n Sixto DURAN-BALLEN launched a series of macroeconomic reforms when he\r\n came into office in August 1992 which included raising domestic fuel\r\n prices and utility rates, eliminating most subsidies, and bringing the\r\n government budget into balance. These measures helped to reduce\r\n inflation from 55% in 1992 to 25% in 1994. DURAN-BALLEN has a much\r\n more favorable attitude toward foreign investment than his predecessor\r\n and has supported several laws designed to encourage foreign\r\n investment. Ecuador has implemented free or complementary trade\r\n agreements with Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, as well\r\n as applied for World Trade Organization membership. Ecuador signed a\r\n standby agreement with the IMF and rescheduled its $7.6 billion\r\n commercial debt in 1994 thereby regaining access to multilateral\r\n lending. Growth in 1994 speeded up to 3.9%, based on increased exports\r\n of bananas and non-traditional products, while international reserves\r\n increased to a record $1.6 billion.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $41.1 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 3.9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $3,840 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 25% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 7.1% (1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $2.76 billion\r\n expenditures: $2.76 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994)\r\n\r\n Exports: $3.3 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: petroleum 39%, bananas 17%, shrimp 16%, cocoa 3%, coffee\r\n 6%\r\n partners: US 42%, Latin America 29%, Caribbean, EU countries 17%\r\n\r\n Imports: $3 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: transport equipment, consumer goods, vehicles, machinery,\r\n chemicals\r\n partners: US 28%, EU 17%, Latin America 31%, Caribbean, Japan\r\n\r\n External debt: $13.2 billion (yearend 1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 6.4% (1993);

Overregulation holds\r\n back technical modernization and foreign investment. Even so, the\r\n economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but in\r\n 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden\r\n of debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for\r\n balance-of-payments support. Egypt's first IMF standby arrangement\r\n concluded in mid-1987 was suspended in early 1988 because of the\r\n government's failure to adopt promised reforms. Egypt signed a\r\n follow-on program with the IMF and also negotiated a structural\r\n adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991. In 1991-93 the government\r\n made solid progress on administrative reforms such as liberalizing\r\n exchange and interest rates but resisted implementing major structural\r\n reforms like streamlining the public sector. As a result, the economy\r\n has not gained momentum and unemployment has become a growing problem.\r\n Egypt probably will continue making uneven progress in implementing\r\n the successor programs with the IMF and World Bank it signed onto in\r\n late 1993. Tourism has plunged since 1992 because of sporadic attacks\r\n by Islamic extremists on tourist groups. President MUBARAK has cited\r\n population growth as the main cause of the country's economic\r\n troubles.

Subsistence farming predominates. Although\r\n pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for\r\n hard currency earnings, the deterioration of the rural economy under\r\n successive brutal regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led\r\n growth. A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the\r\n international donor community have failed to revitalize export\r\n agriculture. Businesses for the most part are owned by government\r\n officials and their family members. Commerce accounts for about 8% of\r\n GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors for about\r\n 38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore,\r\n manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place\r\n under concessions offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been\r\n moderately successful. Increased production from recently discovered\r\n natural gas fields will provide a greater share of exports in 1995.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $280 million (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 7.3% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $700 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 1.6% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $32.5 million\r\n expenditures: $35.9 million, including capital expenditures of $3\r\n million (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $56 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: coffee, timber, cocoa beans\r\n partners: Spain 55.2%, Nigeria 11.4%, Cameroon 9.1% (1992)\r\n\r\n Imports: $62 million (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: petroleum, food, beverages, clothing, machinery\r\n partners: Cameroon 23.1%, Spain 21.8%, France 14.1%, US 4.3% (1992)\r\n\r\n External debt: $260 million (1992 est)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 11.3% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 23,000 kW\r\n production: 20 million kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 50 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: fishing, sawmilling\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for almost 50% of GDP, cash crops - timber and\r\n coffee from Rio Muni, cocoa from Bioko;

Three years after independence - and two\r\n years after the introduction of the kroon - Estonians are beginning to\r\n reap tangible benefits; inflation, though still high, was brought down\r\n to about 2% per month in second half 1994; production declines have\r\n bottomed out with estimated growth of 4% in 1994; and living standards\r\n are rising. Economic restructuring has been dramatic. By 1994 the\r\n service sector accounted for over 55% of GDP, while the once-dominant\r\n heavy industrial sector continues to shrink. The private sector is\r\n growing rapidly; the share of the state enterprises in the economy has\r\n steadily declined and by late 1994 accounted for only about 40% of\r\n GDP. Estonia's foreign trade has shifted rapidly from East to West;\r\n the Western industrialized countries now account for two-thirds of\r\n foreign trade.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $10.4 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $6,460 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3.3% per month (1994 average)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: about 2% in 1994 (official estimate but large\r\n number of underemployed workers)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $643 million\r\n expenditures: $639 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $1.65 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: textile 14%, food products 11%, vehicles 11%, metals 11%\r\n (1993)\r\n partners: Russia, Finland, Sweden, Germany\r\n\r\n Imports: $1 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n commodities: machinery 18%, fuels 15%, vehicles 14%, textiles 10%\r\n (1993)\r\n partners: Finland, Russia, Germany, Sweden\r\n\r\n External debt: $650 million (end of 1991)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -27% (1993)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 3,420,000 kW\r\n production: 11.3 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 6,528 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: oil shale, shipbuilding, phosphates, electric motors,\r\n excavators, cement, furniture, clothing, textiles, paper, shoes,\r\n apparel\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for 10% of GDP;

Its economy is based on\r\n agriculture, which accounts for about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and\r\n 80% of total employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The\r\n agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought, poor\r\n cultivation practices, and deterioration of internal security\r\n conditions. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs\r\n from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but\r\n less than 10% of agriculture, is state run. The government is\r\n considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants, and is\r\n implementing reform measures that are gradually liberalizing the\r\n economy. A major medium-term problem is the improvement of roads,\r\n water supply, and other parts of an infrastructure badly neglected\r\n during years of civil strife.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $20.3 billion (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $380 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 10% (FY93/94)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.2 billion\r\n expenditures: $1.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $707\r\n million (FY93/94)\r\n\r\n Exports: $219.8 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: coffee, leather products, gold\r\n partners: Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.04 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: capital goods, consumer goods, fuel\r\n partners: US, Germany, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Japan\r\n\r\n External debt: $3.7 billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -3.3% (FY91/92);

crops furnish winter\r\n fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and the\r\n sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the\r\n surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So\r\n far, efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been\r\n unsuccessful. The economy has diversified since 1987 when the\r\n government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers\r\n operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license\r\n fees total more than $40 million per year and support the island's\r\n health, education, and welfare system. To encourage tourism, the\r\n Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges for\r\n visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing. The\r\n islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British\r\n Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the\r\n islands in 1993 and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves\r\n capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP $NA\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $NA\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 7.4% (1980-87 average)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%;

When the nations\r\n of the world extended their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the\r\n early 1970s, the Faroese no longer could continue their traditional\r\n long-distance fishing and subsequently depleted their own nearby\r\n fishing areas. The government's tight controls on fish stocks and its\r\n austerity measures have caused a recession, and subsidy cuts will\r\n force nationalization in the fishing industry, which has already been\r\n plagued with bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to withhold its\r\n annual subsidy of $130 million - roughly one-third of the islands'\r\n budget revenues - unless the Faroese make significant efforts to\r\n balance their budget. To this extent the Faroe government is expected\r\n to continue its tough policies, including introducing a 20%\r\n value-added tax (VAT) in 1993, and has agreed to an IMF\r\n economic-political stabilization plan. In addition to its annual\r\n subsidy, the Danish government has bailed out the second largest Faroe\r\n bank to the tune of $140 million since October 1992.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $662 million (1989\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -10.8% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $14,000 (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 6.8% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 23% (1993)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $407.2 million\r\n expenditures: $482.7 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $345.3 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: fish and fish products 88%, animal feedstuffs, transport\r\n equipment (ships) (1989)\r\n partners: Denmark 20%, Germany 18.3%, UK 14.2%, France 11.2%, Spain\r\n 7.9%, US 4.5%\r\n\r\n Imports: $234.4 million (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment 24.4%, manufactures\r\n 24%, food and livestock 19%, fuels 12%, chemicals 6.5%\r\n partners: Denmark 43.8%, Norway 19.8%, Sweden 4.9%, Germany 4.2%, US\r\n 1.3%\r\n\r\n External debt: $1.2 billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate NA%\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 90,000 kW\r\n production: 200 million kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 3,953 kWh (1992)\r\n\r\n Industries: fishing, shipbuilding, handicrafts\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for 27% of GDP;

Sugar exports and tourism are the major sources of\r\n foreign exchange. Industry contributes 13% to GDP, with sugar\r\n processing accounting for one-third of industrial activity. Roughly\r\n 250,000 tourists visit each year. Political uncertainty and drought,\r\n however, contribute to substantial fluctuations in earnings from\r\n tourism and sugar and to the emigration of skilled workers. In 1992,\r\n growth was approximately 3%, based on growth in tourism and a\r\n lessening of labor-management disputes in the sugar and gold-mining\r\n sectors. In 1993, the government's budgeted growth rate of 3% was not\r\n achieved because of a decline in non-sugar agricultural output and\r\n damage from Cyclone Kina. Growth in 1994 is estimated to be 5%,\r\n largely attributed to increased tourism and expansion in domestic\r\n production, particularly in the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $4.3 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $5,650 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 1.5% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 5.4% (1992)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $485 million\r\n expenditures: $579 million, including capital expenditures of $58\r\n million (1994)\r\n\r\n Exports: $405 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: sugar 40%, clothing, gold, processed fish, lumber\r\n partners: EC 26%, Australia 15%, Pacific Islands 11%, Japan 6%\r\n\r\n Imports: $634 million (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment, petroleum products,\r\n food, consumer goods, chemicals\r\n partners: Australia 30%, NZ 17%, Japan 13%, EC 6%, US 6%\r\n\r\n External debt: $670 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 0% (1993 est.);

Its key\r\n economic sector is manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and\r\n engineering industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods\r\n representing about 30% of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals,\r\n Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some\r\n components for manufactured goods. Because of the climate,\r\n agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in\r\n basic products. Forestry, an important export earner, provides a\r\n secondary occupation for the rural population. The economy, which\r\n experienced an average of 4.9% annual growth between 1987 and 1989,\r\n sank into deep recession in 1991 as GDP contracted by 6.5%. The\r\n recession - which continued in 1992 with GDP contracting by 4.1% - has\r\n been caused by economic overheating, depressed foreign markets, and\r\n the dismantling of the barter system between Finland and the former\r\n Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and gas had been exchanged for\r\n Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish Government has proposed\r\n efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and efficiency by an\r\n increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in public expenditures,\r\n partial privatization of state enterprises, and changes in monetary\r\n policy. In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka to the European\r\n Union's (EU) European Currency Unit (ECU) to promote stability.\r\n Ongoing speculation resulting from a lack of confidence in the\r\n government's policies forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by about\r\n 12% in November 1991 and to indefinitely break the link in September\r\n 1992. The devaluations have boosted the competitiveness of Finnish\r\n exports. The recession bottomed out in 1993, and Finland participated\r\n in the general European upturn of 1994. Unemployment probably will\r\n remain a serious problem during the next few years; the majority of\r\n Finnish firms face a weak domestic market and the troubled German and\r\n Swedish export markets. The Finns voted in an October 1994 referendum\r\n to enter the EU, and Finland officially joined the Union on 1 January\r\n 1995.

Large tracts of fertile land, the application of\r\n modern technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading\r\n agricultural producer in Western Europe. Largely self-sufficient in\r\n agricultural products, France is a major exporter of wheat and dairy\r\n products. The industrial sector generates about one-quarter of GDP,\r\n and the growing services sector has become crucial to the economy.\r\n Following stagnation and recession in 1991-93, French GDP in 1994\r\n expanded 2.4%. Growth in 1995 is expected to be in the 3.0% to 3.5%\r\n range. Persistently high unemployment will still pose a major problem\r\n for the government. Paris remains committed to maintaining the\r\n franc-deutsche mark parity, which has kept French interest rates high\r\n despite France's low inflation. Although the pace of economic and\r\n financial integration within the European Union has slowed down,\r\n integration presumably will remain a major force shaping the fortunes\r\n of the various economic sectors over the next few years.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $1.0801 trillion\r\n (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 2.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $18,670 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 1.6% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 12.6% (yearend 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $220.5 billion\r\n expenditures: $249.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $47\r\n billion (1993 budget)\r\n\r\n Exports: $249.2 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: machinery and transportation equipment, chemicals,\r\n foodstuffs, agricultural products, iron and steel products, textiles\r\n and clothing\r\n partners: Germany 18.6%, Italy 11.0%, Spain 11.0%, Belgium-Luxembourg\r\n 9.1%, UK 8.8%, Netherlands 7.9%, US 6.4%, Japan 2.0%, FSU 0.7% (1991\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n Imports: $238.1 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: crude oil, machinery and equipment, agricultural\r\n products, chemicals, iron and steel products\r\n partners: Germany 17.8%, Italy 10.9%, US 9.5%, Netherlands 8.9%, Spain\r\n 8.8%, Belgium-Luxembourg 8.5%, UK 7.5%, Japan 4.1%, FSU 1.3% (1991\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n External debt: $300 billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 2.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 105,250,000 kW\r\n production: 447 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 6,149 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: steel, machinery, chemicals, automobiles, metallurgy,\r\n aircraft, electronics, mining, textiles, food processing, tourism\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for 4% of GDP (including fishing and forestry);\r\n one of the world's top five wheat producers;

Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil\r\n was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector now\r\n accounts for 50% of GDP. Real growth was feeble in 1992 and Gabon\r\n continues to face the problem of fluctuating prices for its oil,\r\n timber, manganese, and uranium exports. Despite an abundance of\r\n natural wealth, and a manageable rate of population growth, the\r\n economy is hobbled by poor fiscal management. In 1992, the fiscal\r\n deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to settle arrears on\r\n its bilateral debt, leading to a cancellation of rescheduling\r\n agreements with official and private creditors. Devaluation of its\r\n Francophone currency by 50% in January 1994 did not set off an\r\n expected inflationary spiral but the government must continue to keep\r\n a tight reign on spending and wage increases.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $5.6 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 1.9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $4,900 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 35% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.3 billion\r\n expenditures: $1.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $311\r\n million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $2.1 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est)\r\n commodities: crude oil 80%, timber 10%, manganese 6%, uranium 2%\r\n partners: US 38%, France 26%, Japan, Germany\r\n\r\n Imports: $832 million (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: foodstuffs, chemical products, petroleum products,\r\n construction materials, manufactures, machinery\r\n partners: France 42%, African countries 23%, US, Japan\r\n\r\n External debt: $3.3 billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -3% (1991)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 315,000 kW\r\n production: 910 million kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 757 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: food and beverages, lumbering and plywood, textiles,\r\n cement, petroleum refining, mining - manganese, uranium, gold,\r\n petroleum\r\n\r\n Agriculture: cash crops - cocoa, coffee, palm oil;

About 75% of the\r\n population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising, which\r\n contribute 30% to GDP. Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing\r\n peanuts, fish, and hides - accounts for less than 10% of GDP. A\r\n sustained structural adjustment program, including a liberalized trade\r\n policy, had fostered a respectable 4% rate of growth in recent years.\r\n Reexport trade constitutes one-third of economic activity; however,\r\n border closures associated with Senegal's monetary crisis in late 1993\r\n led to a halving of reexport trade, reducing government revenues in\r\n turn. The 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has made\r\n Senegalese goods more competitive and apparently prompted a relaxation\r\n of Senegalese controls, paving the way for a comeback in reexports.\r\n But overwhelming these developments were the devastating effects of\r\n the military's takeover in July 1994. By October, traffic at the Port\r\n of Banjul had fallen precipitously as importers nervously scaled back\r\n their activities with the commencement of the anticorruption drive by\r\n the new regime. Concerned with the growing potential for serious\r\n unrest after a countercoup attempt was bloodily put down by the\r\n regime, the United Kingdom and the EU in November issued a travelers\r\n advisory for The Gambia, which brought a halt to tourism almost\r\n immediately. The Gambia faces additional problems in 1995 if, as is\r\n likely, economic sanctions by Western governments remain in effect in\r\n response to indications that the military regime intends to stay in\r\n power far longer than expected by the donors.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $1 billion (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,050 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 6.5% (1993)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $94 million\r\n expenditures: $89 million, including capital expenditures of $24\r\n million (FY92/93 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $81 million (f.o.b., FY92/93 est.)\r\n commodities: peanuts and peanut products, fish, cotton lint, palm\r\n kernels\r\n partners: Japan 60%, Europe 29%, Africa 5%, US 1%, other 5% (1989)\r\n\r\n Imports: $154 million (f.o.b., FY92/93 est.)\r\n commodities: foodstuffs, manufactures, raw materials, fuel, machinery\r\n and transport equipment\r\n partners: Europe 57%, Asia 25%, USSR and Eastern Europe 9%, US 6%,\r\n other 3% (1989)\r\n\r\n External debt: $286 million (FY92/93 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 6.7%\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 30,000 kW\r\n production: 70 million kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 64 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: peanut processing, tourism, beverages, agricultural\r\n machinery assembly, woodworking, metalworking, clothing\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for 30% of GDP; one-third of food requirements\r\n is imported; major export crop is peanuts; other principal crops -\r\n millet, sorghum, rice, corn, cassava, palm kernels; livestock -\r\n cattle, sheep, goats; forestry and fishing resources not fully\r\n exploited\r\n\r\n Economic aid:\r\n recipient: US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $93 million;\r\n Western (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments\r\n (1970-89), $535 million; Communist countries (1970-89), $39 million\r\n\r\n Currency: 1 dalasi (D) = 100 butut\r\n\r\n Exchange rates: dalasi (D) per US$1 - 9.565 (January 1995), 9.576\r\n (1994), 9.129 (1993), 8.888 (1992), 8.803 (1991), 7.883 (1990)\r\n\r\n Fiscal year: 1 July - 30 June\r\n\r\n@The Gambia:Transportation\r\n\r\n Railroads: 0 km\r\n\r\n Highways:\r\n total: 3,083 km\r\n paved: 431 km\r\n unpaved: gravel, crushed stone 501 km; unimproved earth 2,151 km\r\n\r\n Inland waterways: 400 km\r\n\r\n Ports: Banjul\r\n\r\n Merchant marine:\r\n total: 1 bulk ship (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 11,194 GRT/19,394 DWT\r\n\r\n Airports:\r\n total: 1\r\n with paved runways over 3,047 m: 1\r\n\r\n@The Gambia:Communications\r\n\r\n Telephone system: 3,500 telephones; telephone density - 4\r\n telephones/1,000 persons\r\n local: NA\r\n intercity: adequate network of radio relay and wire\r\n international: 1 Atlantic Ocean INTELSAT earth station\r\n\r\n Radio:\r\n broadcast stations: AM 3, FM 2, shortwave 0\r\n radios: NA\r\n\r\n Television:\r\n broadcast stations: NA\r\n televisions: NA\r\n\r\n@The Gambia:Defense Forces\r\n\r\n Branches: Army, Navy, National Police\r\n\r\n Manpower availability: males age 15-49 214,680; males fit for military\r\n service 108,659 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Defense expenditures: exchange rate conversion - $14 million, 3.8% of\r\n GDP (FY93/94)\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nGAZA STRIP\r\n\r\n Note--The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim\r\n Self-Government Arrangements (\"the DOP\"), signed in Washington on 13\r\n September 1993, provides for a transitional period not exceeding five\r\n years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the\r\n West Bank.

Gaza depends upon Israel for nearly 90% of its external\r\n trade. Aggravating the impact of Israeli military administration,\r\n unrest in the territory since 1988 (intifadah) has raised unemployment\r\n and lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The Persian Gulf crisis\r\n and its aftershocks also have dealt blows to Gaza since August 1990.\r\n Worker remittances from the Gulf states have dropped, unemployment has\r\n increased, and exports have fallen.

The country imports the\r\n bulk of its energy needs, including natural gas and oil products. Its\r\n only sizable domestic energy resource is hydropower. Since 1990,\r\n widespread conflicts, e.g., in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and\r\n Mingreliya, have severely aggravated the economic crisis resulting\r\n from the disintegration of the Soviet command economy in December\r\n 1991. Throughout 1993 and 1994, much of industry was functioning at\r\n only 20% of capacity; heavy disruptions in agricultural cultivation\r\n were reported; and tourism was shut down. The country is precariously\r\n dependent on US and EU humanitarian grain shipments, as most other\r\n foods are priced beyond reach of the average citizen. Georgia is also\r\n suffering from an acute energy crisis, as it is having problems paying\r\n for even minimal imports. Georgia is pinning its hopes for recovery on\r\n reestablishing trade ties with Russia and on developing international\r\n transportation through the key Black Sea ports of P'ot'i and Bat'umi.\r\n The government began a tenuous program in 1994 aiming to stabilize\r\n prices and reduce large consumer subsidies.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $6 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -30% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,060 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 40.5% per month (2nd half 1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: officially less than 5% but real unemployment may\r\n be more than 20%, with even larger numbers of underemployed workers\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $NA\r\n commodities: citrus fruits, tea, wine, other agricultural products;\r\n diverse types of machinery;

The staggering $390 billion in western German assistance\r\n that the eastern states have received since 1990 - 40 times the amount\r\n in real terms of US Marshall Fund aid sent to West Germany after World\r\n War II - is just beginning to have an impact on the eastern German\r\n standard of living, which plummeted after unification. Assistance to\r\n the east continues to run at roughly $100 billion annually. Although\r\n the growth rate in the east was much greater than in the west in\r\n 1993-94, eastern GDP per capita nonetheless remains well below\r\n preunification levels; it will take 10-15 years for the eastern states\r\n to match western Germany's living standards. The economic recovery in\r\n the east is led by the construction industries which account for\r\n one-third of industrial output, with growth increasingly supported by\r\n the service sectors and light manufacturing industries. Eastern\r\n Germany's economy is changing from one anchored on manufacturing to a\r\n more service-oriented economy. Western Germany, with three times the\r\n per capita output of the eastern states, has an advanced market\r\n economy and is a world leader in exports. The strong recovery in 1994\r\n from recession began in the export sector and spread to the investment\r\n and consumption sectors in response to falling interest rates. Western\r\n Germany has a highly urbanized and skilled population that enjoys\r\n excellent living standards, abundant leisure time, and comprehensive\r\n social welfare benefits. It is relatively poor in natural resources,\r\n coal being the most important mineral. Western Germany's world-class\r\n companies manufacture technologically advanced goods. The region's\r\n economy is mature: services and manufacturing account for the dominant\r\n share of economic activities, and raw materials and semimanufactured\r\n goods constitute a large portion of imports.\r\n\r\n National product:\r\n Germany: GDP - purchasing power parity - $1.3446 trillion (1994 est.)\r\n western: GDP - purchasing power parity - $1.2363 trillion (1994 est.)\r\n eastern: GDP - purchasing power parity - $108.3 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate:\r\n Germany: 2.9% (1994 est.)\r\n western: 2.3% (1994 est.)\r\n eastern: 9.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita:\r\n Germany: $16,580 (1994 est.)\r\n western: $19,660 (1994 est.)\r\n eastern: $5,950 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n western: 3% (1994)\r\n eastern: 3.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate:\r\n western: 8.2% (December 1994)\r\n eastern: 13.5% (December 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $690 billion\r\n expenditures: $780 billion, including capital expenditures of $96.5\r\n billion (1994)\r\n\r\n Exports: $437 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: manufactures 89.3% (including machines and machine tools,\r\n chemicals, motor vehicles, iron and steel products), agricultural\r\n products 5.5%, raw materials 2.7%, fuels 1.3% (1993)\r\n partners: EC 47.9% (France 11.7%, Netherlands 7.4%, Italy 7.5%, UK\r\n 7.7%, Belgium-Luxembourg 6.6%), EFTA 15.5%, US 7.7%, Eastern Europe\r\n 5.2%, OPEC 3.0% (1993)\r\n\r\n Imports: $362 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: manufactures 75.1%, agricultural products 10.0%, fuels\r\n 8.3%, raw materials 5.0% (1993)\r\n partners: EC 46.4% (France 11.3%, Netherlands 8.4%, Italy 8.1%, UK\r\n 6.0%, Belgium-Luxembourg 5.7%), EFTA 14.3%, US 7.3%, Japan 6.3%,\r\n Eastern Europe 5.1%, OPEC 2.6% (1993)\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production:\r\n western: growth rate 2.8% (1994)\r\n eastern: growth rate $NA\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 115,430,000 kW\r\n production: 493 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 5,683 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries:\r\n western: among world's largest and technologically advanced producers\r\n of iron, steel, coal, cement, chemicals, machinery, vehicles, machine\r\n tools, electronics;

Heavily reliant on international assistance, Ghana has\r\n made steady progress in liberalizing its economy since 1983. Overall\r\n growth continued at a rate of approximately 5% in 1994, due largely to\r\n increased gold, timber, and cocoa production - major sources of\r\n foreign exchange. The economy, however, continues to revolve around\r\n subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 45% of GDP and employs 55%\r\n of the work force, mainly small landholders. Public sector wage\r\n increases, regional peacekeeping commitments, and the containment of\r\n internal unrest in the underdeveloped north have placed substantial\r\n demands on the government's budget and have led to inflationary\r\n deficit financing and a 27% depreciation of the cedi in 1994.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $22.6 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,310 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 25% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 10% (1991)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.05 billion\r\n expenditures: $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $178\r\n million (1993)\r\n\r\n Exports: $1 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: cocoa 40%, gold, timber, tuna, bauxite, and aluminum\r\n partners: Germany 31%, US 12%, UK 11%, Netherlands 6%, Japan 5% (1991)\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.7 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: petroleum 16%, consumer goods, foods, intermediate goods,\r\n capital equipment\r\n partners: UK 22%, US 11%, Germany 9%, Japan 6%\r\n\r\n External debt: $4.6 billion (December 1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 3.4% in manufacturing (1993);\r\n accounts for almost 15% of GDP\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 1,180,000 kW\r\n production: 6.1 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 323 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: mining, lumbering, light manufacturing, aluminum, food\r\n processing\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for almost 50% of GDP (including fishing and\r\n forestry);

Since then, the public sector has been reduced to about 60% of\r\n GDP. Tourism continues as a major source of foreign exchange, and\r\n agriculture is self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and\r\n animal feedstuffs. Over the last decade, real GDP growth has averaged\r\n 1.6% a year, compared with the European Union average of 2.2%.\r\n Inflation continues to be well above the EU average, and the national\r\n debt has reached 140% of GDP, the highest in the EU. Prime Minister\r\n PAPANDREOU will probably make only limited progress correcting the\r\n economy's problems of high inflation, large budget deficit, and\r\n decaying infrastructure. His economic program suggests that although\r\n he will shun his expansionary policies of the 1980s, he will avoid\r\n tough measures needed to slow inflation or reduce the state's role in\r\n the economy. He has limited the previous government's privatization\r\n plans, for example, and has called for generous welfare spending and\r\n real wage increases. Athens continues to rely heavily on EU aid, which\r\n recently has amounted to about 6% of GDP. Greece almost certainly will\r\n not meet the EU's Maastricht Treaty convergence targets of public\r\n deficit held to 3% of GDP and national debt to 60% of GDP by 1999.

Following the closing of the Black Angel\r\n lead and zinc mine in 1989, Greenland became almost completely\r\n dependent on fishing and fish processing, the sector accounting for\r\n 95% of exports. Prospects for fisheries are not bright, as the\r\n important shrimp catches will at best stabilize and cod catches have\r\n dropped. Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon activities is not around\r\n the corner, thus leaving only tourism with some potential for the near\r\n future.

The traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being\r\n replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50%\r\n of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root\r\n crops are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is\r\n still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly from France.\r\n Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production.

Over the past 20 years the tourist industry has\r\n grown rapidly, creating a construction boom for new hotels and the\r\n expansion of older ones. Visitors numbered about 900,000 in 1992. The\r\n slowdown in Japanese economic growth has been reflected in less\r\n vigorous growth in the tourism sector. About 60% of the labor force\r\n works for the private sector and the rest for government. Most food\r\n and industrial goods are imported, with about 75% from the US. Guam\r\n faces the problem of building up the civilian economic sector to\r\n offset the impact of military downsizing.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $2 billion (1991\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $14,000 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 4% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 2% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $525 million\r\n expenditures: $395 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1991)\r\n\r\n Exports: $34 million (f.o.b., 1984)\r\n commodities: mostly transshipments of refined petroleum products,\r\n construction materials, fish, food and beverage products\r\n partners: US 25%, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands 63%, other\r\n 12%\r\n\r\n Imports: $493 million (c.i.f., 1984)\r\n commodities: petroleum and petroleum products, food, manufactured\r\n goods\r\n partners: US 23%, Japan 19%, other 58%\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate NA%\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 300,000 kW\r\n production: 750 million kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 4,797 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: US military, tourism, construction, transshipment\r\n services, concrete products, printing and publishing, food processing,\r\n textiles\r\n\r\n Agriculture: relatively undeveloped with most food imported;

The majority of the population does not\r\n have ready access to safe drinking water, adequate medical care, or\r\n sufficient food. The lack of employment opportunities remains one of\r\n the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil erosion\r\n and political instability. International trade sanctions in response\r\n to the September 1991 coup against President ARISTIDE further damaged\r\n the economy. The restoration of President ARISTIDE, the lifting of\r\n sanctions in late 1994, and foreign aid will alleviate some economic\r\n problems.

Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy,\r\n accounts for 28% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces\r\n two-thirds of exports. Productivity remains low. Manufacturing, still\r\n in its early stages, employs 9% of the labor force, accounts for 15%\r\n of GDP, and generates 20% of exports. The service sectors, including\r\n public administration, account for 50% of GDP and employ 20% of the\r\n labor force. Many basic problems face the economy, including rapid\r\n population growth, high unemployment, inflation, a lack of basic\r\n services, a large and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of\r\n the export sector mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to\r\n sharp price fluctuations.

Natural resources are limited, and food\r\n and raw materials must be imported. Manufacturing accounts for about\r\n 17% of GDP. Goods and services exports account for about 50% of GDP.\r\n Real GDP growth averaged a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in\r\n 1989-90, and picked up to 4.2% in 1991, 5.0% in 1992, 5.2% in 1993,\r\n and 5.5% in 1994. Unemployment, which has been declining since the\r\n mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of labor continues to put\r\n upward pressure on prices and the cost of living. Prospects for\r\n 1995-96 remain bright so long as major trading partners continue to be\r\n reasonably prosperous and so long as investors feel China will support\r\n free market practices after the takeover in 1997.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $136.1 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $24,530 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 8.5% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 1.9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $19.2 billion\r\n expenditures: $19.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (FY93/94)\r\n\r\n Exports: $168.7 billion (including re-exports of $121.0 billion\r\n )(f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: clothing, textiles, yarn and fabric, footwear, electrical\r\n appliances, watches and clocks, toys\r\n partners: China 32%, US 23%, Germany 5%, Japan 5%, UK 3% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Imports: $160 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: foodstuffs, transport equipment, raw materials,\r\n semimanufactures, petroleum;

The private\r\n sector now accounts for about 55% of GDP. Nonetheless, the\r\n transformation is proving difficult, and many citizens say life was\r\n better under the old system. On the bright side, the four-year decline\r\n in output finally ended in 1994, as real GDP increased an estimated\r\n 3%. This growth helped reduce unemployment to just over 10% by\r\n yearend, down from a peak of 13%. However, no progress was made\r\n against inflation, which remained stuck at about 20%, and the\r\n already-large current account deficit in the balance of payments\r\n actually got worse, reaching almost $4 billion. Underlying Hungary's\r\n other economic problems is the large budget deficit, which probably\r\n exceeded 7% of GDP in 1994, despite some late-year budget cutting by\r\n the new leftist government. In 1995 the government has pledged to\r\n accelerate privatization and lower the budget deficit to 5.5% of GDP.\r\n It believes this fiscal tightening will reduce the current account\r\n deficit to $2.5 billion but at the cost of holding economic growth to\r\n only 1%.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $58.8 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $5,700 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 21% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 10.4% (yearend 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $11.3 billion\r\n expenditures: $14.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994)\r\n\r\n Exports: $10.3 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: raw materials and semi-finished goods 30.0%, machinery\r\n and transport equipment 20.1%, consumer goods 25.2%, food and\r\n agriculture 21.4%, fuels and energy 3.4% (1993)\r\n partners: Germany 25.3%, Italy 8.3%, Austria 10.5%, the FSU 14.0%, US\r\n 4.3% (1993)\r\n\r\n Imports: $14.2 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: fuels and energy 12.6%, raw materials and semi-finished\r\n goods 27.3%, machinery and transport equipment 33.0%, consumer goods\r\n 21.2%, food and agriculture 5.9% (1993)\r\n partners: Germany 21.5%, Italy 6.1%, Austria 11.8%, the FSU 20.9%, US\r\n 4.3% (1993);

The\r\n economy is heavily dependent on the fishing industry, which provides\r\n nearly 75% of export earnings and employs 12% of the work force. In\r\n the absence of other natural resources - except energy - Iceland's\r\n economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. The economy, in\r\n recession since 1988, began to recover in 1993, posting 0.4% growth,\r\n but was still hampered by cutbacks in fish quotas as well as falling\r\n world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum,\r\n and ferrosilicon. Real GDP grew by perhaps 2.4% in 1994. The\r\n center-right government plans to continue its policies of reducing the\r\n budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing,\r\n containing inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies,\r\n diversifying the economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The\r\n government, however, remains divided on the issue of EU membership,\r\n primarily because of Icelanders' concern about losing control over\r\n their fishing resources.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $4.5 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 2.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $17,250 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 1.3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 7% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.9 billion\r\n expenditures: $2.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $1.4 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: fish and fish products, animal products, aluminum,\r\n ferrosilicon, diatomite\r\n partners: EC 68% (UK 25%, Germany 12%), US 11%, Japan 8% (1992)\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.3 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: machinery and transportation equipment, petroleum\r\n products, foodstuffs, textiles\r\n partners: EC 53% (Germany 14%, Denmark 10%, UK 9%), Norway 14%, US 9%\r\n (1992)\r\n\r\n External debt: $2.5 billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 1.75% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 1,070,000 kW\r\n production: 4.7 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 16,458 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: fish processing, aluminum smelting, ferro-silicon\r\n production, geothermal power\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for about 15% of GDP;

Faster economic growth in the\r\n 1980s permitted a significant increase in real per capita private\r\n consumption. A large share of the population, perhaps as much as 40%,\r\n remains too poor to afford an adequate diet. Financial strains in 1990\r\n and 1991 prompted government austerity measures that slowed industrial\r\n growth but permitted India to meet its international payment\r\n obligations without rescheduling its debt. Production, trade, and\r\n investment reforms since 1991 have provided new opportunities for\r\n Indian businessmen and an estimated 100 million to 200 million middle\r\n class consumers. New Delhi has always paid its foreign debts on\r\n schedule and has stimulated exports, attracted foreign investment, and\r\n revived confidence in India's economic prospects. Foreign exchange\r\n reserves, precariously low three years ago, now total more than $19\r\n billion.

Indonesia has extensive natural\r\n wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly increasing population, it\r\n remains a rather poor country. Real GDP growth in 1985-94 averaged\r\n about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash\r\n underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering\r\n the labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an\r\n important sector, accounting for 21% of GDP and over 50% of the labor\r\n force. The staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice\r\n importer, Indonesia is now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops -\r\n rubber and palm oil - and textiles and plywood are being encouraged\r\n for both export and job generation. Industrial output now accounts for\r\n almost 40% of GDP and is based on a supply of diverse natural\r\n resources, including crude oil, natural gas, timber, metals, and coal.\r\n Foreign investment has also boosted manufacturing output and exports\r\n in recent years. Indeed, the economy's growth is highly dependent on\r\n the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Japan remains Indonesia's\r\n most important customer and supplier of aid. Rapid growth in the money\r\n supply in 1989-90 prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary\r\n policy in 1991, forcing the private sector to go to foreign banks for\r\n investment financing. Real interest rates remained above 10% and\r\n off-shore commercial debt grew. The growth in off-shore debt prompted\r\n Jakarta to limit foreign borrowing beginning in late 1991. Despite the\r\n continued problems in moving toward a more open financial system and\r\n the persistence of a fairly tight credit situation, GDP growth in\r\n 1992-94 has matched the government target of 6%-7% annual growth.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $619.4 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 6.7% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $3,090 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 9.3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 3% official rate;

At yearend 1993 the Iranian Government estimated that\r\n it owed foreign creditors about $30 billion; an estimated $8 billion\r\n of this debt was in arrears. At yearend 1994, Iran rescheduled $12\r\n billion in debt.

The economy has been dominated by the oil sector,\r\n which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange\r\n earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive\r\n expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export\r\n facilities by Iran, led the government to implement austerity measures\r\n and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments.\r\n After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased\r\n with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged\r\n facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor\r\n shortages, salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land\r\n reform and collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although\r\n accorded high priority by the government, also was under financial\r\n constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent\r\n international economic embargoes, and military action by an\r\n international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically changed\r\n the economic picture. Industrial and transportation facilities, which\r\n suffered severe damage, have been partially restored. Oil exports\r\n remain at less than 5% of the previous level. Shortages of spare parts\r\n continue. Living standards deteriorated even further in 1993 and 1994;\r\n consumer prices have more than doubled in both 1993 and 1994. The\r\n UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced exports and imports and has\r\n contributed to the sharp rise in prices. The Iraqi government has been\r\n unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so that the economic embargo can\r\n be removed. The government's policies of supporting large military and\r\n internal security forces and of allocating resources to key supporters\r\n of the regime have exacerbated shortages. In brief, per capita output\r\n in 1993-94 is far below the 1989-90 level, but no precise estimate is\r\n available.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $NA\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $NA\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $10.4 billion (f.o.b., 1990)\r\n commodities: crude oil and refined products, fertilizer, sulfur\r\n partners: US, Brazil, Turkey, Japan, Netherlands, Spain (1990)\r\n\r\n Imports: $6.6 billion (c.i.f., 1990)\r\n commodities: manufactures, food\r\n partners: Germany, US, Turkey, France, UK (1990)\r\n\r\n External debt: $50 billion (1989 est.), excluding debt of about $35\r\n billion owed to Gulf Arab states\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate NA%;

Agriculture, once\r\n the most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts\r\n for 37% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor\r\n force. Although exports remain the primary engine for Ireland's robust\r\n growth, the economy is also benefiting from a rise in consumer\r\n spending and recovery in both construction and business investment.\r\n Ireland has substantially reduced its external debt since 1987, to 40%\r\n of GDP in 1994. Over the same period, inflation has fallen sharply and\r\n chronic trade deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses.\r\n Unemployment remains a serious problem, however, and job creation is\r\n the main focus of government policy. To ease unemployment, Dublin\r\n aggressively courts foreign investors and recently created a new\r\n industrial development agency to aid small indigenous firms.\r\n Government assistance is constrained by Dublin's continuing deficit\r\n reduction measures.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $49.8 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $14,060 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 2.7% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 16% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $16 billion\r\n expenditures: $16.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994)\r\n\r\n Exports: $28 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: chemicals, data processing equipment, industrial\r\n machinery, live animals, animal products\r\n partners: EU 75% (UK 32%, Germany 13%, France 10%), US 9%\r\n\r\n Imports: $26 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: food, animal feed, data processing equipment, petroleum\r\n and petroleum products, machinery, textiles, clothing\r\n partners: EU 66% (UK 41%, Germany 8%, France 4%), US 15%\r\n\r\n External debt: $20 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 8.5% (1994 est.); accounts for 37%\r\n of GDP\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 3,930,000 kW\r\n production: 14.9 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 3,938 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: food products, brewing, textiles, clothing, chemicals,\r\n pharmaceuticals, machinery, transportation equipment, glass and\r\n crystal\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for 10% of GDP; principal crops - turnips,\r\n barley, potatoes, sugar beets, wheat; livestock - meat and dairy\r\n products; 85% self-sufficient in food; food shortages include bread\r\n grain, fruits, vegetables\r\n\r\n Illicit drugs: transshipment point for hashish from North Africa to\r\n the UK and Netherlands\r\n\r\n Economic aid:\r\n donor: ODA commitments (1980-89), $90 million\r\n\r\n Currency: 1 Irish pound (#Ir) = 100 pence\r\n\r\n Exchange rates: Irish pounds (#Ir) per US$1 - 0.6420 (January 1995),\r\n 0.6676 (1994), 0.6816 (1993), 0.5864 (1992), 0.6190 (1991), 0.6030\r\n (1990)\r\n\r\n Fiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n@Ireland:Transportation\r\n\r\n Railroads:\r\n total: 1,947 km\r\n broad gauge: 1,947 km 1.600-m gauge (36 km electrified; 485 km double\r\n track)\r\n\r\n Highways:\r\n total: 92,327 km\r\n paved: 86,787 km (32 km of expressways)\r\n unpaved: gravel, crushed stone 5,540 km (1992)\r\n\r\n Inland waterways: limited for commercial traffic\r\n\r\n Pipelines: natural gas 225 km\r\n\r\n Ports: Arklow, Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Foynes, Galway, Limerick, New\r\n Ross, Waterford\r\n\r\n Merchant marine:\r\n total: 47 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 129,996 GRT/160,419 DWT\r\n ships by type: bulk 4, cargo 33, chemical tanker 2, container 2, oil\r\n tanker 1, short-sea passenger 3, specialized tanker 2\r\n\r\n Airports:\r\n total: 44\r\n with paved runways over 3,047 m: 1\r\n with paved runways 2,438 to 3,047 m: 1\r\n with paved runways 1,524 to 2,437 m: 4\r\n with paved runways 914 to 1,523 m: 2\r\n with paved runways under 914 m: 32\r\n with unpaved runways 914 to 1,523 m: 4\r\n\r\n@Ireland:Communications\r\n\r\n Telephone system: 900,000 telephones; modern digital system using\r\n cable and microwave radio relay\r\n local: NA\r\n intercity: microwave radio relay\r\n international: 1 INTELSAT (Atlantic Ocean) earth station\r\n\r\n Radio:\r\n broadcast stations: AM 9, FM 45, shortwave 0\r\n radios: NA\r\n\r\n Television:\r\n broadcast stations: 86\r\n televisions: NA\r\n\r\n@Ireland:Defense Forces\r\n\r\n Branches: Army (includes Naval Service and Air Corps), National Police\r\n (Garda Siochana)\r\n\r\n Manpower availability: males age 15-49 926,831; males fit for military\r\n service 749,646; males reach military age (17) annually 34,215 (1995\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n Defense expenditures: exchange rate conversion - $500 million, 1.3% of\r\n GDP (1994)\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nISRAEL\r\n\r\n (also see separate Gaza Strip and West Bank entries) Note: The\r\n territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included in\r\n the data below.

It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw\r\n materials, and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources,\r\n Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial\r\n sectors over the past 20 years. Industry employs about 22% of Israeli\r\n workers, construction 6.5%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 3.5%,\r\n and services most of the rest. Israel is largely self-sufficient in\r\n food production except for grains. Diamonds, high-technology\r\n equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are\r\n leading exports. Israel usually posts current account deficits, which\r\n are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign\r\n loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt is owed to the\r\n United States, which is its major source of economic and military aid.\r\n To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel has been targeting\r\n high-technology niches in international markets, such as medical\r\n scanning equipment. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former\r\n USSR, which topped 450,000 during the period 1990-94, increased\r\n unemployment, intensified housing problems, and strained the\r\n government budget. At the same time, the immigrants bring to the\r\n economy valuable scientific and professional expertise.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $70.1 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 6.8% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $13,880 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 14.5% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 7.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $42.3 billion\r\n expenditures: $45.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $11.1\r\n billion (FY92/93)\r\n\r\n Exports: $16.2 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: machinery and equipment, cut diamonds, chemicals,\r\n textiles and apparel, agricultural products, metals\r\n partners: US, EU, Japan\r\n\r\n Imports: $22.5 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: military equipment, investment goods, rough diamonds,\r\n oil, other productive inputs, consumer goods\r\n partners: EU, US, Japan\r\n\r\n External debt: $25.9 billion (November 1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 8% (1994 est.);

The country is still divided into a developed industrial north,\r\n dominated by private companies, and an undeveloped agricultural south,\r\n dominated by large public enterprises. Services account for 48% of\r\n GDP, industry 35%, agriculture 4%, and public administration 13%. Most\r\n raw materials needed by industry and over 75% of energy requirements\r\n must be imported. After growing at an average annual rate of 3% in\r\n 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in 1991 and 1992, fell by 0.7% in\r\n 1993, and recovered to 2% in 1994. In the second half of 1992, Rome\r\n became unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying to participate in\r\n EU plans for economic and monetary union later in the decade; thus it\r\n finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances. Subsequently, the\r\n government has adopted fairly stringent budgets, abandoned its highly\r\n inflationary wage indexation system, and started to scale back its\r\n extremely generous social welfare programs, including pension and\r\n health care benefits. Monetary officials were forced to withdraw the\r\n lira from the European monetary system in September 1992 when it came\r\n under extreme pressure in currency markets. For the 1990s, Italy faces\r\n the problems of pushing ahead with fiscal reform, refurbishing a\r\n tottering communications system, curbing pollution in major industrial\r\n centers, and adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the\r\n ongoing expansion and economic integration of the European Union.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $998.9 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 2.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $17,180 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3.9% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 12.2% (January 1995)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $339 billion\r\n expenditures: $431 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $190.8 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: metals, textiles and clothing, production machinery,\r\n motor vehicles, transportation equipment, chemicals, other\r\n partners: EU 53.4%, US 7.8%, OPEC 3.8% (1994)\r\n\r\n Imports: $168.7 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n commodities: industrial machinery, chemicals, transport equipment,\r\n petroleum, metals, food, agricultural products\r\n partners: EU 56.3%, OPEC 5.3%, US 4.6% (1994)\r\n\r\n External debt: $67 billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 4.3% (1994 est.);

Industry, the most important sector of the economy, is\r\n heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels. Usually\r\n self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its\r\n requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of\r\n the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the\r\n global catch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10%\r\n average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. Economic\r\n growth came to a halt in 1992-93 largely because of contractionary\r\n domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the\r\n stock and real estate markets. Growth resumed at a 0.6% pace in 1994\r\n largely because of consumer demand. As for foreign trade, the stronger\r\n yen and slower global growth are containing export growth.\r\n Unemployment and inflation remain remarkably low in comparison with\r\n the other industrialized nations. Japan continues to run a huge trade\r\n surplus - $121 billion in 1994, roughly the same size as in 1993 -\r\n which supports extensive investment in foreign assets. Prime Minister\r\n MURAYAMA has yet to formalize his government's plans for\r\n administrative and economic reform, including reduction in the trade\r\n surplus. As leader of a coalition government, he has softened his own\r\n socialist positions. The crowding of the habitable land area and the\r\n aging of the population are two major long-run problems.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $2.5274 trillion\r\n (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 0.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $20,200 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 0.7% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 2.9% (1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $569 billion\r\n expenditures: $671 billion, including capital expenditures (public\r\n works only) of about $126 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $395.5 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: manufactures 97% (including machinery 46%, motor vehicles\r\n 20%, consumer electronics 10%)\r\n partners: Southeast Asia 33%, US 29%, Western Europe 18%, China 5%\r\n\r\n Imports: $274.3 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n commodities: manufactures 52%, fossil fuels 20%, foodstuffs and raw\r\n materials 28%\r\n partners: Southeast Asia 25%, US 23%, Western Europe 15%, China 9%\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 1% (1994);

In 1986 the finance sector overtook tourism as the main\r\n contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the island's output. In\r\n recent years the government has encouraged light industry to locate in\r\n Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has developed\r\n alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear.

In the remainder of the 1980s, however,\r\n reductions in both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real\r\n economic growth to an average of roughly 2% per year. Imports - mainly\r\n oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and food - outstripped exports,\r\n with the difference covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In\r\n mid-1989, the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling\r\n negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF-supported program designed\r\n to gradually reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed\r\n structural reforms. The Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990,\r\n however, aggravated Jordan's already serious economic problems,\r\n forcing the government to shelve the IMF program, stop most debt\r\n payments, and suspend rescheduling negotiations.

It also has\r\n considerable agricultural potential with its vast steppe lands\r\n accommodating both livestock and grain production. Kazakhstan's\r\n industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these\r\n natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building\r\n sector specializing in construction equipment, tractors, agricultural\r\n machinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the USSR and the\r\n collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry\r\n products have resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy since\r\n 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. The\r\n government has pursued a moderate program of economic reform and\r\n privatization which is gradually lifting state controls over economic\r\n activity and shifting assets into the private sector. Nevertheless,\r\n government control over key sectors of the economy remains strong.\r\n Sustained economic hardships and continued pressures from industrial\r\n elites will make it difficult for the government to sustain its\r\n policies of monetary and fiscal discipline which had brought down\r\n inflation by the end of 1994. Continued lack of pipeline\r\n transportation for expanded oil exports has closed off a likely source\r\n of economic recovery.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $55.2 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -25% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $3,200 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 24% per month (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 1.1% includes only officially registered\r\n unemployed;

Commercially viable phosphate deposits were\r\n exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and fish now\r\n represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has\r\n fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP declined about 5% in 1987,\r\n as the fish catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986\r\n and copra production was hampered by repeated rains. Output rebounded\r\n strongly in 1988, with real GDP growing by 10%. The upturn in economic\r\n growth came from an increase in copra production and a good fish\r\n catch. GDP then fell by 2.2% in 1989 and by 2.9% in 1990, but has\r\n risen by about 3% annually in 1991-93. Foreign financial aid, largely\r\n from the UK and Japan, is a critical supplement to GDP, amounting to\r\n 25%-50% of GDP in recent years.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $62 million (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 2.9% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $800 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 6.5% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 2%;

and state-owned industry produces\r\n 95% of manufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is\r\n unusually tight even for a Communist country because of the small size\r\n and homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM Il-song in\r\n the past and now his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during the\r\n period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%, but output declined by 3%-5% annually\r\n during 1989-92 because of systemic problems and disruptions in\r\n socialist-style economic relations with the former USSR and China. In\r\n 1992, output dropped sharply, by perhaps 7%-9%, as the economy felt\r\n the cumulative effect of the reduction in outside support. The\r\n leadership insisted on maintaining its high level of military outlays\r\n from a shrinking economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown in\r\n inventories and critical shortages in the energy sector have led to\r\n increasing interruptions in industrial production. Abundant mineral\r\n resources and hydropower have formed the basis of industrial\r\n development since World War II. Output of the extractive industries\r\n includes coal, iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and\r\n precious metals. Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry,\r\n including military industry, with light industry lagging far behind.\r\n Despite the use of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation,\r\n and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become\r\n self-sufficient in food production. Indeed, a shortage of arable\r\n lands, several years of poor harvests, and a cumbersome distribution\r\n system have resulted in chronic food shortages. The collapse of\r\n Communism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in 1989-91 has\r\n disrupted important technological links. North Korea remains far\r\n behind South Korea in economic development and living standards.

Real GDP increased more than 10%\r\n annually between 1986 and 1991. This growth ultimately led to an\r\n overheated situation characterized by a tight labor market, strong\r\n inflationary pressures, and a rapidly rising current account deficit.\r\n As a result, in 1992, economic policy focused on slowing the growth\r\n rate of inflation and reducing the deficit. Annual growth slowed to\r\n 5%, still above the rate in most other countries of the world, and\r\n recovered to 6.3% in 1993. The economy expanded by 8.3% in 1994,\r\n driven by booming exports.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $508.3 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 8.3% (1994)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $11,270 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 5.6% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 2% (November 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $63 billion\r\n expenditures: $63 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1995\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $96.2 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: electronic and electrical equipment, machinery, steel,\r\n automobiles, ships, textiles, clothing, footwear, fish\r\n partners: US 26%, Japan 17%, EU 14%\r\n\r\n Imports: $102.3 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n commodities: machinery, electronics and electronic equipment, oil,\r\n steel, transport equipment, textiles, organic chemicals, grains\r\n partners: Japan 26%, US 24%, EU 15%\r\n\r\n External debt: $44.1 billion (1993)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 12.1% (1994 est.);

Kuwait has rebuilt its war-ravaged petroleum sector; its\r\n crude oil production reached at least 2.0 million barrels per day by\r\n the end of 1993. The government ran a sizable fiscal deficit in 1993.\r\n Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP and 90% of export and\r\n government revenues. Kuwait lacks water and has practically no arable\r\n land, thus preventing development of agriculture. With the exception\r\n of fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75% of\r\n potable water must be distilled or imported. Because of its high per\r\n capita income, comparable with Western European incomes, Kuwait\r\n provides its citizens with extensive health, educational, and\r\n retirement benefits. Per capita military expenditures are among the\r\n highest in the world. The economy improved moderately in 1994, with\r\n the growth in industry and finance, and should see further gains in\r\n 1995, especially if oil prices go up. The World Bank has urged Kuwait\r\n to push ahead with privatization, including in the oil industry, but\r\n the government will move slowly on this front.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $30.7 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 9.3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $16,900 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3% (1993)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NEGL% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $9 billion\r\n expenditures: $13 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (FY92/93)\r\n\r\n Exports: $10.5 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: oil\r\n partners: France 16%, Italy 15%, Japan 12%, UK 11%\r\n\r\n Imports: $6.6 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: food, construction materials, vehicles and parts,\r\n clothing\r\n partners: US 35%, Japan 12%, UK 9%, Canada 9%\r\n\r\n External debt: $7.2 billion (December 1989 est.)\r\n note: external debt has grown substantially in 1991 and 1992 to pay\r\n for restoration of war damage\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate NA%;

Its economy is heavily agricultural, growing\r\n cotton and tobacco on irrigated land in the south and grain in the\r\n foothills of the north and raising sheep and goats on mountain\r\n pastures. Its small and obsolescent industrial sector, concentrated\r\n around Bishkek, has traditionally relied on Russia and other CIS\r\n countries for customers and industrial inputs, including most of its\r\n fuel. Since 1990, the economy has contracted by almost 50% as\r\n subsidies from Moscow vanished and trade links with other former\r\n Soviet republics eroded. At the same time, the Kyrgyz government stuck\r\n to tight monetary and fiscal policies in 1994 that succeeded in\r\n reducing inflation from 23% per month in 1993 to 5.4% per month in\r\n 1994. Moreover, Kyrgyzstan has been the most successful of the Central\r\n Asian states in reducing state controls over the economy and\r\n privatizing state industries. Nevertheless, restructuring proved to be\r\n a slow and painful process in 1994 despite relatively large flows of\r\n foreign aid and continued progress on economic reform. The decline in\r\n output in 1995 may be much smaller, perhaps 5%, compared with an\r\n estimated 24% in 1994.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $8.4 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -24% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,790 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 5.4% per month (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 0.7% includes officially registered unemployed;\r\n also large numbers of unregistered unemployed and underemployed\r\n workers (1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $116 million to countries outside the FSU (1994)\r\n commodities: wool, chemicals, cotton, ferrous and nonferrous metals,\r\n shoes, machinery, tobacco\r\n partners: Russia 70%, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and others\r\n\r\n Imports: $92.4 million from countries outside the FSU (1994)\r\n commodities: grain, lumber, industrial products, ferrous metals, fuel,\r\n machinery, textiles, footwear\r\n partners: other CIS republics\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -24% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 3,660,000 kW\r\n production: 12.7 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 2,700 kWh (1994)\r\n\r\n Industries: small machinery, textiles, food-processing industries,\r\n cement, shoes, sawn logs, refrigerators, furniture, electric motors,\r\n gold, and rare earth metals\r\n\r\n Agriculture: wool, tobacco, cotton, livestock (sheep, goats, cattle),\r\n vegetables, meat, grapes, fruits and berries, eggs, milk, potatoes\r\n\r\n Illicit drugs: illicit cultivator of cannabis and opium poppy;

The results, starting from an extremely\r\n low base, have been striking - growth has averaged 7.5% annually since\r\n 1988. Even so, Laos is a landlocked country with a primitive\r\n infrastructure. It has no railroads, a rudimentary road system, and\r\n limited external and internal telecommunications. Electricity is\r\n available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts\r\n for half of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. The predominant\r\n crop is rice. In non-drought years, Laos is self-sufficient overall in\r\n food, but each year flood, pests, and localized drought cause\r\n shortages in various parts of the country. For the foreseeable future\r\n the economy will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and other\r\n international sources; aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has\r\n been cut sharply. As in many developing countries, deforestation and\r\n soil erosion will hamper efforts to maintain the high rate of GDP\r\n growth.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $4 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 8.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $850 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 6.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 21% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $277 million (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: electricity, wood products, coffee, tin, garments\r\n partners: Thailand 57%, Germany 10%, France 10%, Japan 5% (1991)\r\n\r\n Imports: $528 million (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: food, fuel oil, consumer goods, manufactures\r\n partners: Thailand 55%, Japan 16%, China 8%, Italy 4% (1991)\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 7.5% (1992 est.);

However, the transition has been painful; in 1994 the\r\n IMF reported a 2% growth in GDP, following steep declines in 1992-93.\r\n The government's tough monetary policies and reform program have kept\r\n inflation at less than 2% a month, supported a dynamic private sector\r\n now accounting for more than half of GDP, and spurred the growth of\r\n trade ties with the West. Much of agriculture is already privatized\r\n and the government plans to step up the pace of privatization of state\r\n enterprises. Latvia thus is in the midst of recovery, helped by the\r\n country's strategic location on the Baltic Sea, its well-educated\r\n population, and its diverse - albeit largely obsolete - industrial\r\n structure.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $12.3 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $4,480 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 1.9% (monthly average 1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 6.5% (December 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $1 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: oil products, timber, ferrous metals, dairy products,\r\n furniture, textiles\r\n partners: Russia, Germany, Sweden, Belarus\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.2 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n commodities: fuels, cars, ferrous metals, chemicals\r\n partners: Russia, Germany, Sweden, Ukraine\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -9.5% (1994 est.); accounts for 27%\r\n of GDP\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 2,080,000 kW\r\n production: 5.5 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 1,864 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: highly diversified; dependent on imports for energy, raw\r\n materials, and intermediate products; produces buses, vans, street and\r\n railroad cars, synthetic fibers, agricultural machinery, fertilizers,\r\n washing machines, radios, electronics, pharmaceuticals, processed\r\n foods, textiles\r\n\r\n Agriculture: principally dairy farming and livestock feeding; products\r\n - meat, milk, eggs, grain, sugar beets, potatoes, vegetables; fishing\r\n and fish packing\r\n\r\n Illicit drugs: transshipment point for illicit drugs from Central and\r\n Southwest Asia and Latin America to Western Europe; limited producer\r\n of illicit opium; mostly for domestic consumption; also produces\r\n illicit amphetamines for export\r\n\r\n Economic aid: $NA\r\n\r\n Currency: 1 lat = 100 cents; introduced NA March 1993\r\n\r\n Exchange rates: lats per US$1 - 0.55 (December 1994), 0.5917 (January\r\n 1994), 1.32 (March 1993)\r\n\r\n Fiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n@Latvia:Transportation\r\n\r\n Railroads:\r\n total: 2,400 km\r\n broad gauge: 2,400 km 1.520-m gauge (270 km electrified)\r\n\r\n Highways:\r\n total: 59,500 km\r\n paved and graveled: 33,000 km\r\n unpaved: earth 26,500 km (1990)\r\n\r\n Inland waterways: 300 km perennially navigable\r\n\r\n Pipelines: crude oil 750 km; refined products 780 km; natural gas 560\r\n km (1992)\r\n\r\n Ports: Daugavpils, Liepaja, Riga, Ventspils\r\n\r\n Merchant marine:\r\n total: 85 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 774,182 GRT/1,010,517 DWT\r\n\r\n ships by type: cargo 17, oil tanker 37, refrigerated cargo 24,\r\n roll-on/roll-off cargo 7\r\n\r\n Airports:\r\n total: 50\r\n with paved runways 2,438 to 3,047 m: 6\r\n with paved runways 1,524 to 2,437 m: 2\r\n with paved runways 914 to 1,523 m: 1\r\n with paved runways under 914 m: 27\r\n with unpaved runways 2,438 to 3,047 m: 2\r\n with unpaved runways 914 to 1,523 m: 2\r\n with unpaved runways under 914 m: 10\r\n\r\n@Latvia:Communications\r\n\r\n Telephone system: 660,000 telephones; 240 telephones/1,000 persons\r\n (1993); Latvia is better provided with telephone service than most of\r\n the other former Soviet republics; an NMT-450 analog cellular\r\n telephone network covers 75% of Latvia's population\r\n local: NA\r\n intercity: NA\r\n international: international traffic carried by leased connection to\r\n the Moscow international gateway switch and through the new Ericsson\r\n AXE local/transit digital telephone exchange in Riga and through the\r\n Finnish cellular net; electronic mail capability by Sprint data\r\n network\r\n\r\n Radio:\r\n broadcast stations: AM NA, FM NA, shortwave NA\r\n radios: NA\r\n\r\n Television:\r\n broadcast stations: NA\r\n televisions: NA\r\n\r\n@Latvia:Defense Forces\r\n\r\n Branches: Ground Forces, Navy, Air and Air Defense Forces, Security\r\n Forces (internal and border troops), Border Guard, Home Guard\r\n (Zemessardze)\r\n\r\n Manpower availability: males age 15-49 658,193; males fit for military\r\n service 517,896; males reach military age (18) annually 18,736 (1995\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n Defense expenditures: 176 million rubles, 3% to 5% of GDP (1994); note\r\n - conversion of the military budget into US dollars using the\r\n prevailing exchange rate could produce misleading results\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nLEBANON\r\n\r\n Note--Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political\r\n institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since the end of\r\n the devastating 16-year civil war which began in 1975. Under the Ta'if\r\n accord - the blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese have\r\n established a more equitable political system, particularly by giving\r\n Muslims a greater say in the political process. Since December 1990,\r\n the Lebanese have formed three cabinets and conducted the first\r\n legislative election in 20 years. Most of the militias have been\r\n weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has seized vast\r\n quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and extended\r\n central government authority over about one-half of the country.\r\n Hizballah, the radical Sh'ia party, retains most of its weapons.\r\n Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel maintains troops\r\n in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia, The Army\r\n of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous\r\n to its border. The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared\r\n security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of\r\n Jazzine. As of December 1993, Syria maintained about 30,000-35,000\r\n troops in Lebanon. These troops are based mainly in Beirut, North\r\n Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment was legitimized by\r\n the Arab League early in Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if accord.\r\n Citing the continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and\r\n failure of the Lebanese Government to implement all of the\r\n constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord, Damascus has so far\r\n refused to withdraw its troops from Beirut.\r\n\r\n@Lebanon:Geography\r\n\r\n Location: Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Israel\r\n and Syria\r\n\r\n Map references: Middle East\r\n\r\n Area:\r\n total area: 10,400 sq km\r\n land area: 10,230 sq km\r\n comparative area: about 0.8 times the size of Connecticut\r\n\r\n Land boundaries: total 454 km, Israel 79 km, Syria 375 km\r\n\r\n Coastline: 225 km\r\n\r\n Maritime claims:\r\n territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\n International disputes: separated from Israel by the 1949 Armistice\r\n Line;

The battered economy has also been propped up\r\n by a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and\r\n medium-scale manufacturers. Family remittances, banking transactions,\r\n manufactured and farm exports, the narcotics trade, and international\r\n emergency aid are the main sources of foreign exchange. In the\r\n relatively settled year of 1991, industrial production, agricultural\r\n output, and exports showed substantial gains. The further rebuilding\r\n of the war-ravaged country was delayed in 1992 because of an upturn in\r\n political wrangling. In October 1992, Rafiq HARIRI was appointed Prime\r\n Minister. HARIRI, a wealthy entrepreneur, announced ambitious plans\r\n for Lebanon's reconstruction which involve a substantial influx of\r\n foreign aid and investment. Progress on restoring basic services is\r\n limited. Since Prime Minister HARIRI's appointment, the most\r\n significant improvement lies in the stabilization of the Lebanese\r\n pound, which had gained over 30% in value by yearend 1993. The years\r\n 1993 and 1994 were marked by efforts of the new administration to\r\n encourage domestic and foreign investment and to obtain additional\r\n international assistance. The construction sector led the 8.5% advance\r\n in real GDP in 1994.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $15.8 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 8.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $4,360 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 12% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 35% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.4 billion\r\n expenditures: $3.2 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $925 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: agricultural products, chemicals, textiles, precious and\r\n semiprecious metals and jewelry, metals and metal products\r\n partners: Saudi Arabia 21%, Switzerland 9.5%, Jordan 6%, Kuwait 12%,\r\n US 5%\r\n\r\n Imports: $4.1 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: consumer goods, machinery and transport equipment,\r\n petroleum products\r\n partners: Italy 14%, France 12%, US 6%, Turkey 5%, Saudi Arabia 3%\r\n\r\n External debt: $765 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 25% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 1,220,000 kW\r\n production: 2.5 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 676 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: banking, food processing, textiles, cement, oil refining,\r\n chemicals, jewelry, some metal fabricating\r\n\r\n Agriculture: principal products - citrus fruits, vegetables, potatoes,\r\n olives, tobacco, hemp (hashish), sheep, goats;

Its economy is based on\r\n agriculture, light manufacturing, and remittances from laborers\r\n employed in South Africa (these remittances supplement domestic income\r\n by as much as 45%). The great majority of households gain their\r\n livelihoods from subsistence farming and migrant labor; a large\r\n portion of the adult male work force is employed in South African\r\n mines. Manufacturing depends largely on farm products to support the\r\n milling, canning, leather, and jute industries; other industries\r\n include textile, clothing, and construction. Although drought has\r\n decreased agricultural activity over the past few years, improvement\r\n of a major hydropower facility will permit the sale of water to South\r\n Africa and allow Lesotho's economy to continue its moderate growth.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $2.6 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,340 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 13.9% (1993)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: substantial unemployment and underemployment\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $438 million\r\n expenditures: $430 million, including capital expenditures of $155\r\n million (FY93/94 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $109 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\n commodities: wool, mohair, wheat, cattle, peas, beans, corn, hides,\r\n skins, baskets\r\n partners: South Africa 42%, EC 28%, North and South America 25% (1991)\r\n\r\n Imports: $964 million (c.i.f., 1992)\r\n commodities: mainly corn, building materials, clothing, vehicles,\r\n machinery, medicines, petroleum\r\n partners: South Africa 94%, Asia 3%, EC 1% (1991)\r\n\r\n External debt: $512 million (1993)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 10%;

Many will not return. Richly endowed with water, mineral\r\n resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia\r\n had been a producer and exporter of basic products, while local\r\n manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope.\r\n Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction\r\n and repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who have fled to\r\n neighboring countries. The political impasse between the interim\r\n government and rebel leader Charles TAYLOR has prevented restoration\r\n of normal economic life, including the re-establishment of a strong\r\n central government with effective economic development programs. The\r\n economy deteriorated further in 1994.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $2.3 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $770 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $242.1 million\r\n expenditures: $435.4 million, including capital expenditures of $29.5\r\n million (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $505 million (f.o.b., 1989 est.)\r\n commodities: iron ore 61%, rubber 20%, timber 11%, coffee\r\n partners: US, EC, Netherlands\r\n\r\n Imports: $394 million (c.i.f., 1989 est.)\r\n commodities: mineral fuels, chemicals, machinery, transportation\r\n equipment, rice and other foodstuffs\r\n partners: US, EC, Japan, China, Netherlands, ECOWAS\r\n\r\n External debt: $2.1 billion (September 1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate NA% (1993-94);

In 1990 per capita GDP was the\r\n highest in Africa at $5,410, but GDP growth rates have slowed and\r\n fluctuated sharply in response to changes in the world oil market.\r\n Import restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to\r\n periodic shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. Windfall revenues\r\n from the hike in world oil prices in late 1990 improved the foreign\r\n payments position and resulted in a current account surplus through\r\n 1992. The nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account\r\n for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly\r\n agricultural products to include petrochemicals, iron, steel, and\r\n aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs\r\n 18% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely\r\n limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food\r\n requirements. The UN sanctions imposed in April 1992 have not yet had\r\n a major impact on the economy because Libya's oil revenues generate\r\n sufficient foreign exchange which sustains imports of food, consumer\r\n goods, and equipment for the oil industry and ongoing development\r\n projects.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $32.9 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -0.9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $6,510 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 25% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $8.1 billion\r\n expenditures: $9.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $3.1\r\n billion (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $7.2 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: crude oil, refined petroleum products, natural gas\r\n partners: Italy, Germany, Spain, France, UK, Turkey, Greece, Egypt\r\n\r\n Imports: $6.9 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: machinery, transport equipment, food, manufactured goods\r\n partners: Italy, Germany, UK, France, Spain, Turkey, Tunisia, Eastern\r\n Europe\r\n\r\n External debt: $3.5 billion excluding military debt (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 10.5% (1990)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 4,600,000 kW\r\n production: 16.1 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 3,078 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: petroleum, food processing, textiles, handicrafts, cement\r\n\r\n Agriculture: 5% of GDP;

Almost 50% of state\r\n property has been privatized and trade is diversifying with a gradual\r\n shift away from the former Soviet Union to Western markets. In\r\n addition, the Lithuanian government has adhered to a disciplined\r\n budgetary and financial policy which has brought inflation down from a\r\n monthly average of around 14% in first half 1993 to an average of 3.1%\r\n in 1994. Nevertheless, the process has been painful with industrial\r\n output in 1993 less than half the 1991 level. The economy appeared to\r\n have bottomed out in 1994, and Vilnius's policies have laid the\r\n groundwork for vigorous recovery over the next few years. Recovery\r\n will build on Lithuanian's strategic location with its ice-free port\r\n at Klaipeda and its rail and highway hub in Vilnius connecting it with\r\n Eastern Europe, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, and on its agriculture\r\n potential, highly skilled labor force, and diversified industrial\r\n sector. Lacking important natural resources, it will remain dependent\r\n on imports of fuels and raw materials.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $13.5 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -0.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $3,500 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3.1% (monthly average 1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 4.5% (January 1995)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $258.5 million\r\n expenditures: $270.2 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $2.2 billion (1994)\r\n commodities: electronics 18%, petroleum products 5%, food 10%,\r\n chemicals 6% (1989)\r\n partners: Russia, Ukraine, Germany\r\n\r\n Imports: $2.7 billion (1994)\r\n commodities: oil 24%, machinery 14%, chemicals 8%, grain NA% (1989)\r\n partners: Russia, Germany, Belarus\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -52% (1992);

Agriculture is based on small\r\n but highly productive family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until\r\n recently dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified,\r\n particularly toward high-technology firms. During the past decade,\r\n growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the\r\n decline in steel. Services, especially banking, account for a growing\r\n proportion of the economy. Luxembourg participates in an economic\r\n union with Belgium on trade and most financial matters, is also\r\n closely connected economically to the Netherlands, and as a member of\r\n the 15-member European Union enjoys the advantages of the open\r\n European market.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $9.2 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 2.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $22,830 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3.6% (1992)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 2.4% (1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $4 billion\r\n expenditures: $4.05 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $6.4 billion (f.o.b., 1991 est.)\r\n commodities: finished steel products, chemicals, rubber products,\r\n glass, aluminum, other industrial products\r\n partners: EC 76%, US 5%\r\n\r\n Imports: $8.3 billion (c.i.f., 1991 est.)\r\n commodities: minerals, metals, foodstuffs, quality consumer goods\r\n partners: Belgium 37%, Germany 31%, France 12%, US 2%\r\n\r\n External debt: $800 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -0.5% (1990);

The economy depends on outside sources for all of its\r\n oil and gas and most of its modern machinery and parts. An important\r\n supplement of GDP is the remittances from thousands of Macedonians\r\n working in Germany and other West European nations. Continued\r\n political turmoil, both internally and in the region as a whole,\r\n prevents any swift readjustments of trade patterns and economic\r\n programs. The country's industrial output and GDP are expected to\r\n decline further in 1995. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's\r\n geographical isolation, technological backwardness, and potential\r\n political instability place it far down the list of countries of\r\n interest to Western investors. Resolution of the dispute with Greece\r\n and an internal commitment to economic reform would encourage foreign\r\n investment over the long run. In the immediate future, the worst\r\n scenario for the economy would be the spread of fighting across its\r\n borders.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $1.9 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -15% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $900 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 54% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 30% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $1.06 billion (1993)\r\n commodities: manufactured goods 40%, machinery and transport equipment\r\n 14%, miscellaneous manufactured articles 23%, raw materials 7.6%, food\r\n (rice) and live animals 5.7%, beverages and tobacco 4.5%, chemicals\r\n 4.7% (1990)\r\n partners: principally Serbia and Montenegro and the other former\r\n Yugoslav republics, Germany, Greece, Albania\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.2 billion (1993)\r\n commodities: fuels and lubricants 19%, manufactured goods 18%,\r\n machinery and transport equipment 15%, food and live animals 14%,\r\n chemicals 11.4%, raw materials 10%, miscellaneous manufactured\r\n articles 8.0%, beverages and tobacco 3.5% (1990)\r\n partners: other former Yugoslav republics, Greece, Albania, Germany,\r\n Bulgaria\r\n\r\n External debt: $840 million (1992)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -14% (1993)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 1,600,000 kW\r\n production: NA kWh\r\n consumption per capita: NA kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: low levels of technology predominate, such as, oil\r\n refining by distillation only;

Agriculture, including fishing\r\n and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for over 30%\r\n of GDP and contributing more than 70% of total export earnings.\r\n Industry is largely confined to the processing of agricultural\r\n products and textile manufacturing; in 1991 it accounted for only 13%\r\n of GDP. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year development plan\r\n that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by 1990,\r\n increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports.\r\n Subsequently, growth in output has been held back because of\r\n protracted antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political\r\n reform. Since 1993, corruption and political instability have caused\r\n the economy and infrastructure to decay further. Since April 1994, the\r\n government commitment to economic reforms has been erratic.

The economy is predominately agricultural, with about 90%\r\n of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for 40%\r\n of GDP and 90% of export revenues. After two years of weak\r\n performance, economic growth improved significantly in 1988-91 as a\r\n result of good weather and a broadly based economic adjustment effort\r\n by the government. Drought cut overall output sharply in 1992, but the\r\n lost ground was recovered in 1993. The economy depends on substantial\r\n inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and\r\n individual donor nations. The new government faces strong challenges,\r\n e.g., to spur exports, to improve educational and health facilities,\r\n and to deal with environmental problems of deforestation and erosion.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $7.3 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 9.3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $750 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 30% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $416 million\r\n expenditures: $498 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $311 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: tobacco, tea, sugar, coffee, peanuts, wood products\r\n partners: US, UK, Zambia, South Africa, Germany\r\n\r\n Imports: $308 million (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: food, petroleum products, semimanufactures, consumer\r\n goods, transportation equipment\r\n partners: South Africa, Japan, US, UK, Zimbabwe\r\n\r\n External debt: $1.8 billion (December 1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 3.5% accounts for about 15% of GDP\r\n (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 190,000 kW\r\n production: 820 million kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 77 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: agricultural processing (tea, tobacco, sugar), sawmilling,\r\n cement, consumer goods\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for 40% of GDP;

Over 90% of government\r\n tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes. During\r\n the 1980s tourism became one of the most important and highest growth\r\n sectors of the economy. In 1993, tourism accounted for 17% of GDP and\r\n more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. The\r\n Maldivian government initiated an economic reform program in 1989\r\n initially by lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the\r\n private sector. Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations to allow\r\n more foreign investment. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to\r\n play a minor role in the economy, constrained by the limited\r\n availability of cultivatable land and the shortage of domestic labor.\r\n Most staple foods must be imported. In 1993, industry which consisted\r\n mainly of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts accounted\r\n for about 6% of GDP.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $360 million (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5.4% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,500 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 20% (1993)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NEGL%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $95 million (excluding foreign transfers)\r\n expenditures: $143 million, including capital expenditures of $71\r\n million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $38.5 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: fish, clothing\r\n partners: US, UK, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Germany\r\n\r\n Imports: $177.8 million (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: consumer goods, intermediate and capital goods, petroleum\r\n products\r\n partners: Singapore, Germany, Sri Lanka, India, Japan\r\n\r\n External debt: $130 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 24% (1990);

Economic activity is largely\r\n confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger. About 10% of the\r\n population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is engaged in\r\n agriculture and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on\r\n processing farm commodities. The economy is beginning to turn around\r\n after contracting through 1992-93, largely because of enhanced exports\r\n and import substitute production in the wake of the 50% devaluation of\r\n January 1994. Post-devaluation inflation appears to have peaked at 35%\r\n in 1994 and the government appears to be keeping on track with its IMF\r\n structural adjustment program.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $5.4 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 2.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $600 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 35% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $376 million\r\n expenditures: $697 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $415 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: cotton, livestock, gold\r\n partners: mostly franc zone and Western Europe\r\n\r\n Imports: $842 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, construction\r\n materials, petroleum, textiles\r\n partners: mostly franc zone and Western Europe\r\n\r\n External debt: $2.6 billion (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -1.4% (1992 est.);

Malta produces only about 20%\r\n of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no\r\n domestic energy sources. Consequently, the economy is highly dependent\r\n on foreign trade and services. Manufacturing and tourism are the\r\n largest contributors to the economy. Manufacturing accounts for about\r\n 24% of GDP, with the electronics and textile industries major\r\n contributors and with the state-owned Malta drydocks employing about\r\n 4,300 people. In 1994, over 1,000,000 tourists visited the island. Per\r\n capita GDP of $10,760 places Malta in the range of the less affluent\r\n EU countries.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $3.9 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $10,760 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 4.5% (March 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.4 billion\r\n expenditures: $1.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $215\r\n million (FY94/95 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $1.3 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment, clothing and footware,\r\n printed matter\r\n partners: Italy 32%, Germany 16%, UK 8%\r\n\r\n Imports: $2.1 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: food, petroleum, machinery and semimanufactured goods\r\n partners: Italy 27%, Germany 14%, UK 13%, US 9%\r\n\r\n External debt: $603 million (1992)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 5.4% (1992);

Agriculture accounts for about 10% of GDP and the\r\n small industrial sector for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with\r\n most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana\r\n exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat,\r\n vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a\r\n chronic trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from\r\n France. Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as\r\n a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work force is\r\n employed in the service sector and in administration.

Mauritania has extensive deposits of\r\n iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports. The decline\r\n in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in\r\n production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing\r\n areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this\r\n key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near\r\n Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, drought and economic\r\n mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of foreign debt.\r\n The government has begun the second stage of an economic reform\r\n program in consultation with the World Bank, the IMF, and major donor\r\n countries. Short-term growth prospects are gloomy because of the heavy\r\n debt service burden, rapid population growth, and vulnerability to\r\n climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $2.4 billion (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,110 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 10% (1993)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 20% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $280 million\r\n expenditures: $346 million, including capital expenditures of $61\r\n million (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $401 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: iron ore, fish and fish products\r\n partners: Japan 27%, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg\r\n\r\n Imports: $378 million (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: foodstuffs, consumer goods, petroleum products, capital\r\n goods\r\n partners: Algeria 15%, China 6%, US 3%, France, Germany, Spain, Italy\r\n\r\n External debt: $1.9 billion (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate NA%;

For most of the\r\n period annual growth has been of the order of 5% to 6%. This\r\n remarkable achievement has been reflected in increased life\r\n expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much improved\r\n infrastructure.

The government's\r\n development strategy centers on industrialization (with a view to\r\n modernization and to exports), agricultural diversification, and\r\n tourism.

Mexico's\r\n membership in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the\r\n United States and Canada, its solid record of economic reforms, and\r\n its strong growth in the second and third quarters of 1994 - at an\r\n annual rate of 3.8% and 4.5% respectively - seemed to augur bright\r\n prospects for 1995. However, an overvalued exchange rate and widening\r\n current account deficits created an imbalance that ultimately proved\r\n unsustainable. To finance the trade gap, Mexico City had become\r\n increasingly reliant on volatile portfolio investment. A series of\r\n political shocks in 1994 - an uprising in the southern state of\r\n Chiapas, the assassination of a presidential candidate, several high\r\n profile kidnappings, the killing of a second high-level political\r\n figure, and renewed threats from the Chiapas rebels - combined with\r\n rising international interest rates and concerns of a devaluation to\r\n undermine investor confidence and prompt massive outflows of capital.\r\n The dwindling of foreign exchange reserves, which the central bank had\r\n been using to defend the currency, forced the new administration to\r\n change the exchange rate policy and allow the currency to float freely\r\n in the last days of 1994. The adjustment roiled Mexican financial\r\n markets, leading to a 30% to 40% weakening of the peso relative to the\r\n dollar. ZEDILLO announced an emergency economic program that included\r\n federal budget cuts and plans for more privatizations, but it failed\r\n to restore investor confidence quickly. While the devaluation is\r\n likely to help Mexican exporters, whose products are now cheaper, it\r\n also raises the specter of an inflationary spiral if domestic\r\n producers increase their prices and workers demand wage hikes.\r\n Although strong economic fundamentals bode well for Mexico's\r\n longer-term outlook, prospects for solid growth and low inflation have\r\n deteriorated considerably, at least through 1995.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $728.7 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 3.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $7,900 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 7.1% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 9.8% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $96.99 billion (1994 est.)\r\n expenditures: $96.51 billion (1994 est.), including capital\r\n expenditures of $NA (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $60.8 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.), includes in-bond\r\n industries\r\n commodities: crude oil, oil products, coffee, silver, engines, motor\r\n vehicles, cotton, consumer electronics\r\n partners: US 82%, Japan 1.4%, EC 5% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Imports: $79.4 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.), includes in-bond\r\n industries\r\n commodities: metal-working machines, steel mill products, agricultural\r\n machinery, electrical equipment, car parts for assembly, repair parts\r\n for motor vehicles, aircraft, and aircraft parts\r\n partners: US 74%, Japan 4.7%, EC 11% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n External debt: $128 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 4.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 28,780,000 kW\r\n production: 122 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 1,239 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: food and beverages, tobacco, chemicals, iron and steel,\r\n petroleum, mining, textiles, clothing, motor vehicles, consumer\r\n durables, tourism\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for 7% of GDP;

As a result, Moldova's economy is primarily\r\n based on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco.\r\n Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal, and natural gas,\r\n and energy shortages have contributed to sharp production declines\r\n since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Moldovan government\r\n is making steady progress on an ambitious economic reform agenda, and\r\n the IMF has called Moldova a model for the region. As part of its\r\n reform efforts, Chisinau has introduced a stable currency, freed all\r\n prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises and\r\n backed their steady privatization, removed export controls, and freed\r\n interest rates. Chisinau appears strongly committed to continuing\r\n these reforms in 1995. Meanwhile, privatization of medium and large\r\n enterprises got underway in mid-1994 and is expected to pick up speed\r\n in 1995. To improve its precarious energy situation, Chisinau reached\r\n an agreement with Moscow in December 1994 on gas deliveries for 1995.\r\n Gazprom, Russia's national gas company, has agreed to reduce prices\r\n for natural gas deliveries to Moldova from the world market price of\r\n $80/thousand cubic meters (tcm) to $58/tcm in return for part\r\n ownership of the Moldovan pipeline system.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $11.9 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -30% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $2,670 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 7.6% per month (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 1% (includes only officially registered unemployed;\r\n large numbers of underemployed workers)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n note: budget deficit for 1993 approximately 6% of GDP\r\n\r\n Exports: $144 million to outside the FSU countries (1994);

About 50%\r\n of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,\r\n banks, and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from\r\n tourism.

In past years extensive mineral resources had\r\n been developed with Soviet support; total Soviet assistance at its\r\n height amounted to 30% of GDP. The mining and processing of coal,\r\n copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part\r\n of industrial production. Timber and fishing are also important\r\n sectors.

Since\r\n the early 1980s the government has pursued an economic program toward\r\n these objectives with the support of the IMF, the World Bank, and the\r\n Paris Club of creditors. The economy has substantial assets to draw\r\n on: the world's largest phosphate reserves, diverse agricultural and\r\n fishing resources, a sizable tourist industry, a growing manufacturing\r\n sector, and remittances from Moroccans working abroad. A severe\r\n drought in 1992-93 depressed economic activity and held down exports.\r\n Real GDP contracted by 4.4% in 1992 and 1.1% in 1993. Despite these\r\n setbacks, initiatives to relax capital controls, strengthen the\r\n banking sector, and privatize state enterprises went forward in\r\n 1993-94. Favorable rainfall in 1994 boosted agricultural production by\r\n 40%.

Indeed, national output,\r\n consumption, and investment declined throughout the first half of the\r\n 1980s because of internal disorders, lack of government administrative\r\n control, and a growing foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid,\r\n attracted by an economic reform policy, resulted in successive years\r\n of economic growth in the late 1980s, but aid has declined steadily\r\n since 1989. Agricultural output is at only 75% of its 1981 level, and\r\n grain has to be imported. Industry operates at only 20%-40% of\r\n capacity. The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep\r\n afloat. Peace accords signed in October 1992 improved chances of\r\n foreign investment, aided IMF-supported economic reforms, and\r\n supported continued economic recovery. Elections held in 1994 diverted\r\n government attention from the economy, resulting in slippage and\r\n delays in the economic reform program. Nonetheless, growth in 1994 was\r\n solid and can continue into the late 1990s given continued foreign\r\n help in meeting debt obligations.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $10.6 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5.8% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $610 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 50% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 50% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $252 million\r\n expenditures: $607 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $150 million (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: shrimp 40%, cashews, cotton, sugar, copra, citrus\r\n partners: Spain, South Africa, US, Portugal, Japan\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.14 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: food, clothing, farm equipment, petroleum\r\n partners: South Africa, UK, France, Japan, Portugal\r\n\r\n External debt: $5 billion (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 5% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 2,360,000 kW\r\n production: 1.7 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 58 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: food, beverages, chemicals (fertilizer, soap, paints),\r\n petroleum products, textiles, nonmetallic mineral products (cement,\r\n glass, asbestos), tobacco\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for 50% of GDP and about 90% of exports;

Mining accounts for almost\r\n 25% of GDP. Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals\r\n in Africa and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial\r\n diamond deposits are among the richest in the world, making Namibia a\r\n primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large\r\n quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten. More than half\r\n the population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence\r\n agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia must import some of its food.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $5.8 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5.8% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $3,600 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 11% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 35% in urban areas (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $941 million\r\n expenditures: $1.05 billion, including capital expenditures of $157\r\n million (FY93/94)\r\n\r\n Exports: $1.3 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: diamonds, copper, gold, zinc, lead, uranium, cattle,\r\n processed fish, karakul skins\r\n partners: Switzerland, South Africa, Germany, Japan\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.1 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: foodstuffs, petroleum products and fuel, machinery and\r\n equipment\r\n partners: South Africa, Germany, US, Switzerland\r\n\r\n External debt: about $385 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -14% (1993);

Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a\r\n livelihood for over 90% of the population and accounting for half of\r\n GDP. Industrial activity is limited, mainly involving the processing\r\n of agricultural produce (jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain).\r\n Production of textiles and carpets has expanded recently and accounted\r\n for 85% of foreign exchange earnings in FY93/94. Apart from\r\n agricultural land and forests, exploitable natural resources are mica,\r\n hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production in the late 1980s\r\n grew by about 5%, as compared with annual population growth of 2.6%.\r\n More than 40% of the population is undernourished. Since May 1991, the\r\n government has been encouraging trade and foreign investment, e.g., by\r\n eliminating business licenses and registration requirements in order\r\n to simplify domestic and foreign investment. The government also has\r\n been cutting public expenditures by reducing subsidies, privatizing\r\n state industries, and laying off civil servants. Prospects for foreign\r\n trade and investment in the 1990s remain poor, however, because of the\r\n small size of the economy, its technological backwardness, its\r\n remoteness, and susceptibility to natural disaster. The international\r\n community provides funding for 70% of Nepal's developmental budget and\r\n for 30% of total budgetary expenditures. The government, realizing\r\n that attempts to reverse three years of liberalization would\r\n jeopardize this vital support, almost certainly will move ahead with\r\n its reform program in 1995-96.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $22.4 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,060 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 9.6% (June 1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%;

The government makes its presence felt, however,\r\n through many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare programs\r\n affecting most aspects of economic activity. The trade and financial\r\n services sector contributes over 50% of GDP. Industrial activity\r\n provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the food-processing,\r\n oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The highly mechanized\r\n agricultural sector employs only 4% of the labor force, but provides\r\n large surpluses for export and the domestic food-processing industry.\r\n Indeed the Netherlands ranks third worldwide in value of agricultural\r\n exports, behind the US and France. High unemployment and a sizable\r\n budget deficit are currently the most serious economic problems. Many\r\n of the economic issues of the 1990s will reflect the course of\r\n European economic integration.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $275.8 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $17,940 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 2.5% (December 1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 8.8% (December 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $109.9 billion\r\n expenditures: $122.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $153 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: metal products, chemicals, processed food and tobacco,\r\n agricultural products\r\n partners: EC 77% (Germany 27%, Belgium-Luxembourg 15%, UK 10%),\r\n Central and Eastern Europe 10%, US 4% (1991)\r\n\r\n Imports: $137 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: raw materials and semifinished products, consumer goods,\r\n transportation equipment, crude oil, food products\r\n partners: EC 64% (Germany 26%, Belgium-Luxembourg 14%, UK 8%), US 8%\r\n (1991)\r\n\r\n External debt: $0\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -1.5% (1993 est.);

The government has hoped that dynamic growth would boost\r\n real incomes, broaden and deepen the technological capabilities of the\r\n industrial sector, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the\r\n expansion of welfare benefits. The initial results were mixed:\r\n inflation is down from double-digit levels, but growth was sluggish in\r\n 1988-91. In 1992-93, growth picked up to 3% annually, a sign that the\r\n new economic approach was beginning to pay off. Business confidence\r\n strengthened in 1994, and export demand picked up in the Asia-Pacific\r\n region, resulting in 6.2% growth.

Annual inflation fell from more than 750% in 1991 to less than\r\n 5% in 1992. Inflation rose again to an estimated 20% in 1993, although\r\n this increase was due almost entirely to a large currency devaluation\r\n in January. As of early 1994, the government was close to finalizing\r\n an enhanced structural adjustment facility with the IMF, after the\r\n previous standby facility expired in early 1993. Despite these\r\n successes, achieving overall economic growth in an economy scarred by\r\n misguided economic values and civil war during the 1980s has proved\r\n elusive. Economic growth was flat in 1992 and slightly negative in\r\n 1993. Nicaragua's per capita foreign debt is one of the highest in the\r\n world; nonetheless, as of late 1993, Nicaragua was current on its\r\n post-1988 debt as well as on payments to the international financial\r\n institutions. Definition of property rights remains a problem;\r\n ownership disputes over large tracts of land, businesses, and homes\r\n confiscated by the previous government have yet to be resolved.

The economy is\r\n centered on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry, and reexport\r\n trade, and increasingly less on uranium, its major export throughout\r\n the 1970s and 1980s. Uranium revenues dropped by almost 50% between\r\n 1983 and 1990 with the end of the uranium boom. Terms of trade with\r\n Nigeria, Niger's largest regional trade partner, have improved\r\n dramatically since the 50% devaluation of the African franc in January\r\n 1994; this devaluation boosted exports of livestock, peas, onions, and\r\n the products of Niger's small cotton industry. The government relies\r\n on bilateral and multilateral aid for operating expenses and public\r\n investment and is strongly induced to adhere to structural adjustment\r\n programs designed by the IMF and the World Bank.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $4.6 billion (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 1.4% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $550 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $188 million\r\n expenditures: $400 million, including capital expenditures of $125\r\n million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $246 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: uranium ore 67%, livestock products 20%, cowpeas, onions\r\n partners: France 77%, Nigeria 8%, Cote d'Ivoire, Italy\r\n\r\n Imports: $286 million (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: consumer goods, primary materials, machinery, vehicles\r\n and parts, petroleum, cereals\r\n partners: France 23%, Cote d'Ivoire, Germany, Italy, Japan\r\n\r\n External debt: $1.2 billion (December 1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -2.7% (1992 est.);

Nigeria's\r\n unpopular military rulers show no sign of wanting to restore\r\n democratic civilian rule in the near future and appear divided on how\r\n to redress fundamental economic imbalances that cause troublesome\r\n inflation and the steady depreciation of the naira. The government's\r\n domestic and international arrears continue to limit economic growth -\r\n even in the oil sector - and prevent an agreement with the IMF and\r\n bilateral creditors on debt relief. The inefficient (largely\r\n subsistence) agricultural sector has failed to keep up with rapid\r\n population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter of food, now\r\n must import food.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $122.6 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -0.8% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,250 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 53% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 28% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $9 billion\r\n expenditures: $10.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $11.9 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\n commodities: oil 95%, cocoa, rubber\r\n partners: US 54%, EC 23%\r\n\r\n Imports: $8.3 billion (c.i.f., 1992)\r\n commodities: machinery and equipment, manufactured goods, food and\r\n animals\r\n partners: EC 64%, US 10%, Japan 7%\r\n\r\n External debt: $29.5 billion (1992)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 7.7% (1991);

The government controls\r\n key areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale\r\n state enterprises) and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing,\r\n and areas with sparse resources. Norway also maintains an extensive\r\n welfare system that helps propel public sector expenditures to\r\n slightly more than 50% of the GDP and results in one of the highest\r\n average tax burdens in the world (54%). A small country with a high\r\n dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an exporter of\r\n raw materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and\r\n medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations.\r\n The country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum,\r\n hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on\r\n its oil sector to keep its economy afloat. Norway imports more than\r\n half its food needs. Although one of the government's main priorities\r\n is to reduce this dependency, this situation is not likely to improve\r\n for years to come. The government also hopes to reduce unemployment\r\n and strengthen and diversify the economy through tax reform and a\r\n series of expansionary budgets. The budget deficit is expected to hit\r\n a record 8% of GDP because of welfare spending and bail-outs of the\r\n banking system. Unemployment is currently running at 8.4% - including\r\n those in job programs - because of the weakness of the economy outside\r\n the oil sector. Economic growth, only 1.6% in 1993, moved up to 5.5%\r\n in 1994.

She has\r\n been under pressure from international donors and the IMF - which gave\r\n Pakistan a $1.3 billion structural adjustment credit in February 1994\r\n - to continue the economic reforms and austerity measures begun by her\r\n predecessor, caretaker Prime Minister Moeen QURESHI (July-October\r\n 1993). Foreign exchange reserves climbed to more than $3 billion in\r\n 1994, and the budget deficit was substantially reduced. Real GDP\r\n growth was 4% in FY93/94, up from 2.3% in FY92/93. Foreign direct and\r\n portfolio investment also have increased. Privatization of large\r\n public sector utilities began in 1994 with the sale of 12% of the\r\n Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) and the Water and Power\r\n Development Authority (WAPDA); the sale of state-owned banks and other\r\n large units are planned for 1995. Still, the government must cope with\r\n long-standing economic vulnerabilities - high levels of debt service\r\n and defense spending, a small tax base, a huge population, and\r\n dependence on cotton-based exports - which hamper its ability to\r\n create a stable economic environment. In addition, Pakistan's\r\n infrastructure is inadequate and deteriorating, low levels of literacy\r\n constrain industrial growth, and increasing sectarian, ethnic, and\r\n tribal violence disrupt production.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $248.5 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,930 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 12% (FY93/94)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 10% (FY90/91 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $10.5 billion\r\n expenditures: $11.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $3.1\r\n billion (FY93/94)\r\n\r\n Exports: $6.7 billion (1993)\r\n commodities: cotton, textiles, clothing, rice, leather, carpets\r\n partners: US, Japan, Hong Kong, Germany, UK, UAE, France\r\n\r\n Imports: $9.5 billion (1993)\r\n commodities: petroleum, petroleum products, machinery, transportation\r\n equipment, vegetable oils, animal fats, chemicals\r\n partners: Japan, US, Germany, UK, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, South Korea\r\n\r\n External debt: $24 billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 5.6% (FY93/94);

GDP grew at\r\n 3.6% in 1994, a respectable rate, yet below the 7.1% average of the\r\n early 1990s. Banking and financial services and trade through the\r\n Colon Free Zone continued to expand rapidly, with the industrial and\r\n agricultural sectors experiencing little growth. The new\r\n administration, inaugurated 1 September 1994, has launched an economic\r\n plan designed to reverse rising unemployment, attract foreign\r\n investment, cut back the size of government, and modernize the\r\n economy. The success of the plan in meeting its goals for 1995 and\r\n beyond depends largely on the success of the administration in\r\n reforming the labor code and instituting the reforms necessary to join\r\n the GATT.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $12.3 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 3.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $4,670 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 1.8% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 12.9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.93 billion\r\n expenditures: $1.93 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994)\r\n\r\n Exports: $520 million (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: bananas 43%, shrimp 11%, sugar 4%, clothing 5%, coffee 2%\r\n\r\n partners: US 45%, EU, Central America and Caribbean\r\n\r\n Imports: $2.205 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: capital goods 21%, crude oil 11%, foodstuffs 9%, consumer\r\n goods, chemicals\r\n partners: US 40%, EU, Central America and Caribbean, Japan\r\n\r\n External debt: $6.7 billion (yearend 1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 1.8% (1994 est.);

Agriculture provides a\r\n subsistence livelihood for 85% of the population. Mining of numerous\r\n deposits, including copper and gold, accounts for about 60% of export\r\n earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and development aid under\r\n World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy. Robust growth in\r\n 1991-92 was led by the mining sector; the opening of a large new gold\r\n mine helped the advance. At the start of 1995, Port Moresby is looking\r\n primarily to the exploitation of mineral and petroleum resources to\r\n drive economic development but new prospecting in Papua New Guinea has\r\n slumped as other mineral-rich countries have stepped up their\r\n competition for international investment. Output from current projects\r\n will probably begin to taper off in 1996, but no new large ventures\r\n are being developed to succeed them.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $9.2 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 6.1% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $2,200 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 1.6% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.33 billion\r\n expenditures: $1.36 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $2.4 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: gold, copper ore, oil, logs, palm oil, coffee, cocoa,\r\n lobster\r\n partners: Australia, Japan, US, Singapore, New Zealand\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.2 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods,\r\n food, fuels, chemicals\r\n partners: Australia, Japan, UK, New Zealand, Netherlands\r\n\r\n External debt: $3.2 billion (1992)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: accounts for 32% of GDP\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 490,000 kW\r\n production: 1.8 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 390 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: copra crushing, palm oil processing, plywood production,\r\n wood chip production, mining of gold, silver, and copper,\r\n construction, tourism\r\n\r\n Agriculture: Accounts for 25% of GDP;

Paraguay\r\n lacks substantial mineral or petroleum resources but possesses a large\r\n hydropower potential. In a major step to increase its economic\r\n activity in the region, Paraguay in March 1991 joined the Southern\r\n Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes Brazil, Argentina, and\r\n Uruguay. In 1992, the government, through an unorthodox approach,\r\n reduced external debt with both commercial and official creditors by\r\n purchasing a sizable amount of the delinquent commercial debt in the\r\n secondary market at a substantial discount. The government had paid\r\n 100% of remaining official debt arrears to the US, Germany, France,\r\n and Spain. All commercial debt arrears have been rescheduled. For the\r\n long run, the government must press forward with general,\r\n market-oriented economic reforms. Growth of 3.5% in 1993 was spurred\r\n by higher-than-expected agricultural output and rising international\r\n commodity prices. Inflation picked up steam in fourth quarter 1993\r\n because of rises in public sector salaries and utility rates. GDP\r\n growth continued in 1994 at 3.5%. Although inflation declined a bit\r\n over 1993, increases in food prices, and crop and infrastructure\r\n damage from heavy rains at the end of the year, forced inflation to\r\n 18%, above the government's target of 15%. Paraguay reaffirmed its\r\n commitment to MERCOSUR on 1 January 1995 by implementing the\r\n organization's common external tariff.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $15.4 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 3.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $2,950 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 18% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 11.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.2 billion\r\n expenditures: $1.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $487\r\n million (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $728 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: cotton, soybeans, timber, vegetable oils, meat products,\r\n coffee, tung oil\r\n partners: EC 37%, Brazil 25%, Argentina 10%, Chile 6%, US 6%\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.38 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: capital goods, foodstuffs, consumer goods, raw materials,\r\n fuels\r\n partners: Brazil 30%, EC 20%, US 18%, Argentina 8%, Japan 7%\r\n\r\n External debt: $1.4 billion (yearend 1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 3.6% (1993 est.);

In the 1980s the economy\r\n suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita output, and\r\n mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World Bank\r\n support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An\r\n austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government\r\n took office in July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly\r\n contraction of economic activity, but the slide came to a halt late\r\n that year, and in 1991 output rose 2.4%. After a burst of inflation as\r\n the austerity program eliminated government price subsidies, monthly\r\n price increases eased to the single-digit level and by December 1991\r\n dropped to the lowest increase since mid-1987. Lima obtained a\r\n financial rescue package from multilateral lenders in September 1991,\r\n although it faced $14 billion in arrears on its external debt. By\r\n working with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and\r\n arrangements, the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March\r\n 1993. In 1992, GDP had fallen by 2.8%, in part because a\r\n warmer-than-usual El Nino current resulted in a 30% drop in the fish\r\n catch, but the economy rebounded as strong foreign investment helped\r\n push growth to 6% in 1993 and 8.6% in 1994.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $73.6 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 8.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $3,110 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 15% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 15%;

Drought and\r\n power supply problems hampered production, while inadequate revenues\r\n prevented government pump priming. Worker remittances helped to\r\n supplement GDP. A marked increase in capital goods imports,\r\n particularly power generating equipment, telecommunications equipment,\r\n and electronic data processors, contributed to 20% annual import\r\n growth in 1992-94.

Growth increased to 3.8% in 1993 and 5.5% in 1994 - the\r\n highest rate in Europe except for Albania. All of the growth since\r\n 1991 has come from the booming private sector, which now accounts for\r\n at least 55% of GDP, even though privatization of the state-owned\r\n enterprises is proceeding slowly and most industry remains in state\r\n hands. Industrial production increased 12% in 1994 - led by 50% jumps\r\n in the output of motor vehicles, radios and televisions, and pulp and\r\n paper - and is now well above the 1990 level. Inflation, which had\r\n approached 1,200% annually in early 1990, was down to about 30% in\r\n 1994, as the government held the budget deficit to 1.5% of GDP. After\r\n five years of steady increases, unemployment has leveled off at about\r\n 16% nationwide, although it approaches 30% in some regions. The trade\r\n deficit was sharply reduced in 1994, due mainly to increased exports\r\n to Western Europe, Poland's main customer. The leftist government\r\n elected in September 1993 gets generally good marks from foreign\r\n observers for its management of the budget but is often criticized for\r\n not moving faster on privatization.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $191.1 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $4,920 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 30% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 16.1% (November 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $27.1 billion\r\n expenditures: $30 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $16.3 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: intermediate goods 26.5%, machinery and transport\r\n equipment 18.1%, miscellaneous manufactures 16.7%, foodstuffs 9.4%,\r\n fuels 8.4% (1993)\r\n partners: Germany 33.4%, Russia 10.2%, Italy 5.3%, UK 4.3% (1993)\r\n\r\n Imports: $18.1 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment 29.6%, intermediate\r\n goods 18.5%, chemicals 13.3%, fuels 12.5%, miscellaneous manufactures\r\n 10.1%\r\n partners: Germany 35.8%, Italy 9.2%, Russia 8.5%, UK 6.6% (1993)\r\n\r\n External debt: $47 billion (1993);

This\r\n comeback rests on high levels of public investment, continuing strong\r\n export growth, and a gradual recovery in consumer spending. The\r\n government's long-run economic goal is the modernization of Portuguese\r\n markets, industry, infrastructure, and work force in order to catch up\r\n with productivity and income levels of the more advanced EU countries.\r\n Per capita income now equals only 55% of the EU average. Economic\r\n policy in 1994 focused on reducing inflationary pressures by lowering\r\n the fiscal deficit, maintaining a stable escudo, moderating wage\r\n increases, and encouraging increased competition. The government's\r\n medium-term objective is to be in the first tier of the EU countries\r\n eligible to join the economic and monetary union (EMU) as early as\r\n 1997. To this end, the 1995 budget posits a cut in total deficit to\r\n 5.8% of GDP.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $107.3 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 1.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $10,190 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 6.1% (May 1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 6.7% (May 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $31 billion\r\n expenditures: $41 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994)\r\n\r\n Exports: $15.4 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: clothing and footwear, machinery, cork and paper\r\n products, hides and skins\r\n partners: EU 75.5%, other developed countries 12.4%, US 4.3% (1994)\r\n\r\n Imports: $24.3 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment, agricultural products,\r\n chemicals, petroleum, textiles\r\n partners: EC 72%, other developed countries 10.9%, less developed\r\n countries 12.9%, US 3.4%\r\n\r\n External debt: $20 billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 1.5% (1994 est.);

The government has been\r\n pushing the development of a tourist industry to relieve high\r\n unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third of the labor force.\r\n The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is extraordinary\r\n and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and Indian\r\n communities are substantially better off than other segments of the\r\n population, often approaching European standards, whereas indigenous\r\n groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer\r\n nations of the African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in\r\n February 1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions.\r\n The economic well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued\r\n financial assistance from France.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $2.5 billion (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $3,900 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 35% (February 1991)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $358 million\r\n expenditures: $914 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1986 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $166 million (f.o.b., 1988)\r\n commodities: sugar 75%, rum and molasses 4%, perfume essences 4%,\r\n lobster 3%, vanilla and tea 1%\r\n partners: France, Mauritius, Bahrain, South Africa, Italy\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.7 billion (c.i.f., 1988)\r\n commodities: manufactured goods, food, beverages, tobacco, machinery\r\n and transportation equipment, raw materials, and petroleum products\r\n partners: France, Mauritius, Bahrain, South Africa, Italy\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate NA%;

Market oriented reforms have been introduced fitfully\r\n since the downfall of CEAUSESCU in December 1989, with the result a\r\n growing private sector, especially in services. The slow pace of\r\n structural reform, however, has exacerbated Romania's high inflation\r\n rate and eroded real wages. Agricultural production rebounded in 1993\r\n from the drought-reduced harvest of 1992. The economy continued its\r\n recovery in 1994, further gains being realized in agriculture,\r\n construction, services, and trade. Food supplies are adequate but\r\n expensive. Romania's infrastructure had deteriorated over the last\r\n five years due to reduced levels of public investment. Residents of\r\n the capital reported frequent disruptions of heating and water\r\n services. The slow and painful process of conversion to a more open\r\n economy will continue in 1995.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $64.7 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 3.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $2,790 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 62% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 10.9% (December 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $8.3 billion\r\n expenditures: $9.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $6 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: metals and metal products 17.6%, mineral products 11.9%,\r\n textiles 18.5%, electric machines and equipment 8.4%, transport\r\n materials 6.5% (1994)\r\n partners: EC 36.1%, developing countries 27.4%, East and Central\r\n Europe 14.9%, EFTA 5.1%, Russia 5%, Japan 1.4%, US 1.3% (1993)\r\n\r\n Imports: $6.3 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: minerals 21.1%, machinery and equipment 19.7%, textiles\r\n 11.5%, agricultural goods 9.2% (1994)\r\n partners: EC 45.8%, East and Central Europe 8.6%, developing countries\r\n 22.6%, Russia 11%, EFTA 6.2%, US 5.0%, Japan 0.8% (1993)\r\n\r\n External debt: $4.4 billion (1994)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -1% (1993 est.);

President YEL'TSIN's\r\n government has made substantial strides in converting to a market\r\n economy since launching its economic reform program in January 1992 by\r\n freeing nearly all prices, slashing defense spending, eliminating the\r\n old centralized distribution system, completing an ambitious voucher\r\n privatization program, establishing private financial institutions,\r\n and decentralizing foreign trade. Russia, however, has made little\r\n progress in a number of key areas that are needed to provide a solid\r\n foundation for the transition to a market economy. Financial\r\n stabilization has remained elusive, with wide swings in monthly\r\n inflation rates. Only limited restructuring of industry has occurred\r\n so far because of a scarcity of investment funds and the failure of\r\n enterprise managers to make hard cost-cutting decisions. In addition,\r\n Moscow has yet to develop a social safety net that would allow faster\r\n restructuring by relieving enterprises of the burden of providing\r\n social benefits for their workers and has been slow to develop the\r\n legal framework necessary to fully support a market economy and to\r\n encourage foreign investment. As a result, output has continued to\r\n fall. According to Russian official data, which probably overstate the\r\n fall, GDP declined by 15% in 1994 compared with a 12% decline in 1993.\r\n Industrial output in 1994 fell 21% with all major sectors taking a\r\n hit. Agricultural production in 1994 was down 9%. The grain harvest\r\n totaled 81 million tons, some 15 million tons less than in 1993.\r\n Unemployment climbed to an estimated 6.6 million or about 7% of the\r\n work force by yearend 1994. Floundering Russian firms have already had\r\n to put another 4.8 million workers on involuntary, unpaid leave or\r\n shortened workweeks. Government fears of large-scale unemployment\r\n continued to hamper industrial restructuring efforts. According to\r\n official Russian data, real per capita income was up nearly 18% in\r\n 1994 compared with 1993, in part because many Russians are working\r\n second jobs. Most Russians perceive that they are worse off now\r\n because of growing crime and health problems and mounting wage\r\n arrears. Russia has made significant headway in privatizing state\r\n assets, completing its voucher privatization program at midyear 1994.\r\n At least a portion of about 110,000 state enterprises were transferred\r\n to private hands by the end of 1994. Including partially privatized\r\n firms, the private sector accounted for roughly half of GDP in 1994.\r\n Financial stabilization continued to remain a challenge for the\r\n government. Moscow tightened financial policies in late 1993 and early\r\n 1994, including postponing planned budget spending, and succeeded in\r\n reducing monthly inflation from 18% in January to about 5% in July and\r\n August. At midyear, however, the government relaxed austerity measures\r\n in the face of mounting pressure from industry and agriculture,\r\n sparking a new round of inflation; the monthly inflation rate jumped\r\n to roughly 15% per month during the fourth quarter. In response,\r\n Moscow announced a fairly tight government budget for 1995 designed to\r\n bring monthly inflation down to around 1% by the end of 1995.\r\n According to official statistics, Russia's 1994 trade with nations\r\n outside the former Soviet Union produced a $12.3 billion surplus, up\r\n from $11.3 billion in 1993. Foreign sales - comprised largely of oil,\r\n natural gas, and other raw materials - grew more than 8%. Imports also\r\n were up 8% as demand for food and other consumer goods surged. Russian\r\n trade with other former Soviet republics continued to decline. At the\r\n same time, Russia paid only a fraction of the roughly $20 billion in\r\n debt that came due in 1994, and by the end of the year, Russia's hard\r\n currency foreign debt had risen to nearly $100 billion. Moscow reached\r\n agreement to restructure debts with Paris Club official creditors in\r\n mid-1994 and concluded a preliminary deal with its commercial bank\r\n creditors late in the year to reschedule debts owed them in early\r\n 1995. Capital flight continued to be a serious problem in 1994, with\r\n billions of additional dollars in assets being moved abroad, primarily\r\n to bank accounts in Europe. Russia's physical plant continues to\r\n deteriorate because of insufficient maintenance and new construction.\r\n Plant and equipment on average are twice the age of the West's. Many\r\n years will pass before Russia can take full advantage of its natural\r\n resources and its human assets.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $721.2 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -15% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $4,820 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 10% per month (average 1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 7.1% (December 1994) with considerable additional\r\n underemployment\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $48 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: petroleum and petroleum products, natural gas, wood and\r\n wood products, metals, chemicals, and a wide variety of civilian and\r\n military manufactures\r\n partners: Europe, North America, Japan, Third World countries, Cuba\r\n\r\n Imports: $35.7 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: machinery and equipment, consumer goods, medicines, meat,\r\n grain, sugar, semifinished metal products\r\n partners: Europe, North America, Japan, Third World countries, Cuba\r\n\r\n External debt: $95 billion-$100 billion (yearend 1994)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -21% (1994)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 213,100,000 KW\r\n production: 876 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 5,800 kWh (1994)\r\n\r\n Industries: complete range of mining and extractive industries\r\n producing coal, oil, gas, chemicals, and metals;

Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural\r\n sector; coffee and tea make up 80%-90% of total exports. The amount of\r\n fertile land is limited, however, and deforestation and soil erosion\r\n continue to create problems. The industrial sector in Rwanda is small,\r\n contributing only 17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses mainly on the\r\n processing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy remains\r\n dependent on coffee/tea exports and foreign aid. Weak international\r\n prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita\r\n GDP to decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank\r\n began in October 1990. Ethnic-based insurgency since 1990 has\r\n devastated wide areas, especially in the north, and displaced hundreds\r\n of thousands of people. A peace accord in mid-1993 temporarily ended\r\n most of the fighting, but massive resumption of civil warfare in April\r\n 1994 in the capital city Kigali and elsewhere has been taking\r\n thousands of lives and severely affecting short-term economic\r\n prospects. The economy suffers massively from failure to maintain the\r\n infrastructure, looting, neglect of important cash crops, and lack of\r\n health care facilities.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $7.9 billion (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -8% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $950 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $350 million\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $44 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: coffee 63%, tea, cassiterite, wolframite, pyrethrum\r\n partners: Germany, Belgium, Italy, Uganda, UK, France, US\r\n\r\n Imports: $250 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: textiles, foodstuffs, machines and equipment, capital\r\n goods, steel, petroleum products, cement and construction material\r\n partners: US, Belgium, Germany, Kenya, Japan\r\n\r\n External debt: $873 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -2.2% (1991);

Indeed, the destructive effect of Tropical Storm Debbie in\r\n mid-1994 caused the loss of 60% of the year's banana crop. Increased\r\n competition from Latin American bananas will probably further reduce\r\n market prices, exacerbating Saint Lucia's need to diversify its\r\n economy in coming years, e.g., by expanding tourism, manufacturing,\r\n and construction\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $610 million (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $4,200 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 0.8% (1993)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 25% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $121 million\r\n expenditures: $127 million, including capital expenditures of $104\r\n million (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $122.8 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\n commodities: bananas 60%, clothing, cocoa, vegetables, fruits, coconut\r\n oil\r\n partners: UK 56%, US 22%, CARICOM 19% (1991)\r\n\r\n Imports: $276 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\n commodities: manufactured goods 21%, machinery and transportation\r\n equipment 21%, food and live animals, chemicals, fuels\r\n partners: US 34%, CARICOM 17%, UK 14%, Japan 7%, Canada 4% (1991)\r\n\r\n External debt: $96.4 million (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 3.5% (1990 est.);

The economy has been declining, however, because the\r\n number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the\r\n years. In March 1989, an agreement between France and Canada set fish\r\n quotas for Saint Pierre's trawlers fishing in Canadian and\r\n Canadian-claimed waters for three years.

Since then, however, cocoa\r\n production has gradually declined because of drought and\r\n mismanagement, so that by 1987 annual output had fallen from 10,000\r\n tons to 3,900 tons. As a result, a shortage of cocoa for export has\r\n created a serious balance-of-payments problem. Production of less\r\n important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm kernels, has also\r\n declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of exports by a\r\n ratio of 4:1 or more. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense\r\n of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food\r\n needs. It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods.\r\n Over the years, Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt\r\n and has had to depend on concessional aid and debt rescheduling.\r\n Considerable potential exists for development of a tourist industry,\r\n and the government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent\r\n years. The government also has attempted to reduce price controls and\r\n subsidies and to encourage market-based mechanisms, e. g., to\r\n facilitate the distribution of imported food.

About 46% of GDP\r\n comes from the private sector. Economic (as well as political) ties\r\n with the US are especially strong. The petroleum sector accounts for\r\n roughly 75% of budget revenues, 35% of GDP, and almost all export\r\n earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves of petroleum in the\r\n world (26% of the proved total), ranks as the largest exporter of\r\n petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the\r\n government intends to bring its budget, which has been in deficit\r\n since 1983, back into balance, and to encourage private economic\r\n activity. Roughly four million foreign workers play an important role\r\n in the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and banking sectors. For\r\n about a decade, Saudi Arabia's domestic and international outlays have\r\n outstripped its income, and the government has cut its foreign\r\n assistance and is beginning to rein in domestic programs. For 1995,\r\n the country looks for improvement in oil prices and will continue its\r\n policies of restraining public spending and encouraging non-oil\r\n exports.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $173.1 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $9,510 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 1% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 6.5% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $39 billion\r\n expenditures: $50 billion, including capital expenditures of $7.5\r\n billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $39.4 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: petroleum and petroleum products 92%\r\n partners: US 20%, Japan 18%, Singapore 5%, France 5%, South Korea 5%\r\n (1992)\r\n\r\n Imports: $28.9 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: machinery and equipment, chemicals, foodstuffs, motor\r\n vehicles, textiles\r\n partners: US 21%, Japan 14%, UK 11%, Germany 8%, Italy 6%, France 5%\r\n (1992)\r\n\r\n External debt: $18.9 billion (December 1989 est., includes short-term\r\n trade credits)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 20% (1991 est.);

After years of\r\n foot-dragging, the government finally passed a liberalized labor code\r\n which should significantly help lower the cost of labor and improve\r\n the manufacturing sector's competitiveness. Inroads also have been\r\n made in closing tax loopholes and eliminating monopoly power in\r\n several sectors. At the same time the government is holding the line\r\n on current fiscal expenditure under the watchful eyes of international\r\n organizations on which it depends for substantial support. A bumper\r\n peanut crop - Senegal's main source of foreign exchange - coincided\r\n with an improvement of international prices and probably resulted in a\r\n doubling of earnings in 1994 over 1993.

Serbia and Montenegro faces major economic problems; output has\r\n dropped sharply, particularly in 1993. First, like the other former\r\n Yugoslav republics, it depended on its sister republics for large\r\n amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and manufactures. Wide\r\n differences in climate, mineral resources, and levels of technology\r\n among the republics accentuated this interdependence, as did the\r\n communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small\r\n number of giant plants. The breakup of many of the trade links, the\r\n sharp drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets,\r\n and the destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have\r\n contributed to the economic difficulties of the republics. One\r\n singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and Montenegro is\r\n the continuation in office of a communist government that is primarily\r\n interested in political and military mastery, not economic reform. A\r\n further complication is the imposition of economic sanctions by the UN\r\n in 1992. Hyperinflation ended with the establishment of a new currency\r\n unit in June 1993; prices were relatively stable in 1994. Reliable\r\n statistics are hard to come by; the GDP estimate of $1,000 per capita\r\n in 1994 is extremely rough. Output in 1994 seems to have leveled off\r\n after the plunge in 1993.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $10 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,000 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 20% (January-November 1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: more than 40% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $NA\r\n commodities: prior to the breakup of the federation, Yugoslavia\r\n exported machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods,\r\n chemicals, food and live animals, raw materials\r\n partners: prior to the imposition of UN sanctions trade partners were\r\n the other former Yugoslav republics, Italy, Germany, other EC, the FSU\r\n countries, East European countries, US\r\n\r\n Imports: $NA\r\n commodities: prior to the breakup of the federation, Yugoslavia\r\n imported machinery and transport equipment, fuels and lubricants,\r\n manufactured goods, chemicals, food and live animals, raw materials\r\n including coking coal for the steel industry\r\n partners: prior to the imposition of UN sanctions trade partners were\r\n the other former Yugoslav republics, the FSU countries, EC countries\r\n (mainly Italy and Germany), East European countries, US\r\n\r\n External debt: $4.2 billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate NA%\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 10,400,000 kW\r\n production: 34 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 2,400 kWh (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Industries: machine building (aircraft, trucks, and automobiles;\r\n armored vehicles and weapons;

in this area, livestock production (sheep and\r\n cattle) and dairy farming prosper; Kosovo produces fruits, vegetables,\r\n tobacco, and a small amount of cereals; the mountainous pastures of\r\n Kosovo and Montenegro support sheep and goat husbandry;

In recent years the government has\r\n encouraged foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other\r\n services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the\r\n high dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming,\r\n fishing, and small-scale manufacturing. The vulnerability of the\r\n tourist sector was illustrated by the sharp drop in 1991-92 due\r\n largely to the Gulf war. Although the industry has rebounded, the\r\n government recognizes the continuing need for upgrading the sector in\r\n the face of stiff international competition.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $430 million (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -2% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $6,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3.9% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 9% (1987)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $227.4 million\r\n expenditures: $263 million, including capital expenditures of $54\r\n million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $50 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: fish, cinnamon bark, copra, petroleum products\r\n (re-exports)\r\n partners: France 43%, UK 22%, Reunion 11%, (1992)\r\n\r\n Imports: $261 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: manufactured goods, food, petroleum products, tobacco,\r\n beverages, machinery and transportation equipment\r\n partners: Singapore 16%, Bahrain 16%, South Africa, 14%, UK 13% (1992)\r\n\r\n External debt: $181 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 4% (1992);

Agriculture generates about 40% of GDP and employs\r\n about two-thirds of the working population, with subsistence\r\n agriculture dominating the sector. Manufacturing, which accounts for\r\n roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of raw materials\r\n and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining\r\n provides an important source of hard currency. Since 1990, the\r\n government has been able to meet its IMF- and World Bank-mandated\r\n stabilization targets, holding down fiscal deficits, increasing\r\n foreign exchange reserves, and retiring much of its domestic debt -\r\n but at a steep cost in terms of capital investments and social\r\n spending. Moreover, the economic infrastructure has nearly collapsed\r\n due to neglect and war-related disruptions in the mining and\r\n agricultural export sectors. The continuing civil war in Liberia has\r\n led to a large influx of refugees, who place additional burdens on\r\n Sierra Leon's fragile economy.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $4.5 billion (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 0.7% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 22% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $68 million\r\n expenditures: $118 million, including capital expenditures of $28\r\n million (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $149 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: rutile 48%, bauxite 25%, diamonds 16%, coffee, cocoa,\r\n fish\r\n partners: US, UK, Belgium, Germany, other Western Europe\r\n\r\n Imports: $149 million (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: foodstuffs 48%, machinery and equipment 32%, fuels 9%\r\n partners: US, EC countries, Japan, China, Nigeria\r\n\r\n External debt: $1.15 billion (yearend 1993)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -1.5% (FY91/92);

The economy registered 10.1%\r\n growth in 1994, with prospects for 7.5%-8.5% growth in 1995. In 1994,\r\n the manufacturing and financial and business services sectors have led\r\n economic growth. Exports boomed, led by the electronics sector,\r\n particularly US demand for disk drives. Rising labor costs continue to\r\n be a threat to Singapore's competitiveness, but there are indications\r\n that productivity is keeping up.

Most of Slovakia's\r\n IMF-approved targets were met by an interim government that lasted 9\r\n months. Annual inflation fell from 23% in 1993 to 12%; unemployment at\r\n 14.6% was still well below forecasts of 17%; and the budget deficit\r\n was around half that in 1993. Slovakia's nearly $200 million trade\r\n surplus also compares favorably with a more than $800 million deficit\r\n in 1993. Furthermore, after contracting almost 25% in the three years\r\n following 1990, GDP grew 4.3% in 1994, according to official\r\n statistics. Bratislava in June qualified for a $254 million IMF\r\n stand-by loan and the second $90 million tranche of its Systemic\r\n Transformation Facility and, in December, received approval for a\r\n European Union loan worth about $160 million. By the end of September\r\n 1994, the Central Bank's foreign currency reserves had tripled since\r\n the end of 1993. Slovakia continued to have difficulty attracting\r\n foreign investment, however, because of perceived political\r\n instability and halting progress in privatization. The interim\r\n government prepared property worth nearly $2 billion for the second\r\n wave of coupon privatization and sold participation in the program to\r\n over 80% of Slovakia's eligible citizens. Parties controlling the new\r\n Parliament in November 1994, however, put the second wave of coupon\r\n privatization on hold and suspended sales of 38 firms until the new\r\n government could evaluate the interim government's decisions in early\r\n 1995. The new government's targets for 1995 include GDP growth of 3%,\r\n inflation of 8%-10%, unemployment of 15%, and a budget deficit under\r\n 3% of GDP. Continuing economic recovery in western Europe should boost\r\n Slovak exports and production, but Slovakia's image with foreign\r\n creditors and investors could suffer setbacks in 1995 if progress on\r\n privatization stalls or budget deficits mount beyond IMF-recommended\r\n levels.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $32.8 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4.3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $6,070 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 12% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 14.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $4.4 billion\r\n expenditures: $4.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $350\r\n million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $6.3 billion (f.o.b., January-November 1994)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment;

It also\r\n benefited from strong ties to Western Europe and suffered\r\n comparatively small physical damage in the dismemberment process. The\r\n beginning was difficult, however. Real GDP fell 15% during 1991-92,\r\n while inflation jumped to 247% in 1991 and unemployment topped 8% -\r\n nearly three times the 1989 level. The turning point came in 1993 when\r\n real GDP grew 1%, unemployment leveled off at about 9%, and inflation\r\n slowed dramatically to 23%. In 1994, the rate of growth of GDP rose to\r\n 4%, unemployment remained stable, and inflation dropped to 20%. This\r\n was accomplished, moreover, without balance-of-payments problems. The\r\n government gets generally good economic marks from foreign observers,\r\n particularly with regard to fiscal policy - the budget deficit in 1994\r\n was only about 1% of GDP, following several years of small surpluses.\r\n Prospects for 1995 appear good, with economic growth expected to\r\n remain strong while unemployment and inflation may decline slightly.\r\n Privatization, sluggish to date, is expected to pick up in 1995.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $16 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $8,110 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 20% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $9.9 billion\r\n expenditures: $9.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1993)\r\n\r\n Exports: $6.5 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment 27%, intermediate\r\n manufactured goods 26%, chemicals 9%, food 4.8%, raw materials 3%,\r\n consumer goods 26% (1993)\r\n partners: Germany 29.5%, former Yugoslavia 15.8%, Italy 12.4%, France\r\n 8.7%, Austria 5.0% (1993)\r\n\r\n Imports: $6.5 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: machinery and transport equipment 30%, intermediate\r\n manufactured goods 17.6%, chemicals 11.5%, raw materials 5.3%, fuels\r\n and lubricants 10.8%, food 8.4% (1993)\r\n partners: Germany 25.0%, Italy 16.1%, former Yugoslavia 10.7%, France\r\n 8.0%, Austria 8.5% (1993)\r\n\r\n External debt: $2.1 billion (1994)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 6% (1994 est.);

Moreover, much of the economy has been\r\n devastated by the civil war. Agriculture is the most important sector,\r\n with livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export\r\n earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for\r\n their livelihood make up about 70% of the population. Crop production\r\n generates only 10% of GDP and employs about 20% of the work force. The\r\n main export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and corn are grown for\r\n the domestic market. The small industrial sector is based on the\r\n processing of agricultural products and accounts for less than 10% of\r\n GDP; most facilities have been shut down because of the civil strife.\r\n The greatly increased political turmoil of 1991-93 has resulted in a\r\n substantial drop in agricultural output, with widespread famine. In\r\n 1994 economic conditions stabilized in the countryside but may turn\r\n worse in 1995 if civil strife intensifies after the UN withdrawal.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $3.3 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $500 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): NA% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $58 million (1990 est.)\r\n commodities: bananas, live animals, fish, hides\r\n partners: Saudi Arabia, Italy, FRG (1986)\r\n\r\n Imports: $249 million (1990 est.)\r\n commodities: petroleum products, foodstuffs, construction materials\r\n partners: US 13%, Italy, FRG, Kenya, UK, Saudi Arabia (1986)\r\n\r\n External debt: $1.9 billion (1989)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate NA%\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: prior to the civil war, 75,000 kW, but now almost completely\r\n shut down due to war damage; note - UN and relief organizations use\r\n their own portable power systems\r\n production: NA kWh\r\n consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\n Industries: a few small industries, including sugar refining,\r\n textiles, petroleum refining (mostly shut down) (1994)\r\n\r\n Agriculture: dominant sector, led by livestock raising (cattle, sheep,\r\n goats); crops - bananas, sorghum, corn, mangoes, sugarcane; not\r\n self-sufficient in food; distribution of food disrupted by civil\r\n strife; fishing potential largely unexploited\r\n\r\n Economic aid:\r\n recipient: US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $639 million;\r\n Western (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments\r\n (1970-89), $3.8 billion; OPEC bilateral aid (1979-89), $1.1 billion;\r\n Communist countries (1970-89), $336 million\r\n\r\n Currency: 1 Somali shilling (So.

But whereas unemployment in these\r\n countries has hovered just above 10%, Spain has been forced to cope\r\n with a 25% unemployment rate. Continued political turmoil has\r\n complicated the establishment of stable government policies toward\r\n budgetary restraint, interest rates, labor law reform, and Spain's\r\n role in the evolving economic integration of Western Europe. Because\r\n the recession has been so deep, the growth in industrial output,\r\n tourism, and other sectors in 1994, while welcome, falls far short of\r\n the growth required to bring unemployment down to, say, 10%. The\r\n recovery in the economies of major trade partners, the comparatively\r\n low inflation rate, lower interest rates, and prospects in the tourist\r\n sector suggest that Spain can make substantial progress in 1995.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $515.8 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 1.8% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $13,120 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 4.9% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 24.5% (yearend 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $97.7 billion\r\n expenditures: $128 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $72.8 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: cars and trucks, semifinished manufactured goods,\r\n foodstuffs, machinery\r\n partners: EC 71.2%, US 4.8%, other developed countries 7.9% (1992)\r\n\r\n Imports: $92.5 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: machinery, transport equipment, fuels, semifinished\r\n goods, foodstuffs, consumer goods, chemicals\r\n partners: EC 60.7%, US 7.4%, other developed countries 11.5%, Middle\r\n East 5.9% (1992)\r\n\r\n External debt: $90 billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 43,800,000 kW\r\n production: 148 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 3,545 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: textiles and apparel (including footwear), food and\r\n beverages, metals and metal manufactures, chemicals, shipbuilding,\r\n automobiles, machine tools, tourism\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for about 5% of GDP and 14% of labor force;\r\n major products - grain, vegetables, olives, wine grapes, sugar beets,\r\n citrus fruit, beef, pork, poultry, dairy;

Governmental\r\n entities account for more than 70% of new investment. The private\r\n sector's main areas of activity are agriculture and trading, with most\r\n private industrial investment predating 1980. Agriculture employs 80%\r\n of the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items.\r\n Sluggish economic performance over the past decade, attributable\r\n largely to declining annual rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita\r\n income and consumption. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages\r\n continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary\r\n Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because\r\n of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund. After Sudan backtracked\r\n on promised reforms in 1992-93, the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from\r\n the Fund. To avoid expulsion, Khartoum agreed to make payments on its\r\n arrears to the Fund, liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies.\r\n These measures have been partially implemented. The government's\r\n continued prosecution of the civil war and its growing international\r\n isolation led to a further deterioration of the nonagricultural\r\n sectors of the economy during 1994. Agriculture, on the other hand,\r\n after several disappointing years, enjoyed a bumper fall harvest in\r\n 1994; its strong performance produced an overall growth rate in GDP of\r\n perhaps 7%.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $23.7 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 7% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $870 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 112% (FY93/94 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 30% (FY92/93 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $493 million\r\n expenditures: $1.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $225\r\n million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $419 million (f.o.b., FY93/94)\r\n commodities: gum arabic 29%, livestock/meat 24%, cotton 13%, sesame,\r\n peanuts\r\n partners: Western Europe 46%, Saudi Arabia 14%, Eastern Europe 9%,\r\n Japan 9%, US 3% (FY87/88)\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.7 billion (c.i.f., FY93/94)\r\n commodities: foodstuffs, petroleum products, manufactured goods,\r\n machinery and equipment, medicines and chemicals, textiles\r\n partners: Western Europe 32%, Africa and Asia 15%, US 13%, Eastern\r\n Europe 3% (FY87/88)\r\n\r\n External debt: $17 billion (June 1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 6.8% (FY92/93 est.);

Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have\r\n mined in the past, the only companies still mining are Norwegian and\r\n Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are essentially company towns.\r\n The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the\r\n Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local services,\r\n and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some\r\n trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $13.3 million\r\n expenditures: $13.3 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 21,000 kW\r\n production: 45 million kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 13,860 kWh (1992)\r\n\r\n Currency: 1 Norwegian krone (NKr) = 100 oere\r\n\r\n Exchange rates: Norwegian kroner (NKr) per US$1 - 6.7014 (January\r\n 1995), 7.0469 (1994), 7.0941 (1993), 6.2145 (1992), 6.4829 (1991),\r\n 6.2597 (1990)\r\n\r\n@Svalbard:Transportation\r\n\r\n Railroads: 0 km\r\n\r\n Highways:\r\n total: NA\r\n paved: NA\r\n unpaved: NA\r\n\r\n Ports: Barentsburg, Longyearbyen, Ny-Alesund, Pyramiden\r\n\r\n Merchant marine: none\r\n\r\n Airports:\r\n total: 4\r\n with paved runways 1,524 to 2,437 m: 1\r\n with paved runways under 914 m: 3\r\n\r\n@Svalbard:Communications\r\n\r\n Telephone system: NA telephones;

Manufacturing, which includes a number of agroprocessing\r\n factories, accounts for another quarter of GDP. Mining has declined in\r\n importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted\r\n by 1978, and health concerns cut world demand for asbestos. Exports of\r\n sugar and forestry products are the main earners of hard currency.\r\n Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with Mozambique,\r\n Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it receives\r\n 90% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports.\r\n Remittances from Swazi workers in South African mines may supplement\r\n domestically produced income by as much as 20%.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $3.3 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $3,490 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 11.3% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 15% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $342 million\r\n expenditures: $410 million, including capital expenditures of $130\r\n million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $632 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: sugar, edible concentrates, wood pulp, cotton yarn,\r\n asbestos\r\n partners: South Africa 50% (est.), EC countries, Canada\r\n\r\n Imports: $734 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: motor vehicles, machinery, transport equipment, petroleum\r\n products, foodstuffs, chemicals\r\n partners: South Africa 90% (est.), Switzerland, UK\r\n\r\n External debt: $240 million (1992)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 4.2% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 120,000 kW\r\n production: 410 million kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 1,003 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: mining (coal and asbestos), wood pulp, sugar\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for over 60% of labor force;

It has a modern distribution system, excellent\r\n internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force.\r\n Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an\r\n economy that is heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned\r\n firms account for about 90% of industrial output, of which the\r\n engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. In 1990,\r\n agriculture accounted for only 1.2% of GDP and 1.9% of the jobs,\r\n Sweden being about 50% sufficient in most products. In the last few\r\n years, however, this extraordinarily favorable picture has been\r\n clouded by inflation, growing unemployment, and a gradual loss of\r\n competitiveness in international markets. Although Prime Minister\r\n BILDT's center-right minority coalition had hoped to charge ahead with\r\n free-market-oriented reforms, a skyrocketing budget deficit - about\r\n 14% of GDP in FY93/94 projections - and record unemployment have\r\n forestalled many of the plans. Unemployment in 1994 is estimated at\r\n around 9% with another 5% in job training. Continued heavy foreign\r\n exchange speculation forced the government to cooperate in late 1992\r\n with the opposition Social Democrats on two crisis packages - one a\r\n severe austerity pact and the other a program to spur industrial\r\n competitiveness - which basically set economic policy through 1997. In\r\n November 1992, Sweden broke its tie to the EC's ECU, and the krona has\r\n since depreciated about 25% against the dollar. The boost in export\r\n competitiveness from the depreciation helped lift Sweden out of its\r\n 3-year recession. To curb the budget deficit and bolster confidence in\r\n the economy, the new Social Democratic government is proposing cuts in\r\n welfare benefits, subsidies, defense, and foreign aid. Sweden has\r\n harmonized its economic policies with those of the EU, which it joined\r\n at the start of 1995.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $163.1 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 2.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $18,580 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 2.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 8.8% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $47.9 billion\r\n expenditures: $70.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (FY93/94)\r\n\r\n Exports: $59.9 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: machinery, motor vehicles, paper products, pulp and wood,\r\n iron and steel products, chemicals, petroleum and petroleum products\r\n partners: EC 55.8% (Germany 15%, UK 9.7%, Denmark 7.2%, France 5.8%),\r\n EFTA 17.4% (Norway 8.4%, Finland 5.1%), US 8.2%, Central and Eastern\r\n Europe 2.5% (1992)\r\n\r\n Imports: $49.6 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n commodities: machinery, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals,\r\n motor vehicles, foodstuffs, iron and steel, clothing\r\n partners: EC 53.6% (Germany 17.9%, UK 6.3%, Denmark 7.5%, France\r\n 4.9%), EFTA (Norway 6.6%, Finland 6%), US 8.4%, Central and Eastern\r\n Europe 3% (1992)\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 9% (1994)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 34,560,000 kW\r\n production: 141 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 14,891 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: iron and steel, precision equipment (bearings, radio and\r\n telephone parts, armaments), wood pulp and paper products, processed\r\n foods, motor vehicles\r\n\r\n Agriculture: animal husbandry predominates, with milk and dairy\r\n products accounting for 37% of farm income;

So far the decision to remain outside the European\r\n single market structure does not appear to have harmed Swiss\r\n interests. In December 1994, the Swiss began bilateral negotiations\r\n with the EU aimed at establishing closer ties in areas of mutual\r\n interest and progressing toward the free circulation of persons,\r\n goods, capital, and services between the two parties. The Swiss\r\n emerged from a three-year recession in mid-1993 and posted 1.8% GDP\r\n growth in 1994. The Swiss central bank's tight monetary policies\r\n brought inflation down from about 4% in 1992 to just under 1% in 1994.\r\n Unemployment has fallen slightly from 5.1% in 1993 to 4.7% in 1994.\r\n Swiss per capita output, living standards, education, and health care\r\n remain unsurpassed in Europe.

Economic growth averaged roughly 10%. The\r\n Gulf war provided Syria an aid windfall of nearly $5 billion dollars\r\n from Arab, European, and Japanese donors. However, the benefits of the\r\n 1990-93 boom were not evenly distributed and the gap between rich and\r\n poor is widening. A nationwide financial scandal and increasing\r\n inflation were accompanied by a decline in GDP growth to 4% in 1994.\r\n For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled with a large number\r\n of poorly performing public sector firms, and industrial productivity\r\n remains to be improved. Oil production is likely to fall off\r\n dramatically by the end of the decade.

Real\r\n growth in GNP has averaged about 9% a year during the past three\r\n decades. Export growth has been even faster and has provided the\r\n impetus for industrialization. Inflation and unemployment are\r\n remarkably low. Agriculture contributes about 4% to GDP, down from 35%\r\n in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13 among major trading\r\n countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily being\r\n replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive industries.\r\n Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand, Indonesia, the\r\n Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The tightening of labor markets\r\n has led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and illegal.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $257 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $12,070 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 5.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 1.6% (1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $30.3 billion\r\n expenditures: $30.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $93 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: electrical machinery 19.7%, electronic products 19.6%,\r\n textiles 10.9%, footwear 3.3%, foodstuffs 1.0%, plywood and wood\r\n products 0.9% (1993 est.)\r\n partners: US 27.6%, Hong Kong 21.7%, EC countries 15.2%, Japan 10.5%\r\n (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Imports: $85.1 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n commodities: machinery and equipment 15.7%, electronic products 15.6%,\r\n chemicals 9.8%, iron and steel 8.5%, crude oil 3.9%, foodstuffs 2.1%\r\n (1993 est.)\r\n partners: Japan 30.1%, US 21.7%, EC countries 17.6% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n External debt: $620 million (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 4.5% (1994 est.); accounts for more\r\n than 40% of GDP\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 21,460,000 kW\r\n production: 108 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 4,789 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: electronics, textiles, chemicals, clothing, food\r\n processing, plywood, sugar milling, cement, shipbuilding, petroleum\r\n refining\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for 4% of GDP and 16% of labor force (includes\r\n part-time farmers); heavily subsidized sector; major crops -\r\n vegetables, rice, fruit, tea; livestock - hogs, poultry, beef, milk;\r\n not self-sufficient in wheat, soybeans, corn; fish catch increasing,\r\n reached 1.4 million metric tons in 1988\r\n\r\n Illicit drugs: an important heroin transit point; also a major drug\r\n money laundering center\r\n\r\n Economic aid:\r\n recipient: US, including Ex-Im (FY46-82), $4.6 billion; Western\r\n (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $500\r\n million\r\n\r\n Currency: 1 New Taiwan dollar (NT$) = 100 cents\r\n\r\n Exchange rates: New Taiwan dollars per US$1 - 26.2 (1994), 26.6\r\n (1993), 25.4 (1992), 25.748 (1991), 27.108 (1990), 26.407 (1989)\r\n\r\n Fiscal year: 1 July - 30 June\r\n\r\n@Taiwan:Transportation\r\n\r\n Railroads:\r\n total: 4,600 km; note - 1,075 km in common carrier service and about\r\n 3,525 km is dedicated to industrial use\r\n narrow gauge: 4,600 km 1.067-m\r\n\r\n Highways:\r\n total: 20,041 km\r\n paved: bituminous, concrete pavement 17,095 km\r\n unpaved: crushed stone, gravel 2,371 km; graded earth 575 km\r\n\r\n Pipelines: petroleum products 615 km; natural gas 97 km\r\n\r\n Ports: Chi-lung (Keelung), Hua-lien, Kao-hsiung, Su-ao, T'ai-chung\r\n\r\n Merchant marine:\r\n total: 198 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 5,635,682 GRT/8,652,111\r\n DWT\r\n ships by type: bulk 55, cargo 30, chemical tanker 1, combination bulk\r\n 2, combination ore/oil 1, container 78, oil tanker 17, passenger-cargo\r\n 1, refrigerated cargo 12, roll-on/roll-off cargo 1\r\n\r\n Airports:\r\n total: 41\r\n with paved runways over 3,047 m: 8\r\n with paved runways 2,438 to 3,047 m: 11\r\n with paved runways 1,524 to 2,437 m: 6\r\n with paved runways 914 to 1,523 m: 6\r\n with paved runways under 914 m: 8\r\n with unpaved runways 1,524 to 2,438 m: 2\r\n\r\n@Taiwan:Communications\r\n\r\n Telephone system: 7,800,000 telephones; best developed system in Asia\r\n outside of Japan\r\n local: NA\r\n intercity: extensive microwave radio relay links on east and west\r\n coasts\r\n international: 2 INTELSAT (1 Pacific Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean) earth\r\n stations; submarine cable links to Japan (Okinawa), Philippines, Guam,\r\n Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Australia, Middle East, and Western\r\n Europe\r\n\r\n Radio:\r\n broadcast stations: AM 91, FM 23, shortwave 0\r\n radios: 8.62 million\r\n\r\n Television:\r\n broadcast stations: 15 (repeaters 13)\r\n televisions: 6.386 million (color 5,680,000, monochrome 706,000)\r\n\r\n@Taiwan:Defense Forces\r\n\r\n Branches: Army, Navy (includes Marines), Air Force, Coastal Patrol and\r\n Defense Command, Armed Forces Reserve Command, Military Police Command\r\n\r\n Manpower availability: males age 15-49 6,293,884; males fit for\r\n military service 4,863,014; males reach military age (19) annually\r\n 201,191 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n Defense expenditures: exchange rate conversion - $9.8 billion, 3.4% of\r\n GDP (FY94/95); $9.77 billion proposed for FY95/96 budget\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nTAJIKISTAN\r\n\r\n Note--Tajikistan has experienced three changes of government since it\r\n gained independence in September 1991. The current president, Emomali\r\n RAKHMONOV, was elected to the presidency in November 1994, yet has\r\n been in power since 1992. The country is suffering through its third\r\n year of a civil war, with no clear end in sight. Underlying the\r\n conflict are deeply-rooted regional and clan-based animosities that\r\n pit a government consisting of people primarily from the Kulob\r\n (Kulyab), Khujand (Leninabad), and Hisor (Hissar) regions against a\r\n secular and Islamic-led opposition from the Gharm, Gorno-Badakhshan,\r\n and Qurghonteppa (Kurgan-Tyube) regions. Government and opposition\r\n representatives have held periodic rounds of UN-mediated peace talks\r\n and agreed in September 1994 to a cease-fire. Russian-led peacekeeping\r\n troops are deployed throughout the country, and Russian border guards\r\n are stationed along the Tajik-Afghan border.\r\n\r\n@Tajikistan:Geography\r\n\r\n Location: Central Asia, west of China\r\n\r\n Map references: Commonwealth of Independent States - Central Asian\r\n States\r\n\r\n Area:\r\n total area: 143,100 sq km\r\n land area: 142,700 sq km\r\n comparative area: slightly smaller than Wisconsin\r\n\r\n Land boundaries: total 3,651 km, Afghanistan 1,206 km, China 414 km,\r\n Kyrgyzstan 870 km, Uzbekistan 1,161 km\r\n\r\n Coastline: 0 km (landlocked)\r\n\r\n Maritime claims: none;

Agriculture dominates the economy, cotton\r\n being the most important crop. Mineral resources, varied but limited\r\n in amount, include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten. Industry is\r\n limited to a large aluminum plant, hydropower facilities, and small\r\n obsolete factories mostly in light industry and food processing. The\r\n Tajik economy has been gravely weakened by three years of civil war\r\n and by the loss of subsidies and markets for its products, which has\r\n left Tajikistan dependent on Russia and Uzbekistan and on\r\n international humanitarian assistance for much of its basic\r\n subsistence needs. Moreover, constant political turmoil and the\r\n continued dominance by former Communist officials have impeded the\r\n introduction of meaningful economic reforms. In the meantime,\r\n Tajikistan's efforts to adopt the Russian ruble as its domestic\r\n currency despite Russia's unwillingness to supply sufficient rubles\r\n left the country in a severe monetary crisis throughout 1994, keeping\r\n inflation low but leaving workers and pensioners unpaid for months at\r\n a time. The government has announced plans to introduce its own\r\n currency in 1995 to help resolve the problem.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $8.5 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -12% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,415 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 1.5% includes only officially registered\r\n unemployed;

The\r\n economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about\r\n 58% of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work\r\n force. Topography and climatic conditions, however, limit cultivated\r\n crops to only 5% of the land area. Industry accounts for 8% of GDP and\r\n is mainly limited to processing agricultural products and light\r\n consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced in mid-1986\r\n has generated notable increases in agricultural production and\r\n financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank,\r\n the International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided\r\n funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure.\r\n Growth in 1991-94 has featured a pickup in industrial production and a\r\n substantial increase in output of minerals, led by gold. Recent\r\n banking reforms have helped increase private sector growth and\r\n investment.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $21 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $750 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 25% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $495 million\r\n expenditures: $631 million, including capital expenditures of $118\r\n million (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $462 million (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: coffee, cotton, tobacco, tea, cashew nuts, sisal\r\n partners: Germany, UK, Japan, Netherlands, Kenya, Hong Kong, US\r\n\r\n Imports: $1.4 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n commodities: manufactured goods, machinery and transportation\r\n equipment, cotton piece goods, crude oil, foodstuffs\r\n partners: Germany, UK, US, Japan, Italy, Denmark\r\n\r\n External debt: $6.7 billion (1993)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 9.3% (1990);

One of the more advanced\r\n developing countries in Asia, Thailand depends on exports of\r\n manufactures and the development of the service sector to fuel the\r\n country's rapid growth. Much of Thailand's recent imports have been\r\n for capital equipment, suggesting that the export sector is poised for\r\n further growth. With foreign investment slowing, Bangkok is working to\r\n increase the generation of domestic capital. Prime Minister CHUAN's\r\n government - Thailand's fifth government in less than three years - is\r\n pledged to continue Bangkok's probusiness policies, and the return of\r\n a democratically elected government has improved business confidence.\r\n Even so, CHUAN must overcome divisions within his ruling coalition to\r\n complete much needed infrastructure development programs if Thailand\r\n is to remain an attractive place for business investment.

Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee,\r\n and cotton, which together generate about 30% of total export\r\n earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests\r\n are normal. In the industrial sector phosphate mining is by far the\r\n most important activity, although it has suffered from the collapse of\r\n world phosphate prices and increased foreign competition. Togo serves\r\n as a regional commercial and trade center. The government's\r\n decade-long IMF and World Bank supported effort to implement economic\r\n reform measures to encourage foreign investment and bring revenues in\r\n line with expenditures has stalled. Political unrest, including\r\n private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, has\r\n jeopardized the reform program, shrunk the tax base, and disrupted\r\n vital economic activity. Although strikes had ended in 1994, political\r\n unrest and lack of funds prevented the government from taking\r\n advantage of the 50% currency devaluation of January 1994. Resumption\r\n of World Bank and IMF flows will depend on implementation of several\r\n controversial moves toward privatization and on downsizing the\r\n military, on which the regime depends to stay in power.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $3.3 billion (1993\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $800 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 0.5% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $284 million\r\n expenditures: $407 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $221 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: phosphates, cotton, cocoa, coffee\r\n partners: EC 40%, Africa 16%, US 1% (1990)\r\n\r\n Imports: $292 million (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n commodities: machinery and equipment, consumer goods, food, chemical\r\n products\r\n partners: EC 57%, Africa 17%, US 5%, Japan 4% (1990)\r\n\r\n External debt: $1.3 billion (1991)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 9% (1991 est.);

Squash, coconuts,\r\n bananas, and vanilla beans are the main crops, and agricultural\r\n exports make up two-thirds of total exports. The country must import a\r\n high proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The\r\n manufacturing sector accounts for only 11% of GDP. Tourism is the\r\n primary source of hard currency earnings, but the country also remains\r\n dependent on sizable external aid and remittances to offset its trade\r\n deficit. The economy continued to grow in 1993-94 largely because of a\r\n rise in squash exports, increased aid flows, and several large\r\n construction projects. The government is now turning its attention to\r\n further development of the private sector and the reduction of the\r\n budget deficit.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $214 million (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $2,050 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3% (1993)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $36.4 million\r\n expenditures: $68.1 million, including capital expenditures of $33.2\r\n million (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $11.3 million (f.o.b., FY92/93)\r\n commodities: squash, vanilla, fish, root crops, coconut oil\r\n partners: Japan 34%, US 17%, Australia 13%, NZ 13% (FY90/91)\r\n\r\n Imports: $56 million (c.i.f., FY92/93)\r\n commodities: food products, machinery and transport equipment,\r\n manufactures, fuels, chemicals\r\n partners: NZ 33%, Australia 22%, US 8%, Japan 8% (FY90/91)\r\n\r\n External debt: $47.5 million (FY90/91)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 1.5% (FY91/92);

Sparked by the\r\n downgrading in January 1994 of Turkey's international credit rating by\r\n two US credit rating agencies, the crisis stems from years of loose\r\n fiscal and monetary policies that had exacerbated inflation and\r\n allowed the public debt, money supply, and current account deficit to\r\n explode. In April 1994, Prime Minister CILLER introduced an austerity\r\n package aimed at restoring domestic and international confidence in\r\n her fragile coalition government. Three months later the IMF endorsed\r\n the program, paving the way for a $740 million IMF standby loan.\r\n Although the economy showed signs of improvement following the\r\n stabilization measures, CILLER has been unable to overcome the\r\n political obstacles to tough structural reforms necessary for\r\n sustained, longer-term growth. As a consequence, the economy is\r\n suffering the worst of both worlds: at the end of 1994, inflation hit\r\n a record 126% (annual rate), and real GDP dropped an estimated 5% for\r\n the year as a whole, the worst decline in Turkey's post-war history.\r\n At the same time, the government missed key 1994 targets stipulated in\r\n the IMF agreement: the budget deficit is estimated to have overshot\r\n the government's goal by 47%; the total public sector borrowing\r\n requirement likely reached 10%-12% of GDP, rather than 8.5% called for\r\n in the program; and the Turkish lira's value fell 5% to 7% more than\r\n expected. The unprecedented effort by the Kurdistan Workers' Party\r\n (PKK) to raise the economic costs of its insurgency against the\r\n Turkish state is adding to Turkey's economic problems. Attacks against\r\n tourists have jeopardized tourist revenues, which account for about 3%\r\n of GDP, while economic activity in southeastern Turkey, where most of\r\n the violence occurs, has dropped considerably. Turkish officials are\r\n now negotiating a new letter of intent with the IMF that will\r\n stipulate more realistic macroeconomic goals for 1995 and allow the\r\n release of remaining funds of the standby agreement.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $305.2 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $4,910 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 106% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 12.6% (1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $28.3 billion\r\n expenditures: $33.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $3.2\r\n billion (1995)\r\n\r\n Exports: $15.3 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: manufactured products 72%, foodstuffs 23%, mining\r\n products 4% (1993)\r\n partners: Germany 24%, Russia 7%, US 7%, UK 6% (1993)\r\n\r\n Imports: $27.6 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: manufactured products 71%, fuels 14%, foodstuffs 6%\r\n (1993)\r\n partners: Germany 15%, US 11%, Italy 9%, Russia 8% (1993)\r\n\r\n External debt: $66.6 billion (1994)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 6.7% (1993);

Half its irrigated land is planted in cotton making it\r\n the world's tenth largest producer. It also has the world's fifth\r\n largest reserves of natural gas and significant oil resources. Until\r\n the end of 1993, Turkmenistan had experienced less economic disruption\r\n than other former Soviet states because its economy received a boost\r\n from higher prices for oil and gas and a sharp increase in hard\r\n currency earnings. In 1994, Russia's refusal to export Turkmen gas to\r\n hard currency markets and mounting debts of its major customers in the\r\n former USSR for gas deliveries contributed to a sharp fall in\r\n industrial production and caused the budget to shift from a surplus to\r\n a slight deficit. Furthermore, with an authoritarian ex-Communist\r\n regime in power and a tribally-based social structure, Turkmenistan\r\n has taken a cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas\r\n and cotton sales to sustain its inefficient economy. With the onset of\r\n economic hard times, even cautious moves toward economic restructuring\r\n and privatization have slowed down. For 1995, Turkmenistan will face\r\n continuing constraints on its earnings because of its customers'\r\n inability to pay for their gas and a low average cotton crop in 1994.\r\n Turkmenistan is working hard to open new gas export channels through\r\n Iran and Turkey, but these may take many years to realize.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $13.1 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -24% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $3,280 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 25% per month (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $382 million to states outside the FSU (1994)\r\n commodities: natural gas, cotton, petroleum products, electricity,\r\n textiles, carpets\r\n partners: Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Georgia,\r\n Azerbaijan, Armenia, Eastern Europe, Turkey, Argentina\r\n\r\n Imports: $304 million from states outside the FSU (1994)\r\n commodities: machinery and parts, grain and food, plastics and rubber,\r\n consumer durables, textiles\r\n partners: Russia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkey\r\n\r\n External debt: NEGL\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -25% (1994)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 2,480,000 kW\r\n production: 10.5 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 2,600 kWh (1994)\r\n\r\n Industries: natural gas, oil, petroleum products, textiles, food\r\n processing\r\n\r\n Agriculture: cotton, grain, animal husbandry\r\n\r\n Illicit drugs: illicit cultivator of cannabis and opium poppy;

Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy,\r\n employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export crop\r\n and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the\r\n government - with the support of foreign countries and international\r\n agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by\r\n undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops,\r\n increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service\r\n wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation\r\n and boosting production and export earnings. In 1990-94, the economy\r\n turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the\r\n rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production\r\n and exports, and gradually improving domestic security. The economy\r\n again prospered in 1994 with rapid growth, low inflation, growing\r\n foreign investment, a trimmed bureaucracy, and the continued return of\r\n exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $16.2 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $850 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $365 million\r\n expenditures: $545 million, including capital expenditures of $165\r\n million (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $237 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: coffee 97%, cotton, tea\r\n partners: US 25%, UK 18%, France 11%, Spain 10%\r\n\r\n Imports: $696 million (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: petroleum products, machinery, cotton piece goods,\r\n metals, transportation equipment, food\r\n partners: Kenya 25%, UK 14%, Italy 13%\r\n\r\n External debt: $2.9 billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 1.5% (1992);

Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of\r\n Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial\r\n quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics.\r\n Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw\r\n materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the\r\n former USSR. In early 1992, the Ukrainian government liberalized most\r\n prices and erected a legal framework for privatization, but widespread\r\n resistance to reform within the government and the legislature soon\r\n stalled reform efforts and led to some backtracking. Loose monetary\r\n and fiscal policies pushed inflation to hyperinflationary levels in\r\n late 1993. Greater monetary and fiscal restraint lowered inflation in\r\n 1994, but also contributed to an accelerated decline in industrial\r\n output. Since his election in July 1994, President KUCHMA has\r\n developed - and parliament has approved - a comprehensive economic\r\n reform program, maintained financial discipline, and reduced state\r\n controls over prices, the exchange rate, and foreign trade.\r\n Implementation of KUCHMA's economic agenda will encounter considerable\r\n resistance from parliament, entrenched bureaucrats, and industrial\r\n interests and will contribute to further declines in output and rising\r\n unemployment which will sorely test the government's ability to stay\r\n the course on reform in 1995.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $189.2 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -19% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $3,650 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 14% per month (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 0.4% officially registered;

Its wealth\r\n is based on oil and gas output (about 40% of GDP), and the fortunes of\r\n the economy fluctuate with the prices of those commodities. Since\r\n 1973, the UAE has undergone a profound transformation from an\r\n impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state\r\n with a high standard of living. At present levels of production, crude\r\n oil reserves should last for over 100 years. Although much stronger\r\n economically than most Gulf states, the UAE faces similar problems\r\n with weak international oil prices and the pressures for cuts in OPEC\r\n oil production quotas.

The economy is essentially capitalistic; over the past\r\n 13 years the ruling Tories have greatly reduced public ownership and\r\n contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is\r\n intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards,\r\n producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor force. The\r\n UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves, and primary energy\r\n production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any\r\n industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and\r\n business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP\r\n while industry continues to decline in importance, now employing only\r\n 25% of the work force and generating only 21% of GDP. The economy\r\n registered 4.2% GDP growth in 1994, its fastest annual rate for six\r\n years. Exports and manufacturing output are the primary engines of\r\n growth. Unemployment is gradually falling. Inflation is at the lowest\r\n level in 27 years, but British monetary authorities raised interest\r\n rates to 6.25% in 1994 in a preemptive strike on emerging inflationary\r\n pressures such as higher taxes and rising manufacturing costs. The\r\n combination of a buoyant economy and fiscal tightening is projected to\r\n trim the FY94/95 budget shortfall to about $50 billion - down from\r\n about $75 billion in FY93/94. The major economic policy question for\r\n Britain in the 1990s is the terms on which it participates in the\r\n financial and economic integration of Europe.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $1.0452 trillion\r\n (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $17,980 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 2.4% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 9.3% (1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $325.5 billion\r\n expenditures: $400.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $33\r\n billion (FY93/94 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $200 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: manufactured goods, machinery, fuels, chemicals,\r\n semifinished goods, transport equipment\r\n partners: EU countries 56.7% (Germany 14.0%, France 11.1%, Netherlands\r\n 7.9%), US 10.9%\r\n\r\n Imports: $215 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: manufactured goods, machinery, semifinished goods,\r\n foodstuffs, consumer goods\r\n partners: EU countries 51.7% (Germany 14.9%, France 9.3%, Netherlands\r\n 8.4%), US 11.6%\r\n\r\n External debt: $16.2 billion (June 1992)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 5.6% (1994)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 65,360,000 kW\r\n production: 303 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 5,123 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: production machinery including machine tools, electric\r\n power equipment, automation equipment, railroad equipment,\r\n shipbuilding, aircraft, motor vehicles and parts, electronics and\r\n communications equipment, metals, chemicals, coal, petroleum, paper\r\n and paper products, food processing, textiles, clothing, and other\r\n consumer goods\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for only 1.5% of GDP;

The economy is market oriented\r\n with most decisions made by private individuals and business firms and\r\n with government purchases of goods and services made predominantly in\r\n the marketplace. In 1989 the economy enjoyed its seventh successive\r\n year of substantial growth, the longest in peacetime history. The\r\n expansion featured moderation in wage and consumer price increases and\r\n a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of the labor force. In\r\n 1990, however, growth slowed to 1% because of a combination of\r\n factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates, Iraq's\r\n invasion of Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and\r\n a general decline in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output\r\n fell by 0.6%, unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved\r\n premature. Growth picked up to 2.3% in 1992 and to 3.1% in 1993.\r\n Unemployment, however, declined only gradually, the increase in GDP\r\n being mainly attributable to gains in output per worker. The year 1994\r\n witnessed a solid 4% gain in real output, a low inflation rate of\r\n 2.6%, and a drop in unemployment below 6%. The capture of both houses\r\n of Congress by the Republicans in the elections of 8 November 1994\r\n means substantial changes are likely in US economic policy, including\r\n changes in the ways the US will address its major economic problems in\r\n 1995-96. These problems include inadequate investment in economic\r\n infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population,\r\n and sizable budget and trade deficits.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $6.7384 trillion\r\n (1994)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4.1% (1994)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $25,850 (1994)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 2.6% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 5.5% (March 1995)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $1.258 trillion\r\n expenditures: $1.461 trillion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994)\r\n\r\n Exports: $513 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n commodities: capital goods, automobiles, industrial supplies and raw\r\n materials, consumer goods, agricultural products\r\n partners: Western Europe 24.3%, Canada 22.1%, Japan 10.5% (1993)\r\n\r\n Imports: $664 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n commodities: crude oil and refined petroleum products, machinery,\r\n automobiles, consumer goods, industrial raw materials, food and\r\n beverages\r\n partners: Canada, 19.3%, Western Europe 18.1%, Japan 18.1% (1993)\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 5.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 695,120,000 kW\r\n production: 3.1 trillion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 11,236 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: leading industrial power in the world, highly diversified\r\n and technologically advanced;

Economic development\r\n has been restrained in recent years by excessive government regulation\r\n of economic detail and 40% to 130% inflation. Although the GDP growth\r\n rate slowed in 1993 to 1.7%, following a healthy expansion to 7.5% in\r\n 1992, it rebounded in 1994 to an estimated 4%, spurred mostly by\r\n increasing agricultural and other exports and a surprise reversal of\r\n the downward trend in industrial production. In a major step toward\r\n regional economic cooperation, Uruguay confirmed its commitment to the\r\n Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) customs union by implementing\r\n MERCOSUR's common external tariff on most tradables on 1 January 1995.\r\n Inflation in 1994 declined for the third consecutive year, yet, at\r\n 44%, it remains the highest in the region; analysts predict that the\r\n expanding fiscal deficit and wage indexation will force the inflation\r\n rate back toward the 50% mark in 1995.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $23 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $7,200 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 44% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $2.9 billion\r\n expenditures: $3 billion, including capital expenditures of $388\r\n million (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $1.78 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: wool and textile manufactures, beef and other animal\r\n products, leather, rice\r\n partners: Brazil, Argentina, US, China, Italy\r\n\r\n Imports: $2.461 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: machinery and equipment, vehicles, chemicals, minerals,\r\n plastics\r\n partners: Brazil, Argentina, US, Nigeria\r\n\r\n External debt: $4.2 billion (1993)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate 3.9% (1992);

It is one\r\n of the poorest states of the former USSR with 60% of its population\r\n living in overpopulated rural communities. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan is\r\n the world's third largest cotton exporter, a major producer of gold\r\n and natural gas, and a regionally significant producer of chemicals\r\n and machinery. Since independence, the government has sought to prop\r\n up the Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight controls\r\n on prices and production. Such policies have buffered the economy from\r\n the sharp declines in output and high inflation experienced by many\r\n other former Soviet republics. They had become increasingly\r\n unsustainable, however, as inflation moves along at 14% per month and\r\n as Russia has forced the Uzbek government to introduce its own\r\n currency. Faced with mounting economic problems, the government has\r\n begun to move on a reform agenda and cooperate with international\r\n financial institutions, announced an acceleration of privatization,\r\n and stepped up efforts to attract foreign investors. Nevertheless, the\r\n regime is likely to find it difficult to sustain its drive for\r\n economic reform.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $54.5 billion (1994\r\n estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $2,400 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 14% per month (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 0.3% includes only officially registered\r\n unemployed;

In 1994, as GDP declined\r\n 3.3%, the oil sector - which accounts for 24% of the total - enjoyed a\r\n 6% expansion, provided 45% of the budget revenues, and generated 70%\r\n of the export earnings. President CALDERA, who assumed office in\r\n February 1994, has used an interventionist, reactive approach to\r\n managing the economy, instituting price and foreign exchange controls\r\n in mid-year to slow inflation and stop the loss of foreign exchange\r\n reserves. The government claims it will remove these controls once\r\n inflationary pressures abate, but the $8 billion bailout of the\r\n banking sector in 1994 has made it difficult for the government to\r\n make good on its promise. Economic controls, coupled with political\r\n uncertainty driven by recurrent coup rumors, continue to deter foreign\r\n and domestic investment; private forecasters see the recession\r\n persisting for a third year in 1995.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $178.3 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -3.3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $8,670 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 71% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $10.3 billion\r\n expenditures: $14.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $103\r\n million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $15.2 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: petroleum 72%, bauxite and aluminum, steel, chemicals,\r\n agricultural products, basic manufactures\r\n partners: US and Puerto Rico 55%, Japan, Netherlands, Italy\r\n\r\n Imports: $7.6 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: raw materials, machinery and equipment, transport\r\n equipment, construction materials\r\n partners: US 40%, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Canada\r\n\r\n External debt: $40.1 billion (1994)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -1.4% (1993 est.);

Most prices are now fully decontrolled,\r\n and the Vietnamese currency has been effectively devalued and floated\r\n at world market rates. In addition, the scope for private sector\r\n activity has been expanded, primarily through decollectivization of\r\n the agricultural sector and introduction of laws giving legal\r\n recognition to private business. Nearly three-quarters of export\r\n earnings are generated by only two commodities, rice and crude oil.\r\n Led by industry and construction, the economy did well in 1993 and\r\n 1994 with output rising 7% and 9% respectively. However, the\r\n industrial sector remains burdened by noncompetitive state-owned\r\n enterprises the government is unwilling or unable to privatize.\r\n Unemployment looms as a serious problem with roughly 20% of the work\r\n force without jobs and with population growth swelling the ranks of\r\n the labor force yearly.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $83.5 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 8.8% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,140 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 14.4% (1994)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 20% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $3.6 billion\r\n expenditures: $4.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $3.6 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: petroleum, rice, agricultural products, marine products,\r\n coffee\r\n partners: Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, France, South Korea\r\n\r\n Imports: $4.2 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: petroleum products, machinery and equipment, steel\r\n products, fertilizer, raw cotton, grain\r\n partners: Singapore, Japan, South Korea, France, Hong Kong, Taiwan\r\n\r\n External debt: $4 billion Western countries;

Industries using advanced technology or\r\n requiring sizable investment have been discouraged by a lack of local\r\n capital and restrictive Israeli policies. Capital investment consists\r\n largely of residential housing, not productive assets that would\r\n enable local Palestinian firms to compete with Israeli industry. GDP\r\n has been substantially supplemented by remittances of workers employed\r\n in Israel and Persian Gulf states. Such transfers from the Gulf\r\n dropped after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake of the\r\n Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West Bank,\r\n increasing unemployment, and export revenues have dropped because of\r\n the decline of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures\r\n to curtail the intifadah also have added to unemployment and lowered\r\n living standards. The area's economic situation has worsened since\r\n Israel's partial closure of the territories in 1993.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $4 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $2,800 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 6.8% (1993)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 35% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $43.4 million\r\n expenditures: $43.7 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (FY89/90)\r\n\r\n Exports: $217 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\n commodities: olives, fruit, vegetables\r\n partners: Jordan, Israel\r\n\r\n Imports: $867 million (c.i.f., 1992)\r\n commodities: food, consumer goods, construction materials\r\n partners: Jordan, Israel\r\n\r\n External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate NA%\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: NA kW\r\n production: NA kWh\r\n consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n note: most electricity imported from Israel;

The bulk of\r\n export earnings comes from the sale of coconut oil and copra. The\r\n economy depends on emigrant remittances and foreign aid to support a\r\n level of imports much greater than export earnings. Tourism has become\r\n the most important growth industry. The economy continued to falter in\r\n 1994, as remittances and tourist earnings remained low. Production of\r\n taro, the primary food export crop, has dropped 97% since a fungal\r\n disease struck the crop in 1993. The rapid growth in 1994 of the giant\r\n African snail population in Western Samoa is also threatening the\r\n country's basic food crops, such as bananas and coconuts.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $400 million (1992\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -4.3% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $2,000 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 14% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $95.3 million\r\n expenditures: $76.7 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Exports: $6.4 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n commodities: coconut oil and cream, taro, copra, cocoa\r\n partners: New Zealand 34%, American Samoa 21%, Germany 18%, Australia\r\n 11%\r\n\r\n Imports: $11.5 million (c.i.f., 1992 est.)\r\n commodities: intermediate goods 58%, food 17%, capital goods 12%\r\n partners: New Zealand 37%, Australia 25%, Japan 11%, Fiji 9%\r\n\r\n External debt: $141 million (June 1993)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -0.3% (1992 est.); accounts for 16%\r\n of GDP\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 29,000 kW\r\n production: 50 million kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 200 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: timber, tourism, food processing, fishing\r\n\r\n Agriculture: accounts for about 50% of GDP; coconuts, fruit (including\r\n bananas, taro, yams)\r\n\r\n Economic aid:\r\n recipient: US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $18 million;\r\n Western (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments\r\n (1970-89), $306 million; OPEC bilateral aid (1979-89), $4 million\r\n\r\n Currency: 1 tala (WS$) = 100 sene\r\n\r\n Exchange rates: tala (WS$) per US$1 - 2.4600 (January 1995), 2.5349\r\n (1994), 2.5681 (1993), 2.4655 (1992), 2.3975 (1991), 2.3095 (1990)\r\n\r\n Fiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n@Western Samoa:Transportation\r\n\r\n Railroads: 0 km\r\n\r\n Highways:\r\n total: 2,042 km\r\n paved: 375 km\r\n unpaved: gravel, crushed stone, earth 1,667 km\r\n\r\n Ports: Apia, Asau, Mulifanua, Salelologa\r\n\r\n Merchant marine:\r\n total: 1 roll-on/roll-off cargo ship (1,000 GRT or over) totaling\r\n 3,838 GRT/5,536 DWT\r\n\r\n Airports:\r\n total: 3\r\n with paved runways 2,438 to 3,047 m: 1\r\n with paved runways under 914 m: 2\r\n\r\n@Western Samoa:Communications\r\n\r\n Telephone system: 7,500 telephones\r\n local: NA\r\n intercity: NA\r\n international: 1 INTELSAT (Pacific Ocean) earth station\r\n\r\n Radio:\r\n broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 0, shortwave 0\r\n radios: 70,000\r\n\r\n Television:\r\n broadcast stations: 0\r\n televisions: NA\r\n\r\n@Western Samoa:Defense Forces\r\n\r\n Branches: no regular armed services; Western Samoa Police Force\r\n\r\n Defense expenditures: $NA, NA% of GDP\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWORLD\r\n\r\n@World:Geography\r\n\r\n Map references: World, Time Zones\r\n\r\n Area:\r\n total area: 510.072 million sq km\r\n land area: 148.94 million sq km\r\n water area: 361.132 million sq km\r\n comparative area: land area about 16 times the size of the US\r\n note: 70.8% of the world is water, 29.2% is land\r\n\r\n Land boundaries: the land boundaries in the world total 250,883.64 km\r\n (not counting shared boundaries twice)\r\n\r\n Coastline: 356,000 km\r\n\r\n Maritime claims:\r\n contiguous zone: 24 nm claimed by most but can vary\r\n continental shelf: 200-m depth claimed by most or to depth of\r\n exploitation, others claim 200 nm or to the edge of the continental\r\n margin\r\n exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm claimed by most but can vary\r\n exclusive economic zone: 200 nm claimed by most but can vary\r\n territorial sea: 12 nm claimed by most but can vary\r\n note: boundary situations with neighboring states prevent many\r\n countries from extending their fishing or economic zones to a full 200\r\n nm; 43 nations and other areas that are landlocked include\r\n Afghanistan, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bhutan,\r\n Bolivia, Botswana, Burkina, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad,\r\n Czech Republic, Ethiopia, Holy See (Vatican City), Hungary,\r\n Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg,\r\n Malawi, Mali, Moldova, Mongolia, Nepal, Niger, Paraguay, Rwanda, San\r\n Marino, Slovakia, Swaziland, Switzerland, Tajikistan, The Former\r\n Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Uzbekistan, West\r\n Bank, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\n\r\n Climate: two large areas of polar climates separated by two rather\r\n narrow temperate zones from a wide equatorial band of tropical to\r\n subtropical climates\r\n\r\n Terrain: highest elevation is Mt.

Average growth of\r\n 3% in the GDP of industrialized countries (60% of GWP in 1994) and\r\n average growth of 6% in the GDP of less developed countries (34% of\r\n GWP) were partly offset by a further 11% drop in the GDP of the former\r\n USSR/Eastern Europe area (now only 6% of GWP). With the notable\r\n exception of Japan at 2.9%, unemployment was typically 5%-12% in the\r\n industrial world. The US accounted for 22% of GWP in 1994; Western\r\n Europe accounted for another 22%; and Japan accounted for 8%. These\r\n are the three \"economic superpowers\" which are presumably destined to\r\n compete for mastery in international markets on into the 21st century.\r\n As for the less developed countries, China, India, and the Four\r\n Dragons - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore - once again\r\n posted records of 5% growth or better; however, many other countries,\r\n especially in Africa, continued to suffer from drought, rapid\r\n population growth, inflation, and civil strife. Central Europe made\r\n considerable progress in moving toward \"market-friendly\" economies,\r\n whereas the 15 ex-Soviet countries (with the notable exceptions of the\r\n three Baltic states) typically experienced further declines in output,\r\n sometimes as high as 30%. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock\r\n economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over\r\n international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.\r\n Internally, the central government in a number of cases is losing\r\n control over resources as separatist regional movements - typically\r\n based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of\r\n the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, and in India. In\r\n Western Europe, governments face the difficult political problem of\r\n channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase\r\n investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The addition\r\n of nearly 100 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe\r\n is exacerbating the problems of pollution, desertification,\r\n underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of their own internal\r\n problems, the industrialized countries have inadequate resources to\r\n deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world, which, at least\r\n from the economic point of view, are becoming further marginalized.\r\n (For the specific economic problems of each country, see the\r\n individual country entries in this volume.)\r\n\r\n National product: GWP (gross world product) - purchasing power parity\r\n - $30.7 trillion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 3.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $5,400 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n all countries: 25%\r\n developed countries: 5%\r\n developing countries: 50% (1994 est.)\r\n note: national inflation rates vary widely in individual cases, from\r\n stable prices to hyperinflation\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 30% combined unemployment and underemployment in\r\n many non-industrialized countries;

the rapid development of\r\n new industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating already\r\n grim environmental problems\r\n\r\n Agriculture: the production of major food crops has increased\r\n substantially in the last 20 years; the annual production of cereals,\r\n for instance, has risen by 50%, from about 1.2 billion metric tons to\r\n about 1.8 billion metric tons; production increases have resulted\r\n mainly from increased yields rather than increases in planted areas;\r\n while global production is sufficient for aggregate demand, about\r\n one-fifth of the world's population remains malnourished, primarily\r\n because local production cannot adequately provide for large and\r\n rapidly growing populations, which are too poor to pay for food\r\n imports;

Future economic\r\n development depends heavily on Western-assisted development of the\r\n country's moderate oil resources. Former South Yemen's willingness to\r\n merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet economic\r\n support. The low level of domestic industry and agriculture has made\r\n northern Yemen dependent on imports for practically all of its\r\n essential needs. Once self-sufficient in food production, northern\r\n Yemen has become a major importer. Land once used for export crops -\r\n cotton, fruit, and vegetables - has been turned over to growing a\r\n shrub called qat, whose leaves are chewed for their stimulant effect\r\n by Yemenis and which has no significant export market. Economic growth\r\n in former South Yemen has been constrained by a lack of incentives,\r\n partly stemming from centralized control over production decisions,\r\n investment allocation, and import choices. Yemen's large trade\r\n deficits have been compensated for by remittances from Yemenis working\r\n abroad and by foreign aid. Since the Gulf crisis, remittances have\r\n dropped substantially. Growth in 1994-95 is constrained by low oil\r\n prices, rapid inflation, and political deadlock that are causing a\r\n lack of economic cooperation and leadership. However, a peace\r\n agreement with Saudi Arabia in February 1995 and the expectation of a\r\n rise in oil prices brighten Yemen's economic prospects.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $23.4 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: -1.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $1,955 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 145% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: 30% (December 1994)\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $1.75 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: crude oil, cotton, coffee, hides, vegetables, dried and\r\n salted fish\r\n partners: Germany 28%, Japan 15%, UK 9%, Austria 7%, China 7% (1992)\r\n\r\n Imports: $2.65 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n commodities: textiles and other manufactured consumer goods, petroleum\r\n products, sugar, grain, flour, other foodstuffs, cement, machinery,\r\n chemicals\r\n partners: US 16%, UK 7%, Japan 6%, France 6%, Italy 6% (1992)\r\n\r\n External debt: $7 billion (1993)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate NA%, accounts for 18% of GDP\r\n\r\n Electricity:\r\n capacity: 810,000 kW\r\n production: 1.8 billion kWh\r\n consumption per capita: 149 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\n Industries: crude oil production and petroleum refining;

While meaningful economic figures are difficult to come by,\r\n Zaire's hyperinflation, chronic large government deficits, and\r\n plunging mineral production have made the country one of the world's\r\n poorest. Most formal transactions are conducted in hard currency as\r\n indigenous bank notes have lost almost all value, and a barter economy\r\n now flourishes in all but the largest cities. Most individuals and\r\n families hang on grimly through subsistence farming and petty trade.\r\n The government has not been able to meet its financial obligations to\r\n the International Monetary Fund or put in place the financial measures\r\n advocated by the IMF. Although short-term prospects for improvement\r\n are dim, improved political stability would boost Zaire's long-term\r\n potential to effectively exploit its vast wealth of mineral and\r\n agricultural resources.\r\n\r\n National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $18.8 billion (1994\r\n est.)\r\n\r\n National product real growth rate: 4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n National product per capita: $440 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\n Inflation rate (consumer prices): 40% per month (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n Budget:\r\n revenues: $NA\r\n expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\n Exports: $362 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: copper, coffee, diamonds, cobalt, crude oil\r\n partners: US, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, UK, Japan, South Africa\r\n\r\n Imports: $356 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n commodities: consumer goods, foodstuffs, mining and other machinery,\r\n transport equipment, fuels\r\n partners: South Africa, US, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK\r\n\r\n External debt: $9.2 billion (May 1992 est.)\r\n\r\n Industrial production: growth rate -20% (1993);

Economic\r\n difficulties stemmed largely from a chronically depressed level of\r\n copper production and weak copper prices, generally ineffective\r\n economic policies, and high inflation. An annual population growth of\r\n 3% brought a decline in per capita GDP of 50% over the decade.\r\n However, economic reforms enacted since 1992 have helped reduce\r\n inflation, have begun to strengthen the social safety net, and have\r\n been accompanied by GDP growth at an estimated 6.8% in 1993 and 4% in\r\n 1994.

None of the successor states of the\r\n former Yugoslavia, including Serbia and Montenegro, have been\r\n permitted to participate solely on the basis of the membership of the\r\n former Yugoslavia in the United Nations General Assembly and Economic\r\n and Social Council and their subsidiary bodies and in various United\r\n Nations specialized agencies. The United Nations, however, permits the\r\n seat and nameplate of the SFRY to remain, permits the SFRY mission to\r\n continue to function, and continues to fly the flag of the former\r\n Yugoslavia. For a variety of reasons, a number of other organizations\r\n have not yet taken action with regard to the membership of the former\r\n Yugoslavia. The World Factbook therefore continues to list Yugoslavia\r\n under international organizations where the SFRY seat remains or where\r\n no action has yet been taken.\r\n\r\nadvanced developing
