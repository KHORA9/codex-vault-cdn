Concluding Remarks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. I.\r\n\r\nGeneral Introduction\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nAfter an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting\r\nfederal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new\r\nConstitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its\r\nown importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the\r\nexistence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it\r\nis composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most\r\ninteresting in the world. It has been frequently remarked that it seems\r\nto have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct\r\nand example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men\r\nare really capable or not of establishing good government from\r\nreflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend\r\nfor their political constitutions on accident and force. If there be\r\nany truth in the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with\r\npropriety be regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made;\r\nand a wrong election of the part we shall act may, in this view,\r\ndeserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.\r\n\r\nThis idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of\r\npatriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good\r\nmen must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice should be\r\ndirected by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and\r\nunbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. But this\r\nis a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected.\r\nThe plan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular\r\ninterests, innovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve\r\nin its discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of\r\nviews, passions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nAmong the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution\r\nwill have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious\r\ninterest of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes\r\nwhich may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence\r\nof the offices they hold under the State establishments; and the\r\nperverted ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to\r\naggrandize themselves by the confusions of their country, or will\r\nflatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the\r\nsubdivision of the empire into several partial confederacies than from\r\nits union under one government.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this\r\nnature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve\r\nindiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their\r\nsituations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or\r\nambitious views. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may\r\nbe actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much\r\nof the opposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make\r\nits appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not\r\nrespectable—the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived\r\njealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes\r\nwhich serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many\r\noccasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right\r\nside of questions of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance,\r\nif duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those who\r\nare ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any\r\ncontroversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might\r\nbe drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those who\r\nadvocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their\r\nantagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition,\r\nand many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate\r\nas well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a\r\nquestion. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing\r\ncould be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all\r\ntimes, characterized political parties. For in politics, as in\r\nreligion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and\r\nsword. Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have\r\nalready sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all\r\nformer cases of great national discussion. A torrent of angry and\r\nmalignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the\r\nopposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually\r\nhope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the\r\nnumber of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the\r\nbitterness of their invectives. An enlightened zeal for the energy and\r\nefficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a\r\ntemper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty.\r\nAn over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people,\r\nwhich is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be\r\nrepresented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for\r\npopularity at the expense of the public good. It will be forgotten, on\r\nthe one hand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that\r\nthe noble enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of\r\nnarrow and illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally\r\nforgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of\r\nliberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed\r\njudgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous\r\nambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the\r\nrights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for\r\nthe firmness and efficiency of government. History will teach us that\r\nthe former has been found a much more certain road to the introduction\r\nof despotism than the latter, and that of those men who have overturned\r\nthe liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career\r\nby paying an obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and\r\nending tyrants.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye, my\r\nfellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts,\r\nfrom whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the\r\nutmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions other than those\r\nwhich may result from the evidence of truth. You will, no doubt, at the\r\nsame time, have collected from the general scope of them, that they\r\nproceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution. Yes, my\r\ncountrymen, I own to you that, after having given it an attentive\r\nconsideration, I am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it.\r\nI am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, your\r\ndignity, and your happiness. I affect not reserves which I do not feel.\r\nI will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when I have\r\ndecided. I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely\r\nlay before you the reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness\r\nof good intentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply\r\nprofessions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository of\r\nmy own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of\r\nby all. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not\r\ndisgrace the cause of truth.\r\n\r\nI propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interesting\r\nparticulars:\r\n\r\nTHE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY\r\n\r\nTHE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THAT UNION\r\nTHE NECESSITY OF A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST EQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE\r\nPROPOSED, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS OBJECT THE CONFORMITY OF THE\r\nPROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT\r\nITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION and lastly, THE ADDITIONAL\r\nSECURITY WHICH ITS ADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT\r\nSPECIES OF GOVERNMENT, TO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a\r\nsatisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their\r\nappearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the\r\nutility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts\r\nof the great body of the people in every State, and one, which it may\r\nbe imagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is, that we already hear\r\nit whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new\r\nConstitution, that the thirteen States are of too great extent for any\r\ngeneral system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate\r\nconfederacies of distinct portions of the whole.[1] This doctrine will,\r\nin all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries\r\nenough to countenance an open avowal of it. For nothing can be more\r\nevident, to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject,\r\nthan the alternative of an adoption of the new Constitution or a\r\ndismemberment of the Union. It will therefore be of use to begin by\r\nexamining the advantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the\r\nprobable dangers, to which every State will be exposed from its\r\ndissolution. This shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] The same idea, tracing the arguments to their consequences, is\r\n held out in several of the late publications against the new\r\n Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\nConcerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nJAY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nWhen the people of America reflect that they are now called upon to\r\ndecide a question, which, in its consequences, must prove one of the\r\nmost important that ever engaged their attention, the propriety of\r\ntheir taking a very comprehensive, as well as a very serious, view of\r\nit, will be evident.\r\n\r\nNothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government,\r\nand it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is\r\ninstituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights in\r\norder to vest it with requisite powers. It is well worthy of\r\nconsideration therefore, whether it would conduce more to the interest\r\nof the people of America that they should, to all general purposes, be\r\none nation, under one federal government, or that they should divide\r\nthemselves into separate confederacies, and give to the head of each\r\nthe same kind of powers which they are advised to place in one national\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIt has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion that the\r\nprosperity of the people of America depended on their continuing firmly\r\nunited, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of our best and wisest\r\ncitizens have been constantly directed to that object. But politicians\r\nnow appear, who insist that this opinion is erroneous, and that instead\r\nof looking for safety and happiness in union, we ought to seek it in a\r\ndivision of the States into distinct confederacies or sovereignties.\r\nHowever extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it nevertheless has\r\nits advocates; and certain characters who were much opposed to it\r\nformerly, are at present of the number. Whatever may be the arguments\r\nor inducements which have wrought this change in the sentiments and\r\ndeclarations of these gentlemen, it certainly would not be wise in the\r\npeople at large to adopt these new political tenets without being fully\r\nconvinced that they are founded in truth and sound policy.\r\n\r\nIt has often given me pleasure to observe that independent America was\r\nnot composed of detached and distant territories, but that one\r\nconnected, fertile, widespreading country was the portion of our\r\nwestern sons of liberty. Providence has in a particular manner blessed\r\nit with a variety of soils and productions, and watered it with\r\ninnumerable streams, for the delight and accommodation of its\r\ninhabitants. A succession of navigable waters forms a kind of chain\r\nround its borders, as if to bind it together; while the most noble\r\nrivers in the world, running at convenient distances, present them with\r\nhighways for the easy communication of friendly aids, and the mutual\r\ntransportation and exchange of their various commodities.\r\n\r\nWith equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence has\r\nbeen pleased to give this one connected country to one united people—a\r\npeople descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language,\r\nprofessing the same religion, attached to the same principles of\r\ngovernment, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by\r\ntheir joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side\r\nthroughout a long and bloody war, have nobly established general\r\nliberty and independence.\r\n\r\nThis country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and\r\nit appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance\r\nso proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other\r\nby the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial,\r\njealous, and alien sovereignties.\r\n\r\nSimilar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and\r\ndenominations of men among us. To all general purposes we have\r\nuniformly been one people each individual citizen everywhere enjoying\r\nthe same national rights, privileges, and protection. As a nation we\r\nhave made peace and war; as a nation we have vanquished our common\r\nenemies; as a nation we have formed alliances, and made treaties, and\r\nentered into various compacts and conventions with foreign states.\r\n\r\nA strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the people,\r\nat a very early period, to institute a federal government to preserve\r\nand perpetuate it. They formed it almost as soon as they had a\r\npolitical existence; nay, at a time when their habitations were in\r\nflames, when many of their citizens were bleeding, and when the\r\nprogress of hostility and desolation left little room for those calm\r\nand mature inquiries and reflections which must ever precede the\r\nformation of a wise and wellbalanced government for a free people. It\r\nis not to be wondered at, that a government instituted in times so\r\ninauspicious, should on experiment be found greatly deficient and\r\ninadequate to the purpose it was intended to answer.\r\n\r\nThis intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects. Still\r\ncontinuing no less attached to union than enamored of liberty, they\r\nobserved the danger which immediately threatened the former and more\r\nremotely the latter; and being pursuaded that ample security for both\r\ncould only be found in a national government more wisely framed, they\r\nas with one voice, convened the late convention at Philadelphia, to\r\ntake that important subject under consideration.\r\n\r\nThis convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of the\r\npeople, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by their\r\npatriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds and\r\nhearts of men, undertook the arduous task. In the mild season of peace,\r\nwith minds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many months in\r\ncool, uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without\r\nhaving been awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love\r\nfor their country, they presented and recommended to the people the\r\nplan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils.\r\n\r\nAdmit, for so is the fact, that this plan is only RECOMMENDED, not\r\nimposed, yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended to\r\nBLIND approbation, nor to BLIND reprobation; but to that sedate and\r\ncandid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the subject\r\ndemand, and which it certainly ought to receive. But this (as was\r\nremarked in the foregoing number of this paper) is more to be wished\r\nthan expected, that it may be so considered and examined. Experience on\r\na former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine in such hopes. It\r\nis not yet forgotten that well-grounded apprehensions of imminent\r\ndanger induced the people of America to form the memorable Congress of\r\n1774. That body recommended certain measures to their constituents, and\r\nthe event proved their wisdom; yet it is fresh in our memories how soon\r\nthe press began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers against those\r\nvery measures. Not only many of the officers of government, who obeyed\r\nthe dictates of personal interest, but others, from a mistaken estimate\r\nof consequences, or the undue influence of former attachments, or whose\r\nambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public\r\ngood, were indefatigable in their efforts to pursuade the people to\r\nreject the advice of that patriotic Congress. Many, indeed, were\r\ndeceived and deluded, but the great majority of the people reasoned and\r\ndecided judiciously; and happy they are in reflecting that they did so.\r\n\r\nThey considered that the Congress was composed of many wise and\r\nexperienced men. That, being convened from different parts of the\r\ncountry, they brought with them and communicated to each other a\r\nvariety of useful information. That, in the course of the time they\r\npassed together in inquiring into and discussing the true interests of\r\ntheir country, they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on that\r\nhead. That they were individually interested in the public liberty and\r\nprosperity, and therefore that it was not less their inclination than\r\ntheir duty to recommend only such measures as, after the most mature\r\ndeliberation, they really thought prudent and advisable.\r\n\r\nThese and similar considerations then induced the people to rely\r\ngreatly on the judgment and integrity of the Congress; and they took\r\ntheir advice, notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors used to\r\ndeter them from it. But if the people at large had reason to confide in\r\nthe men of that Congress, few of whom had been fully tried or generally\r\nknown, still greater reason have they now to respect the judgment and\r\nadvice of the convention, for it is well known that some of the most\r\ndistinguished members of that Congress, who have been since tried and\r\njustly approved for patriotism and abilities, and who have grown old in\r\nacquiring political information, were also members of this convention,\r\nand carried into it their accumulated knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that not only the first, but every succeeding\r\nCongress, as well as the late convention, have invariably joined with\r\nthe people in thinking that the prosperity of America depended on its\r\nUnion. To preserve and perpetuate it was the great object of the people\r\nin forming that convention, and it is also the great object of the plan\r\nwhich the convention has advised them to adopt. With what propriety,\r\ntherefore, or for what good purposes, are attempts at this particular\r\nperiod made by some men to depreciate the importance of the Union? Or\r\nwhy is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better\r\nthan one? I am persuaded in my own mind that the people have always\r\nthought right on this subject, and that their universal and uniform\r\nattachment to the cause of the Union rests on great and weighty\r\nreasons, which I shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing\r\npapers. They who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct\r\nconfederacies in the room of the plan of the convention, seem clearly\r\nto foresee that the rejection of it would put the continuance of the\r\nUnion in the utmost jeopardy. That certainly would be the case, and I\r\nsincerely wish that it may be as clearly foreseen by every good\r\ncitizen, that whenever the dissolution of the Union arrives, America\r\nwill have reason to exclaim, in the words of the poet: “FAREWELL! A\r\nLONG FAREWELL TO ALL MY GREATNESS.”\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. III.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence)\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nJAY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIt is not a new observation that the people of any country (if, like\r\nthe Americans, intelligent and wellinformed) seldom adopt and steadily\r\npersevere for many years in an erroneous opinion respecting their\r\ninterests. That consideration naturally tends to create great respect\r\nfor the high opinion which the people of America have so long and\r\nuniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing firmly\r\nunited under one federal government, vested with sufficient powers for\r\nall general and national purposes.\r\n\r\nThe more attentively I consider and investigate the reasons which\r\nappear to have given birth to this opinion, the more I become convinced\r\nthat they are cogent and conclusive.\r\n\r\nAmong the many objects to which a wise and free people find it\r\nnecessary to direct their attention, that of providing for their SAFETY\r\nseems to be the first. The SAFETY of the people doubtless has relation\r\nto a great variety of circumstances and considerations, and\r\nconsequently affords great latitude to those who wish to define it\r\nprecisely and comprehensively.\r\n\r\nAt present I mean only to consider it as it respects security for the\r\npreservation of peace and tranquillity, as well as against dangers from\r\nFOREIGN ARMS AND INFLUENCE, as from dangers of the LIKE KIND arising\r\nfrom domestic causes. As the former of these comes first in order, it\r\nis proper it should be the first discussed. Let us therefore proceed to\r\nexamine whether the people are not right in their opinion that a\r\ncordial Union, under an efficient national government, affords them the\r\nbest security that can be devised against HOSTILITIES from abroad.\r\n\r\nThe number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world will\r\nalways be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of the\r\ncauses, whether REAL or PRETENDED, which PROVOKE or INVITE them. If\r\nthis remark be just, it becomes useful to inquire whether so many JUST\r\ncauses of war are likely to be given by UNITED AMERICA as by DISUNITED\r\nAmerica; for if it should turn out that United America will probably\r\ngive the fewest, then it will follow that in this respect the Union\r\ntends most to preserve the people in a state of peace with other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe JUST causes of war, for the most part, arise either from violation\r\nof treaties or from direct violence. America has already formed\r\ntreaties with no less than six foreign nations, and all of them, except\r\nPrussia, are maritime, and therefore able to annoy and injure us. She\r\nhas also extensive commerce with Portugal, Spain, and Britain, and,\r\nwith respect to the two latter, has, in addition, the circumstance of\r\nneighborhood to attend to.\r\n\r\nIt is of high importance to the peace of America that she observe the\r\nlaws of nations towards all these powers, and to me it appears evident\r\nthat this will be more perfectly and punctually done by one national\r\ngovernment than it could be either by thirteen separate States or by\r\nthree or four distinct confederacies.\r\n\r\nBecause when once an efficient national government is established, the\r\nbest men in the country will not only consent to serve, but also will\r\ngenerally be appointed to manage it; for, although town or country, or\r\nother contracted influence, may place men in State assemblies, or\r\nsenates, or courts of justice, or executive departments, yet more\r\ngeneral and extensive reputation for talents and other qualifications\r\nwill be necessary to recommend men to offices under the national\r\ngovernment,—especially as it will have the widest field for choice, and\r\nnever experience that want of proper persons which is not uncommon in\r\nsome of the States. Hence, it will result that the administration, the\r\npolitical counsels, and the judicial decisions of the national\r\ngovernment will be more wise, systematical, and judicious than those of\r\nindividual States, and consequently more satisfactory with respect to\r\nother nations, as well as more SAFE with respect to us.\r\n\r\nBecause, under the national government, treaties and articles of\r\ntreaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always be expounded in\r\none sense and executed in the same manner,—whereas, adjudications on\r\nthe same points and questions, in thirteen States, or in three or four\r\nconfederacies, will not always accord or be consistent; and that, as\r\nwell from the variety of independent courts and judges appointed by\r\ndifferent and independent governments, as from the different local laws\r\nand interests which may affect and influence them. The wisdom of the\r\nconvention, in committing such questions to the jurisdiction and\r\njudgment of courts appointed by and responsible only to one national\r\ngovernment, cannot be too much commended.\r\n\r\nBecause the prospect of present loss or advantage may often tempt the\r\ngoverning party in one or two States to swerve from good faith and\r\njustice; but those temptations, not reaching the other States, and\r\nconsequently having little or no influence on the national government,\r\nthe temptation will be fruitless, and good faith and justice be\r\npreserved. The case of the treaty of peace with Britain adds great\r\nweight to this reasoning.\r\n\r\nBecause, even if the governing party in a State should be disposed to\r\nresist such temptations, yet as such temptations may, and commonly do,\r\nresult from circumstances peculiar to the State, and may affect a great\r\nnumber of the inhabitants, the governing party may not always be able,\r\nif willing, to prevent the injustice meditated, or to punish the\r\naggressors. But the national government, not being affected by those\r\nlocal circumstances, will neither be induced to commit the wrong\r\nthemselves, nor want power or inclination to prevent or punish its\r\ncommission by others.\r\n\r\nSo far, therefore, as either designed or accidental violations of\r\ntreaties and the laws of nations afford JUST causes of war, they are\r\nless to be apprehended under one general government than under several\r\nlesser ones, and in that respect the former most favors the SAFETY of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nAs to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and unlawful\r\nviolence, it appears equally clear to me that one good national\r\ngovernment affords vastly more security against dangers of that sort\r\nthan can be derived from any other quarter.\r\n\r\nBecause such violences are more frequently caused by the passions and\r\ninterests of a part than of the whole; of one or two States than of the\r\nUnion. Not a single Indian war has yet been occasioned by aggressions\r\nof the present federal government, feeble as it is; but there are\r\nseveral instances of Indian hostilities having been provoked by the\r\nimproper conduct of individual States, who, either unable or unwilling\r\nto restrain or punish offenses, have given occasion to the slaughter of\r\nmany innocent inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood of Spanish and British territories, bordering on some\r\nStates and not on others, naturally confines the causes of quarrel more\r\nimmediately to the borderers. The bordering States, if any, will be\r\nthose who, under the impulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense of\r\napparent interest or injury, will be most likely, by direct violence,\r\nto excite war with these nations; and nothing can so effectually\r\nobviate that danger as a national government, whose wisdom and prudence\r\nwill not be diminished by the passions which actuate the parties\r\nimmediately interested.\r\n\r\nBut not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the national\r\ngovernment, but it will also be more in their power to accommodate and\r\nsettle them amicably. They will be more temperate and cool, and in that\r\nrespect, as well as in others, will be more in capacity to act\r\nadvisedly than the offending State. The pride of states, as well as of\r\nmen, naturally disposes them to justify all their actions, and opposes\r\ntheir acknowledging, correcting, or repairing their errors and\r\noffenses. The national government, in such cases, will not be affected\r\nby this pride, but will proceed with moderation and candor to consider\r\nand decide on the means most proper to extricate them from the\r\ndifficulties which threaten them.\r\n\r\nBesides, it is well known that acknowledgments, explanations, and\r\ncompensations are often accepted as satisfactory from a strong united\r\nnation, which would be rejected as unsatisfactory if offered by a State\r\nor confederacy of little consideration or power.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1685, the state of Genoa having offended Louis XIV.,\r\nendeavored to appease him. He demanded that they should send their\r\nDoge, or chief magistrate, accompanied by four of their senators, to\r\nFRANCE, to ask his pardon and receive his terms. They were obliged to\r\nsubmit to it for the sake of peace. Would he on any occasion either\r\nhave demanded or have received the like humiliation from Spain, or\r\nBritain, or any other POWERFUL nation?\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. IV.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence)\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nJAY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nMy last paper assigned several reasons why the safety of the people\r\nwould be best secured by union against the danger it may be exposed to\r\nby JUST causes of war given to other nations; and those reasons show\r\nthat such causes would not only be more rarely given, but would also be\r\nmore easily accommodated, by a national government than either by the\r\nState governments or the proposed little confederacies.\r\n\r\nBut the safety of the people of America against dangers from FOREIGN\r\nforce depends not only on their forbearing to give JUST causes of war\r\nto other nations, but also on their placing and continuing themselves\r\nin such a situation as not to INVITE hostility or insult; for it need\r\nnot be observed that there are PRETENDED as well as just causes of war.\r\n\r\nIt is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that\r\nnations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of\r\ngetting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when\r\ntheir nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and\r\nobjects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for\r\npersonal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or\r\nsupport their particular families or partisans. These and a variety of\r\nother motives, which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead\r\nhim to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and\r\ninterests of his people. But, independent of these inducements to war,\r\nwhich are more prevalent in absolute monarchies, but which well deserve\r\nour attention, there are others which affect nations as often as kings;\r\nand some of them will on examination be found to grow out of our\r\nrelative situation and circumstances.\r\n\r\nWith France and with Britain we are rivals in the fisheries, and can\r\nsupply their markets cheaper than they can themselves, notwithstanding\r\nany efforts to prevent it by bounties on their own or duties on foreign\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nWith them and with most other European nations we are rivals in\r\nnavigation and the carrying trade; and we shall deceive ourselves if we\r\nsuppose that any of them will rejoice to see it flourish; for, as our\r\ncarrying trade cannot increase without in some degree diminishing\r\ntheirs, it is more their interest, and will be more their policy, to\r\nrestrain than to promote it.\r\n\r\nIn the trade to China and India, we interfere with more than one\r\nnation, inasmuch as it enables us to partake in advantages which they\r\nhad in a manner monopolized, and as we thereby supply ourselves with\r\ncommodities which we used to purchase from them.\r\n\r\nThe extension of our own commerce in our own vessels cannot give\r\npleasure to any nations who possess territories on or near this\r\ncontinent, because the cheapness and excellence of our productions,\r\nadded to the circumstance of vicinity, and the enterprise and address\r\nof our merchants and navigators, will give us a greater share in the\r\nadvantages which those territories afford, than consists with the\r\nwishes or policy of their respective sovereigns.\r\n\r\nSpain thinks it convenient to shut the Mississippi against us on the\r\none side, and Britain excludes us from the Saint Lawrence on the other;\r\nnor will either of them permit the other waters which are between them\r\nand us to become the means of mutual intercourse and traffic.\r\n\r\nFrom these and such like considerations, which might, if consistent\r\nwith prudence, be more amplified and detailed, it is easy to see that\r\njealousies and uneasinesses may gradually slide into the minds and\r\ncabinets of other nations, and that we are not to expect that they\r\nshould regard our advancement in union, in power and consequence by\r\nland and by sea, with an eye of indifference and composure.\r\n\r\nThe people of America are aware that inducements to war may arise out\r\nof these circumstances, as well as from others not so obvious at\r\npresent, and that whenever such inducements may find fit time and\r\nopportunity for operation, pretenses to color and justify them will not\r\nbe wanting. Wisely, therefore, do they consider union and a good\r\nnational government as necessary to put and keep them in SUCH A\r\nSITUATION as, instead of INVITING war, will tend to repress and\r\ndiscourage it. That situation consists in the best possible state of\r\ndefense, and necessarily depends on the government, the arms, and the\r\nresources of the country.\r\n\r\nAs the safety of the whole is the interest of the whole, and cannot be\r\nprovided for without government, either one or more or many, let us\r\ninquire whether one good government is not, relative to the object in\r\nquestion, more competent than any other given number whatever.\r\n\r\nOne government can collect and avail itself of the talents and\r\nexperience of the ablest men, in whatever part of the Union they may be\r\nfound. It can move on uniform principles of policy. It can harmonize,\r\nassimilate, and protect the several parts and members, and extend the\r\nbenefit of its foresight and precautions to each. In the formation of\r\ntreaties, it will regard the interest of the whole, and the particular\r\ninterests of the parts as connected with that of the whole. It can\r\napply the resources and power of the whole to the defense of any\r\nparticular part, and that more easily and expeditiously than State\r\ngovernments or separate confederacies can possibly do, for want of\r\nconcert and unity of system. It can place the militia under one plan of\r\ndiscipline, and, by putting their officers in a proper line of\r\nsubordination to the Chief Magistrate, will, as it were, consolidate\r\nthem into one corps, and thereby render them more efficient than if\r\ndivided into thirteen or into three or four distinct independent\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nWhat would the militia of Britain be if the English militia obeyed the\r\ngovernment of England, if the Scotch militia obeyed the government of\r\nScotland, and if the Welsh militia obeyed the government of Wales?\r\nSuppose an invasion; would those three governments (if they agreed at\r\nall) be able, with all their respective forces, to operate against the\r\nenemy so effectually as the single government of Great Britain would?\r\n\r\nWe have heard much of the fleets of Britain, and the time may come, if\r\nwe are wise, when the fleets of America may engage attention. But if\r\none national government, had not so regulated the navigation of Britain\r\nas to make it a nursery for seamen—if one national government had not\r\ncalled forth all the national means and materials for forming fleets,\r\ntheir prowess and their thunder would never have been celebrated. Let\r\nEngland have its navigation and fleet—let Scotland have its navigation\r\nand fleet—let Wales have its navigation and fleet—let Ireland have its\r\nnavigation and fleet—let those four of the constituent parts of the\r\nBritish empire be under four independent governments, and it is easy to\r\nperceive how soon they would each dwindle into comparative\r\ninsignificance.\r\n\r\nApply these facts to our own case. Leave America divided into thirteen\r\nor, if you please, into three or four independent governments—what\r\narmies could they raise and pay—what fleets could they ever hope to\r\nhave? If one was attacked, would the others fly to its succor, and\r\nspend their blood and money in its defense? Would there be no danger of\r\ntheir being flattered into neutrality by its specious promises, or\r\nseduced by a too great fondness for peace to decline hazarding their\r\ntranquillity and present safety for the sake of neighbors, of whom\r\nperhaps they have been jealous, and whose importance they are content\r\nto see diminished? Although such conduct would not be wise, it would,\r\nnevertheless, be natural. The history of the states of Greece, and of\r\nother countries, abounds with such instances, and it is not improbable\r\nthat what has so often happened would, under similar circumstances,\r\nhappen again.\r\n\r\nBut admit that they might be willing to help the invaded State or\r\nconfederacy. How, and when, and in what proportion shall aids of men\r\nand money be afforded? Who shall command the allied armies, and from\r\nwhich of them shall he receive his orders? Who shall settle the terms\r\nof peace, and in case of disputes what umpire shall decide between them\r\nand compel acquiescence? Various difficulties and inconveniences would\r\nbe inseparable from such a situation; whereas one government, watching\r\nover the general and common interests, and combining and directing the\r\npowers and resources of the whole, would be free from all these\r\nembarrassments, and conduce far more to the safety of the people.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be our situation, whether firmly united under one\r\nnational government, or split into a number of confederacies, certain\r\nit is, that foreign nations will know and view it exactly as it is; and\r\nthey will act toward us accordingly. If they see that our national\r\ngovernment is efficient and well administered, our trade prudently\r\nregulated, our militia properly organized and disciplined, our\r\nresources and finances discreetly managed, our credit re-established,\r\nour people free, contented, and united, they will be much more disposed\r\nto cultivate our friendship than provoke our resentment. If, on the\r\nother hand, they find us either destitute of an effectual government\r\n(each State doing right or wrong, as to its rulers may seem\r\nconvenient), or split into three or four independent and probably\r\ndiscordant republics or confederacies, one inclining to Britain,\r\nanother to France, and a third to Spain, and perhaps played off against\r\neach other by the three, what a poor, pitiful figure will America make\r\nin their eyes! How liable would she become not only to their contempt\r\nbut to their outrage, and how soon would dear-bought experience\r\nproclaim that when a people or family so divide, it never fails to be\r\nagainst themselves.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. V.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence)\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nJAY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nQueen Anne, in her letter of the 1st July, 1706, to the Scotch\r\nParliament, makes some observations on the importance of the UNION then\r\nforming between England and Scotland, which merit our attention. I\r\nshall present the public with one or two extracts from it: “An entire\r\nand perfect union will be the solid foundation of lasting peace: It\r\nwill secure your religion, liberty, and property; remove the\r\nanimosities amongst yourselves, and the jealousies and differences\r\nbetwixt our two kingdoms. It must increase your strength, riches, and\r\ntrade; and by this union the whole island, being joined in affection\r\nand free from all apprehensions of different interest, will be ENABLED\r\nTO RESIST ALL ITS ENEMIES.” “We most earnestly recommend to you\r\ncalmness and unanimity in this great and weighty affair, that the union\r\nmay be brought to a happy conclusion, being the only EFFECTUAL way to\r\nsecure our present and future happiness, and disappoint the designs of\r\nour and your enemies, who will doubtless, on this occasion, USE THEIR\r\nUTMOST ENDEAVORS TO PREVENT OR DELAY THIS UNION.”\r\n\r\nIt was remarked in the preceding paper, that weakness and divisions at\r\nhome would invite dangers from abroad; and that nothing would tend more\r\nto secure us from them than union, strength, and good government within\r\nourselves. This subject is copious and cannot easily be exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe history of Great Britain is the one with which we are in general\r\nthe best acquainted, and it gives us many useful lessons. We may profit\r\nby their experience without paying the price which it cost them.\r\nAlthough it seems obvious to common sense that the people of such an\r\nisland should be but one nation, yet we find that they were for ages\r\ndivided into three, and that those three were almost constantly\r\nembroiled in quarrels and wars with one another. Notwithstanding their\r\ntrue interest with respect to the continental nations was really the\r\nsame, yet by the arts and policy and practices of those nations, their\r\nmutual jealousies were perpetually kept inflamed, and for a long series\r\nof years they were far more inconvenient and troublesome than they were\r\nuseful and assisting to each other.\r\n\r\nShould the people of America divide themselves into three or four\r\nnations, would not the same thing happen? Would not similar jealousies\r\narise, and be in like manner cherished? Instead of their being “joined\r\nin affection” and free from all apprehension of different “interests,”\r\nenvy and jealousy would soon extinguish confidence and affection, and\r\nthe partial interests of each confederacy, instead of the general\r\ninterests of all America, would be the only objects of their policy and\r\npursuits. Hence, like most other BORDERING nations, they would always\r\nbe either involved in disputes and war, or live in the constant\r\napprehension of them.\r\n\r\nThe most sanguine advocates for three or four confederacies cannot\r\nreasonably suppose that they would long remain exactly on an equal\r\nfooting in point of strength, even if it was possible to form them so\r\nat first; but, admitting that to be practicable, yet what human\r\ncontrivance can secure the continuance of such equality? Independent of\r\nthose local circumstances which tend to beget and increase power in one\r\npart and to impede its progress in another, we must advert to the\r\neffects of that superior policy and good management which would\r\nprobably distinguish the government of one above the rest, and by which\r\ntheir relative equality in strength and consideration would be\r\ndestroyed. For it cannot be presumed that the same degree of sound\r\npolicy, prudence, and foresight would uniformly be observed by each of\r\nthese confederacies for a long succession of years.\r\n\r\nWhenever, and from whatever causes, it might happen, and happen it\r\nwould, that any one of these nations or confederacies should rise on\r\nthe scale of political importance much above the degree of her\r\nneighbors, that moment would those neighbors behold her with envy and\r\nwith fear. Both those passions would lead them to countenance, if not\r\nto promote, whatever might promise to diminish her importance; and\r\nwould also restrain them from measures calculated to advance or even to\r\nsecure her prosperity. Much time would not be necessary to enable her\r\nto discern these unfriendly dispositions. She would soon begin, not\r\nonly to lose confidence in her neighbors, but also to feel a\r\ndisposition equally unfavorable to them. Distrust naturally creates\r\ndistrust, and by nothing is good-will and kind conduct more speedily\r\nchanged than by invidious jealousies and uncandid imputations, whether\r\nexpressed or implied.\r\n\r\nThe North is generally the region of strength, and many local\r\ncircumstances render it probable that the most Northern of the proposed\r\nconfederacies would, at a period not very distant, be unquestionably\r\nmore formidable than any of the others. No sooner would this become\r\nevident than the NORTHERN HIVE would excite the same ideas and\r\nsensations in the more southern parts of America which it formerly did\r\nin the southern parts of Europe. Nor does it appear to be a rash\r\nconjecture that its young swarms might often be tempted to gather honey\r\nin the more blooming fields and milder air of their luxurious and more\r\ndelicate neighbors.\r\n\r\nThey who well consider the history of similar divisions and\r\nconfederacies will find abundant reason to apprehend that those in\r\ncontemplation would in no other sense be neighbors than as they would\r\nbe borderers; that they would neither love nor trust one another, but\r\non the contrary would be a prey to discord, jealousy, and mutual\r\ninjuries; in short, that they would place us exactly in the situations\r\nin which some nations doubtless wish to see us, viz., FORMIDABLE ONLY\r\nTO EACH OTHER.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it appears that those gentlemen are greatly\r\nmistaken who suppose that alliances offensive and defensive might be\r\nformed between these confederacies, and would produce that combination\r\nand union of wills of arms and of resources, which would be necessary\r\nto put and keep them in a formidable state of defense against foreign\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nWhen did the independent states, into which Britain and Spain were\r\nformerly divided, combine in such alliance, or unite their forces\r\nagainst a foreign enemy? The proposed confederacies will be DISTINCT\r\nNATIONS. Each of them would have its commerce with foreigners to\r\nregulate by distinct treaties; and as their productions and commodities\r\nare different and proper for different markets, so would those treaties\r\nbe essentially different. Different commercial concerns must create\r\ndifferent interests, and of course different degrees of political\r\nattachment to and connection with different foreign nations. Hence it\r\nmight and probably would happen that the foreign nation with whom the\r\nSOUTHERN confederacy might be at war would be the one with whom the\r\nNORTHERN confederacy would be the most desirous of preserving peace and\r\nfriendship. An alliance so contrary to their immediate interest would\r\nnot therefore be easy to form, nor, if formed, would it be observed and\r\nfulfilled with perfect good faith.\r\n\r\nNay, it is far more probable that in America, as in Europe, neighboring\r\nnations, acting under the impulse of opposite interests and unfriendly\r\npassions, would frequently be found taking different sides. Considering\r\nour distance from Europe, it would be more natural for these\r\nconfederacies to apprehend danger from one another than from distant\r\nnations, and therefore that each of them should be more desirous to\r\nguard against the others by the aid of foreign alliances, than to guard\r\nagainst foreign dangers by alliances between themselves. And here let\r\nus not forget how much more easy it is to receive foreign fleets into\r\nour ports, and foreign armies into our country, than it is to persuade\r\nor compel them to depart. How many conquests did the Romans and others\r\nmake in the characters of allies, and what innovations did they under\r\nthe same character introduce into the governments of those whom they\r\npretended to protect.\r\n\r\nLet candid men judge, then, whether the division of America into any\r\ngiven number of independent sovereignties would tend to secure us\r\nagainst the hostilities and improper interference of foreign nations.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. VI.\r\n\r\nConcerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe three last numbers of this paper have been dedicated to an\r\nenumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed, in a state of\r\ndisunion, from the arms and arts of foreign nations. I shall now\r\nproceed to delineate dangers of a different and, perhaps, still more\r\nalarming kind—those which will in all probability flow from dissensions\r\nbetween the States themselves, and from domestic factions and\r\nconvulsions. These have been already in some instances slightly\r\nanticipated; but they deserve a more particular and more full\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nA man must be far gone in Utopian speculations who can seriously doubt\r\nthat, if these States should either be wholly disunited, or only united\r\nin partial confederacies, the subdivisions into which they might be\r\nthrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other. To\r\npresume a want of motives for such contests as an argument against\r\ntheir existence, would be to forget that men are ambitious, vindictive,\r\nand rapacious. To look for a continuation of harmony between a number\r\nof independent, unconnected sovereignties in the same neighborhood,\r\nwould be to disregard the uniform course of human events, and to set at\r\ndefiance the accumulated experience of ages.\r\n\r\nThe causes of hostility among nations are innumerable. There are some\r\nwhich have a general and almost constant operation upon the collective\r\nbodies of society. Of this description are the love of power or the\r\ndesire of pre-eminence and dominion—the jealousy of power, or the\r\ndesire of equality and safety. There are others which have a more\r\ncircumscribed though an equally operative influence within their\r\nspheres. Such are the rivalships and competitions of commerce between\r\ncommercial nations. And there are others, not less numerous than either\r\nof the former, which take their origin entirely in private passions; in\r\nthe attachments, enmities, interests, hopes, and fears of leading\r\nindividuals in the communities of which they are members. Men of this\r\nclass, whether the favorites of a king or of a people, have in too many\r\ninstances abused the confidence they possessed; and assuming the\r\npretext of some public motive, have not scrupled to sacrifice the\r\nnational tranquillity to personal advantage or personal gratification.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Pericles, in compliance with the resentment of a\r\nprostitute,[1] at the expense of much of the blood and treasure of his\r\ncountrymen, attacked, vanquished, and destroyed the city of the\r\nSAMNIANS. The same man, stimulated by private pique against the\r\nMEGARENSIANS,[2] another nation of Greece, or to avoid a prosecution\r\nwith which he was threatened as an accomplice of a supposed theft of\r\nthe statuary Phidias,[3] or to get rid of the accusations prepared to\r\nbe brought against him for dissipating the funds of the state in the\r\npurchase of popularity,[4] or from a combination of all these causes,\r\nwas the primitive author of that famous and fatal war, distinguished in\r\nthe Grecian annals by the name of the PELOPONNESIAN war; which, after\r\nvarious vicissitudes, intermissions, and renewals, terminated in the\r\nruin of the Athenian commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe ambitious cardinal, who was prime minister to Henry VIII.,\r\npermitting his vanity to aspire to the triple crown,[5] entertained\r\nhopes of succeeding in the acquisition of that splendid prize by the\r\ninfluence of the Emperor Charles V. To secure the favor and interest of\r\nthis enterprising and powerful monarch, he precipitated England into a\r\nwar with France, contrary to the plainest dictates of policy, and at\r\nthe hazard of the safety and independence, as well of the kingdom over\r\nwhich he presided by his counsels, as of Europe in general. For if\r\nthere ever was a sovereign who bid fair to realize the project of\r\nuniversal monarchy, it was the Emperor Charles V., of whose intrigues\r\nWolsey was at once the instrument and the dupe.\r\n\r\nThe influence which the bigotry of one female,[6] the petulance of\r\nanother,[7] and the cabals of a third,[8] had in the contemporary\r\npolicy, ferments, and pacifications, of a considerable part of Europe,\r\nare topics that have been too often descanted upon not to be generally\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nTo multiply examples of the agency of personal considerations in the\r\nproduction of great national events, either foreign or domestic,\r\naccording to their direction, would be an unnecessary waste of time.\r\nThose who have but a superficial acquaintance with the sources from\r\nwhich they are to be drawn, will themselves recollect a variety of\r\ninstances; and those who have a tolerable knowledge of human nature\r\nwill not stand in need of such lights to form their opinion either of\r\nthe reality or extent of that agency. Perhaps, however, a reference,\r\ntending to illustrate the general principle, may with propriety be made\r\nto a case which has lately happened among ourselves. If Shays had not\r\nbeen a DESPERATE DEBTOR, it is much to be doubted whether Massachusetts\r\nwould have been plunged into a civil war.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the concurring testimony of experience, in this\r\nparticular, there are still to be found visionary or designing men, who\r\nstand ready to advocate the paradox of perpetual peace between the\r\nStates, though dismembered and alienated from each other. The genius of\r\nrepublics (say they) is pacific; the spirit of commerce has a tendency\r\nto soften the manners of men, and to extinguish those inflammable\r\nhumors which have so often kindled into wars. Commercial republics,\r\nlike ours, will never be disposed to waste themselves in ruinous\r\ncontentions with each other. They will be governed by mutual interest,\r\nand will cultivate a spirit of mutual amity and concord.\r\n\r\nIs it not (we may ask these projectors in politics) the true interest\r\nof all nations to cultivate the same benevolent and philosophic spirit?\r\nIf this be their true interest, have they in fact pursued it? Has it\r\nnot, on the contrary, invariably been found that momentary passions,\r\nand immediate interest, have a more active and imperious control over\r\nhuman conduct than general or remote considerations of policy, utility\r\nor justice? Have republics in practice been less addicted to war than\r\nmonarchies? Are not the former administered by MEN as well as the\r\nlatter? Are there not aversions, predilections, rivalships, and desires\r\nof unjust acquisitions, that affect nations as well as kings? Are not\r\npopular assemblies frequently subject to the impulses of rage,\r\nresentment, jealousy, avarice, and of other irregular and violent\r\npropensities? Is it not well known that their determinations are often\r\ngoverned by a few individuals in whom they place confidence, and are,\r\nof course, liable to be tinctured by the passions and views of those\r\nindividuals? Has commerce hitherto done anything more than change the\r\nobjects of war? Is not the love of wealth as domineering and\r\nenterprising a passion as that of power or glory? Have there not been\r\nas many wars founded upon commercial motives since that has become the\r\nprevailing system of nations, as were before occasioned by the cupidity\r\nof territory or dominion? Has not the spirit of commerce, in many\r\ninstances, administered new incentives to the appetite, both for the\r\none and for the other? Let experience, the least fallible guide of\r\nhuman opinions, be appealed to for an answer to these inquiries.\r\n\r\nSparta, Athens, Rome, and Carthage were all republics; two of them,\r\nAthens and Carthage, of the commercial kind. Yet were they as often\r\nengaged in wars, offensive and defensive, as the neighboring monarchies\r\nof the same times. Sparta was little better than a wellregulated camp;\r\nand Rome was never sated of carnage and conquest.\r\n\r\nCarthage, though a commercial republic, was the aggressor in the very\r\nwar that ended in her destruction. Hannibal had carried her arms into\r\nthe heart of Italy and to the gates of Rome, before Scipio, in turn,\r\ngave him an overthrow in the territories of Carthage, and made a\r\nconquest of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nVenice, in later times, figured more than once in wars of ambition,\r\ntill, becoming an object to the other Italian states, Pope Julius II.\r\nfound means to accomplish that formidable league,[9] which gave a\r\ndeadly blow to the power and pride of this haughty republic.\r\n\r\nThe provinces of Holland, till they were overwhelmed in debts and\r\ntaxes, took a leading and conspicuous part in the wars of Europe. They\r\nhad furious contests with England for the dominion of the sea, and were\r\namong the most persevering and most implacable of the opponents of\r\nLouis XIV.\r\n\r\nIn the government of Britain the representatives of the people compose\r\none branch of the national legislature. Commerce has been for ages the\r\npredominant pursuit of that country. Few nations, nevertheless, have\r\nbeen more frequently engaged in war; and the wars in which that kingdom\r\nhas been engaged have, in numerous instances, proceeded from the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThere have been, if I may so express it, almost as many popular as\r\nroyal wars. The cries of the nation and the importunities of their\r\nrepresentatives have, upon various occasions, dragged their monarchs\r\ninto war, or continued them in it, contrary to their inclinations, and\r\nsometimes contrary to the real interests of the State. In that\r\nmemorable struggle for superiority between the rival houses of AUSTRIA\r\nand BOURBON, which so long kept Europe in a flame, it is well known\r\nthat the antipathies of the English against the French, seconding the\r\nambition, or rather the avarice, of a favorite leader,[10] protracted\r\nthe war beyond the limits marked out by sound policy, and for a\r\nconsiderable time in opposition to the views of the court.\r\n\r\nThe wars of these two last-mentioned nations have in a great measure\r\ngrown out of commercial considerations;—the desire of supplanting and\r\nthe fear of being supplanted either in particular branches of traffic,\r\nor in the general advantages of trade and navigation; and sometimes\r\neven the more culpable desire of sharing in the commerce of other\r\nnations, without their consent.\r\n\r\nThe last war but two between Britain and Spain, sprang from the\r\nattempts of the English merchants, to prosecute an illicit trade with\r\nthe Spanish main. These unjustifiable practices on their part, produced\r\nseverities on the part of the Spaniards, towards the subjects of Great\r\nBritain, which were not more justifiable; because they exceeded the\r\nbounds of a just retaliation, and were chargeable with inhumanity and\r\ncruelty. Many of the English who were taken on the Spanish coasts, were\r\nsent to dig in the mines of Potosi; and by the usual progress of a\r\nspirit of resentment, the innocent were after a while confounded with\r\nthe guilty in indiscriminate punishment. The complaints of the\r\nmerchants kindled a violent flame throughout the nation, which soon\r\nafter broke out in the House of Commons, and was communicated from the\r\nbody to the ministry. Letters of reprisal were granted, and a war\r\nensued; which, in its consequences, overthrew all the alliances that\r\nbut twenty years before had been formed, with sanguine expectations of\r\nthe most beneficial fruits.\r\n\r\nFrom this summary of what has taken place in other countries, whose\r\nsituations have borne the nearest resemblance to our own, what reason\r\ncan we have to confide in those reveries which would seduce us into an\r\nexpectation of peace and cordiality between the members of the present\r\nconfederacy, in a state of separation? Have we not already seen enough\r\nof the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have\r\namused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections,\r\nweaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape? Is it not time\r\nto awake from the deceitful dream of a golden age, and to adopt as a\r\npractical maxim for the direction of our political conduct that we, as\r\nwell as the other inhabitants of the globe, are yet remote from the\r\nhappy empire of perfect wisdom and perfect virtue?\r\n\r\nLet the point of extreme depression to which our national dignity and\r\ncredit have sunk, let the inconveniences felt everywhere from a lax and\r\nill administration of government, let the revolt of a part of the State\r\nof North Carolina, the late menacing disturbances in Pennsylvania, and\r\nthe actual insurrections and rebellions in Massachusetts, declare—!\r\n\r\nSo far is the general sense of mankind from corresponding with the\r\ntenets of those who endeavor to lull asleep our apprehensions of\r\ndiscord and hostility between the States, in the event of disunion,\r\nthat it has from long observation of the progress of society become a\r\nsort of axiom in politics, that vicinity or nearness of situation,\r\nconstitutes nations natural enemies. An intelligent writer expresses\r\nhimself on this subject to this effect: “NEIGHBORING NATIONS (says he)\r\nare naturally enemies of each other unless their common weakness forces\r\nthem to league in a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC, and their constitution\r\nprevents the differences that neighborhood occasions, extinguishing\r\nthat secret jealousy which disposes all states to aggrandize themselves\r\nat the expense of their neighbors.”[11] This passage, at the same time,\r\npoints out the EVIL and suggests the REMEDY.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] Aspasia, _vide_ Plutarch’s _Life of Pericles_.\r\n\r\n [2] _Ibid_.\r\n\r\n [3] _Ibid_.

It\r\nwould be a full answer to this question to say—precisely the same\r\ninducements which have, at different times, deluged in blood all the\r\nnations in the world. But, unfortunately for us, the question admits of\r\na more particular answer. There are causes of differences within our\r\nimmediate contemplation, of the tendency of which, even under the\r\nrestraints of a federal constitution, we have had sufficient experience\r\nto enable us to form a judgment of what might be expected if those\r\nrestraints were removed.\r\n\r\nTerritorial disputes have at all times been found one of the most\r\nfertile sources of hostility among nations. Perhaps the greatest\r\nproportion of wars that have desolated the earth have sprung from this\r\norigin. This cause would exist among us in full force. We have a vast\r\ntract of unsettled territory within the boundaries of the United\r\nStates. There still are discordant and undecided claims between several\r\nof them, and the dissolution of the Union would lay a foundation for\r\nsimilar claims between them all. It is well known that they have\r\nheretofore had serious and animated discussion concerning the rights to\r\nthe lands which were ungranted at the time of the Revolution, and which\r\nusually went under the name of crown lands. The States within the\r\nlimits of whose colonial governments they were comprised have claimed\r\nthem as their property, the others have contended that the rights of\r\nthe crown in this article devolved upon the Union; especially as to all\r\nthat part of the Western territory which, either by actual possession,\r\nor through the submission of the Indian proprietors, was subjected to\r\nthe jurisdiction of the king of Great Britain, till it was relinquished\r\nin the treaty of peace. This, it has been said, was at all events an\r\nacquisition to the Confederacy by compact with a foreign power. It has\r\nbeen the prudent policy of Congress to appease this controversy, by\r\nprevailing upon the States to make cessions to the United States for\r\nthe benefit of the whole. This has been so far accomplished as, under a\r\ncontinuation of the Union, to afford a decided prospect of an amicable\r\ntermination of the dispute. A dismemberment of the Confederacy,\r\nhowever, would revive this dispute, and would create others on the same\r\nsubject. At present, a large part of the vacant Western territory is,\r\nby cession at least, if not by any anterior right, the common property\r\nof the Union. If that were at an end, the States which made the\r\ncession, on a principle of federal compromise, would be apt when the\r\nmotive of the grant had ceased, to reclaim the lands as a reversion.\r\nThe other States would no doubt insist on a proportion, by right of\r\nrepresentation. Their argument would be, that a grant, once made, could\r\nnot be revoked; and that the justice of participating in territory\r\nacquired or secured by the joint efforts of the Confederacy, remained\r\nundiminished. If, contrary to probability, it should be admitted by all\r\nthe States, that each had a right to a share of this common stock,\r\nthere would still be a difficulty to be surmounted, as to a proper rule\r\nof apportionment. Different principles would be set up by different\r\nStates for this purpose; and as they would affect the opposite\r\ninterests of the parties, they might not easily be susceptible of a\r\npacific adjustment.\r\n\r\nIn the wide field of Western territory, therefore, we perceive an ample\r\ntheatre for hostile pretensions, without any umpire or common judge to\r\ninterpose between the contending parties. To reason from the past to\r\nthe future, we shall have good ground to apprehend, that the sword\r\nwould sometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of their differences. The\r\ncircumstances of the dispute between Connecticut and Pennsylvania,\r\nrespecting the land at Wyoming, admonish us not to be sanguine in\r\nexpecting an easy accommodation of such differences. The articles of\r\nconfederation obliged the parties to submit the matter to the decision\r\nof a federal court. The submission was made, and the court decided in\r\nfavor of Pennsylvania. But Connecticut gave strong indications of\r\ndissatisfaction with that determination; nor did she appear to be\r\nentirely resigned to it, till, by negotiation and management, something\r\nlike an equivalent was found for the loss she supposed herself to have\r\nsustained. Nothing here said is intended to convey the slightest\r\ncensure on the conduct of that State. She no doubt sincerely believed\r\nherself to have been injured by the decision; and States, like\r\nindividuals, acquiesce with great reluctance in determinations to their\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\nThose who had an opportunity of seeing the inside of the transactions\r\nwhich attended the progress of the controversy between this State and\r\nthe district of Vermont, can vouch the opposition we experienced, as\r\nwell from States not interested as from those which were interested in\r\nthe claim; and can attest the danger to which the peace of the\r\nConfederacy might have been exposed, had this State attempted to assert\r\nits rights by force. Two motives preponderated in that opposition: one,\r\na jealousy entertained of our future power; and the other, the interest\r\nof certain individuals of influence in the neighboring States, who had\r\nobtained grants of lands under the actual government of that district.\r\nEven the States which brought forward claims, in contradiction to ours,\r\nseemed more solicitous to dismember this State, than to establish their\r\nown pretensions. These were New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and\r\nConnecticut. New Jersey and Rhode Island, upon all occasions,\r\ndiscovered a warm zeal for the independence of Vermont; and Maryland,\r\ntill alarmed by the appearance of a connection between Canada and that\r\nState, entered deeply into the same views. These being small States,\r\nsaw with an unfriendly eye the perspective of our growing greatness. In\r\na review of these transactions we may trace some of the causes which\r\nwould be likely to embroil the States with each other, if it should be\r\ntheir unpropitious destiny to become disunited.\r\n\r\nThe competitions of commerce would be another fruitful source of\r\ncontention. The States less favorably circumstanced would be desirous\r\nof escaping from the disadvantages of local situation, and of sharing\r\nin the advantages of their more fortunate neighbors. Each State, or\r\nseparate confederacy, would pursue a system of commercial policy\r\npeculiar to itself. This would occasion distinctions, preferences, and\r\nexclusions, which would beget discontent. The habits of intercourse, on\r\nthe basis of equal privileges, to which we have been accustomed since\r\nthe earliest settlement of the country, would give a keener edge to\r\nthose causes of discontent than they would naturally have independent\r\nof this circumstance. WE SHOULD BE READY TO DENOMINATE INJURIES THOSE\r\nTHINGS WHICH WERE IN REALITY THE JUSTIFIABLE ACTS OF INDEPENDENT\r\nSOVEREIGNTIES CONSULTING A DISTINCT INTEREST. The spirit of enterprise,\r\nwhich characterizes the commercial part of America, has left no\r\noccasion of displaying itself unimproved. It is not at all probable\r\nthat this unbridled spirit would pay much respect to those regulations\r\nof trade by which particular States might endeavor to secure exclusive\r\nbenefits to their own citizens. The infractions of these regulations,\r\non one side, the efforts to prevent and repel them, on the other, would\r\nnaturally lead to outrages, and these to reprisals and wars.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities which some States would have of rendering others\r\ntributary to them by commercial regulations would be impatiently\r\nsubmitted to by the tributary States. The relative situation of New\r\nYork, Connecticut, and New Jersey would afford an example of this kind.\r\nNew York, from the necessities of revenue, must lay duties on her\r\nimportations. A great part of these duties must be paid by the\r\ninhabitants of the two other States in the capacity of consumers of\r\nwhat we import. New York would neither be willing nor able to forego\r\nthis advantage. Her citizens would not consent that a duty paid by them\r\nshould be remitted in favor of the citizens of her neighbors; nor would\r\nit be practicable, if there were not this impediment in the way, to\r\ndistinguish the customers in our own markets. Would Connecticut and New\r\nJersey long submit to be taxed by New York for her exclusive benefit?\r\nShould we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed\r\nenjoyment of a metropolis, from the possession of which we derived an\r\nadvantage so odious to our neighbors, and, in their opinion, so\r\noppressive? Should we be able to preserve it against the incumbent\r\nweight of Connecticut on the one side, and the co-operating pressure of\r\nNew Jersey on the other? These are questions that temerity alone will\r\nanswer in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nThe public debt of the Union would be a further cause of collision\r\nbetween the separate States or confederacies. The apportionment, in the\r\nfirst instance, and the progressive extinguishment afterward, would be\r\nalike productive of ill-humor and animosity. How would it be possible\r\nto agree upon a rule of apportionment satisfactory to all? There is\r\nscarcely any that can be proposed which is entirely free from real\r\nobjections. These, as usual, would be exaggerated by the adverse\r\ninterest of the parties. There are even dissimilar views among the\r\nStates as to the general principle of discharging the public debt. Some\r\nof them, either less impressed with the importance of national credit,\r\nor because their citizens have little, if any, immediate interest in\r\nthe question, feel an indifference, if not a repugnance, to the payment\r\nof the domestic debt at any rate. These would be inclined to magnify\r\nthe difficulties of a distribution. Others of them, a numerous body of\r\nwhose citizens are creditors to the public beyond proportion of the\r\nState in the total amount of the national debt, would be strenuous for\r\nsome equitable and effective provision. The procrastinations of the\r\nformer would excite the resentments of the latter. The settlement of a\r\nrule would, in the meantime, be postponed by real differences of\r\nopinion and affected delays. The citizens of the States interested\r\nwould clamour; foreign powers would urge for the satisfaction of their\r\njust demands, and the peace of the States would be hazarded to the\r\ndouble contingency of external invasion and internal contention.\r\n\r\nSuppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule surmounted, and the\r\napportionment made. Still there is great room to suppose that the rule\r\nagreed upon would, upon experiment, be found to bear harder upon some\r\nStates than upon others. Those which were sufferers by it would\r\nnaturally seek for a mitigation of the burden. The others would as\r\nnaturally be disinclined to a revision, which was likely to end in an\r\nincrease of their own incumbrances. Their refusal would be too\r\nplausible a pretext to the complaining States to withhold their\r\ncontributions, not to be embraced with avidity; and the non-compliance\r\nof these States with their engagements would be a ground of bitter\r\ndiscussion and altercation. If even the rule adopted should in practice\r\njustify the equality of its principle, still delinquencies in payments\r\non the part of some of the States would result from a diversity of\r\nother causes—the real deficiency of resources; the mismanagement of\r\ntheir finances; accidental disorders in the management of the\r\ngovernment; and, in addition to the rest, the reluctance with which men\r\ncommonly part with money for purposes that have outlived the exigencies\r\nwhich produced them, and interfere with the supply of immediate wants.\r\nDelinquencies, from whatever causes, would be productive of complaints,\r\nrecriminations, and quarrels. There is, perhaps, nothing more likely to\r\ndisturb the tranquillity of nations than their being bound to mutual\r\ncontributions for any common object that does not yield an equal and\r\ncoincident benefit. For it is an observation, as true as it is trite,\r\nthat there is nothing men differ so readily about as the payment of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nLaws in violation of private contracts, as they amount to aggressions\r\non the rights of those States whose citizens are injured by them, may\r\nbe considered as another probable source of hostility. We are not\r\nauthorized to expect that a more liberal or more equitable spirit would\r\npreside over the legislations of the individual States hereafter, if\r\nunrestrained by any additional checks, than we have heretofore seen in\r\ntoo many instances disgracing their several codes. We have observed the\r\ndisposition to retaliation excited in Connecticut in consequence of the\r\nenormities perpetrated by the Legislature of Rhode Island; and we\r\nreasonably infer that, in similar cases, under other circumstances, a\r\nwar, not of PARCHMENT, but of the sword, would chastise such atrocious\r\nbreaches of moral obligation and social justice.\r\n\r\nThe probability of incompatible alliances between the different States\r\nor confederacies and different foreign nations, and the effects of this\r\nsituation upon the peace of the whole, have been sufficiently unfolded\r\nin some preceding papers. From the view they have exhibited of this\r\npart of the subject, this conclusion is to be drawn, that America, if\r\nnot connected at all, or only by the feeble tie of a simple league,\r\noffensive and defensive, would, by the operation of such jarring\r\nalliances, be gradually entangled in all the pernicious labyrinths of\r\nEuropean politics and wars; and by the destructive contentions of the\r\nparts into which she was divided, would be likely to become a prey to\r\nthe artifices and machinations of powers equally the enemies of them\r\nall. _Divide et impera_[1] must be the motto of every nation that\r\neither hates or fears us.[2]\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] Divide and command.\r\n\r\n [2] In order that the whole subject of these papers may as soon as\r\n possible be laid before the public, it is proposed to publish them\r\n four times a week—on Tuesday in the New York Packet and on Thursday in\r\n the Daily Advertiser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. VIII.\r\n\r\nThe Consequences of Hostilities Between the States\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, November 20, 1787.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nAssuming it therefore as an established truth that the several States,\r\nin case of disunion, or such combinations of them as might happen to be\r\nformed out of the wreck of the general Confederacy, would be subject to\r\nthose vicissitudes of peace and war, of friendship and enmity, with\r\neach other, which have fallen to the lot of all neighboring nations not\r\nunited under one government, let us enter into a concise detail of some\r\nof the consequences that would attend such a situation.\r\n\r\nWar between the States, in the first period of their separate\r\nexistence, would be accompanied with much greater distresses than it\r\ncommonly is in those countries where regular military establishments\r\nhave long obtained. The disciplined armies always kept on foot on the\r\ncontinent of Europe, though they bear a malignant aspect to liberty and\r\neconomy, have, notwithstanding, been productive of the signal advantage\r\nof rendering sudden conquests impracticable, and of preventing that\r\nrapid desolation which used to mark the progress of war prior to their\r\nintroduction. The art of fortification has contributed to the same\r\nends. The nations of Europe are encircled with chains of fortified\r\nplaces, which mutually obstruct invasion. Campaigns are wasted in\r\nreducing two or three frontier garrisons, to gain admittance into an\r\nenemy’s country. Similar impediments occur at every step, to exhaust\r\nthe strength and delay the progress of an invader. Formerly, an\r\ninvading army would penetrate into the heart of a neighboring country\r\nalmost as soon as intelligence of its approach could be received; but\r\nnow a comparatively small force of disciplined troops, acting on the\r\ndefensive, with the aid of posts, is able to impede, and finally to\r\nfrustrate, the enterprises of one much more considerable. The history\r\nof war, in that quarter of the globe, is no longer a history of nations\r\nsubdued and empires overturned, but of towns taken and retaken; of\r\nbattles that decide nothing; of retreats more beneficial than\r\nvictories; of much effort and little acquisition.\r\n\r\nIn this country the scene would be altogether reversed. The jealousy of\r\nmilitary establishments would postpone them as long as possible. The\r\nwant of fortifications, leaving the frontiers of one state open to\r\nanother, would facilitate inroads. The populous States would, with\r\nlittle difficulty, overrun their less populous neighbors. Conquests\r\nwould be as easy to be made as difficult to be retained. War,\r\ntherefore, would be desultory and predatory. PLUNDER and devastation\r\never march in the train of irregulars. The calamities of individuals\r\nwould make the principal figure in the events which would characterize\r\nour military exploits.\r\n\r\nThis picture is not too highly wrought; though, I confess, it would not\r\nlong remain a just one. Safety from external danger is the most\r\npowerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty\r\nwill, after a time, give way to its dictates. The violent destruction\r\nof life and property incident to war, the continual effort and alarm\r\nattendant on a state of continual danger, will compel nations the most\r\nattached to liberty to resort for repose and security to institutions\r\nwhich have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights. To\r\nbe more safe, they at length become willing to run the risk of being\r\nless free.\r\n\r\nThe institutions chiefly alluded to are STANDING ARMIES and the\r\ncorrespondent appendages of military establishments. Standing armies,\r\nit is said, are not provided against in the new Constitution; and it is\r\ntherefore inferred that they may exist under it.[1] Their existence,\r\nhowever, from the very terms of the proposition, is, at most,\r\nproblematical and uncertain. But standing armies, it may be replied,\r\nmust inevitably result from a dissolution of the Confederacy. Frequent\r\nwar and constant apprehension, which require a state of as constant\r\npreparation, will infallibly produce them. The weaker States or\r\nconfederacies would first have recourse to them, to put themselves upon\r\nan equality with their more potent neighbors. They would endeavor to\r\nsupply the inferiority of population and resources by a more regular\r\nand effective system of defense, by disciplined troops, and by\r\nfortifications. They would, at the same time, be necessitated to\r\nstrengthen the executive arm of government, in doing which their\r\nconstitutions would acquire a progressive direction toward monarchy. It\r\nis of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the\r\nlegislative authority.\r\n\r\nThe expedients which have been mentioned would soon give the States or\r\nconfederacies that made use of them a superiority over their neighbors.\r\nSmall states, or states of less natural strength, under vigorous\r\ngovernments, and with the assistance of disciplined armies, have often\r\ntriumphed over large states, or states of greater natural strength,\r\nwhich have been destitute of these advantages. Neither the pride nor\r\nthe safety of the more important States or confederacies would permit\r\nthem long to submit to this mortifying and adventitious superiority.\r\nThey would quickly resort to means similar to those by which it had\r\nbeen effected, to reinstate themselves in their lost pre-eminence.\r\nThus, we should, in a little time, see established in every part of\r\nthis country the same engines of despotism which have been the scourge\r\nof the Old World. This, at least, would be the natural course of\r\nthings; and our reasonings will be the more likely to be just, in\r\nproportion as they are accommodated to this standard.\r\n\r\nThese are not vague inferences drawn from supposed or speculative\r\ndefects in a Constitution, the whole power of which is lodged in the\r\nhands of a people, or their representatives and delegates, but they are\r\nsolid conclusions, drawn from the natural and necessary progress of\r\nhuman affairs.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be asked, by way of objection to this, why did not\r\nstanding armies spring up out of the contentions which so often\r\ndistracted the ancient republics of Greece? Different answers, equally\r\nsatisfactory, may be given to this question. The industrious habits of\r\nthe people of the present day, absorbed in the pursuits of gain, and\r\ndevoted to the improvements of agriculture and commerce, are\r\nincompatible with the condition of a nation of soldiers, which was the\r\ntrue condition of the people of those republics. The means of revenue,\r\nwhich have been so greatly multiplied by the increase of gold and\r\nsilver and of the arts of industry, and the science of finance, which\r\nis the offspring of modern times, concurring with the habits of\r\nnations, have produced an entire revolution in the system of war, and\r\nhave rendered disciplined armies, distinct from the body of the\r\ncitizens, the inseparable companions of frequent hostility.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide difference, also, between military establishments in a\r\ncountry seldom exposed by its situation to internal invasions, and in\r\none which is often subject to them, and always apprehensive of them.\r\nThe rulers of the former can have a good pretext, if they are even so\r\ninclined, to keep on foot armies so numerous as must of necessity be\r\nmaintained in the latter. These armies being, in the first case,\r\nrarely, if at all, called into activity for interior defense, the\r\npeople are in no danger of being broken to military subordination. The\r\nlaws are not accustomed to relaxations, in favor of military\r\nexigencies; the civil state remains in full vigor, neither corrupted,\r\nnor confounded with the principles or propensities of the other state.\r\nThe smallness of the army renders the natural strength of the community\r\nan over-match for it; and the citizens, not habituated to look up to\r\nthe military power for protection, or to submit to its oppressions,\r\nneither love nor fear the soldiery; they view them with a spirit of\r\njealous acquiescence in a necessary evil, and stand ready to resist a\r\npower which they suppose may be exerted to the prejudice of their\r\nrights. The army under such circumstances may usefully aid the\r\nmagistrate to suppress a small faction, or an occasional mob, or\r\ninsurrection; but it will be unable to enforce encroachments against\r\nthe united efforts of the great body of the people.\r\n\r\nIn a country in the predicament last described, the contrary of all\r\nthis happens. The perpetual menacings of danger oblige the government\r\nto be always prepared to repel it; its armies must be numerous enough\r\nfor instant defense. The continual necessity for their services\r\nenhances the importance of the soldier, and proportionably degrades the\r\ncondition of the citizen. The military state becomes elevated above the\r\ncivil. The inhabitants of territories, often the theatre of war, are\r\nunavoidably subjected to frequent infringements on their rights, which\r\nserve to weaken their sense of those rights; and by degrees the people\r\nare brought to consider the soldiery not only as their protectors, but\r\nas their superiors. The transition from this disposition to that of\r\nconsidering them masters, is neither remote nor difficult; but it is\r\nvery difficult to prevail upon a people under such impressions, to make\r\na bold or effectual resistance to usurpations supported by the military\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Great Britain falls within the first description. An\r\ninsular situation, and a powerful marine, guarding it in a great\r\nmeasure against the possibility of foreign invasion, supersede the\r\nnecessity of a numerous army within the kingdom. A sufficient force to\r\nmake head against a sudden descent, till the militia could have time to\r\nrally and embody, is all that has been deemed requisite. No motive of\r\nnational policy has demanded, nor would public opinion have tolerated,\r\na larger number of troops upon its domestic establishment. There has\r\nbeen, for a long time past, little room for the operation of the other\r\ncauses, which have been enumerated as the consequences of internal war.\r\nThis peculiar felicity of situation has, in a great degree, contributed\r\nto preserve the liberty which that country to this day enjoys, in spite\r\nof the prevalent venality and corruption. If, on the contrary, Britain\r\nhad been situated on the continent, and had been compelled, as she\r\nwould have been, by that situation, to make her military establishments\r\nat home coextensive with those of the other great powers of Europe,\r\nshe, like them, would in all probability be, at this day, a victim to\r\nthe absolute power of a single man. ’T is possible, though not easy,\r\nthat the people of that island may be enslaved from other causes; but\r\nit cannot be by the prowess of an army so inconsiderable as that which\r\nhas been usually kept up within the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIf we are wise enough to preserve the Union we may for ages enjoy an\r\nadvantage similar to that of an insulated situation. Europe is at a\r\ngreat distance from us. Her colonies in our vicinity will be likely to\r\ncontinue too much disproportioned in strength to be able to give us any\r\ndangerous annoyance. Extensive military establishments cannot, in this\r\nposition, be necessary to our security. But if we should be disunited,\r\nand the integral parts should either remain separated, or, which is\r\nmost probable, should be thrown together into two or three\r\nconfederacies, we should be, in a short course of time, in the\r\npredicament of the continental powers of Europe —our liberties would be\r\na prey to the means of defending ourselves against the ambition and\r\njealousy of each other.\r\n\r\nThis is an idea not superficial or futile, but solid and weighty. It\r\ndeserves the most serious and mature consideration of every prudent and\r\nhonest man of whatever party. If such men will make a firm and solemn\r\npause, and meditate dispassionately on the importance of this\r\ninteresting idea; if they will contemplate it in all its attitudes, and\r\ntrace it to all its consequences, they will not hesitate to part with\r\ntrivial objections to a Constitution, the rejection of which would in\r\nall probability put a final period to the Union. The airy phantoms that\r\nflit before the distempered imaginations of some of its adversaries\r\nwould quickly give place to the more substantial forms of dangers,\r\nreal, certain, and formidable.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] This objection will be fully examined in its proper place, and it\r\n will be shown that the only natural precaution which could have been\r\n taken on this subject has been taken; and a much better one than is to\r\n be found in any constitution that has been heretofore framed in\r\n America, most of which contain no guard at all on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. IX.\r\n\r\nThe Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nA firm Union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of\r\nthe States, as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection. It\r\nis impossible to read the history of the petty republics of Greece and\r\nItaly without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the\r\ndistractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the\r\nrapid succession of revolutions by which they were kept in a state of\r\nperpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy. If\r\nthey exhibit occasional calms, these only serve as short-lived contrast\r\nto the furious storms that are to succeed. If now and then intervals of\r\nfelicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising\r\nfrom the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be\r\noverwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If\r\nmomentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle\r\nus with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time\r\nadmonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the\r\ndirection and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted\r\nendowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so\r\njustly celebrated.\r\n\r\nFrom the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics the\r\nadvocates of despotism have drawn arguments, not only against the forms\r\nof republican government, but against the very principles of civil\r\nliberty. They have decried all free government as inconsistent with the\r\norder of society, and have indulged themselves in malicious exultation\r\nover its friends and partisans. Happily for mankind, stupendous fabrics\r\nreared on the basis of liberty, which have flourished for ages, have,\r\nin a few glorious instances, refuted their gloomy sophisms. And, I\r\ntrust, America will be the broad and solid foundation of other\r\nedifices, not less magnificent, which will be equally permanent\r\nmonuments of their errors.\r\n\r\nBut it is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched of\r\nrepublican government were too just copies of the originals from which\r\nthey were taken. If it had been found impracticable to have devised\r\nmodels of a more perfect structure, the enlightened friends to liberty\r\nwould have been obliged to abandon the cause of that species of\r\ngovernment as indefensible. The science of politics, however, like most\r\nother sciences, has received great improvement. The efficacy of various\r\nprinciples is now well understood, which were either not known at all,\r\nor imperfectly known to the ancients. The regular distribution of power\r\ninto distinct departments; the introduction of legislative balances and\r\nchecks; the institution of courts composed of judges holding their\r\noffices during good behavior; the representation of the people in the\r\nlegislature by deputies of their own election: these are wholly new\r\ndiscoveries, or have made their principal progress towards perfection\r\nin modern times. They are means, and powerful means, by which the\r\nexcellences of republican government may be retained and its\r\nimperfections lessened or avoided. To this catalogue of circumstances\r\nthat tend to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government, I\r\nshall venture, however novel it may appear to some, to add one more, on\r\na principle which has been made the foundation of an objection to the\r\nnew Constitution; I mean the ENLARGEMENT of the ORBIT within which such\r\nsystems are to revolve, either in respect to the dimensions of a single\r\nState or to the consolidation of several smaller States into one great\r\nConfederacy. The latter is that which immediately concerns the object\r\nunder consideration. It will, however, be of use to examine the\r\nprinciple in its application to a single State, which shall be attended\r\nto in another place.\r\n\r\nThe utility of a Confederacy, as well to suppress faction and to guard\r\nthe internal tranquillity of States, as to increase their external\r\nforce and security, is in reality not a new idea. It has been practiced\r\nupon in different countries and ages, and has received the sanction of\r\nthe most approved writers on the subject of politics. The opponents of\r\nthe plan proposed have, with great assiduity, cited and circulated the\r\nobservations of Montesquieu on the necessity of a contracted territory\r\nfor a republican government. But they seem not to have been apprised of\r\nthe sentiments of that great man expressed in another part of his work,\r\nnor to have adverted to the consequences of the principle to which they\r\nsubscribe with such ready acquiescence.\r\n\r\nWhen Montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics, the standards\r\nhe had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits of almost\r\nevery one of these States. Neither Virginia, Massachusetts,\r\nPennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, nor Georgia can by any means be\r\ncompared with the models from which he reasoned and to which the terms\r\nof his description apply. If we therefore take his ideas on this point\r\nas the criterion of truth, we shall be driven to the alternative either\r\nof taking refuge at once in the arms of monarchy, or of splitting\r\nourselves into an infinity of little, jealous, clashing, tumultuous\r\ncommonwealths, the wretched nurseries of unceasing discord, and the\r\nmiserable objects of universal pity or contempt. Some of the writers\r\nwho have come forward on the other side of the question seem to have\r\nbeen aware of the dilemma; and have even been bold enough to hint at\r\nthe division of the larger States as a desirable thing. Such an\r\ninfatuated policy, such a desperate expedient, might, by the\r\nmultiplication of petty offices, answer the views of men who possess\r\nnot qualifications to extend their influence beyond the narrow circles\r\nof personal intrigue, but it could never promote the greatness or\r\nhappiness of the people of America.\r\n\r\nReferring the examination of the principle itself to another place, as\r\nhas been already mentioned, it will be sufficient to remark here that,\r\nin the sense of the author who has been most emphatically quoted upon\r\nthe occasion, it would only dictate a reduction of the SIZE of the more\r\nconsiderable MEMBERS of the Union, but would not militate against their\r\nbeing all comprehended in one confederate government. And this is the\r\ntrue question, in the discussion of which we are at present interested.\r\n\r\nSo far are the suggestions of Montesquieu from standing in opposition\r\nto a general Union of the States, that he explicitly treats of a\r\nCONFEDERATE REPUBLIC as the expedient for extending the sphere of\r\npopular government, and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with\r\nthose of republicanism.\r\n\r\n“It is very probable,” (says he[1]) “that mankind would have been\r\nobliged at length to live constantly under the government of a single\r\nperson, had they not contrived a kind of constitution that has all the\r\ninternal advantages of a republican, together with the external force\r\nof a monarchical government. I mean a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n“This form of government is a convention by which several smaller\r\nSTATES agree to become members of a larger ONE, which they intend to\r\nform. It is a kind of assemblage of societies that constitute a new\r\none, capable of increasing, by means of new associations, till they\r\narrive to such a degree of power as to be able to provide for the\r\nsecurity of the united body.\r\n\r\n“A republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force, may\r\nsupport itself without any internal corruptions. The form of this\r\nsociety prevents all manner of inconveniences.\r\n\r\n“If a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme authority, he\r\ncould not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit in all the\r\nconfederate states. Were he to have too great influence over one, this\r\nwould alarm the rest. Were he to subdue a part, that which would still\r\nremain free might oppose him with forces independent of those which he\r\nhad usurped and overpower him before he could be settled in his\r\nusurpation.\r\n\r\n“Should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate states\r\nthe others are able to quell it. Should abuses creep into one part,\r\nthey are reformed by those that remain sound. The state may be\r\ndestroyed on one side, and not on the other; the confederacy may be\r\ndissolved, and the confederates preserve their sovereignty.\r\n\r\n“As this government is composed of small republics, it enjoys the\r\ninternal happiness of each; and with respect to its external situation,\r\nit is possessed, by means of the association, of all the advantages of\r\nlarge monarchies.”\r\n\r\nI have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting passages,\r\nbecause they contain a luminous abridgment of the principal arguments\r\nin favor of the Union, and must effectually remove the false\r\nimpressions which a misapplication of other parts of the work was\r\ncalculated to make. They have, at the same time, an intimate connection\r\nwith the more immediate design of this paper; which is, to illustrate\r\nthe tendency of the Union to repress domestic faction and insurrection.\r\n\r\nA distinction, more subtle than accurate, has been raised between a\r\nCONFEDERACY and a CONSOLIDATION of the States. The essential\r\ncharacteristic of the first is said to be, the restriction of its\r\nauthority to the members in their collective capacities, without\r\nreaching to the individuals of whom they are composed. It is contended\r\nthat the national council ought to have no concern with any object of\r\ninternal administration. An exact equality of suffrage between the\r\nmembers has also been insisted upon as a leading feature of a\r\nconfederate government. These positions are, in the main, arbitrary;\r\nthey are supported neither by principle nor precedent. It has indeed\r\nhappened, that governments of this kind have generally operated in the\r\nmanner which the distinction taken notice of, supposes to be inherent\r\nin their nature; but there have been in most of them extensive\r\nexceptions to the practice, which serve to prove, as far as example\r\nwill go, that there is no absolute rule on the subject. And it will be\r\nclearly shown in the course of this investigation that as far as the\r\nprinciple contended for has prevailed, it has been the cause of\r\nincurable disorder and imbecility in the government.\r\n\r\nThe definition of a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC seems simply to be “an\r\nassemblage of societies,” or an association of two or more states into\r\none state. The extent, modifications, and objects of the federal\r\nauthority are mere matters of discretion. So long as the separate\r\norganization of the members be not abolished; so long as it exists, by\r\na constitutional necessity, for local purposes; though it should be in\r\nperfect subordination to the general authority of the union, it would\r\nstill be, in fact and in theory, an association of states, or a\r\nconfederacy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an\r\nabolition of the State governments, makes them constituent parts of the\r\nnational sovereignty, by allowing them a direct representation in the\r\nSenate, and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very\r\nimportant portions of sovereign power. This fully corresponds, in every\r\nrational import of the terms, with the idea of a federal government.\r\n\r\nIn the Lycian confederacy, which consisted of twenty-three CITIES or\r\nrepublics, the largest were entitled to THREE votes in the COMMON\r\nCOUNCIL, those of the middle class to TWO, and the smallest to ONE. The\r\nCOMMON COUNCIL had the appointment of all the judges and magistrates of\r\nthe respective CITIES. This was certainly the most, delicate species of\r\ninterference in their internal administration; for if there be any\r\nthing that seems exclusively appropriated to the local jurisdictions,\r\nit is the appointment of their own officers. Yet Montesquieu, speaking\r\nof this association, says: “Were I to give a model of an excellent\r\nConfederate Republic, it would be that of Lycia.” Thus we perceive that\r\nthe distinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of\r\nthis enlightened civilian; and we shall be led to conclude, that they\r\nare the novel refinements of an erroneous theory.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] _Spirit of Laws_, vol. i., book ix., chap. i.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. X.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, November 23, 1787.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous advantages promised by a wellconstructed Union, none\r\ndeserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and\r\ncontrol the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments\r\nnever finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as\r\nwhen he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will\r\nnot fail, therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without\r\nviolating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper\r\ncure for it. The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into\r\nthe public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under\r\nwhich popular governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to\r\nbe the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to\r\nliberty derive their most specious declamations. The valuable\r\nimprovements made by the American constitutions on the popular models,\r\nboth ancient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it\r\nwould be an unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as\r\neffectually obviated the danger on this side, as was wished and\r\nexpected. Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and\r\nvirtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and\r\nof public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable,\r\nthat the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties,\r\nand that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of\r\njustice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of\r\nan interested and overbearing majority. However anxiously we may wish\r\nthat these complaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts\r\nwill not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will\r\nbe found, indeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the\r\ndistresses under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the\r\noperation of our governments; but it will be found, at the same time,\r\nthat other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest\r\nmisfortunes; and, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing\r\ndistrust of public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are\r\nechoed from one end of the continent to the other. These must be\r\nchiefly, if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with\r\nwhich a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations.\r\n\r\nBy a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a\r\nmajority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by\r\nsome common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights\r\nof other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by\r\nremoving its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.\r\n\r\nThere are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one,\r\nby destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the\r\nother, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions,\r\nand the same interests.\r\n\r\nIt could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was\r\nworse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an\r\naliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less\r\nfolly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because\r\nit nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air,\r\nwhich is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its\r\ndestructive agency.\r\n\r\nThe second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise.\r\nAs long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty\r\nto exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the\r\nconnection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions\r\nand his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and\r\nthe former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves.\r\nThe diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of\r\nproperty originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity\r\nof interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of\r\ngovernment. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of\r\nacquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of\r\nproperty immediately results; and from the influence of these on the\r\nsentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division\r\nof the society into different interests and parties.\r\n\r\nThe latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we\r\nsee them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity,\r\naccording to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for\r\ndifferent opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many\r\nother points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to\r\ndifferent leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or\r\nto persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting\r\nto the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties,\r\ninflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more\r\ndisposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their\r\ncommon good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into\r\nmutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself,\r\nthe most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to\r\nkindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent\r\nconflicts. But the most common and durable source of factions has been\r\nthe various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and\r\nthose who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in\r\nsociety. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under\r\na like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a\r\nmercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests,\r\ngrow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into\r\ndifferent classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The\r\nregulation of these various and interfering interests forms the\r\nprincipal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party\r\nand faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.\r\n\r\nNo man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest\r\nwould certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his\r\nintegrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit\r\nto be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of\r\nthe most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial\r\ndeterminations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but\r\nconcerning the rights of large bodies of citizens? And what are the\r\ndifferent classes of legislators but advocates and parties to the\r\ncauses which they determine? Is a law proposed concerning private\r\ndebts? It is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side\r\nand the debtors on the other. Justice ought to hold the balance between\r\nthem. Yet the parties are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the\r\nmost numerous party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction must\r\nbe expected to prevail. Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and\r\nin what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions\r\nwhich would be differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing\r\nclasses, and probably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the\r\npublic good. The apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of\r\nproperty is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality;\r\nyet there is, perhaps, no legislative act in which greater opportunity\r\nand temptation are given to a predominant party to trample on the rules\r\nof justice. Every shilling with which they overburden the inferior\r\nnumber, is a shilling saved to their own pockets.\r\n\r\nIt is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust\r\nthese clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public\r\ngood. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in\r\nmany cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into\r\nview indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over\r\nthe immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the\r\nrights of another or the good of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction\r\ncannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of\r\ncontrolling its EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nIf a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by\r\nthe republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its\r\nsinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may\r\nconvulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its\r\nviolence under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is\r\nincluded in a faction, the form of popular government, on the other\r\nhand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both\r\nthe public good and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public\r\ngood and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at\r\nthe same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular\r\ngovernment, is then the great object to which our inquiries are\r\ndirected. Let me add that it is the great desideratum by which this\r\nform of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it\r\nhas so long labored, and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nBy what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only.\r\nEither the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at\r\nthe same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such\r\ncoexistent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and\r\nlocal situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of\r\noppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide,\r\nwe well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on\r\nas an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice\r\nand violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy in proportion to\r\nthe number combined together, that is, in proportion as their efficacy\r\nbecomes needful.\r\n\r\nFrom this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure\r\ndemocracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of\r\ncitizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can\r\nadmit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or\r\ninterest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the\r\nwhole; a communication and concert result from the form of government\r\nitself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the\r\nweaker party or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such\r\ndemocracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention;\r\nhave ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights\r\nof property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they\r\nhave been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have\r\npatronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that\r\nby reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights,\r\nthey would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in\r\ntheir possessions, their opinions, and their passions.\r\n\r\nA republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of\r\nrepresentation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises\r\nthe cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which\r\nit varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature\r\nof the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.\r\n\r\nThe two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic\r\nare: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small\r\nnumber of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of\r\ncitizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and\r\nenlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a\r\nchosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true\r\ninterest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice\r\nwill be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial\r\nconsiderations. Under such a regulation, it may well happen that the\r\npublic voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be\r\nmore consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people\r\nthemselves, convened for the purpose. On the other hand, the effect may\r\nbe inverted. Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of\r\nsinister designs, may, by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means,\r\nfirst obtain the suffrages, and then betray the interests, of the\r\npeople. The question resulting is, whether small or extensive republics\r\nare more favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public\r\nweal; and it is clearly decided in favor of the latter by two obvious\r\nconsiderations:\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the\r\nrepublic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain\r\nnumber, in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that,\r\nhowever large it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in\r\norder to guard against the confusion of a multitude. Hence, the number\r\nof representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of\r\nthe two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small\r\nrepublic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not\r\nless in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a\r\ngreater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater\r\nnumber of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be\r\nmore difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the\r\nvicious arts by which elections are too often carried; and the\r\nsuffrages of the people being more free, will be more likely to centre\r\nin men who possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and\r\nestablished characters.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a\r\nmean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie. By\r\nenlarging too much the number of electors, you render the\r\nrepresentatives too little acquainted with all their local\r\ncircumstances and lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you\r\nrender him unduly attached to these, and too little fit to comprehend\r\nand pursue great and national objects. The federal Constitution forms a\r\nhappy combination in this respect; the great and aggregate interests\r\nbeing referred to the national, the local and particular to the State\r\nlegislatures.\r\n\r\nThe other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens and\r\nextent of territory which may be brought within the compass of\r\nrepublican than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance\r\nprincipally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in\r\nthe former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer\r\nprobably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the\r\nfewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a\r\nmajority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of\r\nindividuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within\r\nwhich they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute\r\ntheir plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater\r\nvariety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a\r\nmajority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of\r\nother citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more\r\ndifficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to\r\nact in unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be\r\nremarked that, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable\r\npurposes, communication is always checked by distrust in proportion to\r\nthe number whose concurrence is necessary.\r\n\r\nHence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has\r\nover a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by\r\na large over a small republic,—is enjoyed by the Union over the States\r\ncomposing it. Does the advantage consist in the substitution of\r\nrepresentatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render\r\nthem superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice? It will not\r\nbe denied that the representation of the Union will be most likely to\r\npossess these requisite endowments. Does it consist in the greater\r\nsecurity afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of\r\nany one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal\r\ndegree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the\r\nUnion, increase this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater\r\nobstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret\r\nwishes of an unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of\r\nthe Union gives it the most palpable advantage.\r\n\r\nThe influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their\r\nparticular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration\r\nthrough the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a\r\npolitical faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of\r\nsects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national\r\ncouncils against any danger from that source. A rage for paper money,\r\nfor an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for\r\nany other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the\r\nwhole body of the Union than a particular member of it; in the same\r\nproportion as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular county\r\nor district, than an entire State.\r\n\r\nIn the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold a\r\nrepublican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican\r\ngovernment. And according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel\r\nin being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and\r\nsupporting the character of Federalists.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XI.\r\n\r\nThe Utility of the Union in Respect to Commercial Relations and a Navy\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Union, in a commercial light, is one of those\r\npoints about which there is least room to entertain a difference of\r\nopinion, and which has, in fact, commanded the most general assent of\r\nmen who have any acquaintance with the subject. This applies as well to\r\nour intercourse with foreign countries as with each other.\r\n\r\nThere are appearances to authorize a supposition that the adventurous\r\nspirit, which distinguishes the commercial character of America, has\r\nalready excited uneasy sensations in several of the maritime powers of\r\nEurope. They seem to be apprehensive of our too great interference in\r\nthat carrying trade, which is the support of their navigation and the\r\nfoundation of their naval strength. Those of them which have colonies\r\nin America look forward to what this country is capable of becoming,\r\nwith painful solicitude. They foresee the dangers that may threaten\r\ntheir American dominions from the neighborhood of States, which have\r\nall the dispositions, and would possess all the means, requisite to the\r\ncreation of a powerful marine. Impressions of this kind will naturally\r\nindicate the policy of fostering divisions among us, and of depriving\r\nus, as far as possible, of an ACTIVE COMMERCE in our own bottoms. This\r\nwould answer the threefold purpose of preventing our interference in\r\ntheir navigation, of monopolizing the profits of our trade, and of\r\nclipping the wings by which we might soar to a dangerous greatness. Did\r\nnot prudence forbid the detail, it would not be difficult to trace, by\r\nfacts, the workings of this policy to the cabinets of ministers.\r\n\r\nIf we continue united, we may counteract a policy so unfriendly to our\r\nprosperity in a variety of ways. By prohibitory regulations, extending,\r\nat the same time, throughout the States, we may oblige foreign\r\ncountries to bid against each other, for the privileges of our markets.\r\nThis assertion will not appear chimerical to those who are able to\r\nappreciate the importance of the markets of three millions of\r\npeople—increasing in rapid progression, for the most part exclusively\r\naddicted to agriculture, and likely from local circumstances to remain\r\nso—to any manufacturing nation; and the immense difference there would\r\nbe to the trade and navigation of such a nation, between a direct\r\ncommunication in its own ships, and an indirect conveyance of its\r\nproducts and returns, to and from America, in the ships of another\r\ncountry. Suppose, for instance, we had a government in America, capable\r\nof excluding Great Britain (with whom we have at present no treaty of\r\ncommerce) from all our ports; what would be the probable operation of\r\nthis step upon her politics? Would it not enable us to negotiate, with\r\nthe fairest prospect of success, for commercial privileges of the most\r\nvaluable and extensive kind, in the dominions of that kingdom? When\r\nthese questions have been asked, upon other occasions, they have\r\nreceived a plausible, but not a solid or satisfactory answer. It has\r\nbeen said that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the\r\nsystem of Britain, because she could prosecute her trade with us\r\nthrough the medium of the Dutch, who would be her immediate customers\r\nand paymasters for those articles which were wanted for the supply of\r\nour markets. But would not her navigation be materially injured by the\r\nloss of the important advantage of being her own carrier in that trade?\r\nWould not the principal part of its profits be intercepted by the\r\nDutch, as a compensation for their agency and risk? Would not the mere\r\ncircumstance of freight occasion a considerable deduction? Would not so\r\ncircuitous an intercourse facilitate the competitions of other nations,\r\nby enhancing the price of British commodities in our markets, and by\r\ntransferring to other hands the management of this interesting branch\r\nof the British commerce?\r\n\r\nA mature consideration of the objects suggested by these questions will\r\njustify a belief that the real disadvantages to Britain from such a\r\nstate of things, conspiring with the pre-possessions of a great part of\r\nthe nation in favor of the American trade, and with the importunities\r\nof the West India islands, would produce a relaxation in her present\r\nsystem, and would let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the\r\nmarkets of those islands elsewhere, from which our trade would derive\r\nthe most substantial benefits. Such a point gained from the British\r\ngovernment, and which could not be expected without an equivalent in\r\nexemptions and immunities in our markets, would be likely to have a\r\ncorrespondent effect on the conduct of other nations, who would not be\r\ninclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in our trade.\r\n\r\nA further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations\r\ntoward us, in this respect, would arise from the establishment of a\r\nfederal navy. There can be no doubt that the continuance of the Union\r\nunder an efficient government would put it in our power, at a period\r\nnot very distant, to create a navy which, if it could not vie with\r\nthose of the great maritime powers, would at least be of respectable\r\nweight if thrown into the scale of either of two contending parties.\r\nThis would be more peculiarly the case in relation to operations in the\r\nWest Indies. A few ships of the line, sent opportunely to the\r\nreinforcement of either side, would often be sufficient to decide the\r\nfate of a campaign, on the event of which interests of the greatest\r\nmagnitude were suspended. Our position is, in this respect, a most\r\ncommanding one. And if to this consideration we add that of the\r\nusefulness of supplies from this country, in the prosecution of\r\nmilitary operations in the West Indies, it will readily be perceived\r\nthat a situation so favorable would enable us to bargain with great\r\nadvantage for commercial privileges. A price would be set not only upon\r\nour friendship, but upon our neutrality. By a steady adherence to the\r\nUnion we may hope, erelong, to become the arbiter of Europe in America,\r\nand to be able to incline the balance of European competitions in this\r\npart of the world as our interest may dictate.\r\n\r\nBut in the reverse of this eligible situation, we shall discover that\r\nthe rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each other, and\r\nwould frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature has kindly\r\nplaced within our reach. In a state so insignificant our commerce would\r\nbe a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each\r\nother; who, having nothing to fear from us, would with little scruple\r\nor remorse, supply their wants by depredations on our property as often\r\nas it fell in their way. The rights of neutrality will only be\r\nrespected when they are defended by an adequate power. A nation,\r\ndespicable by its weakness, forfeits even the privilege of being\r\nneutral.\r\n\r\nUnder a vigorous national government, the natural strength and\r\nresources of the country, directed to a common interest, would baffle\r\nall the combinations of European jealousy to restrain our growth. This\r\nsituation would even take away the motive to such combinations, by\r\ninducing an impracticability of success. An active commerce, an\r\nextensive navigation, and a flourishing marine would then be the\r\noffspring of moral and physical necessity. We might defy the little\r\narts of the little politicians to control or vary the irresistible and\r\nunchangeable course of nature.\r\n\r\nBut in a state of disunion, these combinations might exist and might\r\noperate with success. It would be in the power of the maritime nations,\r\navailing themselves of our universal impotence, to prescribe the\r\nconditions of our political existence; and as they have a common\r\ninterest in being our carriers, and still more in preventing our\r\nbecoming theirs, they would in all probability combine to embarrass our\r\nnavigation in such a manner as would in effect destroy it, and confine\r\nus to a PASSIVE COMMERCE. We should then be compelled to content\r\nourselves with the first price of our commodities, and to see the\r\nprofits of our trade snatched from us to enrich our enemies and\r\npersecutors. That unequaled spirit of enterprise, which signalizes the\r\ngenius of the American merchants and navigators, and which is in itself\r\nan inexhaustible mine of national wealth, would be stifled and lost,\r\nand poverty and disgrace would overspread a country which, with wisdom,\r\nmight make herself the admiration and envy of the world.\r\n\r\nThere are rights of great moment to the trade of America which are\r\nrights of the Union—I allude to the fisheries, to the navigation of the\r\nWestern lakes, and to that of the Mississippi. The dissolution of the\r\nConfederacy would give room for delicate questions concerning the\r\nfuture existence of these rights; which the interest of more powerful\r\npartners would hardly fail to solve to our disadvantage. The\r\ndisposition of Spain with regard to the Mississippi needs no comment.\r\nFrance and Britain are concerned with us in the fisheries, and view\r\nthem as of the utmost moment to their navigation. They, of course,\r\nwould hardly remain long indifferent to that decided mastery, of which\r\nexperience has shown us to be possessed in this valuable branch of\r\ntraffic, and by which we are able to undersell those nations in their\r\nown markets. What more natural than that they should be disposed to\r\nexclude from the lists such dangerous competitors?\r\n\r\nThis branch of trade ought not to be considered as a partial benefit.\r\nAll the navigating States may, in different degrees, advantageously\r\nparticipate in it, and under circumstances of a greater extension of\r\nmercantile capital, would not be unlikely to do it. As a nursery of\r\nseamen, it now is, or when time shall have more nearly assimilated the\r\nprinciples of navigation in the several States, will become, a\r\nuniversal resource. To the establishment of a navy, it must be\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nTo this great national object, a NAVY, union will contribute in various\r\nways. Every institution will grow and flourish in proportion to the\r\nquantity and extent of the means concentred towards its formation and\r\nsupport. A navy of the United States, as it would embrace the resources\r\nof all, is an object far less remote than a navy of any single State or\r\npartial confederacy, which would only embrace the resources of a single\r\npart. It happens, indeed, that different portions of confederated\r\nAmerica possess each some peculiar advantage for this essential\r\nestablishment. The more southern States furnish in greater abundance\r\ncertain kinds of naval stores—tar, pitch, and turpentine. Their wood\r\nfor the construction of ships is also of a more solid and lasting\r\ntexture. The difference in the duration of the ships of which the navy\r\nmight be composed, if chiefly constructed of Southern wood, would be of\r\nsignal importance, either in the view of naval strength or of national\r\neconomy. Some of the Southern and of the Middle States yield a greater\r\nplenty of iron, and of better quality. Seamen must chiefly be drawn\r\nfrom the Northern hive. The necessity of naval protection to external\r\nor maritime commerce does not require a particular elucidation, no more\r\nthan the conduciveness of that species of commerce to the prosperity of\r\na navy.\r\n\r\nAn unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will advance\r\nthe trade of each by an interchange of their respective productions,\r\nnot only for the supply of reciprocal wants at home, but for\r\nexportation to foreign markets. The veins of commerce in every part\r\nwill be replenished, and will acquire additional motion and vigor from\r\na free circulation of the commodities of every part. Commercial\r\nenterprise will have much greater scope, from the diversity in the\r\nproductions of different States. When the staple of one fails from a\r\nbad harvest or unproductive crop, it can call to its aid the staple of\r\nanother. The variety, not less than the value, of products for\r\nexportation contributes to the activity of foreign commerce. It can be\r\nconducted upon much better terms with a large number of materials of a\r\ngiven value than with a small number of materials of the same value;\r\narising from the competitions of trade and from the fluctations of\r\nmarkets. Particular articles may be in great demand at certain periods,\r\nand unsalable at others; but if there be a variety of articles, it can\r\nscarcely happen that they should all be at one time in the latter\r\npredicament, and on this account the operations of the merchant would\r\nbe less liable to any considerable obstruction or stagnation. The\r\nspeculative trader will at once perceive the force of these\r\nobservations, and will acknowledge that the aggregate balance of the\r\ncommerce of the United States would bid fair to be much more favorable\r\nthan that of the thirteen States without union or with partial unions.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be replied to this, that whether the States are united\r\nor disunited, there would still be an intimate intercourse between them\r\nwhich would answer the same ends; this intercourse would be fettered,\r\ninterrupted, and narrowed by a multiplicity of causes, which in the\r\ncourse of these papers have been amply detailed. A unity of commercial,\r\nas well as political, interests, can only result from a unity of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThere are other points of view in which this subject might be placed,\r\nof a striking and animating kind. But they would lead us too far into\r\nthe regions of futurity, and would involve topics not proper for a\r\nnewspaper discussion. I shall briefly observe, that our situation\r\ninvites and our interests prompt us to aim at an ascendant in the\r\nsystem of American affairs. The world may politically, as well as\r\ngeographically, be divided into four parts, each having a distinct set\r\nof interests. Unhappily for the other three, Europe, by her arms and by\r\nher negotiations, by force and by fraud, has, in different degrees,\r\nextended her dominion over them all. Africa, Asia, and America, have\r\nsuccessively felt her domination. The superiority she has long\r\nmaintained has tempted her to plume herself as the Mistress of the\r\nWorld, and to consider the rest of mankind as created for her benefit.\r\nMen admired as profound philosophers have, in direct terms, attributed\r\nto her inhabitants a physical superiority, and have gravely asserted\r\nthat all animals, and with them the human species, degenerate in\r\nAmerica—that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed awhile in\r\nour atmosphere.[1] Facts have too long supported these arrogant\r\npretensions of the Europeans. It belongs to us to vindicate the honor\r\nof the human race, and to teach that assuming brother, moderation.\r\nUnion will enable us to do it. Disunion will will add another victim to\r\nhis triumphs. Let Americans disdain to be the instruments of European\r\ngreatness! Let the thirteen States, bound together in a strict and\r\nindissoluble Union, concur in erecting one great American system,\r\nsuperior to the control of all transatlantic force or influence, and\r\nable to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and the new\r\nworld!\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] “Recherches philosophiques sur les Américains.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XII.\r\n\r\nThe Utility of the Union In Respect to Revenue\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, November 27, 1787.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe effects of Union upon the commercial prosperity of the States have\r\nbeen sufficiently delineated. Its tendency to promote the interests of\r\nrevenue will be the subject of our present inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by all\r\nenlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most\r\nproductive source of national wealth, and has accordingly become a\r\nprimary object of their political cares. By multiplying the means of\r\ngratification, by promoting the introduction and circulation of the\r\nprecious metals, those darling objects of human avarice and enterprise,\r\nit serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of industry, and to\r\nmake them flow with greater activity and copiousness. The assiduous\r\nmerchant, the laborious husbandman, the active mechanic, and the\r\nindustrious manufacturer,—all orders of men, look forward with eager\r\nexpectation and growing alacrity to this pleasing reward of their\r\ntoils. The often-agitated question between agriculture and commerce\r\nhas, from indubitable experience, received a decision which has\r\nsilenced the rivalship that once subsisted between them, and has\r\nproved, to the satisfaction of their friends, that their interests are\r\nintimately blended and interwoven. It has been found in various\r\ncountries that, in proportion as commerce has flourished, land has\r\nrisen in value. And how could it have happened otherwise? Could that\r\nwhich procures a freer vent for the products of the earth, which\r\nfurnishes new incitements to the cultivation of land, which is the most\r\npowerful instrument in increasing the quantity of money in a\r\nstate—could that, in fine, which is the faithful handmaid of labor and\r\nindustry, in every shape, fail to augment that article, which is the\r\nprolific parent of far the greatest part of the objects upon which they\r\nare exerted? It is astonishing that so simple a truth should ever have\r\nhad an adversary; and it is one, among a multitude of proofs, how apt a\r\nspirit of ill-informed jealousy, or of too great abstraction and\r\nrefinement, is to lead men astray from the plainest truths of reason\r\nand conviction.\r\n\r\nThe ability of a country to pay taxes must always be proportioned, in a\r\ngreat degree, to the quantity of money in circulation, and to the\r\ncelerity with which it circulates. Commerce, contributing to both these\r\nobjects, must of necessity render the payment of taxes easier, and\r\nfacilitate the requisite supplies to the treasury. The hereditary\r\ndominions of the Emperor of Germany contain a great extent of fertile,\r\ncultivated, and populous territory, a large proportion of which is\r\nsituated in mild and luxuriant climates. In some parts of this\r\nterritory are to be found the best gold and silver mines in Europe. And\r\nyet, from the want of the fostering influence of commerce, that monarch\r\ncan boast but slender revenues. He has several times been compelled to\r\nowe obligations to the pecuniary succors of other nations for the\r\npreservation of his essential interests, and is unable, upon the\r\nstrength of his own resources, to sustain a long or continued war.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in this aspect of the subject alone that Union will be\r\nseen to conduce to the purpose of revenue. There are other points of\r\nview, in which its influence will appear more immediate and decisive.\r\nIt is evident from the state of the country, from the habits of the\r\npeople, from the experience we have had on the point itself, that it is\r\nimpracticable to raise any very considerable sums by direct taxation.\r\nTax laws have in vain been multiplied; new methods to enforce the\r\ncollection have in vain been tried; the public expectation has been\r\nuniformly disappointed, and the treasuries of the States have remained\r\nempty. The popular system of administration inherent in the nature of\r\npopular government, coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident\r\nto a languid and mutilated state of trade, has hitherto defeated every\r\nexperiment for extensive collections, and has at length taught the\r\ndifferent legislatures the folly of attempting them.\r\n\r\nNo person acquainted with what happens in other countries will be\r\nsurprised at this circumstance. In so opulent a nation as that of\r\nBritain, where direct taxes from superior wealth must be much more\r\ntolerable, and, from the vigor of the government, much more\r\npracticable, than in America, far the greatest part of the national\r\nrevenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind, from imposts, and\r\nfrom excises. Duties on imported articles form a large branch of this\r\nlatter description.\r\n\r\nIn America, it is evident that we must a long time depend for the means\r\nof revenue chiefly on such duties. In most parts of it, excises must be\r\nconfined within a narrow compass. The genius of the people will ill\r\nbrook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit of excise laws. The pockets\r\nof the farmers, on the other hand, will reluctantly yield but scanty\r\nsupplies, in the unwelcome shape of impositions on their houses and\r\nlands; and personal property is too precarious and invisible a fund to\r\nbe laid hold of in any other way than by the inperceptible agency of\r\ntaxes on consumption.\r\n\r\nIf these remarks have any foundation, that state of things which will\r\nbest enable us to improve and extend so valuable a resource must be\r\nbest adapted to our political welfare. And it cannot admit of a serious\r\ndoubt, that this state of things must rest on the basis of a general\r\nUnion. As far as this would be conducive to the interests of commerce,\r\nso far it must tend to the extension of the revenue to be drawn from\r\nthat source. As far as it would contribute to rendering regulations for\r\nthe collection of the duties more simple and efficacious, so far it\r\nmust serve to answer the purposes of making the same rate of duties\r\nmore productive, and of putting it into the power of the government to\r\nincrease the rate without prejudice to trade.\r\n\r\nThe relative situation of these States; the number of rivers with which\r\nthey are intersected, and of bays that wash there shores; the facility\r\nof communication in every direction; the affinity of language and\r\nmanners; the familiar habits of intercourse; —all these are\r\ncircumstances that would conspire to render an illicit trade between\r\nthem a matter of little difficulty, and would insure frequent evasions\r\nof the commercial regulations of each other. The separate States or\r\nconfederacies would be necessitated by mutual jealousy to avoid the\r\ntemptations to that kind of trade by the lowness of their duties. The\r\ntemper of our governments, for a long time to come, would not permit\r\nthose rigorous precautions by which the European nations guard the\r\navenues into their respective countries, as well by land as by water;\r\nand which, even there, are found insufficient obstacles to the\r\nadventurous stratagems of avarice.\r\n\r\nIn France, there is an army of patrols (as they are called) constantly\r\nemployed to secure their fiscal regulations against the inroads of the\r\ndealers in contraband trade. Mr. Neckar computes the number of these\r\npatrols at upwards of twenty thousand. This shows the immense\r\ndifficulty in preventing that species of traffic, where there is an\r\ninland communication, and places in a strong light the disadvantages\r\nwith which the collection of duties in this country would be\r\nencumbered, if by disunion the States should be placed in a situation,\r\nwith respect to each other, resembling that of France with respect to\r\nher neighbors. The arbitrary and vexatious powers with which the\r\npatrols are necessarily armed, would be intolerable in a free country.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, there be but one government pervading all the\r\nStates, there will be, as to the principal part of our commerce, but\r\nONE SIDE to guard—the ATLANTIC COAST. Vessels arriving directly from\r\nforeign countries, laden with valuable cargoes, would rarely choose to\r\nhazard themselves to the complicated and critical perils which would\r\nattend attempts to unlade prior to their coming into port. They would\r\nhave to dread both the dangers of the coast, and of detection, as well\r\nafter as before their arrival at the places of their final destination.\r\nAn ordinary degree of vigilance would be competent to the prevention of\r\nany material infractions upon the rights of the revenue. A few armed\r\nvessels, judiciously stationed at the entrances of our ports, might at\r\na small expense be made useful sentinels of the laws. And the\r\ngovernment having the same interest to provide against violations\r\neverywhere, the co-operation of its measures in each State would have a\r\npowerful tendency to render them effectual. Here also we should\r\npreserve by Union, an advantage which nature holds out to us, and which\r\nwould be relinquished by separation. The United States lie at a great\r\ndistance from Europe, and at a considerable distance from all other\r\nplaces with which they would have extensive connections of foreign\r\ntrade. The passage from them to us, in a few hours, or in a single\r\nnight, as between the coasts of France and Britain, and of other\r\nneighboring nations, would be impracticable. This is a prodigious\r\nsecurity against a direct contraband with foreign countries; but a\r\ncircuitous contraband to one State, through the medium of another,\r\nwould be both easy and safe. The difference between a direct\r\nimportation from abroad, and an indirect importation through the\r\nchannel of a neighboring State, in small parcels, according to time and\r\nopportunity, with the additional facilities of inland communication,\r\nmust be palpable to every man of discernment.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident, that one national government would be able, at\r\nmuch less expense, to extend the duties on imports, beyond comparison,\r\nfurther than would be practicable to the States separately, or to any\r\npartial confederacies. Hitherto, I believe, it may safely be asserted,\r\nthat these duties have not upon an average exceeded in any State three\r\nper cent. In France they are estimated to be about fifteen per cent.,\r\nand in Britain they exceed this proportion.[1] There seems to be\r\nnothing to hinder their being increased in this country to at least\r\ntreble their present amount. The single article of ardent spirits,\r\nunder federal regulation, might be made to furnish a considerable\r\nrevenue. Upon a ratio to the importation into this State, the whole\r\nquantity imported into the United States may be estimated at four\r\nmillions of gallons; which, at a shilling per gallon, would produce two\r\nhundred thousand pounds. That article would well bear this rate of\r\nduty; and if it should tend to diminish the consumption of it, such an\r\neffect would be equally favorable to the agriculture, to the economy,\r\nto the morals, and to the health of the society. There is, perhaps,\r\nnothing so much a subject of national extravagance as these spirits.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the consequence, if we are not able to avail ourselves of\r\nthe resource in question in its full extent? A nation cannot long exist\r\nwithout revenues. Destitute of this essential support, it must resign\r\nits independence, and sink into the degraded condition of a province.\r\nThis is an extremity to which no government will of choice accede.\r\nRevenue, therefore, must be had at all events. In this country, if the\r\nprincipal part be not drawn from commerce, it must fall with oppressive\r\nweight upon land. It has been already intimated that excises, in their\r\ntrue signification, are too little in unison with the feelings of the\r\npeople, to admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation; nor,\r\nindeed, in the States where almost the sole employment is agriculture,\r\nare the objects proper for excise sufficiently numerous to permit very\r\nample collections in that way. Personal estate (as has been before\r\nremarked), from the difficulty in tracing it, cannot be subjected to\r\nlarge contributions, by any other means than by taxes on consumption.\r\nIn populous cities, it may be enough the subject of conjecture, to\r\noccasion the oppression of individuals, without much aggregate benefit\r\nto the State; but beyond these circles, it must, in a great measure,\r\nescape the eye and the hand of the tax-gatherer. As the necessities of\r\nthe State, nevertheless, must be satisfied in some mode or other, the\r\ndefect of other resources must throw the principal weight of public\r\nburdens on the possessors of land. And as, on the other hand, the wants\r\nof the government can never obtain an adequate supply, unless all the\r\nsources of revenue are open to its demands, the finances of the\r\ncommunity, under such embarrassments, cannot be put into a situation\r\nconsistent with its respectability or its security. Thus we shall not\r\neven have the consolations of a full treasury, to atone for the\r\noppression of that valuable class of the citizens who are employed in\r\nthe cultivation of the soil. But public and private distress will keep\r\npace with each other in gloomy concert; and unite in deploring the\r\ninfatuation of those counsels which led to disunion.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] If my memory be right they amount to twenty per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XIII.\r\n\r\nAdvantage of the Union in Respect to Economy in Government\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nAs connected with the subject of revenue, we may with propriety\r\nconsider that of economy. The money saved from one object may be\r\nusefully applied to another, and there will be so much the less to be\r\ndrawn from the pockets of the people. If the States are united under\r\none government, there will be but one national civil list to support;\r\nif they are divided into several confederacies, there will be as many\r\ndifferent national civil lists to be provided for—and each of them, as\r\nto the principal departments, coextensive with that which would be\r\nnecessary for a government of the whole. The entire separation of the\r\nStates into thirteen unconnected sovereignties is a project too\r\nextravagant and too replete with danger to have many advocates. The\r\nideas of men who speculate upon the dismemberment of the empire seem\r\ngenerally turned toward three confederacies—one consisting of the four\r\nNorthern, another of the four Middle, and a third of the five Southern\r\nStates. There is little probability that there would be a greater\r\nnumber. According to this distribution, each confederacy would comprise\r\nan extent of territory larger than that of the kingdom of Great\r\nBritain. No well-informed man will suppose that the affairs of such a\r\nconfederacy can be properly regulated by a government less\r\ncomprehensive in its organs or institutions than that which has been\r\nproposed by the convention. When the dimensions of a State attain to a\r\ncertain magnitude, it requires the same energy of government and the\r\nsame forms of administration which are requisite in one of much greater\r\nextent. This idea admits not of precise demonstration, because there is\r\nno rule by which we can measure the momentum of civil power necessary\r\nto the government of any given number of individuals; but when we\r\nconsider that the island of Britain, nearly commensurate with each of\r\nthe supposed confederacies, contains about eight millions of people,\r\nand when we reflect upon the degree of authority required to direct the\r\npassions of so large a society to the public good, we shall see no\r\nreason to doubt that the like portion of power would be sufficient to\r\nperform the same task in a society far more numerous. Civil power,\r\nproperly organized and exerted, is capable of diffusing its force to a\r\nvery great extent; and can, in a manner, reproduce itself in every part\r\nof a great empire by a judicious arrangement of subordinate\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe supposition that each confederacy into which the States would be\r\nlikely to be divided would require a government not less comprehensive\r\nthan the one proposed, will be strengthened by another supposition,\r\nmore probable than that which presents us with three confederacies as\r\nthe alternative to a general Union. If we attend carefully to\r\ngeographical and commercial considerations, in conjunction with the\r\nhabits and prejudices of the different States, we shall be led to\r\nconclude that in case of disunion they will most naturally league\r\nthemselves under two governments. The four Eastern States, from all the\r\ncauses that form the links of national sympathy and connection, may\r\nwith certainty be expected to unite. New York, situated as she is,\r\nwould never be unwise enough to oppose a feeble and unsupported flank\r\nto the weight of that confederacy. There are other obvious reasons that\r\nwould facilitate her accession to it. New Jersey is too small a State\r\nto think of being a frontier, in opposition to this still more powerful\r\ncombination; nor do there appear to be any obstacles to her admission\r\ninto it. Even Pennsylvania would have strong inducements to join the\r\nNorthern league. An active foreign commerce, on the basis of her own\r\nnavigation, is her true policy, and coincides with the opinions and\r\ndispositions of her citizens. The more Southern States, from various\r\ncircumstances, may not think themselves much interested in the\r\nencouragement of navigation. They may prefer a system which would give\r\nunlimited scope to all nations to be the carriers as well as the\r\npurchasers of their commodities. Pennsylvania may not choose to\r\nconfound her interests in a connection so adverse to her policy. As she\r\nmust at all events be a frontier, she may deem it most consistent with\r\nher safety to have her exposed side turned towards the weaker power of\r\nthe Southern, rather than towards the stronger power of the Northern,\r\nConfederacy. This would give her the fairest chance to avoid being the\r\nFlanders of America. Whatever may be the determination of Pennsylvania,\r\nif the Northern Confederacy includes New Jersey, there is no likelihood\r\nof more than one confederacy to the south of that State.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more evident than that the thirteen States will be able\r\nto support a national government better than one half, or one third, or\r\nany number less than the whole. This reflection must have great weight\r\nin obviating that objection to the proposed plan, which is founded on\r\nthe principle of expense; an objection, however, which, when we come to\r\ntake a nearer view of it, will appear in every light to stand on\r\nmistaken ground.\r\n\r\nIf, in addition to the consideration of a plurality of civil lists, we\r\ntake into view the number of persons who must necessarily be employed\r\nto guard the inland communication between the different confederacies\r\nagainst illicit trade, and who in time will infallibly spring up out of\r\nthe necessities of revenue; and if we also take into view the military\r\nestablishments which it has been shown would unavoidably result from\r\nthe jealousies and conflicts of the several nations into which the\r\nStates would be divided, we shall clearly discover that a separation\r\nwould be not less injurious to the economy, than to the tranquillity,\r\ncommerce, revenue, and liberty of every part.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XIV.\r\n\r\nObjections to the Proposed Constitution From Extent of Territory\r\nAnswered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, November 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nWe have seen the necessity of the Union, as our bulwark against foreign\r\ndanger, as the conservator of peace among ourselves, as the guardian of\r\nour commerce and other common interests, as the only substitute for\r\nthose military establishments which have subverted the liberties of the\r\nOld World, and as the proper antidote for the diseases of faction,\r\nwhich have proved fatal to other popular governments, and of which\r\nalarming symptoms have been betrayed by our own. All that remains,\r\nwithin this branch of our inquiries, is to take notice of an objection\r\nthat may be drawn from the great extent of country which the Union\r\nembraces. A few observations on this subject will be the more proper,\r\nas it is perceived that the adversaries of the new Constitution are\r\navailing themselves of the prevailing prejudice with regard to the\r\npracticable sphere of republican administration, in order to supply, by\r\nimaginary difficulties, the want of those solid objections which they\r\nendeavor in vain to find.\r\n\r\nThe error which limits republican government to a narrow district has\r\nbeen unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I remark here only that\r\nit seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a\r\nrepublic with a democracy, applying to the former reasonings drawn from\r\nthe nature of the latter. The true distinction between these forms was\r\nalso adverted to on a former occasion. It is, that in a democracy, the\r\npeople meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they\r\nassemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A\r\ndemocracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic\r\nmay be extended over a large region.\r\n\r\nTo this accidental source of the error may be added the artifice of\r\nsome celebrated authors, whose writings have had a great share in\r\nforming the modern standard of political opinions. Being subjects\r\neither of an absolute or limited monarchy, they have endeavored to\r\nheighten the advantages, or palliate the evils of those forms, by\r\nplacing in comparison the vices and defects of the republican, and by\r\nciting as specimens of the latter the turbulent democracies of ancient\r\nGreece and modern Italy. Under the confusion of names, it has been an\r\neasy task to transfer to a republic observations applicable to a\r\ndemocracy only; and among others, the observation that it can never be\r\nestablished but among a small number of people, living within a small\r\ncompass of territory.\r\n\r\nSuch a fallacy may have been the less perceived, as most of the popular\r\ngovernments of antiquity were of the democratic species; and even in\r\nmodern Europe, to which we owe the great principle of representation,\r\nno example is seen of a government wholly popular, and founded, at the\r\nsame time, wholly on that principle. If Europe has the merit of\r\ndiscovering this great mechanical power in government, by the simple\r\nagency of which the will of the largest political body may be\r\nconcentred, and its force directed to any object which the public good\r\nrequires, America can claim the merit of making the discovery the basis\r\nof unmixed and extensive republics. It is only to be lamented that any\r\nof her citizens should wish to deprive her of the additional merit of\r\ndisplaying its full efficacy in the establishment of the comprehensive\r\nsystem now under her consideration.\r\n\r\nAs the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central\r\npoint which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as\r\noften as their public functions demand, and will include no greater\r\nnumber than can join in those functions; so the natural limit of a\r\nrepublic is that distance from the centre which will barely allow the\r\nrepresentatives to meet as often as may be necessary for the\r\nadministration of public affairs. Can it be said that the limits of the\r\nUnited States exceed this distance? It will not be said by those who\r\nrecollect that the Atlantic coast is the longest side of the Union,\r\nthat during the term of thirteen years, the representatives of the\r\nStates have been almost continually assembled, and that the members\r\nfrom the most distant States are not chargeable with greater\r\nintermissions of attendance than those from the States in the\r\nneighborhood of Congress.\r\n\r\nThat we may form a juster estimate with regard to this interesting\r\nsubject, let us resort to the actual dimensions of the Union. The\r\nlimits, as fixed by the treaty of peace, are: on the east the Atlantic,\r\non the south the latitude of thirty-one degrees, on the west the\r\nMississippi, and on the north an irregular line running in some\r\ninstances beyond the forty-fifth degree, in others falling as low as\r\nthe forty-second. The southern shore of Lake Erie lies below that\r\nlatitude. Computing the distance between the thirty-first and\r\nforty-fifth degrees, it amounts to nine hundred and seventy-three\r\ncommon miles; computing it from thirty-one to forty-two degrees, to\r\nseven hundred and sixty-four miles and a half. Taking the mean for the\r\ndistance, the amount will be eight hundred and sixty-eight miles and\r\nthree-fourths. The mean distance from the Atlantic to the Mississippi\r\ndoes not probably exceed seven hundred and fifty miles. On a comparison\r\nof this extent with that of several countries in Europe, the\r\npracticability of rendering our system commensurate to it appears to be\r\ndemonstrable. It is not a great deal larger than Germany, where a diet\r\nrepresenting the whole empire is continually assembled; or than Poland\r\nbefore the late dismemberment, where another national diet was the\r\ndepositary of the supreme power. Passing by France and Spain, we find\r\nthat in Great Britain, inferior as it may be in size, the\r\nrepresentatives of the northern extremity of the island have as far to\r\ntravel to the national council as will be required of those of the most\r\nremote parts of the Union.\r\n\r\nFavorable as this view of the subject may be, some observations remain\r\nwhich will place it in a light still more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is to be remembered that the general government\r\nis not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering\r\nlaws. Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects, which\r\nconcern all the members of the republic, but which are not to be\r\nattained by the separate provisions of any. The subordinate\r\ngovernments, which can extend their care to all those other subjects\r\nwhich can be separately provided for, will retain their due authority\r\nand activity. Were it proposed by the plan of the convention to abolish\r\nthe governments of the particular States, its adversaries would have\r\nsome ground for their objection; though it would not be difficult to\r\nshow that if they were abolished the general government would be\r\ncompelled, by the principle of self-preservation, to reinstate them in\r\ntheir proper jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nA second observation to be made is that the immediate object of the\r\nfederal Constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen primitive\r\nStates, which we know to be practicable; and to add to them such other\r\nStates as may arise in their own bosoms, or in their neighborhoods,\r\nwhich we cannot doubt to be equally practicable. The arrangements that\r\nmay be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory which\r\nlie on our northwestern frontier, must be left to those whom further\r\ndiscoveries and experience will render more equal to the task.\r\n\r\nLet it be remarked, in the third place, that the intercourse throughout\r\nthe Union will be facilitated by new improvements. Roads will\r\neverywhere be shortened, and kept in better order; accommodations for\r\ntravelers will be multiplied and meliorated; an interior navigation on\r\nour eastern side will be opened throughout, or nearly throughout, the\r\nwhole extent of the thirteen States. The communication between the\r\nWestern and Atlantic districts, and between different parts of each,\r\nwill be rendered more and more easy by those numerous canals with which\r\nthe beneficence of nature has intersected our country, and which art\r\nfinds it so little difficult to connect and complete.\r\n\r\nA fourth and still more important consideration is, that as almost\r\nevery State will, on one side or other, be a frontier, and will thus\r\nfind, in regard to its safety, an inducement to make some sacrifices\r\nfor the sake of the general protection; so the States which lie at the\r\ngreatest distance from the heart of the Union, and which, of course,\r\nmay partake least of the ordinary circulation of its benefits, will be\r\nat the same time immediately contiguous to foreign nations, and will\r\nconsequently stand, on particular occasions, in greatest need of its\r\nstrength and resources. It may be inconvenient for Georgia, or the\r\nStates forming our western or northeastern borders, to send their\r\nrepresentatives to the seat of government; but they would find it more\r\nso to struggle alone against an invading enemy, or even to support\r\nalone the whole expense of those precautions which may be dictated by\r\nthe neighborhood of continual danger. If they should derive less\r\nbenefit, therefore, from the Union in some respects than the less\r\ndistant States, they will derive greater benefit from it in other\r\nrespects, and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nI submit to you, my fellow-citizens, these considerations, in full\r\nconfidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions\r\nwill allow them their due weight and effect; and that you will never\r\nsuffer difficulties, however formidable in appearance, or however\r\nfashionable the error on which they may be founded, to drive you into\r\nthe gloomy and perilous scene into which the advocates for disunion\r\nwould conduct you. Hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you\r\nthat the people of America, knit together as they are by so many cords\r\nof affection, can no longer live together as members of the same\r\nfamily; can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual\r\nhappiness; can no longer be fellowcitizens of one great, respectable,\r\nand flourishing empire. Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells\r\nyou that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a\r\nnovelty in the political world; that it has never yet had a place in\r\nthe theories of the wildest projectors; that it rashly attempts what it\r\nis impossible to accomplish. No, my countrymen, shut your ears against\r\nthis unhallowed language. Shut your hearts against the poison which it\r\nconveys; the kindred blood which flows in the veins of American\r\ncitizens, the mingled blood which they have shed in defense of their\r\nsacred rights, consecrate their Union, and excite horror at the idea of\r\ntheir becoming aliens, rivals, enemies. And if novelties are to be\r\nshunned, believe me, the most alarming of all novelties, the most wild\r\nof all projects, the most rash of all attempts, is that of rendering us\r\nin pieces, in order to preserve our liberties and promote our\r\nhappiness. But why is the experiment of an extended republic to be\r\nrejected, merely because it may comprise what is new? Is it not the\r\nglory of the people of America, that, whilst they have paid a decent\r\nregard to the opinions of former times and other nations, they have not\r\nsuffered a blind veneration for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to\r\noverrule the suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of\r\ntheir own situation, and the lessons of their own experience? To this\r\nmanly spirit, posterity will be indebted for the possession, and the\r\nworld for the example, of the numerous innovations displayed on the\r\nAmerican theatre, in favor of private rights and public happiness. Had\r\nno important step been taken by the leaders of the Revolution for which\r\na precedent could not be discovered, no government established of which\r\nan exact model did not present itself, the people of the United States\r\nmight, at this moment have been numbered among the melancholy victims\r\nof misguided councils, must at best have been laboring under the weight\r\nof some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of\r\nmankind. Happily for America, happily, we trust, for the whole human\r\nrace, they pursued a new and more noble course. They accomplished a\r\nrevolution which has no parallel in the annals of human society. They\r\nreared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of\r\nthe globe. They formed the design of a great Confederacy, which it is\r\nincumbent on their successors to improve and perpetuate. If their works\r\nbetray imperfections, we wonder at the fewness of them. If they erred\r\nmost in the structure of the Union, this was the work most difficult to\r\nbe executed; this is the work which has been new modelled by the act of\r\nyour convention, and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate\r\nand to decide.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XV.\r\n\r\nThe Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the preceding papers, I have endeavored, my\r\nfellow-citizens, to place before you, in a clear and convincing light,\r\nthe importance of Union to your political safety and happiness. I have\r\nunfolded to you a complication of dangers to which you would be\r\nexposed, should you permit that sacred knot which binds the people of\r\nAmerica together be severed or dissolved by ambition or by avarice, by\r\njealousy or by misrepresentation. In the sequel of the inquiry through\r\nwhich I propose to accompany you, the truths intended to be inculcated\r\nwill receive further confirmation from facts and arguments hitherto\r\nunnoticed. If the road over which you will still have to pass should in\r\nsome places appear to you tedious or irksome, you will recollect that\r\nyou are in quest of information on a subject the most momentous which\r\ncan engage the attention of a free people, that the field through which\r\nyou have to travel is in itself spacious, and that the difficulties of\r\nthe journey have been unnecessarily increased by the mazes with which\r\nsophistry has beset the way. It will be my aim to remove the obstacles\r\nfrom your progress in as compendious a manner as it can be done,\r\nwithout sacrificing utility to despatch.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the plan which I have laid down for the discussion of\r\nthe subject, the point next in order to be examined is the\r\n“insufficiency of the present Confederation to the preservation of the\r\nUnion.” It may perhaps be asked what need there is of reasoning or\r\nproof to illustrate a position which is not either controverted or\r\ndoubted, to which the understandings and feelings of all classes of men\r\nassent, and which in substance is admitted by the opponents as well as\r\nby the friends of the new Constitution. It must in truth be\r\nacknowledged that, however these may differ in other respects, they in\r\ngeneral appear to harmonize in this sentiment, at least, that there are\r\nmaterial imperfections in our national system, and that something is\r\nnecessary to be done to rescue us from impending anarchy. The facts\r\nthat support this opinion are no longer objects of speculation. They\r\nhave forced themselves upon the sensibility of the people at large, and\r\nhave at length extorted from those, whose mistaken policy has had the\r\nprincipal share in precipitating the extremity at which we are arrived,\r\na reluctant confession of the reality of those defects in the scheme of\r\nour federal government, which have been long pointed out and regretted\r\nby the intelligent friends of the Union.\r\n\r\nWe may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the last\r\nstage of national humiliation. There is scarcely anything that can\r\nwound the pride or degrade the character of an independent nation which\r\nwe do not experience. Are there engagements to the performance of which\r\nwe are held by every tie respectable among men? These are the subjects\r\nof constant and unblushing violation. Do we owe debts to foreigners and\r\nto our own citizens contracted in a time of imminent peril for the\r\npreservation of our political existence? These remain without any\r\nproper or satisfactory provision for their discharge. Have we valuable\r\nterritories and important posts in the possession of a foreign power\r\nwhich, by express stipulations, ought long since to have been\r\nsurrendered? These are still retained, to the prejudice of our\r\ninterests, not less than of our rights. Are we in a condition to resent\r\nor to repel the aggression? We have neither troops, nor treasury, nor\r\ngovernment.[1] Are we even in a condition to remonstrate with dignity?\r\nThe just imputations on our own faith, in respect to the same treaty,\r\nought first to be removed. Are we entitled by nature and compact to a\r\nfree participation in the navigation of the Mississippi? Spain excludes\r\nus from it. Is public credit an indispensable resource in time of\r\npublic danger? We seem to have abandoned its cause as desperate and\r\nirretrievable. Is commerce of importance to national wealth? Ours is at\r\nthe lowest point of declension. Is respectability in the eyes of\r\nforeign powers a safeguard against foreign encroachments? The\r\nimbecility of our government even forbids them to treat with us. Our\r\nambassadors abroad are the mere pageants of mimic sovereignty. Is a\r\nviolent and unnatural decrease in the value of land a symptom of\r\nnational distress? The price of improved land in most parts of the\r\ncountry is much lower than can be accounted for by the quantity of\r\nwaste land at market, and can only be fully explained by that want of\r\nprivate and public confidence, which are so alarmingly prevalent among\r\nall ranks, and which have a direct tendency to depreciate property of\r\nevery kind. Is private credit the friend and patron of industry? That\r\nmost useful kind which relates to borrowing and lending is reduced\r\nwithin the narrowest limits, and this still more from an opinion of\r\ninsecurity than from the scarcity of money. To shorten an enumeration\r\nof particulars which can afford neither pleasure nor instruction, it\r\nmay in general be demanded, what indication is there of national\r\ndisorder, poverty, and insignificance that could befall a community so\r\npeculiarly blessed with natural advantages as we are, which does not\r\nform a part of the dark catalogue of our public misfortunes?\r\n\r\nThis is the melancholy situation to which we have been brought by those\r\nvery maxims and councils which would now deter us from adopting the\r\nproposed Constitution; and which, not content with having conducted us\r\nto the brink of a precipice, seem resolved to plunge us into the abyss\r\nthat awaits us below. Here, my countrymen, impelled by every motive\r\nthat ought to influence an enlightened people, let us make a firm stand\r\nfor our safety, our tranquillity, our dignity, our reputation. Let us\r\nat last break the fatal charm which has too long seduced us from the\r\npaths of felicity and prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt is true, as has been before observed that facts, too stubborn to be\r\nresisted, have produced a species of general assent to the abstract\r\nproposition that there exist material defects in our national system;\r\nbut the usefulness of the concession, on the part of the old\r\nadversaries of federal measures, is destroyed by a strenuous opposition\r\nto a remedy, upon the only principles that can give it a chance of\r\nsuccess. While they admit that the government of the United States is\r\ndestitute of energy, they contend against conferring upon it those\r\npowers which are requisite to supply that energy. They seem still to\r\naim at things repugnant and irreconcilable; at an augmentation of\r\nfederal authority, without a diminution of State authority; at\r\nsovereignty in the Union, and complete independence in the members.\r\nThey still, in fine, seem to cherish with blind devotion the political\r\nmonster of an imperium in imperio. This renders a full display of the\r\nprincipal defects of the Confederation necessary, in order to show that\r\nthe evils we experience do not proceed from minute or partial\r\nimperfections, but from fundamental errors in the structure of the\r\nbuilding, which cannot be amended otherwise than by an alteration in\r\nthe first principles and main pillars of the fabric.\r\n\r\nThe great and radical vice in the construction of the existing\r\nConfederation is in the principle of LEGISLATION for STATES or\r\nGOVERNMENTS, in their CORPORATE or COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES, and as\r\ncontradistinguished from the INDIVIDUALS of which they consist. Though\r\nthis principle does not run through all the powers delegated to the\r\nUnion, yet it pervades and governs those on which the efficacy of the\r\nrest depends. Except as to the rule of appointment, the United States\r\nhas an indefinite discretion to make requisitions for men and money;\r\nbut they have no authority to raise either, by regulations extending to\r\nthe individual citizens of America. The consequence of this is, that\r\nthough in theory their resolutions concerning those objects are laws,\r\nconstitutionally binding on the members of the Union, yet in practice\r\nthey are mere recommendations which the States observe or disregard at\r\ntheir option.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular instance of the capriciousness of the human mind, that\r\nafter all the admonitions we have had from experience on this head,\r\nthere should still be found men who object to the new Constitution, for\r\ndeviating from a principle which has been found the bane of the old,\r\nand which is in itself evidently incompatible with the idea of\r\nGOVERNMENT; a principle, in short, which, if it is to be executed at\r\nall, must substitute the violent and sanguinary agency of the sword to\r\nthe mild influence of the magistracy.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing absurd or impracticable in the idea of a league or\r\nalliance between independent nations for certain defined purposes\r\nprecisely stated in a treaty regulating all the details of time, place,\r\ncircumstance, and quantity; leaving nothing to future discretion; and\r\ndepending for its execution on the good faith of the parties. Compacts\r\nof this kind exist among all civilized nations, subject to the usual\r\nvicissitudes of peace and war, of observance and non-observance, as the\r\ninterests or passions of the contracting powers dictate. In the early\r\npart of the present century there was an epidemical rage in Europe for\r\nthis species of compacts, from which the politicians of the times\r\nfondly hoped for benefits which were never realized. With a view to\r\nestablishing the equilibrium of power and the peace of that part of the\r\nworld, all the resources of negotiation were exhausted, and triple and\r\nquadruple alliances were formed; but they were scarcely formed before\r\nthey were broken, giving an instructive but afflicting lesson to\r\nmankind, how little dependence is to be placed on treaties which have\r\nno other sanction than the obligations of good faith, and which oppose\r\ngeneral considerations of peace and justice to the impulse of any\r\nimmediate interest or passion.\r\n\r\nIf the particular States in this country are disposed to stand in a\r\nsimilar relation to each other, and to drop the project of a general\r\nDISCRETIONARY SUPERINTENDENCE, the scheme would indeed be pernicious,\r\nand would entail upon us all the mischiefs which have been enumerated\r\nunder the first head; but it would have the merit of being, at least,\r\nconsistent and practicable Abandoning all views towards a confederate\r\ngovernment, this would bring us to a simple alliance offensive and\r\ndefensive; and would place us in a situation to be alternate friends\r\nand enemies of each other, as our mutual jealousies and rivalships,\r\nnourished by the intrigues of foreign nations, should prescribe to us.\r\n\r\nBut if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous situation; if we\r\nstill will adhere to the design of a national government, or, which is\r\nthe same thing, of a superintending power, under the direction of a\r\ncommon council, we must resolve to incorporate into our plan those\r\ningredients which may be considered as forming the characteristic\r\ndifference between a league and a government; we must extend the\r\nauthority of the Union to the persons of the citizens, —the only proper\r\nobjects of government.\r\n\r\nGovernment implies the power of making laws. It is essential to the\r\nidea of a law, that it be attended with a sanction; or, in other words,\r\na penalty or punishment for disobedience. If there be no penalty\r\nannexed to disobedience, the resolutions or commands which pretend to\r\nbe laws will, in fact, amount to nothing more than advice or\r\nrecommendation. This penalty, whatever it may be, can only be inflicted\r\nin two ways: by the agency of the courts and ministers of justice, or\r\nby military force; by the COERCION of the magistracy, or by the\r\nCOERCION of arms. The first kind can evidently apply only to men; the\r\nlast kind must of necessity, be employed against bodies politic, or\r\ncommunities, or States. It is evident that there is no process of a\r\ncourt by which the observance of the laws can, in the last resort, be\r\nenforced. Sentences may be denounced against them for violations of\r\ntheir duty; but these sentences can only be carried into execution by\r\nthe sword. In an association where the general authority is confined to\r\nthe collective bodies of the communities, that compose it, every breach\r\nof the laws must involve a state of war; and military execution must\r\nbecome the only instrument of civil obedience. Such a state of things\r\ncan certainly not deserve the name of government, nor would any prudent\r\nman choose to commit his happiness to it.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when we were told that breaches, by the States, of the\r\nregulations of the federal authority were not to be expected; that a\r\nsense of common interest would preside over the conduct of the\r\nrespective members, and would beget a full compliance with all the\r\nconstitutional requisitions of the Union. This language, at the present\r\nday, would appear as wild as a great part of what we now hear from the\r\nsame quarter will be thought, when we shall have received further\r\nlessons from that best oracle of wisdom, experience. It at all times\r\nbetrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which human conduct is\r\nactuated, and belied the original inducements to the establishment of\r\ncivil power. Why has government been instituted at all? Because the\r\npassions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice,\r\nwithout constraint. Has it been found that bodies of men act with more\r\nrectitude or greater disinterestedness than individuals? The contrary\r\nof this has been inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of\r\nmankind; and the inference is founded upon obvious reasons. Regard to\r\nreputation has a less active influence, when the infamy of a bad action\r\nis to be divided among a number than when it is to fall singly upon\r\none. A spirit of faction, which is apt to mingle its poison in the\r\ndeliberations of all bodies of men, will often hurry the persons of\r\nwhom they are composed into improprieties and excesses, for which they\r\nwould blush in a private capacity.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this, there is, in the nature of sovereign power, an\r\nimpatience of control, that disposes those who are invested with the\r\nexercise of it, to look with an evil eye upon all external attempts to\r\nrestrain or direct its operations. From this spirit it happens, that in\r\nevery political association which is formed upon the principle of\r\nuniting in a common interest a number of lesser sovereignties, there\r\nwill be found a kind of eccentric tendency in the subordinate or\r\ninferior orbs, by the operation of which there will be a perpetual\r\neffort in each to fly off from the common centre. This tendency is not\r\ndifficult to be accounted for. It has its origin in the love of power.\r\nPower controlled or abridged is almost always the rival and enemy of\r\nthat power by which it is controlled or abridged. This simple\r\nproposition will teach us how little reason there is to expect, that\r\nthe persons intrusted with the administration of the affairs of the\r\nparticular members of a confederacy will at all times be ready, with\r\nperfect good-humor, and an unbiased regard to the public weal, to\r\nexecute the resolutions or decrees of the general authority. The\r\nreverse of this results from the constitution of human nature.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the measures of the Confederacy cannot be executed\r\nwithout the intervention of the particular administrations, there will\r\nbe little prospect of their being executed at all. The rulers of the\r\nrespective members, whether they have a constitutional right to do it\r\nor not, will undertake to judge of the propriety of the measures\r\nthemselves. They will consider the conformity of the thing proposed or\r\nrequired to their immediate interests or aims; the momentary\r\nconveniences or inconveniences that would attend its adoption. All this\r\nwill be done; and in a spirit of interested and suspicious scrutiny,\r\nwithout that knowledge of national circumstances and reasons of state,\r\nwhich is essential to a right judgment, and with that strong\r\npredilection in favor of local objects, which can hardly fail to\r\nmislead the decision. The same process must be repeated in every member\r\nof which the body is constituted; and the execution of the plans,\r\nframed by the councils of the whole, will always fluctuate on the\r\ndiscretion of the ill-informed and prejudiced opinion of every part.\r\nThose who have been conversant in the proceedings of popular\r\nassemblies; who have seen how difficult it often is, where there is no\r\nexterior pressure of circumstances, to bring them to harmonious\r\nresolutions on important points, will readily conceive how impossible\r\nit must be to induce a number of such assemblies, deliberating at a\r\ndistance from each other, at different times, and under different\r\nimpressions, long to co-operate in the same views and pursuits.\r\n\r\nIn our case, the concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereign wills is\r\nrequisite, under the Confederation, to the complete execution of every\r\nimportant measure that proceeds from the Union. It has happened as was\r\nto have been foreseen. The measures of the Union have not been\r\nexecuted; the delinquencies of the States have, step by step, matured\r\nthemselves to an extreme, which has, at length, arrested all the wheels\r\nof the national government, and brought them to an awful stand.\r\nCongress at this time scarcely possess the means of keeping up the\r\nforms of administration, till the States can have time to agree upon a\r\nmore substantial substitute for the present shadow of a federal\r\ngovernment. Things did not come to this desperate extremity at once.\r\nThe causes which have been specified produced at first only unequal and\r\ndisproportionate degrees of compliance with the requisitions of the\r\nUnion. The greater deficiencies of some States furnished the pretext of\r\nexample and the temptation of interest to the complying, or to the\r\nleast delinquent States. Why should we do more in proportion than those\r\nwho are embarked with us in the same political voyage? Why should we\r\nconsent to bear more than our proper share of the common burden? These\r\nwere suggestions which human selfishness could not withstand, and which\r\neven speculative men, who looked forward to remote consequences, could\r\nnot, without hesitation, combat. Each State, yielding to the persuasive\r\nvoice of immediate interest or convenience, has successively withdrawn\r\nits support, till the frail and tottering edifice seems ready to fall\r\nupon our heads, and to crush us beneath its ruins.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] “I mean for the Union.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XVI.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, December 4, 1787.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the principle of legislation for States, or\r\ncommunities, in their political capacities, as it has been exemplified\r\nby the experiment we have made of it, is equally attested by the events\r\nwhich have befallen all other governments of the confederate kind, of\r\nwhich we have any account, in exact proportion to its prevalence in\r\nthose systems. The confirmations of this fact will be worthy of a\r\ndistinct and particular examination. I shall content myself with barely\r\nobserving here, that of all the confederacies of antiquity, which\r\nhistory has handed down to us, the Lycian and Achaean leagues, as far\r\nas there remain vestiges of them, appear to have been most free from\r\nthe fetters of that mistaken principle, and were accordingly those\r\nwhich have best deserved, and have most liberally received, the\r\napplauding suffrages of political writers.\r\n\r\nThis exceptionable principle may, as truly as emphatically, be styled\r\nthe parent of anarchy: It has been seen that delinquencies in the\r\nmembers of the Union are its natural and necessary offspring; and that\r\nwhenever they happen, the only constitutional remedy is force, and the\r\nimmediate effect of the use of it, civil war.\r\n\r\nIt remains to inquire how far so odious an engine of government, in its\r\napplication to us, would even be capable of answering its end. If there\r\nshould not be a large army constantly at the disposal of the national\r\ngovernment it would either not be able to employ force at all, or, when\r\nthis could be done, it would amount to a war between parts of the\r\nConfederacy concerning the infractions of a league, in which the\r\nstrongest combination would be most likely to prevail, whether it\r\nconsisted of those who supported or of those who resisted the general\r\nauthority. It would rarely happen that the delinquency to be redressed\r\nwould be confined to a single member, and if there were more than one\r\nwho had neglected their duty, similarity of situation would induce them\r\nto unite for common defense. Independent of this motive of sympathy, if\r\na large and influential State should happen to be the aggressing\r\nmember, it would commonly have weight enough with its neighbors to win\r\nover some of them as associates to its cause. Specious arguments of\r\ndanger to the common liberty could easily be contrived; plausible\r\nexcuses for the deficiencies of the party could, without difficulty, be\r\ninvented to alarm the apprehensions, inflame the passions, and\r\nconciliate the good-will, even of those States which were not\r\nchargeable with any violation or omission of duty. This would be the\r\nmore likely to take place, as the delinquencies of the larger members\r\nmight be expected sometimes to proceed from an ambitious premeditation\r\nin their rulers, with a view to getting rid of all external control\r\nupon their designs of personal aggrandizement; the better to effect\r\nwhich it is presumable they would tamper beforehand with leading\r\nindividuals in the adjacent States. If associates could not be found at\r\nhome, recourse would be had to the aid of foreign powers, who would\r\nseldom be disinclined to encouraging the dissensions of a Confederacy,\r\nfrom the firm union of which they had so much to fear. When the sword\r\nis once drawn, the passions of men observe no bounds of moderation. The\r\nsuggestions of wounded pride, the instigations of irritated resentment,\r\nwould be apt to carry the States against which the arms of the Union\r\nwere exerted, to any extremes necessary to avenge the affront or to\r\navoid the disgrace of submission. The first war of this kind would\r\nprobably terminate in a dissolution of the Union.\r\n\r\nThis may be considered as the violent death of the Confederacy. Its\r\nmore natural death is what we now seem to be on the point of\r\nexperiencing, if the federal system be not speedily renovated in a more\r\nsubstantial form. It is not probable, considering the genius of this\r\ncountry, that the complying States would often be inclined to support\r\nthe authority of the Union by engaging in a war against the\r\nnon-complying States. They would always be more ready to pursue the\r\nmilder course of putting themselves upon an equal footing with the\r\ndelinquent members by an imitation of their example. And the guilt of\r\nall would thus become the security of all. Our past experience has\r\nexhibited the operation of this spirit in its full light. There would,\r\nin fact, be an insuperable difficulty in ascertaining when force could\r\nwith propriety be employed. In the article of pecuniary contribution,\r\nwhich would be the most usual source of delinquency, it would often be\r\nimpossible to decide whether it had proceeded from disinclination or\r\ninability. The pretense of the latter would always be at hand. And the\r\ncase must be very flagrant in which its fallacy could be detected with\r\nsufficient certainty to justify the harsh expedient of compulsion. It\r\nis easy to see that this problem alone, as often as it should occur,\r\nwould open a wide field for the exercise of factious views, of\r\npartiality, and of oppression, in the majority that happened to prevail\r\nin the national council.\r\n\r\nIt seems to require no pains to prove that the States ought not to\r\nprefer a national Constitution which could only be kept in motion by\r\nthe instrumentality of a large army continually on foot to execute the\r\nordinary requisitions or decrees of the government. And yet this is the\r\nplain alternative involved by those who wish to deny it the power of\r\nextending its operations to individuals. Such a scheme, if practicable\r\nat all, would instantly degenerate into a military despotism; but it\r\nwill be found in every light impracticable. The resources of the Union\r\nwould not be equal to the maintenance of an army considerable enough to\r\nconfine the larger States within the limits of their duty; nor would\r\nthe means ever be furnished of forming such an army in the first\r\ninstance. Whoever considers the populousness and strength of several of\r\nthese States singly at the present juncture, and looks forward to what\r\nthey will become, even at the distance of half a century, will at once\r\ndismiss as idle and visionary any scheme which aims at regulating their\r\nmovements by laws to operate upon them in their collective capacities,\r\nand to be executed by a coercion applicable to them in the same\r\ncapacities. A project of this kind is little less romantic than the\r\nmonster-taming spirit which is attributed to the fabulous heroes and\r\ndemi-gods of antiquity.\r\n\r\nEven in those confederacies which have been composed of members smaller\r\nthan many of our counties, the principle of legislation for sovereign\r\nStates, supported by military coercion, has never been found effectual.\r\nIt has rarely been attempted to be employed, but against the weaker\r\nmembers; and in most instances attempts to coerce the refractory and\r\ndisobedient have been the signals of bloody wars, in which one half of\r\nthe confederacy has displayed its banners against the other half.\r\n\r\nThe result of these observations to an intelligent mind must be clearly\r\nthis, that if it be possible at any rate to construct a federal\r\ngovernment capable of regulating the common concerns and preserving the\r\ngeneral tranquillity, it must be founded, as to the objects committed\r\nto its care, upon the reverse of the principle contended for by the\r\nopponents of the proposed Constitution. It must carry its agency to the\r\npersons of the citizens. It must stand in need of no intermediate\r\nlegislations; but must itself be empowered to employ the arm of the\r\nordinary magistrate to execute its own resolutions. The majesty of the\r\nnational authority must be manifested through the medium of the courts\r\nof justice. The government of the Union, like that of each State, must\r\nbe able to address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of\r\nindividuals; and to attract to its support those passions which have\r\nthe strongest influence upon the human heart. It must, in short,\r\npossess all the means, and have aright to resort to all the methods, of\r\nexecuting the powers with which it is intrusted, that are possessed and\r\nexercised by the government of the particular States.\r\n\r\nTo this reasoning it may perhaps be objected, that if any State should\r\nbe disaffected to the authority of the Union, it could at any time\r\nobstruct the execution of its laws, and bring the matter to the same\r\nissue of force, with the necessity of which the opposite scheme is\r\nreproached.\r\n\r\nThe plausibility of this objection will vanish the moment we advert to\r\nthe essential difference between a mere NON-COMPLIANCE and a DIRECT and\r\nACTIVE RESISTANCE. If the interposition of the State legislatures be\r\nnecessary to give effect to a measure of the Union, they have only NOT\r\nTO ACT, or to ACT EVASIVELY, and the measure is defeated. This neglect\r\nof duty may be disguised under affected but unsubstantial provisions,\r\nso as not to appear, and of course not to excite any alarm in the\r\npeople for the safety of the Constitution. The State leaders may even\r\nmake a merit of their surreptitious invasions of it on the ground of\r\nsome temporary convenience, exemption, or advantage.\r\n\r\nBut if the execution of the laws of the national government should not\r\nrequire the intervention of the State legislatures, if they were to\r\npass into immediate operation upon the citizens themselves, the\r\nparticular governments could not interrupt their progress without an\r\nopen and violent exertion of an unconstitutional power. No omissions\r\nnor evasions would answer the end. They would be obliged to act, and in\r\nsuch a manner as would leave no doubt that they had encroached on the\r\nnational rights. An experiment of this nature would always be hazardous\r\nin the face of a constitution in any degree competent to its own\r\ndefense, and of a people enlightened enough to distinguish between a\r\nlegal exercise and an illegal usurpation of authority. The success of\r\nit would require not merely a factious majority in the legislature, but\r\nthe concurrence of the courts of justice and of the body of the people.\r\nIf the judges were not embarked in a conspiracy with the legislature,\r\nthey would pronounce the resolutions of such a majority to be contrary\r\nto the supreme law of the land, unconstitutional, and void. If the\r\npeople were not tainted with the spirit of their State representatives,\r\nthey, as the natural guardians of the Constitution, would throw their\r\nweight into the national scale and give it a decided preponderancy in\r\nthe contest. Attempts of this kind would not often be made with levity\r\nor rashness, because they could seldom be made without danger to the\r\nauthors, unless in cases of a tyrannical exercise of the federal\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIf opposition to the national government should arise from the\r\ndisorderly conduct of refractory or seditious individuals, it could be\r\novercome by the same means which are daily employed against the same\r\nevil under the State governments. The magistracy, being equally the\r\nministers of the law of the land, from whatever source it might\r\nemanate, would doubtless be as ready to guard the national as the local\r\nregulations from the inroads of private licentiousness. As to those\r\npartial commotions and insurrections, which sometimes disquiet society,\r\nfrom the intrigues of an inconsiderable faction, or from sudden or\r\noccasional illhumors that do not infect the great body of the community\r\nthe general government could command more extensive resources for the\r\nsuppression of disturbances of that kind than would be in the power of\r\nany single member. And as to those mortal feuds which, in certain\r\nconjunctures, spread a conflagration through a whole nation, or through\r\na very large proportion of it, proceeding either from weighty causes of\r\ndiscontent given by the government or from the contagion of some\r\nviolent popular paroxysm, they do not fall within any ordinary rules of\r\ncalculation. When they happen, they commonly amount to revolutions and\r\ndismemberments of empire. No form of government can always either avoid\r\nor control them. It is in vain to hope to guard against events too\r\nmighty for human foresight or precaution, and it would be idle to\r\nobject to a government because it could not perform impossibilities.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XVII.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union)\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nAn objection, of a nature different from that which has been stated and\r\nanswered, in my last address, may perhaps be likewise urged against the\r\nprinciple of legislation for the individual citizens of America. It may\r\nbe said that it would tend to render the government of the Union too\r\npowerful, and to enable it to absorb those residuary authorities, which\r\nit might be judged proper to leave with the States for local purposes.\r\nAllowing the utmost latitude to the love of power which any reasonable\r\nman can require, I confess I am at a loss to discover what temptation\r\nthe persons intrusted with the administration of the general government\r\ncould ever feel to divest the States of the authorities of that\r\ndescription. The regulation of the mere domestic police of a State\r\nappears to me to hold out slender allurements to ambition. Commerce,\r\nfinance, negotiation, and war seem to comprehend all the objects which\r\nhave charms for minds governed by that passion; and all the powers\r\nnecessary to those objects ought, in the first instance, to be lodged\r\nin the national depository. The administration of private justice\r\nbetween the citizens of the same State, the supervision of agriculture\r\nand of other concerns of a similar nature, all those things, in short,\r\nwhich are proper to be provided for by local legislation, can never be\r\ndesirable cares of a general jurisdiction. It is therefore improbable\r\nthat there should exist a disposition in the federal councils to usurp\r\nthe powers with which they are connected; because the attempt to\r\nexercise those powers would be as troublesome as it would be nugatory;\r\nand the possession of them, for that reason, would contribute nothing\r\nto the dignity, to the importance, or to the splendor of the national\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nBut let it be admitted, for argument’s sake, that mere wantonness and\r\nlust of domination would be sufficient to beget that disposition; still\r\nit may be safely affirmed, that the sense of the constituent body of\r\nthe national representatives, or, in other words, the people of the\r\nseveral States, would control the indulgence of so extravagant an\r\nappetite. It will always be far more easy for the State governments to\r\nencroach upon the national authorities than for the national government\r\nto encroach upon the State authorities. The proof of this proposition\r\nturns upon the greater degree of influence which the State governments\r\nif they administer their affairs with uprightness and prudence, will\r\ngenerally possess over the people; a circumstance which at the same\r\ntime teaches us that there is an inherent and intrinsic weakness in all\r\nfederal constitutions; and that too much pains cannot be taken in their\r\norganization, to give them all the force which is compatible with the\r\nprinciples of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of influence in favor of the particular governments\r\nwould result partly from the diffusive construction of the national\r\ngovernment, but chiefly from the nature of the objects to which the\r\nattention of the State administrations would be directed.\r\n\r\nIt is a known fact in human nature, that its affections are commonly\r\nweak in proportion to the distance or diffusiveness of the object. Upon\r\nthe same principle that a man is more attached to his family than to\r\nhis neighborhood, to his neighborhood than to the community at large,\r\nthe people of each State would be apt to feel a stronger bias towards\r\ntheir local governments than towards the government of the Union;\r\nunless the force of that principle should be destroyed by a much better\r\nadministration of the latter.\r\n\r\nThis strong propensity of the human heart would find powerful\r\nauxiliaries in the objects of State regulation.\r\n\r\nThe variety of more minute interests, which will necessarily fall under\r\nthe superintendence of the local administrations, and which will form\r\nso many rivulets of influence, running through every part of the\r\nsociety, cannot be particularized, without involving a detail too\r\ntedious and uninteresting to compensate for the instruction it might\r\nafford.\r\n\r\nThere is one transcendant advantage belonging to the province of the\r\nState governments, which alone suffices to place the matter in a clear\r\nand satisfactory light,—I mean the ordinary administration of criminal\r\nand civil justice. This, of all others, is the most powerful, most\r\nuniversal, and most attractive source of popular obedience and\r\nattachment. It is that which, being the immediate and visible guardian\r\nof life and property, having its benefits and its terrors in constant\r\nactivity before the public eye, regulating all those personal interests\r\nand familiar concerns to which the sensibility of individuals is more\r\nimmediately awake, contributes, more than any other circumstance, to\r\nimpressing upon the minds of the people, affection, esteem, and\r\nreverence towards the government. This great cement of society, which\r\nwill diffuse itself almost wholly through the channels of the\r\nparticular governments, independent of all other causes of influence,\r\nwould insure them so decided an empire over their respective citizens\r\nas to render them at all times a complete counterpoise, and, not\r\nunfrequently, dangerous rivals to the power of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the national government, on the other hand, falling\r\nless immediately under the observation of the mass of the citizens, the\r\nbenefits derived from it will chiefly be perceived and attended to by\r\nspeculative men. Relating to more general interests, they will be less\r\napt to come home to the feelings of the people; and, in proportion,\r\nless likely to inspire an habitual sense of obligation, and an active\r\nsentiment of attachment.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning on this head has been abundantly exemplified by the\r\nexperience of all federal constitutions with which we are acquainted,\r\nand of all others which have borne the least analogy to them.\r\n\r\nThough the ancient feudal systems were not, strictly speaking,\r\nconfederacies, yet they partook of the nature of that species of\r\nassociation. There was a common head, chieftain, or sovereign, whose\r\nauthority extended over the whole nation; and a number of subordinate\r\nvassals, or feudatories, who had large portions of land allotted to\r\nthem, and numerous trains of INFERIOR vassals or retainers, who\r\noccupied and cultivated that land upon the tenure of fealty or\r\nobedience, to the persons of whom they held it. Each principal vassal\r\nwas a kind of sovereign, within his particular demesnes. The\r\nconsequences of this situation were a continual opposition to authority\r\nof the sovereign, and frequent wars between the great barons or chief\r\nfeudatories themselves. The power of the head of the nation was\r\ncommonly too weak, either to preserve the public peace, or to protect\r\nthe people against the oppressions of their immediate lords. This\r\nperiod of European affairs is emphatically styled by historians, the\r\ntimes of feudal anarchy.\r\n\r\nWhen the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous and warlike temper\r\nand of superior abilities, he would acquire a personal weight and\r\ninfluence, which answered, for the time, the purpose of a more regular\r\nauthority. But in general, the power of the barons triumphed over that\r\nof the prince; and in many instances his dominion was entirely thrown\r\noff, and the great fiefs were erected into independent principalities\r\nor States. In those instances in which the monarch finally prevailed\r\nover his vassals, his success was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those\r\nvassals over their dependents. The barons, or nobles, equally the\r\nenemies of the sovereign and the oppressors of the common people, were\r\ndreaded and detested by both; till mutual danger and mutual interest\r\neffected a union between them fatal to the power of the aristocracy.\r\nHad the nobles, by a conduct of clemency and justice, preserved the\r\nfidelity and devotion of their retainers and followers, the contests\r\nbetween them and the prince must almost always have ended in their\r\nfavor, and in the abridgment or subversion of the royal authority.\r\n\r\nThis is not an assertion founded merely in speculation or conjecture.\r\nAmong other illustrations of its truth which might be cited, Scotland\r\nwill furnish a cogent example. The spirit of clanship which was, at an\r\nearly day, introduced into that kingdom, uniting the nobles and their\r\ndependants by ties equivalent to those of kindred, rendered the\r\naristocracy a constant overmatch for the power of the monarch, till the\r\nincorporation with England subdued its fierce and ungovernable spirit,\r\nand reduced it within those rules of subordination which a more\r\nrational and more energetic system of civil polity had previously\r\nestablished in the latter kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe separate governments in a confederacy may aptly be compared with\r\nthe feudal baronies; with this advantage in their favor, that from the\r\nreasons already explained, they will generally possess the confidence\r\nand good-will of the people, and with so important a support, will be\r\nable effectually to oppose all encroachments of the national\r\ngovernment. It will be well if they are not able to counteract its\r\nlegitimate and necessary authority. The points of similitude consist in\r\nthe rivalship of power, applicable to both, and in the CONCENTRATION of\r\nlarge portions of the strength of the community into particular\r\nDEPOSITS, in one case at the disposal of individuals, in the other case\r\nat the disposal of political bodies.\r\n\r\nA concise review of the events that have attended confederate\r\ngovernments will further illustrate this important doctrine; an\r\ninattention to which has been the great source of our political\r\nmistakes, and has given our jealousy a direction to the wrong side.\r\nThis review shall form the subject of some ensuing papers.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XVIII.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union)\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON AND MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nAmong the confederacies of antiquity, the most considerable was that of\r\nthe Grecian republics, associated under the Amphictyonic council. From\r\nthe best accounts transmitted of this celebrated institution, it bore a\r\nvery instructive analogy to the present Confederation of the American\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe members retained the character of independent and sovereign states,\r\nand had equal votes in the federal council. This council had a general\r\nauthority to propose and resolve whatever it judged necessary for the\r\ncommon welfare of Greece; to declare and carry on war; to decide, in\r\nthe last resort, all controversies between the members; to fine the\r\naggressing party; to employ the whole force of the confederacy against\r\nthe disobedient; to admit new members. The Amphictyons were the\r\nguardians of religion, and of the immense riches belonging to the\r\ntemple of Delphos, where they had the right of jurisdiction in\r\ncontroversies between the inhabitants and those who came to consult the\r\noracle. As a further provision for the efficacy of the federal powers,\r\nthey took an oath mutually to defend and protect the united cities, to\r\npunish the violators of this oath, and to inflict vengeance on\r\nsacrilegious despoilers of the temple.\r\n\r\nIn theory, and upon paper, this apparatus of powers seems amply\r\nsufficient for all general purposes. In several material instances,\r\nthey exceed the powers enumerated in the articles of confederation. The\r\nAmphictyons had in their hands the superstition of the times, one of\r\nthe principal engines by which government was then maintained; they had\r\na declared authority to use coercion against refractory cities, and\r\nwere bound by oath to exert this authority on the necessary occasions.\r\n\r\nVery different, nevertheless, was the experiment from the theory. The\r\npowers, like those of the present Congress, were administered by\r\ndeputies appointed wholly by the cities in their political capacities;\r\nand exercised over them in the same capacities. Hence the weakness, the\r\ndisorders, and finally the destruction of the confederacy. The more\r\npowerful members, instead of being kept in awe and subordination,\r\ntyrannized successively over all the rest. Athens, as we learn from\r\nDemosthenes, was the arbiter of Greece seventy-three years. The\r\nLacedaemonians next governed it twenty-nine years; at a subsequent\r\nperiod, after the battle of Leuctra, the Thebans had their turn of\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nIt happened but too often, according to Plutarch, that the deputies of\r\nthe strongest cities awed and corrupted those of the weaker; and that\r\njudgment went in favor of the most powerful party.\r\n\r\nEven in the midst of defensive and dangerous wars with Persia and\r\nMacedon, the members never acted in concert, and were, more or fewer of\r\nthem, eternally the dupes or the hirelings of the common enemy. The\r\nintervals of foreign war were filled up by domestic vicissitudes\r\nconvulsions, and carnage.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the war with Xerxes, it appears that the\r\nLacedaemonians required that a number of the cities should be turned\r\nout of the confederacy for the unfaithful part they had acted. The\r\nAthenians, finding that the Lacedaemonians would lose fewer partisans\r\nby such a measure than themselves, and would become masters of the\r\npublic deliberations, vigorously opposed and defeated the attempt. This\r\npiece of history proves at once the inefficiency of the union, the\r\nambition and jealousy of its most powerful members, and the dependent\r\nand degraded condition of the rest. The smaller members, though\r\nentitled by the theory of their system to revolve in equal pride and\r\nmajesty around the common center, had become, in fact, satellites of\r\nthe orbs of primary magnitude.\r\n\r\nHad the Greeks, says the Abbe Milot, been as wise as they were\r\ncourageous, they would have been admonished by experience of the\r\nnecessity of a closer union, and would have availed themselves of the\r\npeace which followed their success against the Persian arms, to\r\nestablish such a reformation. Instead of this obvious policy, Athens\r\nand Sparta, inflated with the victories and the glory they had\r\nacquired, became first rivals and then enemies; and did each other\r\ninfinitely more mischief than they had suffered from Xerxes. Their\r\nmutual jealousies, fears, hatreds, and injuries ended in the celebrated\r\nPeloponnesian war; which itself ended in the ruin and slavery of the\r\nAthenians who had begun it.\r\n\r\nAs a weak government, when not at war, is ever agitated by internal\r\ndissentions, so these never fail to bring on fresh calamities from\r\nabroad. The Phocians having ploughed up some consecrated ground\r\nbelonging to the temple of Apollo, the Amphictyonic council, according\r\nto the superstition of the age, imposed a fine on the sacrilegious\r\noffenders. The Phocians, being abetted by Athens and Sparta, refused to\r\nsubmit to the decree. The Thebans, with others of the cities, undertook\r\nto maintain the authority of the Amphictyons, and to avenge the\r\nviolated god. The latter, being the weaker party, invited the\r\nassistance of Philip of Macedon, who had secretly fostered the contest.\r\nPhilip gladly seized the opportunity of executing the designs he had\r\nlong planned against the liberties of Greece. By his intrigues and\r\nbribes he won over to his interests the popular leaders of several\r\ncities; by their influence and votes, gained admission into the\r\nAmphictyonic council; and by his arts and his arms, made himself master\r\nof the confederacy.\r\n\r\nSuch were the consequences of the fallacious principle on which this\r\ninteresting establishment was founded. Had Greece, says a judicious\r\nobserver on her fate, been united by a stricter confederation, and\r\npersevered in her union, she would never have worn the chains of\r\nMacedon; and might have proved a barrier to the vast projects of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Achaean league, as it is called, was another society of Grecian\r\nrepublics, which supplies us with valuable instruction.\r\n\r\nThe Union here was far more intimate, and its organization much wiser,\r\nthan in the preceding instance. It will accordingly appear, that though\r\nnot exempt from a similar catastrophe, it by no means equally deserved\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe cities composing this league retained their municipal jurisdiction,\r\nappointed their own officers, and enjoyed a perfect equality. The\r\nsenate, in which they were represented, had the sole and exclusive\r\nright of peace and war; of sending and receiving ambassadors; of\r\nentering into treaties and alliances; of appointing a chief magistrate\r\nor praetor, as he was called, who commanded their armies, and who, with\r\nthe advice and consent of ten of the senators, not only administered\r\nthe government in the recess of the senate, but had a great share in\r\nits deliberations, when assembled. According to the primitive\r\nconstitution, there were two praetors associated in the administration;\r\nbut on trial a single one was preferred.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the cities had all the same laws and customs, the same\r\nweights and measures, and the same money. But how far this effect\r\nproceeded from the authority of the federal council is left in\r\nuncertainty. It is said only that the cities were in a manner compelled\r\nto receive the same laws and usages. When Lacedaemon was brought into\r\nthe league by Philopoemen, it was attended with an abolition of the\r\ninstitutions and laws of Lycurgus, and an adoption of those of the\r\nAchaeans. The Amphictyonic confederacy, of which she had been a member,\r\nleft her in the full exercise of her government and her legislation.\r\nThis circumstance alone proves a very material difference in the genius\r\nof the two systems.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that such imperfect monuments remain of this\r\ncurious political fabric. Could its interior structure and regular\r\noperation be ascertained, it is probable that more light would be\r\nthrown by it on the science of federal government, than by any of the\r\nlike experiments with which we are acquainted.\r\n\r\nOne important fact seems to be witnessed by all the historians who take\r\nnotice of Achaean affairs. It is, that as well after the renovation of\r\nthe league by Aratus, as before its dissolution by the arts of Macedon,\r\nthere was infinitely more of moderation and justice in the\r\nadministration of its government, and less of violence and sedition in\r\nthe people, than were to be found in any of the cities exercising\r\nSINGLY all the prerogatives of sovereignty. The Abbe Mably, in his\r\nobservations on Greece, says that the popular government, which was so\r\ntempestuous elsewhere, caused no disorders in the members of the\r\nAchaean republic, BECAUSE IT WAS THERE TEMPERED BY THE GENERAL\r\nAUTHORITY AND LAWS OF THE CONFEDERACY.\r\n\r\nWe are not to conclude too hastily, however, that faction did not, in a\r\ncertain degree, agitate the particular cities; much less that a due\r\nsubordination and harmony reigned in the general system. The contrary\r\nis sufficiently displayed in the vicissitudes and fate of the republic.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Amphictyonic confederacy remained, that of the Achaeans,\r\nwhich comprehended the less important cities only, made little figure\r\non the theatre of Greece. When the former became a victim to Macedon,\r\nthe latter was spared by the policy of Philip and Alexander. Under the\r\nsuccessors of these princes, however, a different policy prevailed. The\r\narts of division were practiced among the Achaeans. Each city was\r\nseduced into a separate interest; the union was dissolved. Some of the\r\ncities fell under the tyranny of Macedonian garrisons; others under\r\nthat of usurpers springing out of their own confusions. Shame and\r\noppression erelong awaken their love of liberty. A few cities reunited.\r\nTheir example was followed by others, as opportunities were found of\r\ncutting off their tyrants. The league soon embraced almost the whole\r\nPeloponnesus. Macedon saw its progress; but was hindered by internal\r\ndissensions from stopping it. All Greece caught the enthusiasm and\r\nseemed ready to unite in one confederacy, when the jealousy and envy in\r\nSparta and Athens, of the rising glory of the Achaeans, threw a fatal\r\ndamp on the enterprise. The dread of the Macedonian power induced the\r\nleague to court the alliance of the Kings of Egypt and Syria, who, as\r\nsuccessors of Alexander, were rivals of the king of Macedon. This\r\npolicy was defeated by Cleomenes, king of Sparta, who was led by his\r\nambition to make an unprovoked attack on his neighbors, the Achaeans,\r\nand who, as an enemy to Macedon, had interest enough with the Egyptian\r\nand Syrian princes to effect a breach of their engagements with the\r\nleague.\r\n\r\nThe Achaeans were now reduced to the dilemma of submitting to\r\nCleomenes, or of supplicating the aid of Macedon, its former oppressor.\r\nThe latter expedient was adopted. The contests of the Greeks always\r\nafforded a pleasing opportunity to that powerful neighbor of\r\nintermeddling in their affairs. A Macedonian army quickly appeared.\r\nCleomenes was vanquished. The Achaeans soon experienced, as often\r\nhappens, that a victorious and powerful ally is but another name for a\r\nmaster. All that their most abject compliances could obtain from him\r\nwas a toleration of the exercise of their laws. Philip, who was now on\r\nthe throne of Macedon, soon provoked by his tyrannies, fresh\r\ncombinations among the Greeks. The Achaeans, though weakened by\r\ninternal dissensions and by the revolt of Messene, one of its members,\r\nbeing joined by the AEtolians and Athenians, erected the standard of\r\nopposition. Finding themselves, though thus supported, unequal to the\r\nundertaking, they once more had recourse to the dangerous expedient of\r\nintroducing the succor of foreign arms. The Romans, to whom the\r\ninvitation was made, eagerly embraced it. Philip was conquered; Macedon\r\nsubdued. A new crisis ensued to the league. Dissensions broke out among\r\nit members. These the Romans fostered. Callicrates and other popular\r\nleaders became mercenary instruments for inveigling their countrymen.\r\nThe more effectually to nourish discord and disorder the Romans had, to\r\nthe astonishment of those who confided in their sincerity, already\r\nproclaimed universal liberty[1] throughout Greece. With the same\r\ninsidious views, they now seduced the members from the league, by\r\nrepresenting to their pride the violation it committed on their\r\nsovereignty. By these arts this union, the last hope of Greece, the\r\nlast hope of ancient liberty, was torn into pieces; and such imbecility\r\nand distraction introduced, that the arms of Rome found little\r\ndifficulty in completing the ruin which their arts had commenced. The\r\nAchaeans were cut to pieces, and Achaia loaded with chains, under which\r\nit is groaning at this hour.\r\n\r\nI have thought it not superfluous to give the outlines of this\r\nimportant portion of history; both because it teaches more than one\r\nlesson, and because, as a supplement to the outlines of the Achaean\r\nconstitution, it emphatically illustrates the tendency of federal\r\nbodies rather to anarchy among the members, than to tyranny in the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] This was but another name more specious for the independence of\r\n the members on the federal head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XIX.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union)\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON AND MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe examples of ancient confederacies, cited in my last paper, have not\r\nexhausted the source of experimental instruction on this subject. There\r\nare existing institutions, founded on a similar principle, which merit\r\nparticular consideration. The first which presents itself is the\r\nGermanic body.\r\n\r\nIn the early ages of Christianity, Germany was occupied by seven\r\ndistinct nations, who had no common chief. The Franks, one of the\r\nnumber, having conquered the Gauls, established the kingdom which has\r\ntaken its name from them. In the ninth century Charlemagne, its warlike\r\nmonarch, carried his victorious arms in every direction; and Germany\r\nbecame a part of his vast dominions. On the dismemberment, which took\r\nplace under his sons, this part was erected into a separate and\r\nindependent empire. Charlemagne and his immediate descendants possessed\r\nthe reality, as well as the ensigns and dignity of imperial power. But\r\nthe principal vassals, whose fiefs had become hereditary, and who\r\ncomposed the national diets which Charlemagne had not abolished,\r\ngradually threw off the yoke and advanced to sovereign jurisdiction and\r\nindependence. The force of imperial sovereignty was insufficient to\r\nrestrain such powerful dependants; or to preserve the unity and\r\ntranquillity of the empire. The most furious private wars, accompanied\r\nwith every species of calamity, were carried on between the different\r\nprinces and states. The imperial authority, unable to maintain the\r\npublic order, declined by degrees till it was almost extinct in the\r\nanarchy, which agitated the long interval between the death of the last\r\nemperor of the Suabian, and the accession of the first emperor of the\r\nAustrian lines. In the eleventh century the emperors enjoyed full\r\nsovereignty: In the fifteenth they had little more than the symbols and\r\ndecorations of power.\r\n\r\nOut of this feudal system, which has itself many of the important\r\nfeatures of a confederacy, has grown the federal system which\r\nconstitutes the Germanic empire. Its powers are vested in a diet\r\nrepresenting the component members of the confederacy; in the emperor,\r\nwho is the executive magistrate, with a negative on the decrees of the\r\ndiet; and in the imperial chamber and the aulic council, two judiciary\r\ntribunals having supreme jurisdiction in controversies which concern\r\nthe empire, or which happen among its members.\r\n\r\nThe diet possesses the general power of legislating for the empire; of\r\nmaking war and peace; contracting alliances; assessing quotas of troops\r\nand money; constructing fortresses; regulating coin; admitting new\r\nmembers; and subjecting disobedient members to the ban of the empire,\r\nby which the party is degraded from his sovereign rights and his\r\npossessions forfeited. The members of the confederacy are expressly\r\nrestricted from entering into compacts prejudicial to the empire; from\r\nimposing tolls and duties on their mutual intercourse, without the\r\nconsent of the emperor and diet; from altering the value of money; from\r\ndoing injustice to one another; or from affording assistance or retreat\r\nto disturbers of the public peace. And the ban is denounced against\r\nsuch as shall violate any of these restrictions. The members of the\r\ndiet, as such, are subject in all cases to be judged by the emperor and\r\ndiet, and in their private capacities by the aulic council and imperial\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nThe prerogatives of the emperor are numerous. The most important of\r\nthem are: his exclusive right to make propositions to the diet; to\r\nnegative its resolutions; to name ambassadors; to confer dignities and\r\ntitles; to fill vacant electorates; to found universities; to grant\r\nprivileges not injurious to the states of the empire; to receive and\r\napply the public revenues; and generally to watch over the public\r\nsafety. In certain cases, the electors form a council to him. In\r\nquality of emperor, he possesses no territory within the empire, nor\r\nreceives any revenue for his support. But his revenue and dominions, in\r\nother qualities, constitute him one of the most powerful princes in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nFrom such a parade of constitutional powers, in the representatives and\r\nhead of this confederacy, the natural supposition would be, that it\r\nmust form an exception to the general character which belongs to its\r\nkindred systems. Nothing would be further from the reality. The\r\nfundamental principle on which it rests, that the empire is a community\r\nof sovereigns, that the diet is a representation of sovereigns and that\r\nthe laws are addressed to sovereigns, renders the empire a nerveless\r\nbody, incapable of regulating its own members, insecure against\r\nexternal dangers, and agitated with unceasing fermentations in its own\r\nbowels.\r\n\r\nThe history of Germany is a history of wars between the emperor and the\r\nprinces and states; of wars among the princes and states themselves; of\r\nthe licentiousness of the strong, and the oppression of the weak; of\r\nforeign intrusions, and foreign intrigues; of requisitions of men and\r\nmoney disregarded, or partially complied with; of attempts to enforce\r\nthem, altogether abortive, or attended with slaughter and desolation,\r\ninvolving the innocent with the guilty; of general inbecility,\r\nconfusion, and misery.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, the emperor, with one part of the empire on\r\nhis side, was seen engaged against the other princes and states. In one\r\nof the conflicts, the emperor himself was put to flight, and very near\r\nbeing made prisoner by the elector of Saxony. The late king of Prussia\r\nwas more than once pitted against his imperial sovereign; and commonly\r\nproved an overmatch for him. Controversies and wars among the members\r\nthemselves have been so common, that the German annals are crowded with\r\nthe bloody pages which describe them. Previous to the peace of\r\nWestphalia, Germany was desolated by a war of thirty years, in which\r\nthe emperor, with one half of the empire, was on one side, and Sweden,\r\nwith the other half, on the opposite side. Peace was at length\r\nnegotiated, and dictated by foreign powers; and the articles of it, to\r\nwhich foreign powers are parties, made a fundamental part of the\r\nGermanic constitution.\r\n\r\nIf the nation happens, on any emergency, to be more united by the\r\nnecessity of self-defense, its situation is still deplorable. Military\r\npreparations must be preceded by so many tedious discussions, arising\r\nfrom the jealousies, pride, separate views, and clashing pretensions of\r\nsovereign bodies, that before the diet can settle the arrangements, the\r\nenemy are in the field; and before the federal troops are ready to take\r\nit, are retiring into winter quarters.\r\n\r\nThe small body of national troops, which has been judged necessary in\r\ntime of peace, is defectively kept up, badly paid, infected with local\r\nprejudices, and supported by irregular and disproportionate\r\ncontributions to the treasury.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of maintaining order and dispensing justice among\r\nthese sovereign subjects, produced the experiment of dividing the\r\nempire into nine or ten circles or districts; of giving them an\r\ninterior organization, and of charging them with the military execution\r\nof the laws against delinquent and contumacious members. This\r\nexperiment has only served to demonstrate more fully the radical vice\r\nof the constitution. Each circle is the miniature picture of the\r\ndeformities of this political monster. They either fail to execute\r\ntheir commissions, or they do it with all the devastation and carnage\r\nof civil war. Sometimes whole circles are defaulters; and then they\r\nincrease the mischief which they were instituted to remedy.\r\n\r\nWe may form some judgment of this scheme of military coercion from a\r\nsample given by Thuanus. In Donawerth, a free and imperial city of the\r\ncircle of Suabia, the Abb 300 de St. Croix enjoyed certain immunities\r\nwhich had been reserved to him. In the exercise of these, on some\r\npublic occasions, outrages were committed on him by the people of the\r\ncity. The consequence was that the city was put under the ban of the\r\nempire, and the Duke of Bavaria, though director of another circle,\r\nobtained an appointment to enforce it. He soon appeared before the city\r\nwith a corps of ten thousand troops, and finding it a fit occasion, as\r\nhe had secretly intended from the beginning, to revive an antiquated\r\nclaim, on the pretext that his ancestors had suffered the place to be\r\ndismembered from his territory,[1] he took possession of it in his own\r\nname, disarmed, and punished the inhabitants, and reannexed the city to\r\nhis domains.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, perhaps, what has so long kept this disjointed machine\r\nfrom falling entirely to pieces? The answer is obvious: The weakness of\r\nmost of the members, who are unwilling to expose themselves to the\r\nmercy of foreign powers; the weakness of most of the principal members,\r\ncompared with the formidable powers all around them; the vast weight\r\nand influence which the emperor derives from his separate and\r\nheriditary dominions; and the interest he feels in preserving a system\r\nwith which his family pride is connected, and which constitutes him the\r\nfirst prince in Europe; —these causes support a feeble and precarious\r\nUnion; whilst the repellant quality, incident to the nature of\r\nsovereignty, and which time continually strengthens, prevents any\r\nreform whatever, founded on a proper consolidation. Nor is it to be\r\nimagined, if this obstacle could be surmounted, that the neighboring\r\npowers would suffer a revolution to take place which would give to the\r\nempire the force and preeminence to which it is entitled. Foreign\r\nnations have long considered themselves as interested in the changes\r\nmade by events in this constitution; and have, on various occasions,\r\nbetrayed their policy of perpetuating its anarchy and weakness.\r\n\r\nIf more direct examples were wanting, Poland, as a government over\r\nlocal sovereigns, might not improperly be taken notice of. Nor could\r\nany proof more striking be given of the calamities flowing from such\r\ninstitutions. Equally unfit for self-government and self-defense, it\r\nhas long been at the mercy of its powerful neighbors; who have lately\r\nhad the mercy to disburden it of one third of its people and\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nThe connection among the Swiss cantons scarcely amounts to a\r\nconfederacy; though it is sometimes cited as an instance of the\r\nstability of such institutions.\r\n\r\nThey have no common treasury; no common troops even in war; no common\r\ncoin; no common judicatory; nor any other common mark of sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThey are kept together by the peculiarity of their topographical\r\nposition; by their individual weakness and insignificancy; by the fear\r\nof powerful neighbors, to one of which they were formerly subject; by\r\nthe few sources of contention among a people of such simple and\r\nhomogeneous manners; by their joint interest in their dependent\r\npossessions; by the mutual aid they stand in need of, for suppressing\r\ninsurrections and rebellions, an aid expressly stipulated and often\r\nrequired and afforded; and by the necessity of some regular and\r\npermanent provision for accomodating disputes among the cantons. The\r\nprovision is, that the parties at variance shall each choose four\r\njudges out of the neutral cantons, who, in case of disagreement, choose\r\nan umpire. This tribunal, under an oath of impartiality, pronounces\r\ndefinitive sentence, which all the cantons are bound to enforce. The\r\ncompetency of this regulation may be estimated by a clause in their\r\ntreaty of 1683, with Victor Amadeus of Savoy; in which he obliges\r\nhimself to interpose as mediator in disputes between the cantons, and\r\nto employ force, if necessary, against the contumacious party.\r\n\r\nSo far as the peculiarity of their case will admit of comparison with\r\nthat of the United States, it serves to confirm the principle intended\r\nto be established. Whatever efficacy the union may have had in ordinary\r\ncases, it appears that the moment a cause of difference sprang up,\r\ncapable of trying its strength, it failed. The controversies on the\r\nsubject of religion, which in three instances have kindled violent and\r\nbloody contests, may be said, in fact, to have severed the league. The\r\nProtestant and Catholic cantons have since had their separate diets,\r\nwhere all the most important concerns are adjusted, and which have left\r\nthe general diet little other business than to take care of the common\r\nbailages.\r\n\r\nThat separation had another consequence, which merits attention. It\r\nproduced opposite alliances with foreign powers: of Berne, at the head\r\nof the Protestant association, with the United Provinces; and of\r\nLuzerne, at the head of the Catholic association, with France.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] Pfeffel, “Nouvel Abrég. Chronol. de l’Hist., etc., d’Allemagne,”\r\n says the pretext was to indemnify himself for the expense of the\r\n expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XX.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, December 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON AND MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe United Netherlands are a confederacy of republics, or rather of\r\naristocracies of a very remarkable texture, yet confirming all the\r\nlessons derived from those which we have already reviewed.\r\n\r\nThe union is composed of seven coequal and sovereign states, and each\r\nstate or province is a composition of equal and independent cities. In\r\nall important cases, not only the provinces but the cities must be\r\nunanimous.\r\n\r\nThe sovereignty of the Union is represented by the States-General,\r\nconsisting usually of about fifty deputies appointed by the provinces.\r\nThey hold their seats, some for life, some for six, three, and one\r\nyears; from two provinces they continue in appointment during pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe States-General have authority to enter into treaties and alliances;\r\nto make war and peace; to raise armies and equip fleets; to ascertain\r\nquotas and demand contributions. In all these cases, however, unanimity\r\nand the sanction of their constituents are requisite. They have\r\nauthority to appoint and receive ambassadors; to execute treaties and\r\nalliances already formed; to provide for the collection of duties on\r\nimports and exports; to regulate the mint, with a saving to the\r\nprovincial rights; to govern as sovereigns the dependent territories.\r\nThe provinces are restrained, unless with the general consent, from\r\nentering into foreign treaties; from establishing imposts injurious to\r\nothers, or charging their neighbors with higher duties than their own\r\nsubjects. A council of state, a chamber of accounts, with five colleges\r\nof admiralty, aid and fortify the federal administration.\r\n\r\nThe executive magistrate of the union is the stadtholder, who is now an\r\nhereditary prince. His principal weight and influence in the republic\r\nare derived from this independent title; from his great patrimonial\r\nestates; from his family connections with some of the chief potentates\r\nof Europe; and, more than all, perhaps, from his being stadtholder in\r\nthe several provinces, as well as for the union; in which provincial\r\nquality he has the appointment of town magistrates under certain\r\nregulations, executes provincial decrees, presides when he pleases in\r\nthe provincial tribunals, and has throughout the power of pardon.\r\n\r\nAs stadtholder of the union, he has, however, considerable\r\nprerogatives.\r\n\r\nIn his political capacity he has authority to settle disputes between\r\nthe provinces, when other methods fail; to assist at the deliberations\r\nof the States-General, and at their particular conferences; to give\r\naudiences to foreign ambassadors, and to keep agents for his particular\r\naffairs at foreign courts.\r\n\r\nIn his military capacity he commands the federal troops, provides for\r\ngarrisons, and in general regulates military affairs; disposes of all\r\nappointments, from colonels to ensigns, and of the governments and\r\nposts of fortified towns.\r\n\r\nIn his marine capacity he is admiral-general, and superintends and\r\ndirects every thing relative to naval forces and other naval affairs;\r\npresides in the admiralties in person or by proxy; appoints\r\nlieutenant-admirals and other officers; and establishes councils of\r\nwar, whose sentences are not executed till he approves them.\r\n\r\nHis revenue, exclusive of his private income, amounts to three hundred\r\nthousand florins. The standing army which he commands consists of about\r\nforty thousand men.\r\n\r\nSuch is the nature of the celebrated Belgic confederacy, as delineated\r\non parchment. What are the characters which practice has stamped upon\r\nit? Imbecility in the government; discord among the provinces; foreign\r\ninfluence and indignities; a precarious existence in peace, and\r\npeculiar calamities from war.\r\n\r\nIt was long ago remarked by Grotius, that nothing but the hatred of his\r\ncountrymen to the house of Austria kept them from being ruined by the\r\nvices of their constitution.\r\n\r\nThe union of Utrecht, says another respectable writer, reposes an\r\nauthority in the States-General, seemingly sufficient to secure\r\nharmony, but the jealousy in each province renders the practice very\r\ndifferent from the theory.\r\n\r\nThe same instrument, says another, obliges each province to levy\r\ncertain contributions; but this article never could, and probably never\r\nwill, be executed; because the inland provinces, who have little\r\ncommerce, cannot pay an equal quota.\r\n\r\nIn matters of contribution, it is the practice to waive the articles of\r\nthe constitution. The danger of delay obliges the consenting provinces\r\nto furnish their quotas, without waiting for the others; and then to\r\nobtain reimbursement from the others, by deputations, which are\r\nfrequent, or otherwise, as they can. The great wealth and influence of\r\nthe province of Holland enable her to effect both these purposes.\r\n\r\nIt has more than once happened, that the deficiencies had to be\r\nultimately collected at the point of the bayonet; a thing practicable,\r\nthough dreadful, in a confedracy where one of the members exceeds in\r\nforce all the rest, and where several of them are too small to meditate\r\nresistance; but utterly impracticable in one composed of members,\r\nseveral of which are equal to each other in strength and resources, and\r\nequal singly to a vigorous and persevering defense.\r\n\r\nForeign ministers, says Sir William Temple, who was himself a foreign\r\nminister, elude matters taken ad referendum, by tampering with the\r\nprovinces and cities. In 1726, the treaty of Hanover was delayed by\r\nthese means a whole year. Instances of a like nature are numerous and\r\nnotorious.\r\n\r\nIn critical emergencies, the States-General are often compelled to\r\noverleap their constitutional bounds. In 1688, they concluded a treaty\r\nof themselves at the risk of their heads. The treaty of Westphalia, in\r\n1648, by which their independence was formerly and finally recognized,\r\nwas concluded without the consent of Zealand. Even as recently as the\r\nlast treaty of peace with Great Britain, the constitutional principle\r\nof unanimity was departed from. A weak constitution must necessarily\r\nterminate in dissolution, for want of proper powers, or the usurpation\r\nof powers requisite for the public safety. Whether the usurpation, when\r\nonce begun, will stop at the salutary point, or go forward to the\r\ndangerous extreme, must depend on the contingencies of the moment.\r\nTyranny has perhaps oftener grown out of the assumptions of power,\r\ncalled for, on pressing exigencies, by a defective constitution, than\r\nout of the full exercise of the largest constitutional authorities.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the calamities produced by the stadtholdership, it has\r\nbeen supposed that without his influence in the individual provinces,\r\nthe causes of anarchy manifest in the confederacy would long ago have\r\ndissolved it. “Under such a government,” says the Abbe Mably, “the\r\nUnion could never have subsisted, if the provinces had not a spring\r\nwithin themselves, capable of quickening their tardiness, and\r\ncompelling them to the same way of thinking. This spring is the\r\nstadtholder.” It is remarked by Sir William Temple, “that in the\r\nintermissions of the stadtholdership, Holland, by her riches and her\r\nauthority, which drew the others into a sort of dependence, supplied\r\nthe place.”\r\n\r\nThese are not the only circumstances which have controlled the tendency\r\nto anarchy and dissolution. The surrounding powers impose an absolute\r\nnecessity of union to a certain degree, at the same time that they\r\nnourish by their intrigues the constitutional vices which keep the\r\nrepublic in some degree always at their mercy.\r\n\r\nThe true patriots have long bewailed the fatal tendency of these vices,\r\nand have made no less than four regular experiments by EXTRAORDINARY\r\nASSEMBLIES, convened for the special purpose, to apply a remedy. As\r\nmany times has their laudable zeal found it impossible to UNITE THE\r\nPUBLIC COUNCILS in reforming the known, the acknowledged, the fatal\r\nevils of the existing constitution. Let us pause, my fellow-citizens,\r\nfor one moment, over this melancholy and monitory lesson of history;\r\nand with the tear that drops for the calamities brought on mankind by\r\ntheir adverse opinions and selfish passions, let our gratitude mingle\r\nan ejaculation to Heaven, for the propitious concord which has\r\ndistinguished the consultations for our political happiness.\r\n\r\nA design was also conceived of establishing a general tax to be\r\nadministered by the federal authority. This also had its adversaries\r\nand failed.\r\n\r\nThis unhappy people seem to be now suffering from popular convulsions,\r\nfrom dissensions among the states, and from the actual invasion of\r\nforeign arms, the crisis of their destiny. All nations have their eyes\r\nfixed on the awful spectacle. The first wish prompted by humanity is,\r\nthat this severe trial may issue in such a revolution of their\r\ngovernment as will establish their union, and render it the parent of\r\ntranquillity, freedom and happiness: The next, that the asylum under\r\nwhich, we trust, the enjoyment of these blessings will speedily be\r\nsecured in this country, may receive and console them for the\r\ncatastrophe of their own.\r\n\r\nI make no apology for having dwelt so long on the contemplation of\r\nthese federal precedents. Experience is the oracle of truth; and where\r\nits responses are unequivocal, they ought to be conclusive and sacred.\r\nThe important truth, which it unequivocally pronounces in the present\r\ncase, is that a sovereignty over sovereigns, a government over\r\ngovernments, a legislation for communities, as contradistinguished from\r\nindividuals, as it is a solecism in theory, so in practice it is\r\nsubversive of the order and ends of civil polity, by substituting\r\nVIOLENCE in place of LAW, or the destructive COERCION of the SWORD in\r\nplace of the mild and salutary COERCION of the MAGISTRACY.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXI.\r\n\r\nOther Defects of the Present Confederation\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nHaving in the three last numbers taken a summary review of the\r\nprincipal circumstances and events which have depicted the genius and\r\nfate of other confederate governments, I shall now proceed in the\r\nenumeration of the most important of those defects which have hitherto\r\ndisappointed our hopes from the system established among ourselves. To\r\nform a safe and satisfactory judgment of the proper remedy, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary that we should be well acquainted with the extent\r\nand malignity of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe next most palpable defect of the subsisting Confederation, is the\r\ntotal want of a SANCTION to its laws. The United States, as now\r\ncomposed, have no powers to exact obedience, or punish disobedience to\r\ntheir resolutions, either by pecuniary mulcts, by a suspension or\r\ndivestiture of privileges, or by any other constitutional mode. There\r\nis no express delegation of authority to them to use force against\r\ndelinquent members; and if such a right should be ascribed to the\r\nfederal head, as resulting from the nature of the social compact\r\nbetween the States, it must be by inference and construction, in the\r\nface of that part of the second article, by which it is declared, “that\r\neach State shall retain every power, jurisdiction, and right, not\r\nEXPRESSLY delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.” There\r\nis, doubtless, a striking absurdity in supposing that a right of this\r\nkind does not exist, but we are reduced to the dilemma either of\r\nembracing that supposition, preposterous as it may seem, or of\r\ncontravening or explaining away a provision, which has been of late a\r\nrepeated theme of the eulogies of those who oppose the new\r\nConstitution; and the want of which, in that plan, has been the subject\r\nof much plausible animadversion, and severe criticism. If we are\r\nunwilling to impair the force of this applauded provision, we shall be\r\nobliged to conclude, that the United States afford the extraordinary\r\nspectacle of a government destitute even of the shadow of\r\nconstitutional power to enforce the execution of its own laws. It will\r\nappear, from the specimens which have been cited, that the American\r\nConfederacy, in this particular, stands discriminated from every other\r\ninstitution of a similar kind, and exhibits a new and unexampled\r\nphenomenon in the political world.\r\n\r\nThe want of a mutual guaranty of the State governments is another\r\ncapital imperfection in the federal plan. There is nothing of this kind\r\ndeclared in the articles that compose it; and to imply a tacit guaranty\r\nfrom considerations of utility, would be a still more flagrant\r\ndeparture from the clause which has been mentioned, than to imply a\r\ntacit power of coercion from the like considerations. The want of a\r\nguaranty, though it might in its consequences endanger the Union, does\r\nnot so immediately attack its existence as the want of a constitutional\r\nsanction to its laws.\r\n\r\nWithout a guaranty the assistance to be derived from the Union in\r\nrepelling those domestic dangers which may sometimes threaten the\r\nexistence of the State constitutions, must be renounced. Usurpation may\r\nrear its crest in each State, and trample upon the liberties of the\r\npeople, while the national government could legally do nothing more\r\nthan behold its encroachments with indignation and regret. A successful\r\nfaction may erect a tyranny on the ruins of order and law, while no\r\nsuccor could constitutionally be afforded by the Union to the friends\r\nand supporters of the government. The tempestuous situation from which\r\nMassachusetts has scarcely emerged, evinces that dangers of this kind\r\nare not merely speculative. Who can determine what might have been the\r\nissue of her late convulsions, if the malcontents had been headed by a\r\nCaesar or by a Cromwell? Who can predict what effect a despotism,\r\nestablished in Massachusetts, would have upon the liberties of New\r\nHampshire or Rhode Island, of Connecticut or New York?\r\n\r\nThe inordinate pride of State importance has suggested to some minds an\r\nobjection to the principle of a guaranty in the federal government, as\r\ninvolving an officious interference in the domestic concerns of the\r\nmembers. A scruple of this kind would deprive us of one of the\r\nprincipal advantages to be expected from union, and can only flow from\r\na misapprehension of the nature of the provision itself. It could be no\r\nimpediment to reforms of the State constitution by a majority of the\r\npeople in a legal and peaceable mode. This right would remain\r\nundiminished. The guaranty could only operate against changes to be\r\neffected by violence. Towards the preventions of calamities of this\r\nkind, too many checks cannot be provided. The peace of society and the\r\nstability of government depend absolutely on the efficacy of the\r\nprecautions adopted on this head. Where the whole power of the\r\ngovernment is in the hands of the people, there is the less pretense\r\nfor the use of violent remedies in partial or occasional distempers of\r\nthe State. The natural cure for an ill-administration, in a popular or\r\nrepresentative constitution, is a change of men. A guaranty by the\r\nnational authority would be as much levelled against the usurpations of\r\nrulers as against the ferments and outrages of faction and sedition in\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nThe principle of regulating the contributions of the States to the\r\ncommon treasury by QUOTAS is another fundamental error in the\r\nConfederation. Its repugnancy to an adequate supply of the national\r\nexigencies has been already pointed out, and has sufficiently appeared\r\nfrom the trial which has been made of it. I speak of it now solely with\r\na view to equality among the States. Those who have been accustomed to\r\ncontemplate the circumstances which produce and constitute national\r\nwealth, must be satisfied that there is no common standard or barometer\r\nby which the degrees of it can be ascertained. Neither the value of\r\nlands, nor the numbers of the people, which have been successively\r\nproposed as the rule of State contributions, has any pretension to\r\nbeing a just representative. If we compare the wealth of the United\r\nNetherlands with that of Russia or Germany, or even of France, and if\r\nwe at the same time compare the total value of the lands and the\r\naggregate population of that contracted district with the total value\r\nof the lands and the aggregate population of the immense regions of\r\neither of the three last-mentioned countries, we shall at once discover\r\nthat there is no comparison between the proportion of either of these\r\ntwo objects and that of the relative wealth of those nations. If the\r\nlike parallel were to be run between several of the American States, it\r\nwould furnish a like result. Let Virginia be contrasted with North\r\nCarolina, Pennsylvania with Connecticut, or Maryland with New Jersey,\r\nand we shall be convinced that the respective abilities of those\r\nStates, in relation to revenue, bear little or no analogy to their\r\ncomparative stock in lands or to their comparative population. The\r\nposition may be equally illustrated by a similar process between the\r\ncounties of the same State. No man who is acquainted with the State of\r\nNew York will doubt that the active wealth of King’s County bears a\r\nmuch greater proportion to that of Montgomery than it would appear to\r\nbe if we should take either the total value of the lands or the total\r\nnumber of the people as a criterion!\r\n\r\nThe wealth of nations depends upon an infinite variety of causes.\r\nSituation, soil, climate, the nature of the productions, the nature of\r\nthe government, the genius of the citizens, the degree of information\r\nthey possess, the state of commerce, of arts, of industry, these\r\ncircumstances and many more, too complex, minute, or adventitious to\r\nadmit of a particular specification, occasion differences hardly\r\nconceivable in the relative opulence and riches of different countries.\r\nThe consequence clearly is that there can be no common measure of\r\nnational wealth, and, of course, no general or stationary rule by which\r\nthe ability of a state to pay taxes can be determined. The attempt,\r\ntherefore, to regulate the contributions of the members of a\r\nconfederacy by any such rule, cannot fail to be productive of glaring\r\ninequality and extreme oppression.\r\n\r\nThis inequality would of itself be sufficient in America to work the\r\neventual destruction of the Union, if any mode of enforcing a\r\ncompliance with its requisitions could be devised. The suffering States\r\nwould not long consent to remain associated upon a principle which\r\ndistributes the public burdens with so unequal a hand, and which was\r\ncalculated to impoverish and oppress the citizens of some States, while\r\nthose of others would scarcely be conscious of the small proportion of\r\nthe weight they were required to sustain. This, however, is an evil\r\ninseparable from the principle of quotas and requisitions.\r\n\r\nThere is no method of steering clear of this inconvenience, but by\r\nauthorizing the national government to raise its own revenues in its\r\nown way. Imposts, excises, and, in general, all duties upon articles of\r\nconsumption, may be compared to a fluid, which will, in time, find its\r\nlevel with the means of paying them. The amount to be contributed by\r\neach citizen will in a degree be at his own option, and can be\r\nregulated by an attention to his resources. The rich may be\r\nextravagant, the poor can be frugal; and private oppression may always\r\nbe avoided by a judicious selection of objects proper for such\r\nimpositions. If inequalities should arise in some States from duties on\r\nparticular objects, these will, in all probability, be counterbalanced\r\nby proportional inequalities in other States, from the duties on other\r\nobjects. In the course of time and things, an equilibrium, as far as it\r\nis attainable in so complicated a subject, will be established\r\neverywhere. Or, if inequalities should still exist, they would neither\r\nbe so great in their degree, so uniform in their operation, nor so\r\nodious in their appearance, as those which would necessarily spring\r\nfrom quotas, upon any scale that can possibly be devised.\r\n\r\nIt is a signal advantage of taxes on articles of consumption, that they\r\ncontain in their own nature a security against excess. They prescribe\r\ntheir own limit; which cannot be exceeded without defeating the end\r\nproposed, that is, an extension of the revenue. When applied to this\r\nobject, the saying is as just as it is witty, that, “in political\r\narithmetic, two and two do not always make four.”\r\n\r\nIf duties are too high, they lessen the consumption; the collection is\r\neluded; and the product to the treasury is not so great as when they\r\nare confined within proper and moderate bounds. This forms a complete\r\nbarrier against any material oppression of the citizens by taxes of\r\nthis class, and is itself a natural limitation of the power of imposing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nImpositions of this kind usually fall under the denomination of\r\nindirect taxes, and must for a long time constitute the chief part of\r\nthe revenue raised in this country. Those of the direct kind, which\r\nprincipally relate to land and buildings, may admit of a rule of\r\napportionment. Either the value of land, or the number of the people,\r\nmay serve as a standard. The state of agriculture and the populousness\r\nof a country have been considered as nearly connected with each other.\r\nAnd, as a rule, for the purpose intended, numbers, in the view of\r\nsimplicity and certainty, are entitled to a preference. In every\r\ncountry it is a herculean task to obtain a valuation of the land; in a\r\ncountry imperfectly settled and progressive in improvement, the\r\ndifficulties are increased almost to impracticability. The expense of\r\nan accurate valuation is, in all situations, a formidable objection. In\r\na branch of taxation where no limits to the discretion of the\r\ngovernment are to be found in the nature of things, the establishment\r\nof a fixed rule, not incompatible with the end, may be attended with\r\nfewer inconveniences than to leave that discretion altogether at large.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXII.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Other Defects of the Present Confederation)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, December 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIn addition to the defects already enumerated in the existing federal\r\nsystem, there are others of not less importance, which concur in\r\nrendering it altogether unfit for the administration of the affairs of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nThe want of a power to regulate commerce is by all parties allowed to\r\nbe of the number. The utility of such a power has been anticipated\r\nunder the first head of our inquiries; and for this reason, as well as\r\nfrom the universal conviction entertained upon the subject, little need\r\nbe added in this place. It is indeed evident, on the most superficial\r\nview, that there is no object, either as it respects the interests of\r\ntrade or finance, that more strongly demands a federal superintendence.\r\nThe want of it has already operated as a bar to the formation of\r\nbeneficial treaties with foreign powers, and has given occasions of\r\ndissatisfaction between the States. No nation acquainted with the\r\nnature of our political association would be unwise enough to enter\r\ninto stipulations with the United States, by which they conceded\r\nprivileges of any importance to them, while they were apprised that the\r\nengagements on the part of the Union might at any moment be violated by\r\nits members, and while they found from experience that they might enjoy\r\nevery advantage they desired in our markets, without granting us any\r\nreturn but such as their momentary convenience might suggest. It is\r\nnot, therefore, to be wondered at that Mr. Jenkinson, in ushering into\r\nthe House of Commons a bill for regulating the temporary intercourse\r\nbetween the two countries, should preface its introduction by a\r\ndeclaration that similar provisions in former bills had been found to\r\nanswer every purpose to the commerce of Great Britain, and that it\r\nwould be prudent to persist in the plan until it should appear whether\r\nthe American government was likely or not to acquire greater\r\nconsistency.[1]\r\n\r\nSeveral States have endeavored, by separate prohibitions, restrictions,\r\nand exclusions, to influence the conduct of that kingdom in this\r\nparticular, but the want of concert, arising from the want of a general\r\nauthority and from clashing and dissimilar views in the State, has\r\nhitherto frustrated every experiment of the kind, and will continue to\r\ndo so as long as the same obstacles to a uniformity of measures\r\ncontinue to exist.\r\n\r\nThe interfering and unneighborly regulations of some States, contrary\r\nto the true spirit of the Union, have, in different instances, given\r\njust cause of umbrage and complaint to others, and it is to be feared\r\nthat examples of this nature, if not restrained by a national control,\r\nwould be multiplied and extended till they became not less serious\r\nsources of animosity and discord than injurious impediments to the\r\nintercourse between the different parts of the Confederacy. “The\r\ncommerce of the German empire[2] is in continual trammels from the\r\nmultiplicity of the duties which the several princes and states exact\r\nupon the merchandises passing through their territories, by means of\r\nwhich the fine streams and navigable rivers with which Germany is so\r\nhappily watered are rendered almost useless.” Though the genius of the\r\npeople of this country might never permit this description to be\r\nstrictly applicable to us, yet we may reasonably expect, from the\r\ngradual conflicts of State regulations, that the citizens of each would\r\nat length come to be considered and treated by the others in no better\r\nlight than that of foreigners and aliens.\r\n\r\nThe power of raising armies, by the most obvious construction of the\r\narticles of the Confederation, is merely a power of making requisitions\r\nupon the States for quotas of men. This practice in the course of the\r\nlate war, was found replete with obstructions to a vigorous and to an\r\neconomical system of defense. It gave birth to a competition between\r\nthe States which created a kind of auction for men. In order to furnish\r\nthe quotas required of them, they outbid each other till bounties grew\r\nto an enormous and insupportable size. The hope of a still further\r\nincrease afforded an inducement to those who were disposed to serve to\r\nprocrastinate their enlistment, and disinclined them from engaging for\r\nany considerable periods. Hence, slow and scanty levies of men, in the\r\nmost critical emergencies of our affairs; short enlistments at an\r\nunparalleled expense; continual fluctuations in the troops, ruinous to\r\ntheir discipline and subjecting the public safety frequently to the\r\nperilous crisis of a disbanded army. Hence, also, those oppressive\r\nexpedients for raising men which were upon several occasions practiced,\r\nand which nothing but the enthusiasm of liberty would have induced the\r\npeople to endure.\r\n\r\nThis method of raising troops is not more unfriendly to economy and\r\nvigor than it is to an equal distribution of the burden. The States\r\nnear the seat of war, influenced by motives of self-preservation, made\r\nefforts to furnish their quotas, which even exceeded their abilities;\r\nwhile those at a distance from danger were, for the most part, as\r\nremiss as the others were diligent, in their exertions. The immediate\r\npressure of this inequality was not in this case, as in that of the\r\ncontributions of money, alleviated by the hope of a final liquidation.\r\nThe States which did not pay their proportions of money might at least\r\nbe charged with their deficiencies; but no account could be formed of\r\nthe deficiencies in the supplies of men. We shall not, however, see\r\nmuch reason to reget the want of this hope, when we consider how little\r\nprospect there is, that the most delinquent States will ever be able to\r\nmake compensation for their pecuniary failures. The system of quotas\r\nand requisitions, whether it be applied to men or money, is, in every\r\nview, a system of imbecility in the Union, and of inequality and\r\ninjustice among the members.\r\n\r\nThe right of equal suffrage among the States is another exceptionable\r\npart of the Confederation. Every idea of proportion and every rule of\r\nfair representation conspire to condemn a principle, which gives to\r\nRhode Island an equal weight in the scale of power with Massachusetts,\r\nor Connecticut, or New York; and to Deleware an equal voice in the\r\nnational deliberations with Pennsylvania, or Virginia, or North\r\nCarolina. Its operation contradicts the fundamental maxim of republican\r\ngovernment, which requires that the sense of the majority should\r\nprevail. Sophistry may reply, that sovereigns are equal, and that a\r\nmajority of the votes of the States will be a majority of confederated\r\nAmerica. But this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the\r\nplain suggestions of justice and common-sense. It may happen that this\r\nmajority of States is a small minority of the people of America;[3] and\r\ntwo thirds of the people of America could not long be persuaded, upon\r\nthe credit of artificial distinctions and syllogistic subtleties, to\r\nsubmit their interests to the management and disposal of one third. The\r\nlarger States would after a while revolt from the idea of receiving the\r\nlaw from the smaller. To acquiesce in such a privation of their due\r\nimportance in the political scale, would be not merely to be insensible\r\nto the love of power, but even to sacrifice the desire of equality. It\r\nis neither rational to expect the first, nor just to require the last.\r\nThe smaller States, considering how peculiarly their safety and welfare\r\ndepend on union, ought readily to renounce a pretension which, if not\r\nrelinquished, would prove fatal to its duration.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected to this, that not seven but nine States, or two\r\nthirds of the whole number, must consent to the most important\r\nresolutions; and it may be thence inferred that nine States would\r\nalways comprehend a majority of the Union. But this does not obviate\r\nthe impropriety of an equal vote between States of the most unequal\r\ndimensions and populousness; nor is the inference accurate in point of\r\nfact; for we can enumerate nine States which contain less than a\r\nmajority of the people;[4] and it is constitutionally possible that\r\nthese nine may give the vote. Besides, there are matters of\r\nconsiderable moment determinable by a bare majority; and there are\r\nothers, concerning which doubts have been entertained, which, if\r\ninterpreted in favor of the sufficiency of a vote of seven States,\r\nwould extend its operation to interests of the first magnitude. In\r\naddition to this, it is to be observed that there is a probability of\r\nan increase in the number of States, and no provision for a\r\nproportional augmentation of the ratio of votes.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all: what at first sight may seem a remedy, is, in\r\nreality, a poison. To give a minority a negative upon the majority\r\n(which is always the case where more than a majority is requisite to a\r\ndecision), is, in its tendency, to subject the sense of the greater\r\nnumber to that of the lesser. Congress, from the nonattendance of a few\r\nStates, have been frequently in the situation of a Polish diet, where a\r\nsingle VOTE has been sufficient to put a stop to all their movements. A\r\nsixtieth part of the Union, which is about the proportion of Delaware\r\nand Rhode Island, has several times been able to oppose an entire bar\r\nto its operations. This is one of those refinements which, in practice,\r\nhas an effect the reverse of what is expected from it in theory. The\r\nnecessity of unanimity in public bodies, or of something approaching\r\ntowards it, has been founded upon a supposition that it would\r\ncontribute to security. But its real operation is to embarrass the\r\nadministration, to destroy the energy of the government, and to\r\nsubstitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant,\r\nturbulent, or corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations and decisions\r\nof a respectable majority. In those emergencies of a nation, in which\r\nthe goodness or badness, the weakness or strength of its government, is\r\nof the greatest importance, there is commonly a necessity for action.\r\nThe public business must, in some way or other, go forward. If a\r\npertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority, respecting\r\nthe best mode of conducting it, the majority, in order that something\r\nmay be done, must conform to the views of the minority; and thus the\r\nsense of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater, and give\r\na tone to the national proceedings. Hence, tedious delays; continual\r\nnegotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good.\r\nAnd yet, in such a system, it is even happy when such compromises can\r\ntake place: for upon some occasions things will not admit of\r\naccommodation; and then the measures of government must be injuriously\r\nsuspended, or fatally defeated. It is often, by the impracticability of\r\nobtaining the concurrence of the necessary number of votes, kept in a\r\nstate of inaction. Its situation must always savor of weakness,\r\nsometimes border upon anarchy.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to discover, that a principle of this kind gives\r\ngreater scope to foreign corruption, as well as to domestic faction,\r\nthan that which permits the sense of the majority to decide; though the\r\ncontrary of this has been presumed. The mistake has proceeded from not\r\nattending with due care to the mischiefs that may be occasioned by\r\nobstructing the progress of government at certain critical seasons.\r\nWhen the concurrence of a large number is required by the Constitution\r\nto the doing of any national act, we are apt to rest satisfied that all\r\nis safe, because nothing improper will be likely TO BE DONE, but we\r\nforget how much good may be prevented, and how much ill may be\r\nproduced, by the power of hindering the doing what may be necessary,\r\nand of keeping affairs in the same unfavorable posture in which they\r\nmay happen to stand at particular periods.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, we were engaged in a war, in conjunction with\r\none foreign nation, against another. Suppose the necessity of our\r\nsituation demanded peace, and the interest or ambition of our ally led\r\nhim to seek the prosecution of the war, with views that might justify\r\nus in making separate terms. In such a state of things, this ally of\r\nours would evidently find it much easier, by his bribes and intrigues,\r\nto tie up the hands of government from making peace, where two thirds\r\nof all the votes were requisite to that object, than where a simple\r\nmajority would suffice. In the first case, he would have to corrupt a\r\nsmaller number; in the last, a greater number. Upon the same principle,\r\nit would be much easier for a foreign power with which we were at war\r\nto perplex our councils and embarrass our exertions. And, in a\r\ncommercial view, we may be subjected to similar inconveniences. A\r\nnation, with which we might have a treaty of commerce, could with much\r\ngreater facility prevent our forming a connection with her competitor\r\nin trade, though such a connection should be ever so beneficial to\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nEvils of this description ought not to be regarded as imaginary. One of\r\nthe weak sides of republics, among their numerous advantages, is that\r\nthey afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption. An hereditary\r\nmonarch, though often disposed to sacrifice his subjects to his\r\nambition, has so great a personal interest in the government and in the\r\nexternal glory of the nation, that it is not easy for a foreign power\r\nto give him an equivalent for what he would sacrifice by treachery to\r\nthe state. The world has accordingly been witness to few examples of\r\nthis species of royal prostitution, though there have been abundant\r\nspecimens of every other kind.\r\n\r\nIn republics, persons elevated from the mass of the community, by the\r\nsuffrages of their fellow-citizens, to stations of great pre-eminence\r\nand power, may find compensations for betraying their trust, which, to\r\nany but minds animated and guided by superior virtue, may appear to\r\nexceed the proportion of interest they have in the common stock, and to\r\noverbalance the obligations of duty. Hence it is that history furnishes\r\nus with so many mortifying examples of the prevalency of foreign\r\ncorruption in republican governments. How much this contributed to the\r\nruin of the ancient commonwealths has been already delineated. It is\r\nwell known that the deputies of the United Provinces have, in various\r\ninstances, been purchased by the emissaries of the neighboring\r\nkingdoms. The Earl of Chesterfield (if my memory serves me right), in a\r\nletter to his court, intimates that his success in an important\r\nnegotiation must depend on his obtaining a major’s commission for one\r\nof those deputies. And in Sweden the parties were alternately bought by\r\nFrance and England in so barefaced and notorious a manner that it\r\nexcited universal disgust in the nation, and was a principal cause that\r\nthe most limited monarch in Europe, in a single day, without tumult,\r\nviolence, or opposition, became one of the most absolute and\r\nuncontrolled.\r\n\r\nA circumstance which crowns the defects of the Confederation remains\r\nyet to be mentioned, the want of a judiciary power. Laws are a dead\r\nletter without courts to expound and define their true meaning and\r\noperation. The treaties of the United States, to have any force at all,\r\nmust be considered as part of the law of the land. Their true import,\r\nas far as respects individuals, must, like all other laws, be\r\nascertained by judicial determinations. To produce uniformity in these\r\ndeterminations, they ought to be submitted, in the last resort, to one\r\nSUPREME TRIBUNAL. And this tribunal ought to be instituted under the\r\nsame authority which forms the treaties themselves. These ingredients\r\nare both indispensable. If there is in each State a court of final\r\njurisdiction, there may be as many different final determinations on\r\nthe same point as there are courts. There are endless diversities in\r\nthe opinions of men. We often see not only different courts but the\r\njudges of the came court differing from each other. To avoid the\r\nconfusion which would unavoidably result from the contradictory\r\ndecisions of a number of independent judicatories, all nations have\r\nfound it necessary to establish one court paramount to the rest,\r\npossessing a general superintendence, and authorized to settle and\r\ndeclare in the last resort a uniform rule of civil justice.\r\n\r\nThis is the more necessary where the frame of the government is so\r\ncompounded that the laws of the whole are in danger of being\r\ncontravened by the laws of the parts. In this case, if the particular\r\ntribunals are invested with a right of ultimate jurisdiction, besides\r\nthe contradictions to be expected from difference of opinion, there\r\nwill be much to fear from the bias of local views and prejudices, and\r\nfrom the interference of local regulations. As often as such an\r\ninterference was to happen, there would be reason to apprehend that the\r\nprovisions of the particular laws might be preferred to those of the\r\ngeneral laws; for nothing is more natural to men in office than to look\r\nwith peculiar deference towards that authority to which they owe their\r\nofficial existence. The treaties of the United States, under the\r\npresent Constitution, are liable to the infractions of thirteen\r\ndifferent legislatures, and as many different courts of final\r\njurisdiction, acting under the authority of those legislatures. The\r\nfaith, the reputation, the peace of the whole Union, are thus\r\ncontinually at the mercy of the prejudices, the passions, and the\r\ninterests of every member of which it is composed. Is it possible that\r\nforeign nations can either respect or confide in such a government? Is\r\nit possible that the people of America will longer consent to trust\r\ntheir honor, their happiness, their safety, on so precarious a\r\nfoundation?\r\n\r\nIn this review of the Confederation, I have confined myself to the\r\nexhibition of its most material defects; passing over those\r\nimperfections in its details by which even a great part of the power\r\nintended to be conferred upon it has been in a great measure rendered\r\nabortive. It must be by this time evident to all men of reflection, who\r\ncan divest themselves of the prepossessions of preconceived opinions,\r\nthat it is a system so radically vicious and unsound, as to admit not\r\nof amendment but by an entire change in its leading features and\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nThe organization of Congress is itself utterly improper for the\r\nexercise of those powers which are necessary to be deposited in the\r\nUnion. A single assembly may be a proper receptacle of those slender,\r\nor rather fettered, authorities, which have been heretofore delegated\r\nto the federal head; but it would be inconsistent with all the\r\nprinciples of good government, to intrust it with those additional\r\npowers which, even the moderate and more rational adversaries of the\r\nproposed Constitution admit, ought to reside in the United States. If\r\nthat plan should not be adopted, and if the necessity of the Union\r\nshould be able to withstand the ambitious aims of those men who may\r\nindulge magnificent schemes of personal aggrandizement from its\r\ndissolution, the probability would be, that we should run into the\r\nproject of conferring supplementary powers upon Congress, as they are\r\nnow constituted; and either the machine, from the intrinsic feebleness\r\nof its structure, will moulder into pieces, in spite of our ill-judged\r\nefforts to prop it; or, by successive augmentations of its force an\r\nenergy, as necessity might prompt, we shall finally accumulate, in a\r\nsingle body, all the most important prerogatives of sovereignty, and\r\nthus entail upon our posterity one of the most execrable forms of\r\ngovernment that human infatuation ever contrived. Thus, we should\r\ncreate in reality that very tyranny which the adversaries of the new\r\nConstitution either are, or affect to be, solicitous to avert.\r\n\r\nIt has not a little contributed to the infirmities of the existing\r\nfederal system, that it never had a ratification by the PEOPLE. Resting\r\non no better foundation than the consent of the several legislatures,\r\nit has been exposed to frequent and intricate questions concerning the\r\nvalidity of its powers, and has, in some instances, given birth to the\r\nenormous doctrine of a right of legislative repeal. Owing its\r\nratification to the law of a State, it has been contended that the same\r\nauthority might repeal the law by which it was ratified. However gross\r\na heresy it may be to maintain that a PARTY to a COMPACT has a right to\r\nrevoke that COMPACT, the doctrine itself has had respectable advocates.\r\nThe possibility of a question of this nature proves the necessity of\r\nlaying the foundations of our national government deeper than in the\r\nmere sanction of delegated authority. The fabric of American empire\r\nought to rest on the solid basis of THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE. The\r\nstreams of national power ought to flow immediately from that pure,\r\noriginal fountain of all legitimate authority.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] This, as nearly as I can recollect, was the sense of his speech on\r\n introducing the last bill.\r\n\r\n [2] Encyclopedia, article “Empire.”\r\n\r\n [3] New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Georgia, South\r\n Carolina, and Maryland are a majority of the whole number of the\r\n States, but they do not contain one third of the people.\r\n\r\n [4] Add New York and Connecticut to the foregoing seven, and they will\r\n be less than a majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Necessity of a Government as Energetic as the One Proposed to the\r\nPreservation of the Union\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, December 18, 1787.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe necessity of a Constitution, at least equally energetic with the\r\none proposed, to the preservation of the Union, is the point at the\r\nexamination of which we are now arrived.\r\n\r\nThis inquiry will naturally divide itself into three branches the\r\nobjects to be provided for by the federal government, the quantity of\r\npower necessary to the accomplishment of those objects, the persons\r\nupon whom that power ought to operate. Its distribution and\r\norganization will more properly claim our attention under the\r\nsucceeding head.\r\n\r\nThe principal purposes to be answered by union are these the common\r\ndefense of the members; the preservation of the public peace as well\r\nagainst internal convulsions as external attacks; the regulation of\r\ncommerce with other nations and between the States; the superintendence\r\nof our intercourse, political and commercial, with foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe authorities essential to the common defense are these: to raise\r\narmies; to build and equip fleets; to prescribe rules for the\r\ngovernment of both; to direct their operations; to provide for their\r\nsupport. These powers ought to exist without limitation, BECAUSE IT IS\r\nIMPOSSIBLE TO FORESEE OR DEFINE THE EXTENT AND VARIETY OF NATIONAL\r\nEXIGENCIES, OR THE CORRESPONDENT EXTENT AND VARIETY OF THE MEANS WHICH\r\nMAY BE NECESSARY TO SATISFY THEM. The circumstances that endanger the\r\nsafety of nations are infinite, and for this reason no constitutional\r\nshackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which the care of it is\r\ncommitted. This power ought to be coextensive with all the possible\r\ncombinations of such circumstances; and ought to be under the direction\r\nof the same councils which are appointed to preside over the common\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those truths which, to a correct and unprejudiced mind,\r\ncarries its own evidence along with it; and may be obscured, but cannot\r\nbe made plainer by argument or reasoning. It rests upon axioms as\r\nsimple as they are universal; the MEANS ought to be proportioned to the\r\nEND; the persons, from whose agency the attainment of any END is\r\nexpected, ought to possess the MEANS by which it is to be attained.\r\n\r\nWhether there ought to be a federal government intrusted with the care\r\nof the common defense, is a question in the first instance, open for\r\ndiscussion; but the moment it is decided in the affirmative, it will\r\nfollow, that that government ought to be clothed with all the powers\r\nrequisite to complete execution of its trust. And unless it can be\r\nshown that the circumstances which may affect the public safety are\r\nreducible within certain determinate limits; unless the contrary of\r\nthis position can be fairly and rationally disputed, it must be\r\nadmitted, as a necessary consequence, that there can be no limitation\r\nof that authority which is to provide for the defense and protection of\r\nthe community, in any matter essential to its efficacy that is, in any\r\nmatter essential to the FORMATION, DIRECTION, or SUPPORT of the\r\nNATIONAL FORCES.\r\n\r\nDefective as the present Confederation has been proved to be, this\r\nprinciple appears to have been fully recognized by the framers of it;\r\nthough they have not made proper or adequate provision for its\r\nexercise. Congress have an unlimited discretion to make requisitions of\r\nmen and money; to govern the army and navy; to direct their operations.\r\nAs their requisitions are made constitutionally binding upon the\r\nStates, who are in fact under the most solemn obligations to furnish\r\nthe supplies required of them, the intention evidently was that the\r\nUnited States should command whatever resources were by them judged\r\nrequisite to the “common defense and general welfare.” It was presumed\r\nthat a sense of their true interests, and a regard to the dictates of\r\ngood faith, would be found sufficient pledges for the punctual\r\nperformance of the duty of the members to the federal head.\r\n\r\nThe experiment has, however, demonstrated that this expectation was\r\nill-founded and illusory; and the observations, made under the last\r\nhead, will, I imagine, have sufficed to convince the impartial and\r\ndiscerning, that there is an absolute necessity for an entire change in\r\nthe first principles of the system; that if we are in earnest about\r\ngiving the Union energy and duration, we must abandon the vain project\r\nof legislating upon the States in their collective capacities; we must\r\nextend the laws of the federal government to the individual citizens of\r\nAmerica; we must discard the fallacious scheme of quotas and\r\nrequisitions, as equally impracticable and unjust. The result from all\r\nthis is that the Union ought to be invested with full power to levy\r\ntroops; to build and equip fleets; and to raise the revenues which will\r\nbe required for the formation and support of an army and navy, in the\r\ncustomary and ordinary modes practiced in other governments.\r\n\r\nIf the circumstances of our country are such as to demand a compound\r\ninstead of a simple, a confederate instead of a sole, government, the\r\nessential point which will remain to be adjusted will be to\r\ndiscriminate the OBJECTS, as far as it can be done, which shall\r\nappertain to the different provinces or departments of power; allowing\r\nto each the most ample authority for fulfilling the objects committed\r\nto its charge. Shall the Union be constituted the guardian of the\r\ncommon safety? Are fleets and armies and revenues necessary to this\r\npurpose? The government of the Union must be empowered to pass all\r\nlaws, and to make all regulations which have relation to them. The same\r\nmust be the case in respect to commerce, and to every other matter to\r\nwhich its jurisdiction is permitted to extend. Is the administration of\r\njustice between the citizens of the same State the proper department of\r\nthe local governments? These must possess all the authorities which are\r\nconnected with this object, and with every other that may be allotted\r\nto their particular cognizance and direction. Not to confer in each\r\ncase a degree of power commensurate to the end, would be to violate the\r\nmost obvious rules of prudence and propriety, and improvidently to\r\ntrust the great interests of the nation to hands which are disabled\r\nfrom managing them with vigor and success.\r\n\r\nWho is likely to make suitable provisions for the public defense, as\r\nthat body to which the guardianship of the public safety is confided;\r\nwhich, as the centre of information, will best understand the extent\r\nand urgency of the dangers that threaten; as the representative of the\r\nWHOLE, will feel itself most deeply interested in the preservation of\r\nevery part; which, from the responsibility implied in the duty assigned\r\nto it, will be most sensibly impressed with the necessity of proper\r\nexertions; and which, by the extension of its authority throughout the\r\nStates, can alone establish uniformity and concert in the plans and\r\nmeasures by which the common safety is to be secured? Is there not a\r\nmanifest inconsistency in devolving upon the federal government the\r\ncare of the general defense, and leaving in the State governments the\r\nEFFECTIVE powers by which it is to be provided for? Is not a want of\r\nco-operation the infallible consequence of such a system? And will not\r\nweakness, disorder, an undue distribution of the burdens and calamities\r\nof war, an unnecessary and intolerable increase of expense, be its\r\nnatural and inevitable concomitants? Have we not had unequivocal\r\nexperience of its effects in the course of the revolution which we have\r\njust accomplished?\r\n\r\nEvery view we may take of the subject, as candid inquirers after truth,\r\nwill serve to convince us, that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny\r\nthe federal government an unconfined authority, as to all those objects\r\nwhich are intrusted to its management. It will indeed deserve the most\r\nvigilant and careful attention of the people, to see that it be modeled\r\nin such a manner as to admit of its being safely vested with the\r\nrequisite powers. If any plan which has been, or may be, offered to our\r\nconsideration, should not, upon a dispassionate inspection, be found to\r\nanswer this description, it ought to be rejected. A government, the\r\nconstitution of which renders it unfit to be trusted with all the\r\npowers which a free people OUGHT TO DELEGATE TO ANY GOVERNMENT, would\r\nbe an unsafe and improper depositary of the NATIONAL INTERESTS.\r\nWherever THESE can with propriety be confided, the coincident powers\r\nmay safely accompany them. This is the true result of all just\r\nreasoning upon the subject. And the adversaries of the plan promulgated\r\nby the convention ought to have confined themselves to showing, that\r\nthe internal structure of the proposed government was such as to render\r\nit unworthy of the confidence of the people. They ought not to have\r\nwandered into inflammatory declamations and unmeaning cavils about the\r\nextent of the powers. The POWERS are not too extensive for the OBJECTS\r\nof federal administration, or, in other words, for the management of\r\nour NATIONAL INTERESTS; nor can any satisfactory argument be framed to\r\nshow that they are chargeable with such an excess. If it be true, as\r\nhas been insinuated by some of the writers on the other side, that the\r\ndifficulty arises from the nature of the thing, and that the extent of\r\nthe country will not permit us to form a government in which such ample\r\npowers can safely be reposed, it would prove that we ought to contract\r\nour views, and resort to the expedient of separate confederacies, which\r\nwill move within more practicable spheres. For the absurdity must\r\ncontinually stare us in the face of confiding to a government the\r\ndirection of the most essential national interests, without daring to\r\ntrust it to the authorities which are indispensible to their proper and\r\nefficient management. Let us not attempt to reconcile contradictions,\r\nbut firmly embrace a rational alternative.\r\n\r\nI trust, however, that the impracticability of one general system\r\ncannot be shown. I am greatly mistaken, if any thing of weight has yet\r\nbeen advanced of this tendency; and I flatter myself, that the\r\nobservations which have been made in the course of these papers have\r\nserved to place the reverse of that position in as clear a light as any\r\nmatter still in the womb of time and experience can be susceptible of.\r\nThis, at all events, must be evident, that the very difficulty itself,\r\ndrawn from the extent of the country, is the strongest argument in\r\nfavor of an energetic government; for any other can certainly never\r\npreserve the Union of so large an empire. If we embrace the tenets of\r\nthose who oppose the adoption of the proposed Constitution, as the\r\nstandard of our political creed, we cannot fail to verify the gloomy\r\ndoctrines which predict the impracticability of a national system\r\npervading entire limits of the present Confederacy.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTo the powers proposed to be conferred upon the federal government, in\r\nrespect to the creation and direction of the national forces, I have\r\nmet with but one specific objection, which, if I understand it right,\r\nis this, that proper provision has not been made against the existence\r\nof standing armies in time of peace; an objection which, I shall now\r\nendeavor to show, rests on weak and unsubstantial foundations.\r\n\r\nIt has indeed been brought forward in the most vague and general form,\r\nsupported only by bold assertions, without the appearance of argument;\r\nwithout even the sanction of theoretical opinions; in contradiction to\r\nthe practice of other free nations, and to the general sense of\r\nAmerica, as expressed in most of the existing constitutions. The\r\nproprietory of this remark will appear, the moment it is recollected\r\nthat the objection under consideration turns upon a supposed necessity\r\nof restraining the LEGISLATIVE authority of the nation, in the article\r\nof military establishments; a principle unheard of, except in one or\r\ntwo of our State constitutions, and rejected in all the rest.\r\n\r\nA stranger to our politics, who was to read our newspapers at the\r\npresent juncture, without having previously inspected the plan reported\r\nby the convention, would be naturally led to one of two conclusions:\r\neither that it contained a positive injunction, that standing armies\r\nshould be kept up in time of peace; or that it vested in the EXECUTIVE\r\nthe whole power of levying troops, without subjecting his discretion,\r\nin any shape, to the control of the legislature.\r\n\r\nIf he came afterwards to peruse the plan itself, he would be surprised\r\nto discover, that neither the one nor the other was the case; that the\r\nwhole power of raising armies was lodged in the LEGISLATURE, not in the\r\nEXECUTIVE; that this legislature was to be a popular body, consisting\r\nof the representatives of the people periodically elected; and that\r\ninstead of the provision he had supposed in favor of standing armies,\r\nthere was to be found, in respect to this object, an important\r\nqualification even of the legislative discretion, in that clause which\r\nforbids the appropriation of money for the support of an army for any\r\nlonger period than two years a precaution which, upon a nearer view of\r\nit, will appear to be a great and real security against the keeping up\r\nof troops without evident necessity.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in his first surmise, the person I have supposed would be\r\napt to pursue his conjectures a little further. He would naturally say\r\nto himself, it is impossible that all this vehement and pathetic\r\ndeclamation can be without some colorable pretext. It must needs be\r\nthat this people, so jealous of their liberties, have, in all the\r\npreceding models of the constitutions which they have established,\r\ninserted the most precise and rigid precautions on this point, the\r\nomission of which, in the new plan, has given birth to all this\r\napprehension and clamor.\r\n\r\nIf, under this impression, he proceeded to pass in review the several\r\nState constitutions, how great would be his disappointment to find that\r\nTWO only of them[1] contained an interdiction of standing armies in\r\ntime of peace; that the other eleven had either observed a profound\r\nsilence on the subject, or had in express terms admitted the right of\r\nthe Legislature to authorize their existence.\r\n\r\nStill, however he would be persuaded that there must be some plausible\r\nfoundation for the cry raised on this head. He would never be able to\r\nimagine, while any source of information remained unexplored, that it\r\nwas nothing more than an experiment upon the public credulity, dictated\r\neither by a deliberate intention to deceive, or by the overflowings of\r\na zeal too intemperate to be ingenuous. It would probably occur to him,\r\nthat he would be likely to find the precautions he was in search of in\r\nthe primitive compact between the States. Here, at length, he would\r\nexpect to meet with a solution of the enigma. No doubt, he would\r\nobserve to himself, the existing Confederation must contain the most\r\nexplicit provisions against military establishments in time of peace;\r\nand a departure from this model, in a favorite point, has occasioned\r\nthe discontent which appears to influence these political champions.\r\n\r\nIf he should now apply himself to a careful and critical survey of the\r\narticles of Confederation, his astonishment would not only be\r\nincreased, but would acquire a mixture of indignation, at the\r\nunexpected discovery, that these articles, instead of containing the\r\nprohibition he looked for, and though they had, with jealous\r\ncircumspection, restricted the authority of the State legislatures in\r\nthis particular, had not imposed a single restraint on that of the\r\nUnited States. If he happened to be a man of quick sensibility, or\r\nardent temper, he could now no longer refrain from regarding these\r\nclamors as the dishonest artifices of a sinister and unprincipled\r\nopposition to a plan which ought at least to receive a fair and candid\r\nexamination from all sincere lovers of their country! How else, he\r\nwould say, could the authors of them have been tempted to vent such\r\nloud censures upon that plan, about a point in which it seems to have\r\nconformed itself to the general sense of America as declared in its\r\ndifferent forms of government, and in which it has even superadded a\r\nnew and powerful guard unknown to any of them? If, on the contrary, he\r\nhappened to be a man of calm and dispassionate feelings, he would\r\nindulge a sigh for the frailty of human nature, and would lament, that\r\nin a matter so interesting to the happiness of millions, the true\r\nmerits of the question should be perplexed and entangled by expedients\r\nso unfriendly to an impartial and right determination. Even such a man\r\ncould hardly forbear remarking, that a conduct of this kind has too\r\nmuch the appearance of an intention to mislead the people by alarming\r\ntheir passions, rather than to convince them by arguments addressed to\r\ntheir understandings.\r\n\r\nBut however little this objection may be countenanced, even by\r\nprecedents among ourselves, it may be satisfactory to take a nearer\r\nview of its intrinsic merits. From a close examination it will appear\r\nthat restraints upon the discretion of the legislature in respect to\r\nmilitary establishments in time of peace, would be improper to be\r\nimposed, and if imposed, from the necessities of society, would be\r\nunlikely to be observed.\r\n\r\nThough a wide ocean separates the United States from Europe, yet there\r\nare various considerations that warn us against an excess of confidence\r\nor security. On one side of us, and stretching far into our rear, are\r\ngrowing settlements subject to the dominion of Britain. On the other\r\nside, and extending to meet the British settlements, are colonies and\r\nestablishments subject to the dominion of Spain. This situation and the\r\nvicinity of the West India Islands, belonging to these two powers\r\ncreate between them, in respect to their American possessions and in\r\nrelation to us, a common interest. The savage tribes on our Western\r\nfrontier ought to be regarded as our natural enemies, their natural\r\nallies, because they have most to fear from us, and most to hope from\r\nthem. The improvements in the art of navigation have, as to the\r\nfacility of communication, rendered distant nations, in a great\r\nmeasure, neighbors. Britain and Spain are among the principal maritime\r\npowers of Europe. A future concert of views between these nations ought\r\nnot to be regarded as improbable. The increasing remoteness of\r\nconsanguinity is every day diminishing the force of the family compact\r\nbetween France and Spain. And politicians have ever with great reason\r\nconsidered the ties of blood as feeble and precarious links of\r\npolitical connection. These circumstances combined, admonish us not to\r\nbe too sanguine in considering ourselves as entirely out of the reach\r\nof danger.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the Revolution, and ever since the peace, there has been a\r\nconstant necessity for keeping small garrisons on our Western frontier.\r\nNo person can doubt that these will continue to be indispensable, if it\r\nshould only be against the ravages and depredations of the Indians.\r\nThese garrisons must either be furnished by occasional detachments from\r\nthe militia, or by permanent corps in the pay of the government. The\r\nfirst is impracticable; and if practicable, would be pernicious. The\r\nmilitia would not long, if at all, submit to be dragged from their\r\noccupations and families to perform that most disagreeable duty in\r\ntimes of profound peace. And if they could be prevailed upon or\r\ncompelled to do it, the increased expense of a frequent rotation of\r\nservice, and the loss of labor and disconcertion of the industrious\r\npursuits of individuals, would form conclusive objections to the\r\nscheme. It would be as burdensome and injurious to the public as\r\nruinous to private citizens. The latter resource of permanent corps in\r\nthe pay of the government amounts to a standing army in time of peace;\r\na small one, indeed, but not the less real for being small. Here is a\r\nsimple view of the subject, that shows us at once the impropriety of a\r\nconstitutional interdiction of such establishments, and the necessity\r\nof leaving the matter to the discretion and prudence of the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to our increase in strength, it is probable, nay, it may\r\nbe said certain, that Britain and Spain would augment their military\r\nestablishments in our neighborhood. If we should not be willing to be\r\nexposed, in a naked and defenseless condition, to their insults and\r\nencroachments, we should find it expedient to increase our frontier\r\ngarrisons in some ratio to the force by which our Western settlements\r\nmight be annoyed. There are, and will be, particular posts, the\r\npossession of which will include the command of large districts of\r\nterritory, and facilitate future invasions of the remainder. It may be\r\nadded that some of those posts will be keys to the trade with the\r\nIndian nations. Can any man think it would be wise to leave such posts\r\nin a situation to be at any instant seized by one or the other of two\r\nneighboring and formidable powers? To act this part would be to desert\r\nall the usual maxims of prudence and policy.\r\n\r\nIf we mean to be a commercial people, or even to be secure on our\r\nAtlantic side, we must endeavor, as soon as possible, to have a navy.\r\nTo this purpose there must be dock-yards and arsenals; and for the\r\ndefense of these, fortifications, and probably garrisons. When a nation\r\nhas become so powerful by sea that it can protect its dock-yards by its\r\nfleets, this supersedes the necessity of garrisons for that purpose;\r\nbut where naval establishments are in their infancy, moderate garrisons\r\nwill, in all likelihood, be found an indispensable security against\r\ndescents for the destruction of the arsenals and dock-yards, and\r\nsometimes of the fleet itself.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] This statement of the matter is taken from the printed collection\r\n of State constitutions. Pennsylvania and North Carolina are the two\r\n which contain the interdiction in these words: “As standing armies in\r\n time of peace are dangerous to liberty, THEY OUGHT NOT to be kept up.”\r\n This is, in truth, rather a CAUTION than a PROHIBITION. New Hampshire,\r\n Massachusetts, Delaware, and Maryland have, in each of their bils of\r\n rights, a clause to this effect: “Standing armies are dangerous to\r\n liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF\r\n THE LEGISLATURE”; which is a formal admission of the authority of the\r\n Legislature. New York has no bills of rights, and her constitution\r\n says not a word about the matter. No bills of rights appear annexed to\r\n the constitutions of the other States, except the foregoing, and their\r\n constitutions are equally silent. I am told, however that one or two\r\n States have bills of rights which do not appear in this collection;\r\n but that those also recognize the right of the legislative authority\r\n in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXV.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, December 21, 1787.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be urged that the objects enumerated in the preceding\r\nnumber ought to be provided for by the State governments, under the\r\ndirection of the Union. But this would be, in reality, an inversion of\r\nthe primary principle of our political association, as it would in\r\npractice transfer the care of the common defense from the federal head\r\nto the individual members: a project oppressive to some States,\r\ndangerous to all, and baneful to the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nThe territories of Britain, Spain, and of the Indian nations in our\r\nneighborhood do not border on particular States, but encircle the Union\r\nfrom Maine to Georgia. The danger, though in different degrees, is\r\ntherefore common. And the means of guarding against it ought, in like\r\nmanner, to be the objects of common councils and of a common treasury.\r\nIt happens that some States, from local situation, are more directly\r\nexposed. New York is of this class. Upon the plan of separate\r\nprovisions, New York would have to sustain the whole weight of the\r\nestablishments requisite to her immediate safety, and to the mediate or\r\nultimate protection of her neighbors. This would neither be equitable\r\nas it respected New York nor safe as it respected the other States.\r\nVarious inconveniences would attend such a system. The States, to whose\r\nlot it might fall to support the necessary establishments, would be as\r\nlittle able as willing, for a considerable time to come, to bear the\r\nburden of competent provisions. The security of all would thus be\r\nsubjected to the parsimony, improvidence, or inability of a part. If\r\nthe resources of such part becoming more abundant and extensive, its\r\nprovisions should be proportionally enlarged, the other States would\r\nquickly take the alarm at seeing the whole military force of the Union\r\nin the hands of two or three of its members, and those probably amongst\r\nthe most powerful. They would each choose to have some counterpoise,\r\nand pretenses could easily be contrived. In this situation, military\r\nestablishments, nourished by mutual jealousy, would be apt to swell\r\nbeyond their natural or proper size; and being at the separate disposal\r\nof the members, they would be engines for the abridgment or demolition\r\nof the national authority.\r\n\r\nReasons have been already given to induce a supposition that the State\r\ngovernments will too naturally be prone to a rivalship with that of the\r\nUnion, the foundation of which will be the love of power; and that in\r\nany contest between the federal head and one of its members the people\r\nwill be most apt to unite with their local government. If, in addition\r\nto this immense advantage, the ambition of the members should be\r\nstimulated by the separate and independent possession of military\r\nforces, it would afford too strong a temptation and too great a\r\nfacility to them to make enterprises upon, and finally to subvert, the\r\nconstitutional authority of the Union. On the other hand, the liberty\r\nof the people would be less safe in this state of things than in that\r\nwhich left the national forces in the hands of the national government.\r\nAs far as an army may be considered as a dangerous weapon of power, it\r\nhad better be in those hands of which the people are most likely to be\r\njealous than in those of which they are least likely to be jealous. For\r\nit is a truth, which the experience of ages has attested, that the\r\npeople are always most in danger when the means of injuring their\r\nrights are in the possession of those of whom they entertain the least\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nThe framers of the existing Confederation, fully aware of the danger to\r\nthe Union from the separate possession of military forces by the\r\nStates, have, in express terms, prohibited them from having either\r\nships or troops, unless with the consent of Congress. The truth is,\r\nthat the existence of a federal government and military establishments\r\nunder State authority are not less at variance with each other than a\r\ndue supply of the federal treasury and the system of quotas and\r\nrequisitions.\r\n\r\nThere are other lights besides those already taken notice of, in which\r\nthe impropriety of restraints on the discretion of the national\r\nlegislature will be equally manifest. The design of the objection,\r\nwhich has been mentioned, is to preclude standing armies in time of\r\npeace, though we have never been informed how far it is designed the\r\nprohibition should extend; whether to raising armies as well as to\r\nKEEPING THEM UP in a season of tranquillity or not. If it be confined\r\nto the latter it will have no precise signification, and it will be\r\nineffectual for the purpose intended. When armies are once raised what\r\nshall be denominated “keeping them up,” contrary to the sense of the\r\nConstitution? What time shall be requisite to ascertain the violation?\r\nShall it be a week, a month, a year? Or shall we say they may be\r\ncontinued as long as the danger which occasioned their being raised\r\ncontinues? This would be to admit that they might be kept up IN TIME OF\r\nPEACE, against threatening or impending danger, which would be at once\r\nto deviate from the literal meaning of the prohibition, and to\r\nintroduce an extensive latitude of construction. Who shall judge of the\r\ncontinuance of the danger? This must undoubtedly be submitted to the\r\nnational government, and the matter would then be brought to this\r\nissue, that the national government, to provide against apprehended\r\ndanger, might in the first instance raise troops, and might afterwards\r\nkeep them on foot as long as they supposed the peace or safety of the\r\ncommunity was in any degree of jeopardy. It is easy to perceive that a\r\ndiscretion so latitudinary as this would afford ample room for eluding\r\nthe force of the provision.\r\n\r\nThe supposed utility of a provision of this kind can only be founded on\r\nthe supposed probability, or at least possibility, of a combination\r\nbetween the executive and the legislative, in some scheme of\r\nusurpation. Should this at any time happen, how easy would it be to\r\nfabricate pretenses of approaching danger! Indian hostilities,\r\ninstigated by Spain or Britain, would always be at hand. Provocations\r\nto produce the desired appearances might even be given to some foreign\r\npower, and appeased again by timely concessions. If we can reasonably\r\npresume such a combination to have been formed, and that the enterprise\r\nis warranted by a sufficient prospect of success, the army, when once\r\nraised, from whatever cause, or on whatever pretext, may be applied to\r\nthe execution of the project.\r\n\r\nIf, to obviate this consequence, it should be resolved to extend the\r\nprohibition to the RAISING of armies in time of peace, the United\r\nStates would then exhibit the most extraordinary spectacle which the\r\nworld has yet seen, that of a nation incapacitated by its Constitution\r\nto prepare for defense, before it was actually invaded. As the ceremony\r\nof a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse, the\r\npresence of an enemy within our territories must be waited for, as the\r\nlegal warrant to the government to begin its levies of men for the\r\nprotection of the State. We must receive the blow, before we could even\r\nprepare to return it. All that kind of policy by which nations\r\nanticipate distant danger, and meet the gathering storm, must be\r\nabstained from, as contrary to the genuine maxims of a free government.\r\nWe must expose our property and liberty to the mercy of foreign\r\ninvaders, and invite them by our weakness to seize the naked and\r\ndefenseless prey, because we are afraid that rulers, created by our\r\nchoice, dependent on our will, might endanger that liberty, by an abuse\r\nof the means necessary to its preservation.\r\n\r\nHere I expect we shall be told that the militia of the country is its\r\nnatural bulwark, and would be at all times equal to the national\r\ndefense. This doctrine, in substance, had like to have lost us our\r\nindependence. It cost millions to the United States that might have\r\nbeen saved. The facts which, from our own experience, forbid a reliance\r\nof this kind, are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of such a\r\nsuggestion. The steady operations of war against a regular and\r\ndisciplined army can only be successfully conducted by a force of the\r\nsame kind. Considerations of economy, not less than of stability and\r\nvigor, confirm this position. The American militia, in the course of\r\nthe late war, have, by their valor on numerous occasions, erected\r\neternal monuments to their fame; but the bravest of them feel and know\r\nthat the liberty of their country could not have been established by\r\ntheir efforts alone, however great and valuable they were. War, like\r\nmost other things, is a science to be acquired and perfected by\r\ndiligence, by perserverance, by time, and by practice.\r\n\r\nAll violent policy, as it is contrary to the natural and experienced\r\ncourse of human affairs, defeats itself. Pennsylvania, at this instant,\r\naffords an example of the truth of this remark. The Bill of Rights of\r\nthat State declares that standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and\r\nought not to be kept up in time of peace. Pennsylvania, nevertheless,\r\nin a time of profound peace, from the existence of partial disorders in\r\none or two of her counties, has resolved to raise a body of troops; and\r\nin all probability will keep them up as long as there is any appearance\r\nof danger to the public peace. The conduct of Massachusetts affords a\r\nlesson on the same subject, though on different ground. That State\r\n(without waiting for the sanction of Congress, as the articles of the\r\nConfederation require) was compelled to raise troops to quell a\r\ndomestic insurrection, and still keeps a corps in pay to prevent a\r\nrevival of the spirit of revolt. The particular constitution of\r\nMassachusetts opposed no obstacle to the measure; but the instance is\r\nstill of use to instruct us that cases are likely to occur under our\r\ngovernment, as well as under those of other nations, which will\r\nsometimes render a military force in time of peace essential to the\r\nsecurity of the society, and that it is therefore improper in this\r\nrespect to control the legislative discretion. It also teaches us, in\r\nits application to the United States, how little the rights of a feeble\r\ngovernment are likely to be respected, even by its own constituents.\r\nAnd it teaches us, in addition to the rest, how unequal parchment\r\nprovisions are to a struggle with public necessity.\r\n\r\nIt was a fundamental maxim of the Lacedaemonian commonwealth, that the\r\npost of admiral should not be conferred twice on the same person. The\r\nPeloponnesian confederates, having suffered a severe defeat at sea from\r\nthe Athenians, demanded Lysander, who had before served with success in\r\nthat capacity, to command the combined fleets. The Lacedaemonians, to\r\ngratify their allies, and yet preserve the semblance of an adherence to\r\ntheir ancient institutions, had recourse to the flimsy subterfuge of\r\ninvesting Lysander with the real power of admiral, under the nominal\r\ntitle of vice-admiral. This instance is selected from among a multitude\r\nthat might be cited to confirm the truth already advanced and\r\nillustrated by domestic examples; which is, that nations pay little\r\nregard to rules and maxims calculated in their very nature to run\r\ncounter to the necessities of society. Wise politicians will be\r\ncautious about fettering the government with restrictions that cannot\r\nbe observed, because they know that every breach of the fundamental\r\nlaws, though dictated by necessity, impairs that sacred reverence which\r\nought to be maintained in the breast of rulers towards the constitution\r\nof a country, and forms a precedent for other breaches where the same\r\nplea of necessity does not exist at all, or is less urgent and\r\npalpable.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXVI.\r\n\r\nThe Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to the\r\nCommon Defense Considered\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIt was a thing hardly to be expected that in a popular revolution the\r\nminds of men should stop at that happy mean which marks the salutary\r\nboundary between POWER and PRIVILEGE, and combines the energy of\r\ngovernment with the security of private rights. A failure in this\r\ndelicate and important point is the great source of the inconveniences\r\nwe experience, and if we are not cautious to avoid a repetition of the\r\nerror, in our future attempts to rectify and ameliorate our system, we\r\nmay travel from one chimerical project to another; we may try change\r\nafter change; but we shall never be likely to make any material change\r\nfor the better.\r\n\r\nThe idea of restraining the legislative authority, in the means of\r\nproviding for the national defense, is one of those refinements which\r\nowe their origin to a zeal for liberty more ardent than enlightened. We\r\nhave seen, however, that it has not had thus far an extensive\r\nprevalency; that even in this country, where it made its first\r\nappearance, Pennsylvania and North Carolina are the only two States by\r\nwhich it has been in any degree patronized; and that all the others\r\nhave refused to give it the least countenance; wisely judging that\r\nconfidence must be placed somewhere; that the necessity of doing it, is\r\nimplied in the very act of delegating power; and that it is better to\r\nhazard the abuse of that confidence than to embarrass the government\r\nand endanger the public safety by impolitic restrictions on the\r\nlegislative authority. The opponents of the proposed Constitution\r\ncombat, in this respect, the general decision of America; and instead\r\nof being taught by experience the propriety of correcting any extremes\r\ninto which we may have heretofore run, they appear disposed to conduct\r\nus into others still more dangerous, and more extravagant. As if the\r\ntone of government had been found too high, or too rigid, the doctrines\r\nthey teach are calculated to induce us to depress or to relax it, by\r\nexpedients which, upon other occasions, have been condemned or\r\nforborne. It may be affirmed without the imputation of invective, that\r\nif the principles they inculcate, on various points, could so far\r\nobtain as to become the popular creed, they would utterly unfit the\r\npeople of this country for any species of government whatever. But a\r\ndanger of this kind is not to be apprehended. The citizens of America\r\nhave too much discernment to be argued into anarchy. And I am much\r\nmistaken, if experience has not wrought a deep and solemn conviction in\r\nthe public mind, that greater energy of government is essential to the\r\nwelfare and prosperity of the community.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss in this place concisely to remark the origin and\r\nprogress of the idea, which aims at the exclusion of military\r\nestablishments in time of peace. Though in speculative minds it may\r\narise from a contemplation of the nature and tendency of such\r\ninstitutions, fortified by the events that have happened in other ages\r\nand countries, yet as a national sentiment, it must be traced to those\r\nhabits of thinking which we derive from the nation from whom the\r\ninhabitants of these States have in general sprung.\r\n\r\nIn England, for a long time after the Norman Conquest, the authority of\r\nthe monarch was almost unlimited. Inroads were gradually made upon the\r\nprerogative, in favor of liberty, first by the barons, and afterwards\r\nby the people, till the greatest part of its most formidable\r\npretensions became extinct. But it was not till the revolution in 1688,\r\nwhich elevated the Prince of Orange to the throne of Great Britain,\r\nthat English liberty was completely triumphant. As incident to the\r\nundefined power of making war, an acknowledged prerogative of the\r\ncrown, Charles II. had, by his own authority, kept on foot in time of\r\npeace a body of 5,000 regular troops. And this number James II.\r\nincreased to 30,000; who were paid out of his civil list. At the\r\nrevolution, to abolish the exercise of so dangerous an authority, it\r\nbecame an article of the Bill of Rights then framed, that “the raising\r\nor keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace, UNLESS\r\nWITH THE CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT, was against law.”\r\n\r\nIn that kingdom, when the pulse of liberty was at its highest pitch, no\r\nsecurity against the danger of standing armies was thought requisite,\r\nbeyond a prohibition of their being raised or kept up by the mere\r\nauthority of the executive magistrate. The patriots, who effected that\r\nmemorable revolution, were too temperate, too wellinformed, to think of\r\nany restraint on the legislative discretion. They were aware that a\r\ncertain number of troops for guards and garrisons were indispensable;\r\nthat no precise bounds could be set to the national exigencies; that a\r\npower equal to every possible contingency must exist somewhere in the\r\ngovernment: and that when they referred the exercise of that power to\r\nthe judgment of the legislature, they had arrived at the ultimate point\r\nof precaution which was reconcilable with the safety of the community.\r\n\r\nFrom the same source, the people of America may be said to have derived\r\nan hereditary impression of danger to liberty, from standing armies in\r\ntime of peace. The circumstances of a revolution quickened the public\r\nsensibility on every point connected with the security of popular\r\nrights, and in some instances raise the warmth of our zeal beyond the\r\ndegree which consisted with the due temperature of the body politic.\r\nThe attempts of two of the States to restrict the authority of the\r\nlegislature in the article of military establishments, are of the\r\nnumber of these instances. The principles which had taught us to be\r\njealous of the power of an hereditary monarch were by an injudicious\r\nexcess extended to the representatives of the people in their popular\r\nassemblies. Even in some of the States, where this error was not\r\nadopted, we find unnecessary declarations that standing armies ought\r\nnot to be kept up, in time of peace, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE\r\nLEGISLATURE. I call them unnecessary, because the reason which had\r\nintroduced a similar provision into the English Bill of Rights is not\r\napplicable to any of the State constitutions. The power of raising\r\narmies at all, under those constitutions, can by no construction be\r\ndeemed to reside anywhere else, than in the legislatures themselves;\r\nand it was superfluous, if not absurd, to declare that a matter should\r\nnot be done without the consent of a body, which alone had the power of\r\ndoing it. Accordingly, in some of these constitutions, and among\r\nothers, in that of this State of New York, which has been justly\r\ncelebrated, both in Europe and America, as one of the best of the forms\r\nof government established in this country, there is a total silence\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that even in the two States which seem to have\r\nmeditated an interdiction of military establishments in time of peace,\r\nthe mode of expression made use of is rather cautionary than\r\nprohibitory. It is not said, that standing armies SHALL NOT BE kept up,\r\nbut that they OUGHT NOT to be kept up, in time of peace. This ambiguity\r\nof terms appears to have been the result of a conflict between jealousy\r\nand conviction; between the desire of excluding such establishments at\r\nall events, and the persuasion that an absolute exclusion would be\r\nunwise and unsafe.\r\n\r\nCan it be doubted that such a provision, whenever the situation of\r\npublic affairs was understood to require a departure from it, would be\r\ninterpreted by the legislature into a mere admonition, and would be\r\nmade to yield to the necessities or supposed necessities of the State?\r\nLet the fact already mentioned, with respect to Pennsylvania, decide.\r\nWhat then (it may be asked) is the use of such a provision, if it cease\r\nto operate the moment there is an inclination to disregard it?\r\n\r\nLet us examine whether there be any comparison, in point of efficacy,\r\nbetween the provision alluded to and that which is contained in the new\r\nConstitution, for restraining the appropriations of money for military\r\npurposes to the period of two years. The former, by aiming at too much,\r\nis calculated to effect nothing; the latter, by steering clear of an\r\nimprudent extreme, and by being perfectly compatible with a proper\r\nprovision for the exigencies of the nation, will have a salutary and\r\npowerful operation.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of the United States will be OBLIGED, by this\r\nprovision, once at least in every two years, to deliberate upon the\r\npropriety of keeping a military force on foot; to come to a new\r\nresolution on the point; and to declare their sense of the matter, by a\r\nformal vote in the face of their constituents. They are not AT LIBERTY\r\nto vest in the executive department permanent funds for the support of\r\nan army, if they were even incautious enough to be willing to repose in\r\nit so improper a confidence. As the spirit of party, in different\r\ndegrees, must be expected to infect all political bodies, there will\r\nbe, no doubt, persons in the national legislature willing enough to\r\narraign the measures and criminate the views of the majority. The\r\nprovision for the support of a military force will always be a\r\nfavorable topic for declamation. As often as the question comes\r\nforward, the public attention will be roused and attracted to the\r\nsubject, by the party in opposition; and if the majority should be\r\nreally disposed to exceed the proper limits, the community will be\r\nwarned of the danger, and will have an opportunity of taking measures\r\nto guard against it. Independent of parties in the national legislature\r\nitself, as often as the period of discussion arrived, the State\r\nlegislatures, who will always be not only vigilant but suspicious and\r\njealous guardians of the rights of the citizens against encroachments\r\nfrom the federal government, will constantly have their attention awake\r\nto the conduct of the national rulers, and will be ready enough, if any\r\nthing improper appears, to sound the alarm to the people, and not only\r\nto be the VOICE, but, if necessary, the ARM of their discontent.\r\n\r\nSchemes to subvert the liberties of a great community REQUIRE TIME to\r\nmature them for execution. An army, so large as seriously to menace\r\nthose liberties, could only be formed by progressive augmentations;\r\nwhich would suppose, not merely a temporary combination between the\r\nlegislature and executive, but a continued conspiracy for a series of\r\ntime. Is it probable that such a combination would exist at all? Is it\r\nprobable that it would be persevered in, and transmitted along through\r\nall the successive variations in a representative body, which biennial\r\nelections would naturally produce in both houses? Is it presumable,\r\nthat every man, the instant he took his seat in the national Senate or\r\nHouse of Representatives, would commence a traitor to his constituents\r\nand to his country? Can it be supposed that there would not be found\r\none man, discerning enough to detect so atrocious a conspiracy, or bold\r\nor honest enough to apprise his constituents of their danger? If such\r\npresumptions can fairly be made, there ought at once to be an end of\r\nall delegated authority. The people should resolve to recall all the\r\npowers they have heretofore parted with out of their own hands, and to\r\ndivide themselves into as many States as there are counties, in order\r\nthat they may be able to manage their own concerns in person.\r\n\r\nIf such suppositions could even be reasonably made, still the\r\nconcealment of the design, for any duration, would be impracticable. It\r\nwould be announced, by the very circumstance of augmenting the army to\r\nso great an extent in time of profound peace. What colorable reason\r\ncould be assigned, in a country so situated, for such vast\r\naugmentations of the military force? It is impossible that the people\r\ncould be long deceived; and the destruction of the project, and of the\r\nprojectors, would quickly follow the discovery.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the provision which limits the appropriation of\r\nmoney for the support of an army to the period of two years would be\r\nunavailing, because the Executive, when once possessed of a force large\r\nenough to awe the people into submission, would find resources in that\r\nvery force sufficient to enable him to dispense with supplies from the\r\nacts of the legislature. But the question again recurs, upon what\r\npretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in\r\ntime of peace? If we suppose it to have been created in consequence of\r\nsome domestic insurrection or foreign war, then it becomes a case not\r\nwithin the principles of the objection; for this is levelled against\r\nthe power of keeping up troops in time of peace. Few persons will be so\r\nvisionary as seriously to contend that military forces ought not to be\r\nraised to quell a rebellion or resist an invasion; and if the defense\r\nof the community under such circumstances should make it necessary to\r\nhave an army so numerous as to hazard its liberty, this is one of those\r\ncalamaties for which there is neither preventative nor cure. It cannot\r\nbe provided against by any possible form of government; it might even\r\nresult from a simple league offensive and defensive, if it should ever\r\nbe necessary for the confederates or allies to form an army for common\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nBut it is an evil infinitely less likely to attend us in a united than\r\nin a disunited state; nay, it may be safely asserted that it is an evil\r\naltogether unlikely to attend us in the latter situation. It is not\r\neasy to conceive a possibility that dangers so formidable can assail\r\nthe whole Union, as to demand a force considerable enough to place our\r\nliberties in the least jeopardy, especially if we take into our view\r\nthe aid to be derived from the militia, which ought always to be\r\ncounted upon as a valuable and powerful auxiliary. But in a state of\r\ndisunion (as has been fully shown in another place), the contrary of\r\nthis supposition would become not only probable, but almost\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXVII.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to the\r\nCommon Defense Considered)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, December 25, 1787.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIt has been urged, in different shapes, that a Constitution of the kind\r\nproposed by the convention cannot operate without the aid of a military\r\nforce to execute its laws. This, however, like most other things that\r\nhave been alleged on that side, rests on mere general assertion,\r\nunsupported by any precise or intelligible designation of the reasons\r\nupon which it is founded. As far as I have been able to divine the\r\nlatent meaning of the objectors, it seems to originate in a\r\npresupposition that the people will be disinclined to the exercise of\r\nfederal authority in any matter of an internal nature. Waiving any\r\nexception that might be taken to the inaccuracy or inexplicitness of\r\nthe distinction between internal and external, let us inquire what\r\nground there is to presuppose that disinclination in the people. Unless\r\nwe presume at the same time that the powers of the general government\r\nwill be worse administered than those of the State government, there\r\nseems to be no room for the presumption of ill-will, disaffection, or\r\nopposition in the people. I believe it may be laid down as a general\r\nrule that their confidence in and obedience to a government will\r\ncommonly be proportioned to the goodness or badness of its\r\nadministration. It must be admitted that there are exceptions to this\r\nrule; but these exceptions depend so entirely on accidental causes,\r\nthat they cannot be considered as having any relation to the intrinsic\r\nmerits or demerits of a constitution. These can only be judged of by\r\ngeneral principles and maxims.\r\n\r\nVarious reasons have been suggested, in the course of these papers, to\r\ninduce a probability that the general government will be better\r\nadministered than the particular governments; the principal of which\r\nreasons are that the extension of the spheres of election will present\r\na greater option, or latitude of choice, to the people; that through\r\nthe medium of the State legislatures which are select bodies of men,\r\nand which are to appoint the members of the national Senate there is\r\nreason to expect that this branch will generally be composed with\r\npeculiar care and judgment; that these circumstances promise greater\r\nknowledge and more extensive information in the national councils, and\r\nthat they will be less apt to be tainted by the spirit of faction, and\r\nmore out of the reach of those occasional ill-humors, or temporary\r\nprejudices and propensities, which, in smaller societies, frequently\r\ncontaminate the public councils, beget injustice and oppression of a\r\npart of the community, and engender schemes which, though they gratify\r\na momentary inclination or desire, terminate in general distress,\r\ndissatisfaction, and disgust. Several additional reasons of\r\nconsiderable force, to fortify that probability, will occur when we\r\ncome to survey, with a more critical eye, the interior structure of the\r\nedifice which we are invited to erect. It will be sufficient here to\r\nremark, that until satisfactory reasons can be assigned to justify an\r\nopinion, that the federal government is likely to be administered in\r\nsuch a manner as to render it odious or contemptible to the people,\r\nthere can be no reasonable foundation for the supposition that the laws\r\nof the Union will meet with any greater obstruction from them, or will\r\nstand in need of any other methods to enforce their execution, than the\r\nlaws of the particular members.\r\n\r\nThe hope of impunity is a strong incitement to sedition; the dread of\r\npunishment, a proportionably strong discouragement to it. Will not the\r\ngovernment of the Union, which, if possessed of a due degree of power,\r\ncan call to its aid the collective resources of the whole Confederacy,\r\nbe more likely to repress the FORMER sentiment and to inspire the\r\nLATTER, than that of a single State, which can only command the\r\nresources within itself? A turbulent faction in a State may easily\r\nsuppose itself able to contend with the friends to the government in\r\nthat State; but it can hardly be so infatuated as to imagine itself a\r\nmatch for the combined efforts of the Union. If this reflection be\r\njust, there is less danger of resistance from irregular combinations of\r\nindividuals to the authority of the Confederacy than to that of a\r\nsingle member.\r\n\r\nI will, in this place, hazard an observation, which will not be the\r\nless just because to some it may appear new; which is, that the more\r\nthe operations of the national authority are intermingled in the\r\nordinary exercise of government, the more the citizens are accustomed\r\nto meet with it in the common occurrences of their political life, the\r\nmore it is familiarized to their sight and to their feelings, the\r\nfurther it enters into those objects which touch the most sensible\r\nchords and put in motion the most active springs of the human heart,\r\nthe greater will be the probability that it will conciliate the respect\r\nand attachment of the community. Man is very much a creature of habit.\r\nA thing that rarely strikes his senses will generally have but little\r\ninfluence upon his mind. A government continually at a distance and out\r\nof sight can hardly be expected to interest the sensations of the\r\npeople. The inference is, that the authority of the Union, and the\r\naffections of the citizens towards it, will be strengthened, rather\r\nthan weakened, by its extension to what are called matters of internal\r\nconcern; and will have less occasion to recur to force, in proportion\r\nto the familiarity and comprehensiveness of its agency. The more it\r\ncirculates through those channels and currents in which the passions of\r\nmankind naturally flow, the less will it require the aid of the violent\r\nand perilous expedients of compulsion.\r\n\r\nOne thing, at all events, must be evident, that a government like the\r\none proposed would bid much fairer to avoid the necessity of using\r\nforce, than that species of league contend for by most of its\r\nopponents; the authority of which should only operate upon the States\r\nin their political or collective capacities. It has been shown that in\r\nsuch a Confederacy there can be no sanction for the laws but force;\r\nthat frequent delinquencies in the members are the natural offspring of\r\nthe very frame of the government; and that as often as these happen,\r\nthey can only be redressed, if at all, by war and violence.\r\n\r\nThe plan reported by the convention, by extending the authority of the\r\nfederal head to the individual citizens of the several States, will\r\nenable the government to employ the ordinary magistracy of each, in the\r\nexecution of its laws. It is easy to perceive that this will tend to\r\ndestroy, in the common apprehension, all distinction between the\r\nsources from which they might proceed; and will give the federal\r\ngovernment the same advantage for securing a due obedience to its\r\nauthority which is enjoyed by the government of each State, in addition\r\nto the influence on public opinion which will result from the important\r\nconsideration of its having power to call to its assistance and support\r\nthe resources of the whole Union. It merits particular attention in\r\nthis place, that the laws of the Confederacy, as to the ENUMERATED and\r\nLEGITIMATE objects of its jurisdiction, will become the SUPREME LAW of\r\nthe land; to the observance of which all officers, legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial, in each State, will be bound by the sanctity\r\nof an oath. Thus the legislatures, courts, and magistrates, of the\r\nrespective members, will be incorporated into the operations of the\r\nnational government AS FAR AS ITS JUST AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY\r\nEXTENDS; and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its\r\nlaws.[1] Any man who will pursue, by his own reflections, the\r\nconsequences of this situation, will perceive that there is good ground\r\nto calculate upon a regular and peaceable execution of the laws of the\r\nUnion, if its powers are administered with a common share of prudence.\r\nIf we will arbitrarily suppose the contrary, we may deduce any\r\ninferences we please from the supposition; for it is certainly\r\npossible, by an injudicious exercise of the authorities of the best\r\ngovernment that ever was, or ever can be instituted, to provoke and\r\nprecipitate the people into the wildest excesses. But though the\r\nadversaries of the proposed Constitution should presume that the\r\nnational rulers would be insensible to the motives of public good, or\r\nto the obligations of duty, I would still ask them how the interests of\r\nambition, or the views of encroachment, can be promoted by such a\r\nconduct?\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] The sophistry which has been employed to show that this will tend\r\n to the destruction of the State governments, will, in its will, in its\r\n proper place, be fully detected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to the\r\nCommon Defense Considered)\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThat there may happen cases in which the national government may be\r\nnecessitated to resort to force, cannot be denied. Our own experience\r\nhas corroborated the lessons taught by the examples of other nations;\r\nthat emergencies of this sort will sometimes arise in all societies,\r\nhowever constituted; that seditions and insurrections are, unhappily,\r\nmaladies as inseparable from the body politic as tumors and eruptions\r\nfrom the natural body; that the idea of governing at all times by the\r\nsimple force of law (which we have been told is the only admissible\r\nprinciple of republican government), has no place but in the reveries\r\nof those political doctors whose sagacity disdains the admonitions of\r\nexperimental instruction.\r\n\r\nShould such emergencies at any time happen under the national\r\ngovernment, there could be no remedy but force. The means to be\r\nemployed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief. If it\r\nshould be a slight commotion in a small part of a State, the militia of\r\nthe residue would be adequate to its suppression; and the national\r\npresumption is that they would be ready to do their duty. An\r\ninsurrection, whatever may be its immediate cause, eventually endangers\r\nall government. Regard to the public peace, if not to the rights of the\r\nUnion, would engage the citizens to whom the contagion had not\r\ncommunicated itself to oppose the insurgents; and if the general\r\ngovernment should be found in practice conducive to the prosperity and\r\nfelicity of the people, it were irrational to believe that they would\r\nbe disinclined to its support.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, the insurrection should pervade a whole State, or\r\na principal part of it, the employment of a different kind of force\r\nmight become unavoidable. It appears that Massachusetts found it\r\nnecessary to raise troops for repressing the disorders within that\r\nState; that Pennsylvania, from the mere apprehension of commotions\r\namong a part of her citizens, has thought proper to have recourse to\r\nthe same measure. Suppose the State of New York had been inclined to\r\nre-establish her lost jurisdiction over the inhabitants of Vermont,\r\ncould she have hoped for success in such an enterprise from the efforts\r\nof the militia alone? Would she not have been compelled to raise and to\r\nmaintain a more regular force for the execution of her design? If it\r\nmust then be admitted that the necessity of recurring to a force\r\ndifferent from the militia, in cases of this extraordinary nature, is\r\napplicable to the State governments themselves, why should the\r\npossibility, that the national government might be under a like\r\nnecessity, in similar extremities, be made an objection to its\r\nexistence? Is it not surprising that men who declare an attachment to\r\nthe Union in the abstract, should urge as an objection to the proposed\r\nConstitution what applies with tenfold weight to the plan for which\r\nthey contend; and what, as far as it has any foundation in truth, is an\r\ninevitable consequence of civil society upon an enlarged scale? Who\r\nwould not prefer that possibility to the unceasing agitations and\r\nfrequent revolutions which are the continual scourges of petty\r\nrepublics?\r\n\r\nLet us pursue this examination in another light. Suppose, in lieu of\r\none general system, two, or three, or even four Confederacies were to\r\nbe formed, would not the same difficulty oppose itself to the\r\noperations of either of these Confederacies? Would not each of them be\r\nexposed to the same casualties; and when these happened, be obliged to\r\nhave recourse to the same expedients for upholding its authority which\r\nare objected to in a government for all the States? Would the militia,\r\nin this supposition, be more ready or more able to support the federal\r\nauthority than in the case of a general union? All candid and\r\nintelligent men must, upon due consideration, acknowledge that the\r\nprinciple of the objection is equally applicable to either of the two\r\ncases; and that whether we have one government for all the States, or\r\ndifferent governments for different parcels of them, or even if there\r\nshould be an entire separation of the States, there might sometimes be\r\na necessity to make use of a force constituted differently from the\r\nmilitia, to preserve the peace of the community and to maintain the\r\njust authority of the laws against those violent invasions of them\r\nwhich amount to insurrections and rebellions.\r\n\r\nIndependent of all other reasonings upon the subject, it is a full\r\nanswer to those who require a more peremptory provision against\r\nmilitary establishments in time of peace, to say that the whole power\r\nof the proposed government is to be in the hands of the representatives\r\nof the people. This is the essential, and, after all, only efficacious\r\nsecurity for the rights and privileges of the people, which is\r\nattainable in civil society.[1]\r\n\r\nIf the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there\r\nis then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of\r\nself-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government,\r\nand which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be\r\nexerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those\r\nof the rulers of an individual state. In a single state, if the persons\r\nintrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels,\r\nsubdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct\r\ngovernment in each, can take no regular measures for defense. The\r\ncitizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without\r\nsystem, without resource; except in their courage and despair. The\r\nusurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often\r\ncrush the opposition in embryo. The smaller the extent of the\r\nterritory, the more difficult will it be for the people to form a\r\nregular or systematic plan of opposition, and the more easy will it be\r\nto defeat their early efforts. Intelligence can be more speedily\r\nobtained of their preparations and movements, and the military force in\r\nthe possession of the usurpers can be more rapidly directed against the\r\npart where the opposition has begun. In this situation there must be a\r\npeculiar coincidence of circumstances to insure success to the popular\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nThe obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase\r\nwith the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens\r\nunderstand their rights and are disposed to defend them. The natural\r\nstrength of the people in a large community, in proportion to the\r\nartificial strength of the government, is greater than in a small, and\r\nof course more competent to a struggle with the attempts of the\r\ngovernment to establish a tyranny. But in a confederacy the people,\r\nwithout exaggeration, may be said to be entirely the masters of their\r\nown fate. Power being almost always the rival of power, the general\r\ngovernment will at all times stand ready to check the usurpations of\r\nthe state governments, and these will have the same disposition towards\r\nthe general government. The people, by throwing themselves into either\r\nscale, will infallibly make it preponderate. If their rights are\r\ninvaded by either, they can make use of the other as the instrument of\r\nredress. How wise will it be in them by cherishing the union to\r\npreserve to themselves an advantage which can never be too highly\r\nprized!\r\n\r\nIt may safely be received as an axiom in our political system, that the\r\nState governments will, in all possible contingencies, afford complete\r\nsecurity against invasions of the public liberty by the national\r\nauthority. Projects of usurpation cannot be masked under pretenses so\r\nlikely to escape the penetration of select bodies of men, as of the\r\npeople at large. The legislatures will have better means of\r\ninformation. They can discover the danger at a distance; and possessing\r\nall the organs of civil power, and the confidence of the people, they\r\ncan at once adopt a regular plan of opposition, in which they can\r\ncombine all the resources of the community. They can readily\r\ncommunicate with each other in the different States, and unite their\r\ncommon forces for the protection of their common liberty.\r\n\r\nThe great extent of the country is a further security. We have already\r\nexperienced its utility against the attacks of a foreign power. And it\r\nwould have precisely the same effect against the enterprises of\r\nambitious rulers in the national councils. If the federal army should\r\nbe able to quell the resistance of one State, the distant States would\r\nhave it in their power to make head with fresh forces. The advantages\r\nobtained in one place must be abandoned to subdue the opposition in\r\nothers; and the moment the part which had been reduced to submission\r\nwas left to itself, its efforts would be renewed, and its resistance\r\nrevive.\r\n\r\nWe should recollect that the extent of the military force must, at all\r\nevents, be regulated by the resources of the country. For a long time\r\nto come, it will not be possible to maintain a large army; and as the\r\nmeans of doing this increase, the population and natural strength of\r\nthe community will proportionably increase. When will the time arrive\r\nthat the federal government can raise and maintain an army capable of\r\nerecting a despotism over the great body of the people of an immense\r\nempire, who are in a situation, through the medium of their State\r\ngovernments, to take measures for their own defense, with all the\r\ncelerity, regularity, and system of independent nations? The\r\napprehension may be considered as a disease, for which there can be\r\nfound no cure in the resources of argument and reasoning.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] Its full efficacy will be examined hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXIX.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Militia\r\n\r\nFrom the Daily Advertiser.\r\n\r\nThursday, January 10, 1788\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe power of regulating the militia, and of commanding its services in\r\ntimes of insurrection and invasion are natural incidents to the duties\r\nof superintending the common defense, and of watching over the internal\r\npeace of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nIt requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity\r\nin the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended\r\nwith the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into\r\nservice for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the\r\nduties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and\r\nconcert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army;\r\nand it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency\r\nin military functions which would be essential to their usefulness.\r\nThis desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the\r\nregulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority.\r\nIt is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the\r\nconvention proposes to empower the Union “to provide for organizing,\r\narming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of\r\nthem as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING\r\nTO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE\r\nAUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE\r\nPRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.”\r\n\r\nOf the different grounds which have been taken in opposition to the\r\nplan of the convention, there is none that was so little to have been\r\nexpected, or is so untenable in itself, as the one from which this\r\nparticular provision has been attacked. If a well-regulated militia be\r\nthe most natural defense of a free country, it ought certainly to be\r\nunder the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is\r\nconstituted the guardian of the national security. If standing armies\r\nare dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia, in the\r\nbody to whose care the protection of the State is committed, ought, as\r\nfar as possible, to take away the inducement and the pretext to such\r\nunfriendly institutions. If the federal government can command the aid\r\nof the militia in those emergencies which call for the military arm in\r\nsupport of the civil magistrate, it can the better dispense with the\r\nemployment of a different kind of force. If it cannot avail itself of\r\nthe former, it will be obliged to recur to the latter. To render an\r\narmy unnecessary, will be a more certain method of preventing its\r\nexistence than a thousand prohibitions upon paper.\r\n\r\nIn order to cast an odium upon the power of calling forth the militia\r\nto execute the laws of the Union, it has been remarked that there is\r\nnowhere any provision in the proposed Constitution for calling out the\r\nPOSSE COMITATUS, to assist the magistrate in the execution of his duty,\r\nwhence it has been inferred, that military force was intended to be his\r\nonly auxiliary. There is a striking incoherence in the objections which\r\nhave appeared, and sometimes even from the same quarter, not much\r\ncalculated to inspire a very favorable opinion of the sincerity or fair\r\ndealing of their authors. The same persons who tell us in one breath,\r\nthat the powers of the federal government will be despotic and\r\nunlimited, inform us in the next, that it has not authority sufficient\r\neven to call out the POSSE COMITATUS. The latter, fortunately, is as\r\nmuch short of the truth as the former exceeds it. It would be as absurd\r\nto doubt, that a right to pass all laws NECESSARY AND PROPER to execute\r\nits declared powers, would include that of requiring the assistance of\r\nthe citizens to the officers who may be intrusted with the execution of\r\nthose laws, as it would be to believe, that a right to enact laws\r\nnecessary and proper for the imposition and collection of taxes would\r\ninvolve that of varying the rules of descent and of the alienation of\r\nlanded property, or of abolishing the trial by jury in cases relating\r\nto it. It being therefore evident that the supposition of a want of\r\npower to require the aid of the POSSE COMITATUS is entirely destitute\r\nof color, it will follow, that the conclusion which has been drawn from\r\nit, in its application to the authority of the federal government over\r\nthe militia, is as uncandid as it is illogical. What reason could there\r\nbe to infer, that force was intended to be the sole instrument of\r\nauthority, merely because there is a power to make use of it when\r\nnecessary? What shall we think of the motives which could induce men of\r\nsense to reason in this manner? How shall we prevent a conflict between\r\ncharity and judgment?\r\n\r\nBy a curious refinement upon the spirit of republican jealousy, we are\r\neven taught to apprehend danger from the militia itself, in the hands\r\nof the federal government. It is observed that select corps may be\r\nformed, composed of the young and ardent, who may be rendered\r\nsubservient to the views of arbitrary power. What plan for the\r\nregulation of the militia may be pursued by the national government, is\r\nimpossible to be foreseen. But so far from viewing the matter in the\r\nsame light with those who object to select corps as dangerous, were the\r\nConstitution ratified, and were I to deliver my sentiments to a member\r\nof the federal legislature from this State on the subject of a militia\r\nestablishment, I should hold to him, in substance, the following\r\ndiscourse:\r\n\r\n“The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as\r\nfutile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of being carried\r\ninto execution. A tolerable expertness in military movements is a\r\nbusiness that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a\r\nweek, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great\r\nbody of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be\r\nunder arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and\r\nevolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of\r\nperfection which would entitle them to the character of a\r\nwell-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a\r\nserious public inconvenience and loss. It would form an annual\r\ndeduction from the productive labor of the country, to an amount which,\r\ncalculating upon the present numbers of the people, would not fall far\r\nshort of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all the\r\nStates. To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and\r\nindustry to so considerable an extent, would be unwise: and the\r\nexperiment, if made, could not succeed, because it would not long be\r\nendured. Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the\r\npeople at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in\r\norder to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to\r\nassemble them once or twice in the course of a year.\r\n\r\n“But though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be\r\nabandoned as mischievous or impracticable; yet it is a matter of the\r\nutmost importance that a well-digested plan should, as soon as\r\npossible, be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia. The\r\nattention of the government ought particularly to be directed to the\r\nformation of a select corps of moderate extent, upon such principles as\r\nwill really fit them for service in case of need. By thus\r\ncircumscribing the plan, it will be possible to have an excellent body\r\nof well-trained militia, ready to take the field whenever the defense\r\nof the State shall require it. This will not only lessen the call for\r\nmilitary establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige\r\nthe government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be\r\nformidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body\r\nof citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the\r\nuse of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of\r\ntheir fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can\r\nbe devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against\r\nit, if it should exist.”\r\n\r\nThus differently from the adversaries of the proposed Constitution\r\nshould I reason on the same subject, deducing arguments of safety from\r\nthe very sources which they represent as fraught with danger and\r\nperdition. But how the national legislature may reason on the point, is\r\na thing which neither they nor I can foresee.\r\n\r\nThere is something so far-fetched and so extravagant in the idea of\r\ndanger to liberty from the militia, that one is at a loss whether to\r\ntreat it with gravity or with raillery; whether to consider it as a\r\nmere trial of skill, like the paradoxes of rhetoricians; as a\r\ndisingenuous artifice to instil prejudices at any price; or as the\r\nserious offspring of political fanaticism. Where in the name of\r\ncommon-sense, are our fears to end if we may not trust our sons, our\r\nbrothers, our neighbors, our fellow-citizens? What shadow of danger can\r\nthere be from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their\r\ncountrymen and who participate with them in the same feelings,\r\nsentiments, habits and interests? What reasonable cause of apprehension\r\ncan be inferred from a power in the Union to prescribe regulations for\r\nthe militia, and to command its services when necessary, while the\r\nparticular States are to have the SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE APPOINTMENT OF THE\r\nOFFICERS? If it were possible seriously to indulge a jealousy of the\r\nmilitia upon any conceivable establishment under the federal\r\ngovernment, the circumstance of the officers being in the appointment\r\nof the States ought at once to extinguish it. There can be no doubt\r\nthat this circumstance will always secure to them a preponderating\r\ninfluence over the militia.\r\n\r\nIn reading many of the publications against the Constitution, a man is\r\napt to imagine that he is perusing some ill-written tale or romance,\r\nwhich instead of natural and agreeable images, exhibits to the mind\r\nnothing but frightful and distorted shapes—\r\n\r\n“Gorgons, hydras, and chimeras dire;”\r\n\r\ndiscoloring and disfiguring whatever it represents, and transforming\r\neverything it touches into a monster.\r\n\r\nA sample of this is to be observed in the exaggerated and improbable\r\nsuggestions which have taken place respecting the power of calling for\r\nthe services of the militia. That of New Hampshire is to be marched to\r\nGeorgia, of Georgia to New Hampshire, of New York to Kentucky, and of\r\nKentucky to Lake Champlain. Nay, the debts due to the French and Dutch\r\nare to be paid in militiamen instead of louis d’ors and ducats. At one\r\nmoment there is to be a large army to lay prostrate the liberties of\r\nthe people; at another moment the militia of Virginia are to be dragged\r\nfrom their homes five or six hundred miles, to tame the republican\r\ncontumacy of Massachusetts; and that of Massachusetts is to be\r\ntransported an equal distance to subdue the refractory haughtiness of\r\nthe aristocratic Virginians. Do the persons who rave at this rate\r\nimagine that their art or their eloquence can impose any conceits or\r\nabsurdities upon the people of America for infallible truths?\r\n\r\nIf there should be an army to be made use of as the engine of\r\ndespotism, what need of the militia? If there should be no army,\r\nwhither would the militia, irritated by being called upon to undertake\r\na distant and hopeless expedition, for the purpose of riveting the\r\nchains of slavery upon a part of their countrymen, direct their course,\r\nbut to the seat of the tyrants, who had meditated so foolish as well as\r\nso wicked a project, to crush them in their imagined intrenchments of\r\npower, and to make them an example of the just vengeance of an abused\r\nand incensed people? Is this the way in which usurpers stride to\r\ndominion over a numerous and enlightened nation? Do they begin by\r\nexciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended\r\nusurpations? Do they usually commence their career by wanton and\r\ndisgustful acts of power, calculated to answer no end, but to draw upon\r\nthemselves universal hatred and execration? Are suppositions of this\r\nsort the sober admonitions of discerning patriots to a discerning\r\npeople? Or are they the inflammatory ravings of incendiaries or\r\ndistempered enthusiasts? If we were even to suppose the national rulers\r\nactuated by the most ungovernable ambition, it is impossible to believe\r\nthat they would employ such preposterous means to accomplish their\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nIn times of insurrection, or invasion, it would be natural and proper\r\nthat the militia of a neighboring State should be marched into another,\r\nto resist a common enemy, or to guard the republic against the violence\r\nof faction or sedition. This was frequently the case, in respect to the\r\nfirst object, in the course of the late war; and this mutual succor is,\r\nindeed, a principal end of our political association. If the power of\r\naffording it be placed under the direction of the Union, there will be\r\nno danger of a supine and listless inattention to the dangers of a\r\nneighbor, till its near approach had superadded the incitements of\r\nselfpreservation to the too feeble impulses of duty and sympathy.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXX.\r\n\r\nConcerning the General Power of Taxation\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, December 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIt has been already observed that the federal government ought to\r\npossess the power of providing for the support of the national forces;\r\nin which proposition was intended to be included the expense of raising\r\ntroops, of building and equipping fleets, and all other expenses in any\r\nwise connected with military arrangements and operations. But these are\r\nnot the only objects to which the jurisdiction of the Union, in respect\r\nto revenue, must necessarily be empowered to extend. It must embrace a\r\nprovision for the support of the national civil list; for the payment\r\nof the national debts contracted, or that may be contracted; and, in\r\ngeneral, for all those matters which will call for disbursements out of\r\nthe national treasury. The conclusion is, that there must be\r\ninterwoven, in the frame of the government, a general power of\r\ntaxation, in one shape or another.\r\n\r\nMoney is, with propriety, considered as the vital principle of the body\r\npolitic; as that which sustains its life and motion, and enables it to\r\nperform its most essential functions. A complete power, therefore, to\r\nprocure a regular and adequate supply of it, as far as the resources of\r\nthe community will permit, may be regarded as an indispensable\r\ningredient in every constitution. From a deficiency in this particular,\r\none of two evils must ensue; either the people must be subjected to\r\ncontinual plunder, as a substitute for a more eligible mode of\r\nsupplying the public wants, or the government must sink into a fatal\r\natrophy, and, in a short course of time, perish.\r\n\r\nIn the Ottoman or Turkish empire, the sovereign, though in other\r\nrespects absolute master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects, has\r\nno right to impose a new tax. The consequence is that he permits the\r\nbashaws or governors of provinces to pillage the people without mercy;\r\nand, in turn, squeezes out of them the sums of which he stands in need,\r\nto satisfy his own exigencies and those of the state. In America, from\r\na like cause, the government of the Union has gradually dwindled into a\r\nstate of decay, approaching nearly to annihilation. Who can doubt, that\r\nthe happiness of the people in both countries would be promoted by\r\ncompetent authorities in the proper hands, to provide the revenues\r\nwhich the necessities of the public might require?\r\n\r\nThe present Confederation, feeble as it is intended to repose in the\r\nUnited States, an unlimited power of providing for the pecuniary wants\r\nof the Union. But proceeding upon an erroneous principle, it has been\r\ndone in such a manner as entirely to have frustrated the intention.\r\nCongress, by the articles which compose that compact (as has already\r\nbeen stated), are authorized to ascertain and call for any sums of\r\nmoney necessary, in their judgment, to the service of the United\r\nStates; and their requisitions, if conformable to the rule of\r\napportionment, are in every constitutional sense obligatory upon the\r\nStates. These have no right to question the propriety of the demand; no\r\ndiscretion beyond that of devising the ways and means of furnishing the\r\nsums demanded. But though this be strictly and truly the case; though\r\nthe assumption of such a right would be an infringement of the articles\r\nof Union; though it may seldom or never have been avowedly claimed, yet\r\nin practice it has been constantly exercised, and would continue to be\r\nso, as long as the revenues of the Confederacy should remain dependent\r\non the intermediate agency of its members. What the consequences of\r\nthis system have been, is within the knowledge of every man the least\r\nconversant in our public affairs, and has been amply unfolded in\r\ndifferent parts of these inquiries. It is this which has chiefly\r\ncontributed to reduce us to a situation, which affords ample cause both\r\nof mortification to ourselves, and of triumph to our enemies.\r\n\r\nWhat remedy can there be for this situation, but in a change of the\r\nsystem which has produced it in a change of the fallacious and delusive\r\nsystem of quotas and requisitions? What substitute can there be\r\nimagined for this ignis fatuus in finance, but that of permitting the\r\nnational government to raise its own revenues by the ordinary methods\r\nof taxation authorized in every well-ordered constitution of civil\r\ngovernment? Ingenious men may declaim with plausibility on any subject;\r\nbut no human ingenuity can point out any other expedient to rescue us\r\nfrom the inconveniences and embarrassments naturally resulting from\r\ndefective supplies of the public treasury.\r\n\r\nThe more intelligent adversaries of the new Constitution admit the\r\nforce of this reasoning; but they qualify their admission by a\r\ndistinction between what they call INTERNAL and EXTERNAL taxation. The\r\nformer they would reserve to the State governments; the latter, which\r\nthey explain into commercial imposts, or rather duties on imported\r\narticles, they declare themselves willing to concede to the federal\r\nhead. This distinction, however, would violate the maxim of good sense\r\nand sound policy, which dictates that every POWER ought to be in\r\nproportion to its OBJECT; and would still leave the general government\r\nin a kind of tutelage to the State governments, inconsistent with every\r\nidea of vigor or efficiency. Who can pretend that commercial imposts\r\nare, or would be, alone equal to the present and future exigencies of\r\nthe Union? Taking into the account the existing debt, foreign and\r\ndomestic, upon any plan of extinguishment which a man moderately\r\nimpressed with the importance of public justice and public credit could\r\napprove, in addition to the establishments which all parties will\r\nacknowledge to be necessary, we could not reasonably flatter ourselves,\r\nthat this resource alone, upon the most improved scale, would even\r\nsuffice for its present necessities. Its future necessities admit not\r\nof calculation or limitation; and upon the principle, more than once\r\nadverted to, the power of making provision for them as they arise ought\r\nto be equally unconfined. I believe it may be regarded as a position\r\nwarranted by the history of mankind, that, IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF\r\nTHINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE,\r\nWILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.\r\n\r\nTo say that deficiencies may be provided for by requisitions upon the\r\nStates, is on the one hand to acknowledge that this system cannot be\r\ndepended upon, and on the other hand to depend upon it for every thing\r\nbeyond a certain limit. Those who have carefully attended to its vices\r\nand deformities as they have been exhibited by experience or delineated\r\nin the course of these papers, must feel invincible repugnancy to\r\ntrusting the national interests in any degree to its operation. Its\r\ninevitable tendency, whenever it is brought into activity, must be to\r\nenfeeble the Union, and sow the seeds of discord and contention between\r\nthe federal head and its members, and between the members themselves.\r\nCan it be expected that the deficiencies would be better supplied in\r\nthis mode than the total wants of the Union have heretofore been\r\nsupplied in the same mode? It ought to be recollected that if less will\r\nbe required from the States, they will have proportionably less means\r\nto answer the demand. If the opinions of those who contend for the\r\ndistinction which has been mentioned were to be received as evidence of\r\ntruth, one would be led to conclude that there was some known point in\r\nthe economy of national affairs at which it would be safe to stop and\r\nto say: Thus far the ends of public happiness will be promoted by\r\nsupplying the wants of government, and all beyond this is unworthy of\r\nour care or anxiety. How is it possible that a government half supplied\r\nand always necessitous, can fulfill the purposes of its institution,\r\ncan provide for the security, advance the prosperity, or support the\r\nreputation of the commonwealth? How can it ever possess either energy\r\nor stability, dignity or credit, confidence at home or respectability\r\nabroad? How can its administration be any thing else than a succession\r\nof expedients temporizing, impotent, disgraceful? How will it be able\r\nto avoid a frequent sacrifice of its engagements to immediate\r\nnecessity? How can it undertake or execute any liberal or enlarged\r\nplans of public good?\r\n\r\nLet us attend to what would be the effects of this situation in the\r\nvery first war in which we should happen to be engaged. We will\r\npresume, for argument’s sake, that the revenue arising from the impost\r\nduties answers the purposes of a provision for the public debt and of a\r\npeace establishment for the Union. Thus circumstanced, a war breaks\r\nout. What would be the probable conduct of the government in such an\r\nemergency? Taught by experience that proper dependence could not be\r\nplaced on the success of requisitions, unable by its own authority to\r\nlay hold of fresh resources, and urged by considerations of national\r\ndanger, would it not be driven to the expedient of diverting the funds\r\nalready appropriated from their proper objects to the defense of the\r\nState? It is not easy to see how a step of this kind could be avoided;\r\nand if it should be taken, it is evident that it would prove the\r\ndestruction of public credit at the very moment that it was becoming\r\nessential to the public safety. To imagine that at such a crisis credit\r\nmight be dispensed with, would be the extreme of infatuation. In the\r\nmodern system of war, nations the most wealthy are obliged to have\r\nrecourse to large loans. A country so little opulent as ours must feel\r\nthis necessity in a much stronger degree. But who would lend to a\r\ngovernment that prefaced its overtures for borrowing by an act which\r\ndemonstrated that no reliance could be placed on the steadiness of its\r\nmeasures for paying? The loans it might be able to procure would be as\r\nlimited in their extent as burdensome in their conditions. They would\r\nbe made upon the same principles that usurers commonly lend to bankrupt\r\nand fraudulent debtors, with a sparing hand and at enormous premiums.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be imagined that, from the scantiness of the resources\r\nof the country, the necessity of diverting the established funds in the\r\ncase supposed would exist, though the national government should\r\npossess an unrestrained power of taxation. But two considerations will\r\nserve to quiet all apprehension on this head: one is, that we are sure\r\nthe resources of the community, in their full extent, will be brought\r\ninto activity for the benefit of the Union; the other is, that whatever\r\ndeficiences there may be, can without difficulty be supplied by loans.\r\n\r\nThe power of creating new funds upon new objects of taxation, by its\r\nown authority, would enable the national government to borrow as far as\r\nits necessities might require. Foreigners, as well as the citizens of\r\nAmerica, could then reasonably repose confidence in its engagements;\r\nbut to depend upon a government that must itself depend upon thirteen\r\nother governments for the means of fulfilling its contracts, when once\r\nits situation is clearly understood, would require a degree of\r\ncredulity not often to be met with in the pecuniary transactions of\r\nmankind, and little reconcilable with the usual sharp-sightedness of\r\navarice.\r\n\r\nReflections of this kind may have trifling weight with men who hope to\r\nsee realized in America the halcyon scenes of the poetic or fabulous\r\nage; but to those who believe we are likely to experience a common\r\nportion of the vicissitudes and calamities which have fallen to the lot\r\nof other nations, they must appear entitled to serious attention. Such\r\nmen must behold the actual situation of their country with painful\r\nsolicitude, and deprecate the evils which ambition or revenge might,\r\nwith too much facility, inflict upon it.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXXI.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning the General Power of Taxation)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, January 1, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIn disquisitions of every kind, there are certain primary truths, or\r\nfirst principles, upon which all subsequent reasonings must depend.\r\nThese contain an internal evidence which, antecedent to all reflection\r\nor combination, commands the assent of the mind. Where it produces not\r\nthis effect, it must proceed either from some defect or disorder in the\r\norgans of perception, or from the influence of some strong interest, or\r\npassion, or prejudice. Of this nature are the maxims in geometry, that\r\n“the whole is greater than its part; things equal to the same are equal\r\nto one another; two straight lines cannot enclose a space; and all\r\nright angles are equal to each other.” Of the same nature are these\r\nother maxims in ethics and politics, that there cannot be an effect\r\nwithout a cause; that the means ought to be proportioned to the end;\r\nthat every power ought to be commensurate with its object; that there\r\nought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect a purpose which\r\nis itself incapable of limitation. And there are other truths in the\r\ntwo latter sciences which, if they cannot pretend to rank in the class\r\nof axioms, are yet such direct inferences from them, and so obvious in\r\nthemselves, and so agreeable to the natural and unsophisticated\r\ndictates of common-sense, that they challenge the assent of a sound and\r\nunbiased mind, with a degree of force and conviction almost equally\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nThe objects of geometrical inquiry are so entirely abstracted from\r\nthose pursuits which stir up and put in motion the unruly passions of\r\nthe human heart, that mankind, without difficulty, adopt not only the\r\nmore simple theorems of the science, but even those abstruse paradoxes\r\nwhich, however they may appear susceptible of demonstration, are at\r\nvariance with the natural conceptions which the mind, without the aid\r\nof philosophy, would be led to entertain upon the subject. The INFINITE\r\nDIVISIBILITY of matter, or, in other words, the INFINITE divisibility\r\nof a FINITE thing, extending even to the minutest atom, is a point\r\nagreed among geometricians, though not less incomprehensible to\r\ncommon-sense than any of those mysteries in religion, against which the\r\nbatteries of infidelity have been so industriously leveled.\r\n\r\nBut in the sciences of morals and politics, men are found far less\r\ntractable. To a certain degree, it is right and useful that this should\r\nbe the case. Caution and investigation are a necessary armor against\r\nerror and imposition. But this untractableness may be carried too far,\r\nand may degenerate into obstinacy, perverseness, or disingenuity.\r\nThough it cannot be pretended that the principles of moral and\r\npolitical knowledge have, in general, the same degree of certainty with\r\nthose of the mathematics, yet they have much better claims in this\r\nrespect than, to judge from the conduct of men in particular\r\nsituations, we should be disposed to allow them. The obscurity is much\r\noftener in the passions and prejudices of the reasoner than in the\r\nsubject. Men, upon too many occasions, do not give their own\r\nunderstandings fair play; but, yielding to some untoward bias, they\r\nentangle themselves in words and confound themselves in subtleties.\r\n\r\nHow else could it happen (if we admit the objectors to be sincere in\r\ntheir opposition), that positions so clear as those which manifest the\r\nnecessity of a general power of taxation in the government of the\r\nUnion, should have to encounter any adversaries among men of\r\ndiscernment? Though these positions have been elsewhere fully stated,\r\nthey will perhaps not be improperly recapitulated in this place, as\r\nintroductory to an examination of what may have been offered by way of\r\nobjection to them. They are in substance as follows:\r\n\r\nA government ought to contain in itself every power requisite to the\r\nfull accomplishment of the objects committed to its care, and to the\r\ncomplete execution of the trusts for which it is responsible, free from\r\nevery other control but a regard to the public good and to the sense of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nAs the duties of superintending the national defense and of securing\r\nthe public peace against foreign or domestic violence involve a\r\nprovision for casualties and dangers to which no possible limits can be\r\nassigned, the power of making that provision ought to know no other\r\nbounds than the exigencies of the nation and the resources of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nAs revenue is the essential engine by which the means of answering the\r\nnational exigencies must be procured, the power of procuring that\r\narticle in its full extent must necessarily be comprehended in that of\r\nproviding for those exigencies.\r\n\r\nAs theory and practice conspire to prove that the power of procuring\r\nrevenue is unavailing when exercised over the States in their\r\ncollective capacities, the federal government must of necessity be\r\ninvested with an unqualified power of taxation in the ordinary modes.\r\n\r\nDid not experience evince the contrary, it would be natural to conclude\r\nthat the propriety of a general power of taxation in the national\r\ngovernment might safely be permitted to rest on the evidence of these\r\npropositions, unassisted by any additional arguments or illustrations.\r\nBut we find, in fact, that the antagonists of the proposed\r\nConstitution, so far from acquiescing in their justness or truth, seem\r\nto make their principal and most zealous effort against this part of\r\nthe plan. It may therefore be satisfactory to analyze the arguments\r\nwith which they combat it.\r\n\r\nThose of them which have been most labored with that view, seem in\r\nsubstance to amount to this: “It is not true, because the exigencies of\r\nthe Union may not be susceptible of limitation, that its power of\r\nlaying taxes ought to be unconfined. Revenue is as requisite to the\r\npurposes of the local administrations as to those of the Union; and the\r\nformer are at least of equal importance with the latter to the\r\nhappiness of the people. It is, therefore, as necessary that the State\r\ngovernments should be able to command the means of supplying their\r\nwants, as that the national government should possess the like faculty\r\nin respect to the wants of the Union. But an indefinite power of\r\ntaxation in the LATTER might, and probably would in time, deprive the\r\nFORMER of the means of providing for their own necessities; and would\r\nsubject them entirely to the mercy of the national legislature. As the\r\nlaws of the Union are to become the supreme law of the land, as it is\r\nto have power to pass all laws that may be NECESSARY for carrying into\r\nexecution the authorities with which it is proposed to vest it, the\r\nnational government might at any time abolish the taxes imposed for\r\nState objects upon the pretense of an interference with its own. It\r\nmight allege a necessity of doing this in order to give efficacy to the\r\nnational revenues. And thus all the resources of taxation might by\r\ndegrees become the subjects of federal monopoly, to the entire\r\nexclusion and destruction of the State governments.”\r\n\r\nThis mode of reasoning appears sometimes to turn upon the supposition\r\nof usurpation in the national government; at other times it seems to be\r\ndesigned only as a deduction from the constitutional operation of its\r\nintended powers. It is only in the latter light that it can be admitted\r\nto have any pretensions to fairness. The moment we launch into\r\nconjectures about the usurpations of the federal government, we get\r\ninto an unfathomable abyss, and fairly put ourselves out of the reach\r\nof all reasoning. Imagination may range at pleasure till it gets\r\nbewildered amidst the labyrinths of an enchanted castle, and knows not\r\non which side to turn to extricate itself from the perplexities into\r\nwhich it has so rashly adventured. Whatever may be the limits or\r\nmodifications of the powers of the Union, it is easy to imagine an\r\nendless train of possible dangers; and by indulging an excess of\r\njealousy and timidity, we may bring ourselves to a state of absolute\r\nscepticism and irresolution. I repeat here what I have observed in\r\nsubstance in another place, that all observations founded upon the\r\ndanger of usurpation ought to be referred to the composition and\r\nstructure of the government, not to the nature or extent of its powers.\r\nThe State governments, by their original constitutions, are invested\r\nwith complete sovereignty. In what does our security consist against\r\nusurpation from that quarter? Doubtless in the manner of their\r\nformation, and in a due dependence of those who are to administer them\r\nupon the people. If the proposed construction of the federal government\r\nbe found, upon an impartial examination of it, to be such as to afford,\r\nto a proper extent, the same species of security, all apprehensions on\r\nthe score of usurpation ought to be discarded.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that a disposition in the State governments\r\nto encroach upon the rights of the Union is quite as probable as a\r\ndisposition in the Union to encroach upon the rights of the State\r\ngovernments. What side would be likely to prevail in such a conflict,\r\nmust depend on the means which the contending parties could employ\r\ntoward insuring success. As in republics strength is always on the side\r\nof the people, and as there are weighty reasons to induce a belief that\r\nthe State governments will commonly possess most influence over them,\r\nthe natural conclusion is that such contests will be most apt to end to\r\nthe disadvantage of the Union; and that there is greater probability of\r\nencroachments by the members upon the federal head, than by the federal\r\nhead upon the members. But it is evident that all conjectures of this\r\nkind must be extremely vague and fallible: and that it is by far the\r\nsafest course to lay them altogether aside, and to confine our\r\nattention wholly to the nature and extent of the powers as they are\r\ndelineated in the Constitution. Every thing beyond this must be left to\r\nthe prudence and firmness of the people; who, as they will hold the\r\nscales in their own hands, it is to be hoped, will always take care to\r\npreserve the constitutional equilibrium between the general and the\r\nState governments. Upon this ground, which is evidently the true one,\r\nit will not be difficult to obviate the objections which have been made\r\nto an indefinite power of taxation in the United States.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXXII.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning the General Power of Taxation)\r\n\r\nFrom the Daily Advertiser.\r\n\r\nThursday, January 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nAlthough I am of opinion that there would be no real danger of the\r\nconsequences which seem to be apprehended to the State governments from\r\na power in the Union to control them in the levies of money, because I\r\nam persuaded that the sense of the people, the extreme hazard of\r\nprovoking the resentments of the State governments, and a conviction of\r\nthe utility and necessity of local administrations for local purposes,\r\nwould be a complete barrier against the oppressive use of such a power;\r\nyet I am willing here to allow, in its full extent, the justness of the\r\nreasoning which requires that the individual States should possess an\r\nindependent and uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues\r\nfor the supply of their own wants. And making this concession, I affirm\r\nthat (with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports) they\r\nwould, under the plan of the convention, retain that authority in the\r\nmost absolute and unqualified sense; and that an attempt on the part of\r\nthe national government to abridge them in the exercise of it, would be\r\na violent assumption of power, unwarranted by any article or clause of\r\nits Constitution.\r\n\r\nAn entire consolidation of the States into one complete national\r\nsovereignty would imply an entire subordination of the parts; and\r\nwhatever powers might remain in them, would be altogether dependent on\r\nthe general will. But as the plan of the convention aims only at a\r\npartial union or consolidation, the State governments would clearly\r\nretain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had, and which\r\nwere not, by that act, EXCLUSIVELY delegated to the United States. This\r\nexclusive delegation, or rather this alienation, of State sovereignty,\r\nwould only exist in three cases: where the Constitution in express\r\nterms granted an exclusive authority to the Union; where it granted in\r\none instance an authority to the Union, and in another prohibited the\r\nStates from exercising the like authority; and where it granted an\r\nauthority to the Union, to which a similar authority in the States\r\nwould be absolutely and totally CONTRADICTORY and REPUGNANT. I use\r\nthese terms to distinguish this last case from another which might\r\nappear to resemble it, but which would, in fact, be essentially\r\ndifferent; I mean where the exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction might\r\nbe productive of occasional interferences in the POLICY of any branch\r\nof administration, but would not imply any direct contradiction or\r\nrepugnancy in point of constitutional authority. These three cases of\r\nexclusive jurisdiction in the federal government may be exemplified by\r\nthe following instances: The last clause but one in the eighth section\r\nof the first article provides expressly that Congress shall exercise\r\n“EXCLUSIVE LEGISLATION” over the district to be appropriated as the\r\nseat of government. This answers to the first case. The first clause of\r\nthe same section empowers Congress “TO LAY AND COLLECT TAXES, DUTIES,\r\nIMPOSTS AND EXCISES”; and the second clause of the tenth section of the\r\nsame article declares that, “NO STATE SHALL, without the consent of\r\nCongress, LAY ANY IMPOSTS OR DUTIES ON IMPORTS OR EXPORTS, except for\r\nthe purpose of executing its inspection laws.” Hence would result an\r\nexclusive power in the Union to lay duties on imports and exports, with\r\nthe particular exception mentioned; but this power is abridged by\r\nanother clause, which declares that no tax or duty shall be laid on\r\narticles exported from any State; in consequence of which\r\nqualification, it now only extends to the DUTIES ON IMPORTS. This\r\nanswers to the second case. The third will be found in that clause\r\nwhich declares that Congress shall have power “to establish an UNIFORM\r\nRULE of naturalization throughout the United States.” This must\r\nnecessarily be exclusive; because if each State had power to prescribe\r\na DISTINCT RULE, there could not be a UNIFORM RULE.\r\n\r\nA case which may perhaps be thought to resemble the latter, but which\r\nis in fact widely different, affects the question immediately under\r\nconsideration. I mean the power of imposing taxes on all articles other\r\nthan exports and imports. This, I contend, is manifestly a concurrent\r\nand coequal authority in the United States and in the individual\r\nStates. There is plainly no expression in the granting clause which\r\nmakes that power EXCLUSIVE in the Union. There is no independent clause\r\nor sentence which prohibits the States from exercising it. So far is\r\nthis from being the case, that a plain and conclusive argument to the\r\ncontrary is to be deduced from the restraint laid upon the States in\r\nrelation to duties on imports and exports. This restriction implies an\r\nadmission that, if it were not inserted, the States would possess the\r\npower it excludes; and it implies a further admission, that as to all\r\nother taxes, the authority of the States remains undiminished. In any\r\nother view it would be both unnecessary and dangerous; it would be\r\nunnecessary, because if the grant to the Union of the power of laying\r\nsuch duties implied the exclusion of the States, or even their\r\nsubordination in this particular, there could be no need of such a\r\nrestriction; it would be dangerous, because the introduction of it\r\nleads directly to the conclusion which has been mentioned, and which,\r\nif the reasoning of the objectors be just, could not have been\r\nintended; I mean that the States, in all cases to which the restriction\r\ndid not apply, would have a concurrent power of taxation with the\r\nUnion. The restriction in question amounts to what lawyers call a\r\nNEGATIVE PREGNANT that is, a NEGATION of one thing, and an AFFIRMANCE\r\nof another; a negation of the authority of the States to impose taxes\r\non imports and exports, and an affirmance of their authority to impose\r\nthem on all other articles. It would be mere sophistry to argue that it\r\nwas meant to exclude them ABSOLUTELY from the imposition of taxes of\r\nthe former kind, and to leave them at liberty to lay others SUBJECT TO\r\nTHE CONTROL of the national legislature. The restraining or prohibitory\r\nclause only says, that they shall not, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS,\r\nlay such duties; and if we are to understand this in the sense last\r\nmentioned, the Constitution would then be made to introduce a formal\r\nprovision for the sake of a very absurd conclusion; which is, that the\r\nStates, WITH THE CONSENT of the national legislature, might tax imports\r\nand exports; and that they might tax every other article, UNLESS\r\nCONTROLLED by the same body. If this was the intention, why not leave\r\nit, in the first instance, to what is alleged to be the natural\r\noperation of the original clause, conferring a general power of\r\ntaxation upon the Union? It is evident that this could not have been\r\nthe intention, and that it will not bear a construction of the kind.\r\n\r\nAs to a supposition of repugnancy between the power of taxation in the\r\nStates and in the Union, it cannot be supported in that sense which\r\nwould be requisite to work an exclusion of the States. It is, indeed,\r\npossible that a tax might be laid on a particular article by a State\r\nwhich might render it INEXPEDIENT that thus a further tax should be\r\nlaid on the same article by the Union; but it would not imply a\r\nconstitutional inability to impose a further tax. The quantity of the\r\nimposition, the expediency or inexpediency of an increase on either\r\nside, would be mutually questions of prudence; but there would be\r\ninvolved no direct contradiction of power. The particular policy of the\r\nnational and of the State systems of finance might now and then not\r\nexactly coincide, and might require reciprocal forbearances. It is not,\r\nhowever a mere possibility of inconvenience in the exercise of powers,\r\nbut an immediate constitutional repugnancy that can by implication\r\nalienate and extinguish a pre-existing right of sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of a concurrent jurisdiction in certain cases results\r\nfrom the division of the sovereign power; and the rule that all\r\nauthorities, of which the States are not explicitly divested in favor\r\nof the Union, remain with them in full vigor, is not a theoretical\r\nconsequence of that division, but is clearly admitted by the whole\r\ntenor of the instrument which contains the articles of the proposed\r\nConstitution. We there find that, notwithstanding the affirmative\r\ngrants of general authorities, there has been the most pointed care in\r\nthose cases where it was deemed improper that the like authorities\r\nshould reside in the States, to insert negative clauses prohibiting the\r\nexercise of them by the States. The tenth section of the first article\r\nconsists altogether of such provisions. This circumstance is a clear\r\nindication of the sense of the convention, and furnishes a rule of\r\ninterpretation out of the body of the act, which justifies the position\r\nI have advanced and refutes every hypothesis to the contrary.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning the General Power of Taxation)\r\n\r\nFrom the Daily Advertiser.\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe residue of the argument against the provisions of the Constitution\r\nin respect to taxation is ingrafted upon the following clause. The last\r\nclause of the eighth section of the first article of the plan under\r\nconsideration authorizes the national legislature “to make all laws\r\nwhich shall be NECESSARY and PROPER for carrying into execution THE\r\nPOWERS by that Constitution vested in the government of the United\r\nStates, or in any department or officer thereof”; and the second clause\r\nof the sixth article declares, “that the Constitution and the laws of\r\nthe United States made IN PURSUANCE THEREOF, and the treaties made by\r\ntheir authority shall be the SUPREME LAW of the land, any thing in the\r\nconstitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\nThese two clauses have been the source of much virulent invective and\r\npetulant declamation against the proposed Constitution. They have been\r\nheld up to the people in all the exaggerated colors of\r\nmisrepresentation as the pernicious engines by which their local\r\ngovernments were to be destroyed and their liberties exterminated; as\r\nthe hideous monster whose devouring jaws would spare neither sex nor\r\nage, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor profane; and yet, strange as it\r\nmay appear, after all this clamor, to those who may not have happened\r\nto contemplate them in the same light, it may be affirmed with perfect\r\nconfidence that the constitutional operation of the intended government\r\nwould be precisely the same, if these clauses were entirely\r\nobliterated, as if they were repeated in every article. They are only\r\ndeclaratory of a truth which would have resulted by necessary and\r\nunavoidable implication from the very act of constituting a federal\r\ngovernment, and vesting it with certain specified powers. This is so\r\nclear a proposition, that moderation itself can scarcely listen to the\r\nrailings which have been so copiously vented against this part of the\r\nplan, without emotions that disturb its equanimity.\r\n\r\nWhat is a power, but the ability or faculty of doing a thing? What is\r\nthe ability to do a thing, but the power of employing the MEANS\r\nnecessary to its execution? What is a LEGISLATIVE power, but a power of\r\nmaking LAWS? What are the MEANS to execute a LEGISLATIVE power but\r\nLAWS? What is the power of laying and collecting taxes, but a\r\nLEGISLATIVE POWER, or a power of MAKING LAWS, to lay and collect taxes?\r\nWhat are the proper means of executing such a power, but NECESSARY and\r\nPROPER laws?\r\n\r\nThis simple train of inquiry furnishes us at once with a test by which\r\nto judge of the true nature of the clause complained of. It conducts us\r\nto this palpable truth, that a power to lay and collect taxes must be a\r\npower to pass all laws NECESSARY and PROPER for the execution of that\r\npower; and what does the unfortunate and culumniated provision in\r\nquestion do more than declare the same truth, to wit, that the national\r\nlegislature, to whom the power of laying and collecting taxes had been\r\npreviously given, might, in the execution of that power, pass all laws\r\nNECESSARY and PROPER to carry it into effect? I have applied these\r\nobservations thus particularly to the power of taxation, because it is\r\nthe immediate subject under consideration, and because it is the most\r\nimportant of the authorities proposed to be conferred upon the Union.\r\nBut the same process will lead to the same result, in relation to all\r\nother powers declared in the Constitution. And it is EXPRESSLY to\r\nexecute these powers that the sweeping clause, as it has been\r\naffectedly called, authorizes the national legislature to pass all\r\nNECESSARY and PROPER laws. If there is any thing exceptionable, it must\r\nbe sought for in the specific powers upon which this general\r\ndeclaration is predicated. The declaration itself, though it may be\r\nchargeable with tautology or redundancy, is at least perfectly\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\nBut SUSPICION may ask, Why then was it introduced? The answer is, that\r\nit could only have been done for greater caution, and to guard against\r\nall cavilling refinements in those who might hereafter feel a\r\ndisposition to curtail and evade the legitimate authorities of the\r\nUnion. The Convention probably foresaw, what it has been a principal\r\naim of these papers to inculcate, that the danger which most threatens\r\nour political welfare is that the State governments will finally sap\r\nthe foundations of the Union; and might therefore think it necessary,\r\nin so cardinal a point, to leave nothing to construction. Whatever may\r\nhave been the inducement to it, the wisdom of the precaution is evident\r\nfrom the cry which has been raised against it; as that very cry betrays\r\na disposition to question the great and essential truth which it is\r\nmanifestly the object of that provision to declare.\r\n\r\nBut it may be again asked, Who is to judge of the NECESSITY and\r\nPROPRIETY of the laws to be passed for executing the powers of the\r\nUnion? I answer, first, that this question arises as well and as fully\r\nupon the simple grant of those powers as upon the declaratory clause;\r\nand I answer, in the second place, that the national government, like\r\nevery other, must judge, in the first instance, of the proper exercise\r\nof its powers, and its constituents in the last. If the federal\r\ngovernment should overpass the just bounds of its authority and make a\r\ntyrannical use of its powers, the people, whose creature it is, must\r\nappeal to the standard they have formed, and take such measures to\r\nredress the injury done to the Constitution as the exigency may suggest\r\nand prudence justify. The propriety of a law, in a constitutional\r\nlight, must always be determined by the nature of the powers upon which\r\nit is founded. Suppose, by some forced constructions of its authority\r\n(which, indeed, cannot easily be imagined), the Federal legislature\r\nshould attempt to vary the law of descent in any State, would it not be\r\nevident that, in making such an attempt, it had exceeded its\r\njurisdiction, and infringed upon that of the State? Suppose, again,\r\nthat upon the pretense of an interference with its revenues, it should\r\nundertake to abrogate a landtax imposed by the authority of a State;\r\nwould it not be equally evident that this was an invasion of that\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction in respect to this species of tax, which its\r\nConstitution plainly supposes to exist in the State governments? If\r\nthere ever should be a doubt on this head, the credit of it will be\r\nentirely due to those reasoners who, in the imprudent zeal of their\r\nanimosity to the plan of the convention, have labored to envelop it in\r\na cloud calculated to obscure the plainest and simplest truths.\r\n\r\nBut it is said that the laws of the Union are to be the SUPREME LAW of\r\nthe land. But what inference can be drawn from this, or what would they\r\namount to, if they were not to be supreme? It is evident they would\r\namount to nothing. A LAW, by the very meaning of the term, includes\r\nsupremacy. It is a rule which those to whom it is prescribed are bound\r\nto observe. This results from every political association. If\r\nindividuals enter into a state of society, the laws of that society\r\nmust be the supreme regulator of their conduct. If a number of\r\npolitical societies enter into a larger political society, the laws\r\nwhich the latter may enact, pursuant to the powers intrusted to it by\r\nits constitution, must necessarily be supreme over those societies, and\r\nthe individuals of whom they are composed. It would otherwise be a mere\r\ntreaty, dependent on the good faith of the parties, and not a\r\ngovernment, which is only another word for POLITICAL POWER AND\r\nSUPREMACY. But it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the\r\nlarge society which are NOT PURSUANT to its constitutional powers, but\r\nwhich are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller\r\nsocieties, will become the supreme law of the land. These will be\r\nmerely acts of usurpation, and will deserve to be treated as such.\r\nHence we perceive that the clause which declares the supremacy of the\r\nlaws of the Union, like the one we have just before considered, only\r\ndeclares a truth, which flows immediately and necessarily from the\r\ninstitution of a federal government. It will not, I presume, have\r\nescaped observation, that it EXPRESSLY confines this supremacy to laws\r\nmade PURSUANT TO THE CONSTITUTION; which I mention merely as an\r\ninstance of caution in the convention; since that limitation would have\r\nbeen to be understood, though it had not been expressed.\r\n\r\nThough a law, therefore, laying a tax for the use of the United States\r\nwould be supreme in its nature, and could not legally be opposed or\r\ncontrolled, yet a law for abrogating or preventing the collection of a\r\ntax laid by the authority of the State, (unless upon imports and\r\nexports), would not be the supreme law of the land, but a usurpation of\r\npower not granted by the Constitution. As far as an improper\r\naccumulation of taxes on the same object might tend to render the\r\ncollection difficult or precarious, this would be a mutual\r\ninconvenience, not arising from a superiority or defect of power on\r\neither side, but from an injudicious exercise of power by one or the\r\nother, in a manner equally disadvantageous to both. It is to be hoped\r\nand presumed, however, that mutual interest would dictate a concert in\r\nthis respect which would avoid any material inconvenience. The\r\ninference from the whole is, that the individual States would, under\r\nthe proposed Constitution, retain an independent and uncontrollable\r\nauthority to raise revenue to any extent of which they may stand in\r\nneed, by every kind of taxation, except duties on imports and exports.\r\nIt will be shown in the next paper that this CONCURRENT JURISDICTION in\r\nthe article of taxation was the only admissible substitute for an\r\nentire subordination, in respect to this branch of power, of the State\r\nauthority to that of the Union.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning the General Power of Taxation)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, January 4, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nI flatter myself it has been clearly shown in my last number that the\r\nparticular States, under the proposed Constitution, would have COEQUAL\r\nauthority with the Union in the article of revenue, except as to duties\r\non imports. As this leaves open to the States far the greatest part of\r\nthe resources of the community, there can be no color for the assertion\r\nthat they would not possess means as abundant as could be desired for\r\nthe supply of their own wants, independent of all external control.\r\nThat the field is sufficiently wide will more fully appear when we come\r\nto advert to the inconsiderable share of the public expenses for which\r\nit will fall to the lot of the State governments to provide.\r\n\r\nTo argue upon abstract principles that this co-ordinate authority\r\ncannot exist, is to set up supposition and theory against fact and\r\nreality. However proper such reasonings might be to show that a thing\r\nOUGHT NOT TO EXIST, they are wholly to be rejected when they are made\r\nuse of to prove that it does not exist contrary to the evidence of the\r\nfact itself. It is well known that in the Roman republic the\r\nlegislative authority, in the last resort, resided for ages in two\r\ndifferent political bodies not as branches of the same legislature, but\r\nas distinct and independent legislatures, in each of which an opposite\r\ninterest prevailed: in one the patrician; in the other, the plebian.\r\nMany arguments might have been adduced to prove the unfitness of two\r\nsuch seemingly contradictory authorities, each having power to ANNUL or\r\nREPEAL the acts of the other. But a man would have been regarded as\r\nfrantic who should have attempted at Rome to disprove their existence.\r\nIt will be readily understood that I allude to the COMITIA CENTURIATA\r\nand the COMITIA TRIBUTA. The former, in which the people voted by\r\ncenturies, was so arranged as to give a superiority to the patrician\r\ninterest; in the latter, in which numbers prevailed, the plebian\r\ninterest had an entire predominancy. And yet these two legislatures\r\ncoexisted for ages, and the Roman republic attained to the utmost\r\nheight of human greatness.\r\n\r\nIn the case particularly under consideration, there is no such\r\ncontradiction as appears in the example cited; there is no power on\r\neither side to annul the acts of the other. And in practice there is\r\nlittle reason to apprehend any inconvenience; because, in a short\r\ncourse of time, the wants of the States will naturally reduce\r\nthemselves within A VERY NARROW COMPASS; and in the interim, the United\r\nStates will, in all probability, find it convenient to abstain wholly\r\nfrom those objects to which the particular States would be inclined to\r\nresort.\r\n\r\nTo form a more precise judgment of the true merits of this question, it\r\nwill be well to advert to the proportion between the objects that will\r\nrequire a federal provision in respect to revenue, and those which will\r\nrequire a State provision. We shall discover that the former are\r\naltogether unlimited, and that the latter are circumscribed within very\r\nmoderate bounds. In pursuing this inquiry, we must bear in mind that we\r\nare not to confine our view to the present period, but to look forward\r\nto remote futurity. Constitutions of civil government are not to be\r\nframed upon a calculation of existing exigencies, but upon a\r\ncombination of these with the probable exigencies of ages, according to\r\nthe natural and tried course of human affairs. Nothing, therefore, can\r\nbe more fallacious than to infer the extent of any power, proper to be\r\nlodged in the national government, from an estimate of its immediate\r\nnecessities. There ought to be a CAPACITY to provide for future\r\ncontingencies as they may happen; and as these are illimitable in their\r\nnature, it is impossible safely to limit that capacity. It is true,\r\nperhaps, that a computation might be made with sufficient accuracy to\r\nanswer the purpose of the quantity of revenue requisite to discharge\r\nthe subsisting engagements of the Union, and to maintain those\r\nestablishments which, for some time to come, would suffice in time of\r\npeace. But would it be wise, or would it not rather be the extreme of\r\nfolly, to stop at this point, and to leave the government intrusted\r\nwith the care of the national defense in a state of absolute incapacity\r\nto provide for the protection of the community against future invasions\r\nof the public peace, by foreign war or domestic convulsions? If, on the\r\ncontrary, we ought to exceed this point, where can we stop, short of an\r\nindefinite power of providing for emergencies as they may arise? Though\r\nit is easy to assert, in general terms, the possibility of forming a\r\nrational judgment of a due provision against probable dangers, yet we\r\nmay safely challenge those who make the assertion to bring forward\r\ntheir data, and may affirm that they would be found as vague and\r\nuncertain as any that could be produced to establish the probable\r\nduration of the world. Observations confined to the mere prospects of\r\ninternal attacks can deserve no weight; though even these will admit of\r\nno satisfactory calculation: but if we mean to be a commercial people,\r\nit must form a part of our policy to be able one day to defend that\r\ncommerce. The support of a navy and of naval wars would involve\r\ncontingencies that must baffle all the efforts of political arithmetic.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that we ought to try the novel and absurd experiment in\r\npolitics of tying up the hands of government from offensive war founded\r\nupon reasons of state, yet certainly we ought not to disable it from\r\nguarding the community against the ambition or enmity of other nations.\r\nA cloud has been for some time hanging over the European world. If it\r\nshould break forth into a storm, who can insure us that in its progress\r\na part of its fury would not be spent upon us? No reasonable man would\r\nhastily pronounce that we are entirely out of its reach. Or if the\r\ncombustible materials that now seem to be collecting should be\r\ndissipated without coming to maturity, or if a flame should be kindled\r\nwithout extending to us, what security can we have that our\r\ntranquillity will long remain undisturbed from some other cause or from\r\nsome other quarter? Let us recollect that peace or war will not always\r\nbe left to our option; that however moderate or unambitious we may be,\r\nwe cannot count upon the moderation, or hope to extinguish the ambition\r\nof others. Who could have imagined at the conclusion of the last war\r\nthat France and Britain, wearied and exhausted as they both were, would\r\nso soon have looked with so hostile an aspect upon each other? To judge\r\nfrom the history of mankind, we shall be compelled to conclude that the\r\nfiery and destructive passions of war reign in the human breast with\r\nmuch more powerful sway than the mild and beneficent sentiments of\r\npeace; and that to model our political systems upon speculations of\r\nlasting tranquillity, is to calculate on the weaker springs of the\r\nhuman character.\r\n\r\nWhat are the chief sources of expense in every government? What has\r\noccasioned that enormous accumulation of debts with which several of\r\nthe European nations are oppressed? The answers plainly is, wars and\r\nrebellions; the support of those institutions which are necessary to\r\nguard the body politic against these two most mortal diseases of\r\nsociety. The expenses arising from those institutions which are\r\nrelative to the mere domestic police of a state, to the support of its\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial departments, with their different\r\nappendages, and to the encouragement of agriculture and manufactures\r\n(which will comprehend almost all the objects of state expenditure),\r\nare insignificant in comparison with those which relate to the national\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nIn the kingdom of Great Britain, where all the ostentatious apparatus\r\nof monarchy is to be provided for, not above a fifteenth part of the\r\nannual income of the nation is appropriated to the class of expenses\r\nlast mentioned; the other fourteen fifteenths are absorbed in the\r\npayment of the interest of debts contracted for carrying on the wars in\r\nwhich that country has been engaged, and in the maintenance of fleets\r\nand armies. If, on the one hand, it should be observed that the\r\nexpenses incurred in the prosecution of the ambitious enterprises and\r\nvainglorious pursuits of a monarchy are not a proper standard by which\r\nto judge of those which might be necessary in a republic, it ought, on\r\nthe other hand, to be remarked that there should be as great a\r\ndisproportion between the profusion and extravagance of a wealthy\r\nkingdom in its domestic administration, and the frugality and economy\r\nwhich in that particular become the modest simplicity of republican\r\ngovernment. If we balance a proper deduction from one side against that\r\nwhich it is supposed ought to be made from the other, the proportion\r\nmay still be considered as holding good.\r\n\r\nBut let us advert to the large debt which we have ourselves contracted\r\nin a single war, and let us only calculate on a common share of the\r\nevents which disturb the peace of nations, and we shall instantly\r\nperceive, without the aid of any elaborate illustration, that there\r\nmust always be an immense disproportion between the objects of federal\r\nand state expenditures. It is true that several of the States,\r\nseparately, are encumbered with considerable debts, which are an\r\nexcrescence of the late war. But this cannot happen again, if the\r\nproposed system be adopted; and when these debts are discharged, the\r\nonly call for revenue of any consequence, which the State governments\r\nwill continue to experience, will be for the mere support of their\r\nrespective civil list; to which, if we add all contingencies, the total\r\namount in every State ought to fall considerably short of two hundred\r\nthousand pounds.\r\n\r\nIn framing a government for posterity as well as ourselves, we ought,\r\nin those provisions which are designed to be permanent, to calculate,\r\nnot on temporary, but on permanent causes of expense. If this principle\r\nbe a just one our attention would be directed to a provision in favor\r\nof the State governments for an annual sum of about two hundred\r\nthousand pounds; while the exigencies of the Union could be susceptible\r\nof no limits, even in imagination. In this view of the subject, by what\r\nlogic can it be maintained that the local governments ought to command,\r\nin perpetuity, an EXCLUSIVE source of revenue for any sum beyond the\r\nextent of two hundred thousand pounds? To extend its power further, in\r\nEXCLUSION of the authority of the Union, would be to take the resources\r\nof the community out of those hands which stood in need of them for the\r\npublic welfare, in order to put them into other hands which could have\r\nno just or proper occasion for them.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, the convention had been inclined to proceed upon the\r\nprinciple of a repartition of the objects of revenue, between the Union\r\nand its members, in PROPORTION to their comparative necessities; what\r\nparticular fund could have been selected for the use of the States,\r\nthat would not either have been too much or too little too little for\r\ntheir present, too much for their future wants? As to the line of\r\nseparation between external and internal taxes, this would leave to the\r\nStates, at a rough computation, the command of two thirds of the\r\nresources of the community to defray from a tenth to a twentieth part\r\nof its expenses; and to the Union, one third of the resources of the\r\ncommunity, to defray from nine tenths to nineteen twentieths of its\r\nexpenses. If we desert this boundary and content ourselves with leaving\r\nto the States an exclusive power of taxing houses and lands, there\r\nwould still be a great disproportion between the MEANS and the END; the\r\npossession of one third of the resources of the community to supply, at\r\nmost, one tenth of its wants. If any fund could have been selected and\r\nappropriated, equal to and not greater than the object, it would have\r\nbeen inadequate to the discharge of the existing debts of the\r\nparticular States, and would have left them dependent on the Union for\r\na provision for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe preceding train of observation will justify the position which has\r\nbeen elsewhere laid down, that “A CONCURRENT JURISDICTION in the\r\narticle of taxation was the only admissible substitute for an entire\r\nsubordination, in respect to this branch of power, of State authority\r\nto that of the Union.” Any separation of the objects of revenue that\r\ncould have been fallen upon, would have amounted to a sacrifice of the\r\ngreat INTERESTS of the Union to the POWER of the individual States. The\r\nconvention thought the concurrent jurisdiction preferable to that\r\nsubordination; and it is evident that it has at least the merit of\r\nreconciling an indefinite constitutional power of taxation in the\r\nFederal government with an adequate and independent power in the States\r\nto provide for their own necessities. There remain a few other lights,\r\nin which this important subject of taxation will claim a further\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXXV.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning the General Power of Taxation)\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed to examine any other objections to an indefinite\r\npower of taxation in the Union, I shall make one general remark; which\r\nis, that if the jurisdiction of the national government, in the article\r\nof revenue, should be restricted to particular objects, it would\r\nnaturally occasion an undue proportion of the public burdens to fall\r\nupon those objects. Two evils would spring from this source: the\r\noppression of particular branches of industry; and an unequal\r\ndistribution of the taxes, as well among the several States as among\r\nthe citizens of the same State.\r\n\r\nSuppose, as has been contended for, the federal power of taxation were\r\nto be confined to duties on imports, it is evident that the government,\r\nfor want of being able to command other resources, would frequently be\r\ntempted to extend these duties to an injurious excess. There are\r\npersons who imagine that they can never be carried to too great a\r\nlength; since the higher they are, the more it is alleged they will\r\ntend to discourage an extravagant consumption, to produce a favorable\r\nbalance of trade, and to promote domestic manufactures. But all\r\nextremes are pernicious in various ways. Exorbitant duties on imported\r\narticles would beget a general spirit of smuggling; which is always\r\nprejudicial to the fair trader, and eventually to the revenue itself:\r\nthey tend to render other classes of the community tributary, in an\r\nimproper degree, to the manufacturing classes, to whom they give a\r\npremature monopoly of the markets; they sometimes force industry out of\r\nits more natural channels into others in which it flows with less\r\nadvantage; and in the last place, they oppress the merchant, who is\r\noften obliged to pay them himself without any retribution from the\r\nconsumer. When the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market,\r\nthe consumer generally pays the duty; but when the markets happen to be\r\noverstocked, a great proportion falls upon the merchant, and sometimes\r\nnot only exhausts his profits, but breaks in upon his capital. I am apt\r\nto think that a division of the duty, between the seller and the buyer,\r\nmore often happens than is commonly imagined. It is not always possible\r\nto raise the price of a commodity in exact proportion to every\r\nadditional imposition laid upon it. The merchant, especially in a\r\ncountry of small commercial capital, is often under a necessity of\r\nkeeping prices down in order to a more expeditious sale.\r\n\r\nThe maxim that the consumer is the payer, is so much oftener true than\r\nthe reverse of the proposition, that it is far more equitable that the\r\nduties on imports should go into a common stock, than that they should\r\nredound to the exclusive benefit of the importing States. But it is not\r\nso generally true as to render it equitable, that those duties should\r\nform the only national fund. When they are paid by the merchant they\r\noperate as an additional tax upon the importing State, whose citizens\r\npay their proportion of them in the character of consumers. In this\r\nview they are productive of inequality among the States; which\r\ninequality would be increased with the increased extent of the duties.\r\nThe confinement of the national revenues to this species of imposts\r\nwould be attended with inequality, from a different cause, between the\r\nmanufacturing and the non-manufacturing States. The States which can go\r\nfarthest towards the supply of their own wants, by their own\r\nmanufactures, will not, according to their numbers or wealth, consume\r\nso great a proportion of imported articles as those States which are\r\nnot in the same favorable situation. They would not, therefore, in this\r\nmode alone contribute to the public treasury in a ratio to their\r\nabilities. To make them do this it is necessary that recourse be had to\r\nexcises, the proper objects of which are particular kinds of\r\nmanufactures. New York is more deeply interested in these\r\nconsiderations than such of her citizens as contend for limiting the\r\npower of the Union to external taxation may be aware of. New York is an\r\nimporting State, and is not likely speedily to be, to any great extent,\r\na manufacturing State. She would, of course, suffer in a double light\r\nfrom restraining the jurisdiction of the Union to commercial imposts.\r\n\r\nSo far as these observations tend to inculcate a danger of the import\r\nduties being extended to an injurious extreme it may be observed,\r\nconformably to a remark made in another part of these papers, that the\r\ninterest of the revenue itself would be a sufficient guard against such\r\nan extreme. I readily admit that this would be the case, as long as\r\nother resources were open; but if the avenues to them were closed,\r\nHOPE, stimulated by necessity, would beget experiments, fortified by\r\nrigorous precautions and additional penalties, which, for a time, would\r\nhave the intended effect, till there had been leisure to contrive\r\nexpedients to elude these new precautions. The first success would be\r\napt to inspire false opinions, which it might require a long course of\r\nsubsequent experience to correct. Necessity, especially in politics,\r\noften occasions false hopes, false reasonings, and a system of measures\r\ncorrespondingly erroneous. But even if this supposed excess should not\r\nbe a consequence of the limitation of the federal power of taxation,\r\nthe inequalities spoken of would still ensue, though not in the same\r\ndegree, from the other causes that have been noticed. Let us now return\r\nto the examination of objections.\r\n\r\nOne which, if we may judge from the frequency of its repetition, seems\r\nmost to be relied on, is, that the House of Representatives is not\r\nsufficiently numerous for the reception of all the different classes of\r\ncitizens, in order to combine the interests and feelings of every part\r\nof the community, and to produce a due sympathy between the\r\nrepresentative body and its constituents. This argument presents itself\r\nunder a very specious and seducing form; and is well calculated to lay\r\nhold of the prejudices of those to whom it is addressed. But when we\r\ncome to dissect it with attention, it will appear to be made up of\r\nnothing but fair-sounding words. The object it seems to aim at is, in\r\nthe first place, impracticable, and in the sense in which it is\r\ncontended for, is unnecessary. I reserve for another place the\r\ndiscussion of the question which relates to the sufficiency of the\r\nrepresentative body in respect to numbers, and shall content myself\r\nwith examining here the particular use which has been made of a\r\ncontrary supposition, in reference to the immediate subject of our\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nThe idea of an actual representation of all classes of the people, by\r\npersons of each class, is altogether visionary. Unless it were\r\nexpressly provided in the Constitution, that each different occupation\r\nshould send one or more members, the thing would never take place in\r\npractice. Mechanics and manufacturers will always be inclined, with few\r\nexceptions, to give their votes to merchants, in preference to persons\r\nof their own professions or trades. Those discerning citizens are well\r\naware that the mechanic and manufacturing arts furnish the materials of\r\nmercantile enterprise and industry. Many of them, indeed, are\r\nimmediately connected with the operations of commerce. They know that\r\nthe merchant is their natural patron and friend; and they are aware,\r\nthat however great the confidence they may justly feel in their own\r\ngood sense, their interests can be more effectually promoted by the\r\nmerchant than by themselves. They are sensible that their habits in\r\nlife have not been such as to give them those acquired endowments,\r\nwithout which, in a deliberative assembly, the greatest natural\r\nabilities are for the most part useless; and that the influence and\r\nweight, and superior acquirements of the merchants render them more\r\nequal to a contest with any spirit which might happen to infuse itself\r\ninto the public councils, unfriendly to the manufacturing and trading\r\ninterests. These considerations, and many others that might be\r\nmentioned prove, and experience confirms it, that artisans and\r\nmanufacturers will commonly be disposed to bestow their votes upon\r\nmerchants and those whom they recommend. We must therefore consider\r\nmerchants as the natural representatives of all these classes of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the learned professions, little need be observed; they\r\ntruly form no distinct interest in society, and according to their\r\nsituation and talents, will be indiscriminately the objects of the\r\nconfidence and choice of each other, and of other parts of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nNothing remains but the landed interest; and this, in a political view,\r\nand particularly in relation to taxes, I take to be perfectly united,\r\nfrom the wealthiest landlord down to the poorest tenant. No tax can be\r\nlaid on land which will not affect the proprietor of millions of acres\r\nas well as the proprietor of a single acre. Every landholder will\r\ntherefore have a common interest to keep the taxes on land as low as\r\npossible; and common interest may always be reckoned upon as the surest\r\nbond of sympathy. But if we even could suppose a distinction of\r\ninterest between the opulent landholder and the middling farmer, what\r\nreason is there to conclude, that the first would stand a better chance\r\nof being deputed to the national legislature than the last? If we take\r\nfact as our guide, and look into our own senate and assembly, we shall\r\nfind that moderate proprietors of land prevail in both; nor is this\r\nless the case in the senate, which consists of a smaller number, than\r\nin the assembly, which is composed of a greater number. Where the\r\nqualifications of the electors are the same, whether they have to\r\nchoose a small or a large number, their votes will fall upon those in\r\nwhom they have most confidence; whether these happen to be men of large\r\nfortunes, or of moderate property, or of no property at all.\r\n\r\nIt is said to be necessary, that all classes of citizens should have\r\nsome of their own number in the representative body, in order that\r\ntheir feelings and interests may be the better understood and attended\r\nto. But we have seen that this will never happen under any arrangement\r\nthat leaves the votes of the people free. Where this is the case, the\r\nrepresentative body, with too few exceptions to have any influence on\r\nthe spirit of the government, will be composed of landholders,\r\nmerchants, and men of the learned professions. But where is the danger\r\nthat the interests and feelings of the different classes of citizens\r\nwill not be understood or attended to by these three descriptions of\r\nmen? Will not the landholder know and feel whatever will promote or\r\ninsure the interest of landed property? And will he not, from his own\r\ninterest in that species of property, be sufficiently prone to resist\r\nevery attempt to prejudice or encumber it? Will not the merchant\r\nunderstand and be disposed to cultivate, as far as may be proper, the\r\ninterests of the mechanic and manufacturing arts, to which his commerce\r\nis so nearly allied? Will not the man of the learned profession, who\r\nwill feel a neutrality to the rivalships between the different branches\r\nof industry, be likely to prove an impartial arbiter between them,\r\nready to promote either, so far as it shall appear to him conducive to\r\nthe general interests of the society?\r\n\r\nIf we take into the account the momentary humors or dispositions which\r\nmay happen to prevail in particular parts of the society, and to which\r\na wise administration will never be inattentive, is the man whose\r\nsituation leads to extensive inquiry and information less likely to be\r\na competent judge of their nature, extent, and foundation than one\r\nwhose observation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbors\r\nand acquaintances? Is it not natural that a man who is a candidate for\r\nthe favor of the people, and who is dependent on the suffrages of his\r\nfellow-citizens for the continuance of his public honors, should take\r\ncare to inform himself of their dispositions and inclinations, and\r\nshould be willing to allow them their proper degree of influence upon\r\nhis conduct? This dependence, and the necessity of being bound himself,\r\nand his posterity, by the laws to which he gives his assent, are the\r\ntrue, and they are the strong chords of sympathy between the\r\nrepresentative and the constituent.\r\n\r\nThere is no part of the administration of government that requires\r\nextensive information and a thorough knowledge of the principles of\r\npolitical economy, so much as the business of taxation. The man who\r\nunderstands those principles best will be least likely to resort to\r\noppressive expedients, or sacrifice any particular class of citizens to\r\nthe procurement of revenue. It might be demonstrated that the most\r\nproductive system of finance will always be the least burdensome. There\r\ncan be no doubt that in order to a judicious exercise of the power of\r\ntaxation, it is necessary that the person in whose hands it should be\r\nacquainted with the general genius, habits, and modes of thinking of\r\nthe people at large, and with the resources of the country. And this is\r\nall that can be reasonably meant by a knowledge of the interests and\r\nfeelings of the people. In any other sense the proposition has either\r\nno meaning, or an absurd one. And in that sense let every considerate\r\ncitizen judge for himself where the requisite qualification is most\r\nlikely to be found.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXXVI.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning the General Power of Taxation)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday January 8, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the result of the observations, to which the\r\nforegoing number has been principally devoted, is, that from the\r\nnatural operation of the different interests and views of the various\r\nclasses of the community, whether the representation of the people be\r\nmore or less numerous, it will consist almost entirely of proprietors\r\nof land, of merchants, and of members of the learned professions, who\r\nwill truly represent all those different interests and views. If it\r\nshould be objected that we have seen other descriptions of men in the\r\nlocal legislatures, I answer that it is admitted there are exceptions\r\nto the rule, but not in sufficient number to influence the general\r\ncomplexion or character of the government. There are strong minds in\r\nevery walk of life that will rise superior to the disadvantages of\r\nsituation, and will command the tribute due to their merit, not only\r\nfrom the classes to which they particularly belong, but from the\r\nsociety in general. The door ought to be equally open to all; and I\r\ntrust, for the credit of human nature, that we shall see examples of\r\nsuch vigorous plants flourishing in the soil of federal as well as of\r\nState legislation; but occasional instances of this sort will not\r\nrender the reasoning founded upon the general course of things, less\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\nThe subject might be placed in several other lights that would all lead\r\nto the same result; and in particular it might be asked, What greater\r\naffinity or relation of interest can be conceived between the carpenter\r\nand blacksmith, and the linen manufacturer or stocking weaver, than\r\nbetween the merchant and either of them? It is notorious that there are\r\noften as great rivalships between different branches of the mechanic or\r\nmanufacturing arts as there are between any of the departments of labor\r\nand industry; so that, unless the representative body were to be far\r\nmore numerous than would be consistent with any idea of regularity or\r\nwisdom in its deliberations, it is impossible that what seems to be the\r\nspirit of the objection we have been considering should ever be\r\nrealized in practice. But I forbear to dwell any longer on a matter\r\nwhich has hitherto worn too loose a garb to admit even of an accurate\r\ninspection of its real shape or tendency.\r\n\r\nThere is another objection of a somewhat more precise nature that\r\nclaims our attention. It has been asserted that a power of internal\r\ntaxation in the national legislature could never be exercised with\r\nadvantage, as well from the want of a sufficient knowledge of local\r\ncircumstances, as from an interference between the revenue laws of the\r\nUnion and of the particular States. The supposition of a want of proper\r\nknowledge seems to be entirely destitute of foundation. If any question\r\nis depending in a State legislature respecting one of the counties,\r\nwhich demands a knowledge of local details, how is it acquired? No\r\ndoubt from the information of the members of the county. Cannot the\r\nlike knowledge be obtained in the national legislature from the\r\nrepresentatives of each State? And is it not to be presumed that the\r\nmen who will generally be sent there will be possessed of the necessary\r\ndegree of intelligence to be able to communicate that information? Is\r\nthe knowledge of local circumstances, as applied to taxation, a minute\r\ntopographical acquaintance with all the mountains, rivers, streams,\r\nhighways, and bypaths in each State; or is it a general acquaintance\r\nwith its situation and resources, with the state of its agriculture,\r\ncommerce, manufactures, with the nature of its products and\r\nconsumptions, with the different degrees and kinds of its wealth,\r\nproperty, and industry?\r\n\r\nNations in general, even under governments of the more popular kind,\r\nusually commit the administration of their finances to single men or to\r\nboards composed of a few individuals, who digest and prepare, in the\r\nfirst instance, the plans of taxation, which are afterwards passed into\r\nlaws by the authority of the sovereign or legislature.\r\n\r\nInquisitive and enlightened statesmen are deemed everywhere best\r\nqualified to make a judicious selection of the objects proper for\r\nrevenue; which is a clear indication, as far as the sense of mankind\r\ncan have weight in the question, of the species of knowledge of local\r\ncircumstances requisite to the purposes of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe taxes intended to be comprised under the general denomination of\r\ninternal taxes may be subdivided into those of the DIRECT and those of\r\nthe INDIRECT kind. Though the objection be made to both, yet the\r\nreasoning upon it seems to be confined to the former branch. And\r\nindeed, as to the latter, by which must be understood duties and\r\nexcises on articles of consumption, one is at a loss to conceive what\r\ncan be the nature of the difficulties apprehended. The knowledge\r\nrelating to them must evidently be of a kind that will either be\r\nsuggested by the nature of the article itself, or can easily be\r\nprocured from any well-informed man, especially of the mercantile\r\nclass. The circumstances that may distinguish its situation in one\r\nState from its situation in another must be few, simple, and easy to be\r\ncomprehended. The principal thing to be attended to, would be to avoid\r\nthose articles which had been previously appropriated to the use of a\r\nparticular State; and there could be no difficulty in ascertaining the\r\nrevenue system of each. This could always be known from the respective\r\ncodes of laws, as well as from the information of the members from the\r\nseveral States.\r\n\r\nThe objection, when applied to real property or to houses and lands,\r\nappears to have, at first sight, more foundation, but even in this view\r\nit will not bear a close examination. Land taxes are co monly laid in\r\none of two modes, either by ACTUAL valuations, permanent or periodical,\r\nor by OCCASIONAL assessments, at the discretion, or according to the\r\nbest judgment, of certain officers whose duty it is to make them. In\r\neither case, the EXECUTION of the business, which alone requires the\r\nknowledge of local details, must be devolved upon discreet persons in\r\nthe character of commissioners or assessors, elected by the people or\r\nappointed by the government for the purpose. All that the law can do\r\nmust be to name the persons or to prescribe the manner of their\r\nelection or appointment, to fix their numbers and qualifications and to\r\ndraw the general outlines of their powers and duties. And what is there\r\nin all this that cannot as well be performed by the national\r\nlegislature as by a State legislature? The attention of either can only\r\nreach to general principles; local details, as already observed, must\r\nbe referred to those who are to execute the plan.\r\n\r\nBut there is a simple point of view in which this matter may be placed\r\nthat must be altogether satisfactory. The national legislature can make\r\nuse of the SYSTEM OF EACH STATE WITHIN THAT STATE. The method of laying\r\nand collecting this species of taxes in each State can, in all its\r\nparts, be adopted and employed by the federal government.\r\n\r\nLet it be recollected that the proportion of these taxes is not to be\r\nleft to the discretion of the national legislature, but is to be\r\ndetermined by the numbers of each State, as described in the second\r\nsection of the first article. An actual census or enumeration of the\r\npeople must furnish the rule, a circumstance which effectually shuts\r\nthe door to partiality or oppression. The abuse of this power of\r\ntaxation seems to have been provided against with guarded\r\ncircumspection. In addition to the precaution just mentioned, there is\r\na provision that “all duties, imposts, and excises shall be UNIFORM\r\nthroughout the United States.”\r\n\r\nIt has been very properly observed by different speakers and writers on\r\nthe side of the Constitution, that if the exercise of the power of\r\ninternal taxation by the Union should be discovered on experiment to be\r\nreally inconvenient, the federal government may then forbear the use of\r\nit, and have recourse to requisitions in its stead. By way of answer to\r\nthis, it has been triumphantly asked, Why not in the first instance\r\nomit that ambiguous power, and rely upon the latter resource? Two solid\r\nanswers may be given. The first is, that the exercise of that power, if\r\nconvenient, will be preferable, because it will be more effectual; and\r\nit is impossible to prove in theory, or otherwise than by the\r\nexperiment, that it cannot be advantageously exercised. The contrary,\r\nindeed, appears most probable. The second answer is, that the existence\r\nof such a power in the Constitution will have a strong influence in\r\ngiving efficacy to requisitions. When the States know that the Union\r\ncan apply itself without their agency, it will be a powerful motive for\r\nexertion on their part.\r\n\r\nAs to the interference of the revenue laws of the Union, and of its\r\nmembers, we have already seen that there can be no clashing or\r\nrepugnancy of authority. The laws cannot, therefore, in a legal sense,\r\ninterfere with each other; and it is far from impossible to avoid an\r\ninterference even in the policy of their different systems. An\r\neffectual expedient for this purpose will be, mutually, to abstain from\r\nthose objects which either side may have first had recourse to. As\r\nneither can CONTROL the other, each will have an obvious and sensible\r\ninterest in this reciprocal forbearance. And where there is an\r\nIMMEDIATE common interest, we may safely count upon its operation. When\r\nthe particular debts of the States are done away, and their expenses\r\ncome to be limited within their natural compass, the possibility almost\r\nof interference will vanish. A small land tax will answer the purpose\r\nof the States, and will be their most simple and most fit resource.\r\n\r\nMany spectres have been raised out of this power of internal taxation,\r\nto excite the apprehensions of the people: double sets of revenue\r\nofficers, a duplication of their burdens by double taxations, and the\r\nfrightful forms of odious and oppressive poll-taxes, have been played\r\noff with all the ingenious dexterity of political legerdemain.\r\n\r\nAs to the first point, there are two cases in which there can be no\r\nroom for double sets of officers: one, where the right of imposing the\r\ntax is exclusively vested in the Union, which applies to the duties on\r\nimports; the other, where the object has not fallen under any State\r\nregulation or provision, which may be applicable to a variety of\r\nobjects. In other cases, the probability is that the United States will\r\neither wholly abstain from the objects preoccupied for local purposes,\r\nor will make use of the State officers and State regulations for\r\ncollecting the additional imposition. This will best answer the views\r\nof revenue, because it will save expense in the collection, and will\r\nbest avoid any occasion of disgust to the State governments and to the\r\npeople. At all events, here is a practicable expedient for avoiding\r\nsuch an inconvenience; and nothing more can be required than to show\r\nthat evils predicted to not necessarily result from the plan.\r\n\r\nAs to any argument derived from a supposed system of influence, it is a\r\nsufficient answer to say that it ought not to be presumed; but the\r\nsupposition is susceptible of a more precise answer. If such a spirit\r\nshould infest the councils of the Union, the most certain road to the\r\naccomplishment of its aim would be to employ the State officers as much\r\nas possible, and to attach them to the Union by an accumulation of\r\ntheir emoluments. This would serve to turn the tide of State influence\r\ninto the channels of the national government, instead of making federal\r\ninfluence flow in an opposite and adverse current. But all suppositions\r\nof this kind are invidious, and ought to be banished from the\r\nconsideration of the great question before the people. They can answer\r\nno other end than to cast a mist over the truth.\r\n\r\nAs to the suggestion of double taxation, the answer is plain. The wants\r\nof the Union are to be supplied in one way or another; if to be done by\r\nthe authority of the federal government, it will not be to be done by\r\nthat of the State government. The quantity of taxes to be paid by the\r\ncommunity must be the same in either case; with this advantage, if the\r\nprovision is to be made by the Union that the capital resource of\r\ncommercial imposts, which is the most convenient branch of revenue, can\r\nbe prudently improved to a much greater extent under federal than under\r\nState regulation, and of course will render it less necessary to recur\r\nto more inconvenient methods; and with this further advantage, that as\r\nfar as there may be any real difficulty in the exercise of the power of\r\ninternal taxation, it will impose a disposition to greater care in the\r\nchoice and arrangement of the means; and must naturally tend to make it\r\na fixed point of policy in the national administration to go as far as\r\nmay be practicable in making the luxury of the rich tributary to the\r\npublic treasury, in order to diminish the necessity of those\r\nimpositions which might create dissatisfaction in the poorer and most\r\nnumerous classes of the society. Happy it is when the interest which\r\nthe government has in the preservation of its own power, coincides with\r\na proper distribution of the public burdens, and tends to guard the\r\nleast wealthy part of the community from oppression!\r\n\r\nAs to poll taxes, I, without scruple, confess my disapprobation of\r\nthem; and though they have prevailed from an early period in those\r\nStates[1] which have uniformly been the most tenacious of their rights,\r\nI should lament to see them introduced into practice under the national\r\ngovernment. But does it follow because there is a power to lay them\r\nthat they will actually be laid? Every State in the Union has power to\r\nimpose taxes of this kind; and yet in several of them they are unknown\r\nin practice. Are the State governments to be stigmatized as tyrannies,\r\nbecause they possess this power? If they are not, with what propriety\r\ncan the like power justify such a charge against the national\r\ngovernment, or even be urged as an obstacle to its adoption? As little\r\nfriendly as I am to the species of imposition, I still feel a thorough\r\nconviction that the power of having recourse to it ought to exist in\r\nthe federal government. There are certain emergencies of nations, in\r\nwhich expedients, that in the ordinary state of things ought to be\r\nforborne, become essential to the public weal. And the government, from\r\nthe possibility of such emergencies, ought ever to have the option of\r\nmaking use of them. The real scarcity of objects in this country, which\r\nmay be considered as productive sources of revenue, is a reason\r\npeculiar to itself, for not abridging the discretion of the national\r\ncouncils in this respect. There may exist certain critical and\r\ntempestuous conjunctures of the State, in which a poll tax may become\r\nan inestimable resource. And as I know nothing to exempt this portion\r\nof the globe from the common calamities that have befallen other parts\r\nof it, I acknowledge my aversion to every project that is calculated to\r\ndisarm the government of a single weapon, which in any possible\r\ncontingency might be usefully employed for the general defense and\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nI have now gone through the examination of such of the powers proposed\r\nto be vested in the United States, which may be considered as having an\r\nimmediate relation to the energy of the government; and have endeavored\r\nto answer the principal objections which have been made to them. I have\r\npassed over in silence those minor authorities, which are either too\r\ninconsiderable to have been thought worthy of the hostilities of the\r\nopponents of the Constitution, or of too manifest propriety to admit of\r\ncontroversy. The mass of judiciary power, however, might have claimed\r\nan investigation under this head, had it not been for the consideration\r\nthat its organization and its extent may be more advantageously\r\nconsidered in connection. This has determined me to refer it to the\r\nbranch of our inquiries upon which we shall next enter.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] The New England States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXXVII.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Difficulties of the Convention in Devising a Proper Form\r\nof Government\r\n\r\nFrom the Daily Advertiser.\r\n\r\nFriday, January 11, 1788.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the defects of the existing Confederation, and showing\r\nthat they cannot be supplied by a government of less energy than that\r\nbefore the public, several of the most important principles of the\r\nlatter fell of course under consideration. But as the ultimate object\r\nof these papers is to determine clearly and fully the merits of this\r\nConstitution, and the expediency of adopting it, our plan cannot be\r\ncomplete without taking a more critical and thorough survey of the work\r\nof the convention, without examining it on all its sides, comparing it\r\nin all its parts, and calculating its probable effects.\r\n\r\nThat this remaining task may be executed under impressions conducive to\r\na just and fair result, some reflections must in this place be\r\nindulged, which candor previously suggests.\r\n\r\nIt is a misfortune, inseparable from human affairs, that public\r\nmeasures are rarely investigated with that spirit of moderation which\r\nis essential to a just estimate of their real tendency to advance or\r\nobstruct the public good; and that this spirit is more apt to be\r\ndiminished than promoted, by those occasions which require an unusual\r\nexercise of it. To those who have been led by experience to attend to\r\nthis consideration, it could not appear surprising, that the act of the\r\nconvention, which recommends so many important changes and innovations,\r\nwhich may be viewed in so many lights and relations, and which touches\r\nthe springs of so many passions and interests, should find or excite\r\ndispositions unfriendly, both on one side and on the other, to a fair\r\ndiscussion and accurate judgment of its merits. In some, it has been\r\ntoo evident from their own publications, that they have scanned the\r\nproposed Constitution, not only with a predisposition to censure, but\r\nwith a predetermination to condemn; as the language held by others\r\nbetrays an opposite predetermination or bias, which must render their\r\nopinions also of little moment in the question. In placing, however,\r\nthese different characters on a level, with respect to the weight of\r\ntheir opinions, I wish not to insinuate that there may not be a\r\nmaterial difference in the purity of their intentions. It is but just\r\nto remark in favor of the latter description, that as our situation is\r\nuniversally admitted to be peculiarly critical, and to require\r\nindispensably that something should be done for our relief, the\r\npredetermined patron of what has been actually done may have taken his\r\nbias from the weight of these considerations, as well as from\r\nconsiderations of a sinister nature. The predetermined adversary, on\r\nthe other hand, can have been governed by no venial motive whatever.\r\nThe intentions of the first may be upright, as they may on the contrary\r\nbe culpable. The views of the last cannot be upright, and must be\r\nculpable. But the truth is, that these papers are not addressed to\r\npersons falling under either of these characters. They solicit the\r\nattention of those only, who add to a sincere zeal for the happiness of\r\ntheir country, a temper favorable to a just estimate of the means of\r\npromoting it.\r\n\r\nPersons of this character will proceed to an examination of the plan\r\nsubmitted by the convention, not only without a disposition to find or\r\nto magnify faults; but will see the propriety of reflecting, that a\r\nfaultless plan was not to be expected. Nor will they barely make\r\nallowances for the errors which may be chargeable on the fallibility to\r\nwhich the convention, as a body of men, were liable; but will keep in\r\nmind, that they themselves also are but men, and ought not to assume an\r\ninfallibility in rejudging the fallible opinions of others.\r\n\r\nWith equal readiness will it be perceived, that besides these\r\ninducements to candor, many allowances ought to be made for the\r\ndifficulties inherent in the very nature of the undertaking referred to\r\nthe convention.\r\n\r\nThe novelty of the undertaking immediately strikes us. It has been\r\nshown in the course of these papers, that the existing Confederation is\r\nfounded on principles which are fallacious; that we must consequently\r\nchange this first foundation, and with it the superstructure resting\r\nupon it. It has been shown, that the other confederacies which could be\r\nconsulted as precedents have been vitiated by the same erroneous\r\nprinciples, and can therefore furnish no other light than that of\r\nbeacons, which give warning of the course to be shunned, without\r\npointing out that which ought to be pursued. The most that the\r\nconvention could do in such a situation, was to avoid the errors\r\nsuggested by the past experience of other countries, as well as of our\r\nown; and to provide a convenient mode of rectifying their own errors,\r\nas future experiences may unfold them.\r\n\r\nAmong the difficulties encountered by the convention, a very important\r\none must have lain in combining the requisite stability and energy in\r\ngovernment, with the inviolable attention due to liberty and to the\r\nrepublican form. Without substantially accomplishing this part of their\r\nundertaking, they would have very imperfectly fulfilled the object of\r\ntheir appointment, or the expectation of the public; yet that it could\r\nnot be easily accomplished, will be denied by no one who is unwilling\r\nto betray his ignorance of the subject. Energy in government is\r\nessential to that security against external and internal danger, and to\r\nthat prompt and salutary execution of the laws which enter into the\r\nvery definition of good government. Stability in government is\r\nessential to national character and to the advantages annexed to it, as\r\nwell as to that repose and confidence in the minds of the people, which\r\nare among the chief blessings of civil society. An irregular and\r\nmutable legislation is not more an evil in itself than it is odious to\r\nthe people; and it may be pronounced with assurance that the people of\r\nthis country, enlightened as they are with regard to the nature, and\r\ninterested, as the great body of them are, in the effects of good\r\ngovernment, will never be satisfied till some remedy be applied to the\r\nvicissitudes and uncertainties which characterize the State\r\nadministrations. On comparing, however, these valuable ingredients with\r\nthe vital principles of liberty, we must perceive at once the\r\ndifficulty of mingling them together in their due proportions. The\r\ngenius of republican liberty seems to demand on one side, not only that\r\nall power should be derived from the people, but that those intrusted\r\nwith it should be kept in independence on the people, by a short\r\nduration of their appointments; and that even during this short period\r\nthe trust should be placed not in a few, but a number of hands.\r\nStability, on the contrary, requires that the hands in which power is\r\nlodged should continue for a length of time the same. A frequent change\r\nof men will result from a frequent return of elections; and a frequent\r\nchange of measures from a frequent change of men: whilst energy in\r\ngovernment requires not only a certain duration of power, but the\r\nexecution of it by a single hand.\r\n\r\nHow far the convention may have succeeded in this part of their work,\r\nwill better appear on a more accurate view of it. From the cursory view\r\nhere taken, it must clearly appear to have been an arduous part.\r\n\r\nNot less arduous must have been the task of marking the proper line of\r\npartition between the authority of the general and that of the State\r\ngovernments. Every man will be sensible of this difficulty, in\r\nproportion as he has been accustomed to contemplate and discriminate\r\nobjects extensive and complicated in their nature. The faculties of the\r\nmind itself have never yet been distinguished and defined, with\r\nsatisfactory precision, by all the efforts of the most acute and\r\nmetaphysical philosophers. Sense, perception, judgment, desire,\r\nvolition, memory, imagination, are found to be separated by such\r\ndelicate shades and minute gradations that their boundaries have eluded\r\nthe most subtle investigations, and remain a pregnant source of\r\ningenious disquisition and controversy. The boundaries between the\r\ngreat kingdom of nature, and, still more, between the various\r\nprovinces, and lesser portions, into which they are subdivided, afford\r\nanother illustration of the same important truth. The most sagacious\r\nand laborious naturalists have never yet succeeded in tracing with\r\ncertainty the line which separates the district of vegetable life from\r\nthe neighboring region of unorganized matter, or which marks the\r\ntermination of the former and the commencement of the animal empire. A\r\nstill greater obscurity lies in the distinctive characters by which the\r\nobjects in each of these great departments of nature have been arranged\r\nand assorted.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass from the works of nature, in which all the delineations\r\nare perfectly accurate, and appear to be otherwise only from the\r\nimperfection of the eye which surveys them, to the institutions of man,\r\nin which the obscurity arises as well from the object itself as from\r\nthe organ by which it is contemplated, we must perceive the necessity\r\nof moderating still further our expectations and hopes from the efforts\r\nof human sagacity. Experience has instructed us that no skill in the\r\nscience of government has yet been able to discriminate and define,\r\nwith sufficient certainty, its three great provinces the legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judiciary; or even the privileges and powers of the\r\ndifferent legislative branches. Questions daily occur in the course of\r\npractice, which prove the obscurity which reins in these subjects, and\r\nwhich puzzle the greatest adepts in political science.\r\n\r\nThe experience of ages, with the continued and combined labors of the\r\nmost enlightened legislatures and jurists, has been equally\r\nunsuccessful in delineating the several objects and limits of different\r\ncodes of laws and different tribunals of justice. The precise extent of\r\nthe common law, and the statute law, the maritime law, the\r\necclesiastical law, the law of corporations, and other local laws and\r\ncustoms, remains still to be clearly and finally established in Great\r\nBritain, where accuracy in such subjects has been more industriously\r\npursued than in any other part of the world. The jurisdiction of her\r\nseveral courts, general and local, of law, of equity, of admiralty,\r\netc., is not less a source of frequent and intricate discussions,\r\nsufficiently denoting the indeterminate limits by which they are\r\nrespectively circumscribed. All new laws, though penned with the\r\ngreatest technical skill, and passed on the fullest and most mature\r\ndeliberation, are considered as more or less obscure and equivocal,\r\nuntil their meaning be liquidated and ascertained by a series of\r\nparticular discussions and adjudications. Besides the obscurity arising\r\nfrom the complexity of objects, and the imperfection of the human\r\nfaculties, the medium through which the conceptions of men are conveyed\r\nto each other adds a fresh embarrassment. The use of words is to\r\nexpress ideas. Perspicuity, therefore, requires not only that the ideas\r\nshould be distinctly formed, but that they should be expressed by words\r\ndistinctly and exclusively appropriate to them. But no language is so\r\ncopious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea, or so\r\ncorrect as not to include many equivocally denoting different ideas.\r\nHence it must happen that however accurately objects may be\r\ndiscriminated in themselves, and however accurately the discrimination\r\nmay be considered, the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate by\r\nthe inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered. And this\r\nunavoidable inaccuracy must be greater or less, according to the\r\ncomplexity and novelty of the objects defined. When the Almighty\r\nhimself condescends to address mankind in their own language, his\r\nmeaning, luminous as it must be, is rendered dim and doubtful by the\r\ncloudy medium through which it is communicated.\r\n\r\nHere, then, are three sources of vague and incorrect definitions:\r\nindistinctness of the object, imperfection of the organ of conception,\r\ninadequateness of the vehicle of ideas. Any one of these must produce a\r\ncertain degree of obscurity. The convention, in delineating the\r\nboundary between the federal and State jurisdictions, must have\r\nexperienced the full effect of them all.\r\n\r\nTo the difficulties already mentioned may be added the interfering\r\npretensions of the larger and smaller States. We cannot err in\r\nsupposing that the former would contend for a participation in the\r\ngovernment, fully proportioned to their superior wealth and importance;\r\nand that the latter would not be less tenacious of the equality at\r\npresent enjoyed by them. We may well suppose that neither side would\r\nentirely yield to the other, and consequently that the struggle could\r\nbe terminated only by compromise. It is extremely probable, also, that\r\nafter the ratio of representation had been adjusted, this very\r\ncompromise must have produced a fresh struggle between the same\r\nparties, to give such a turn to the organization of the government, and\r\nto the distribution of its powers, as would increase the importance of\r\nthe branches, in forming which they had respectively obtained the\r\ngreatest share of influence. There are features in the Constitution\r\nwhich warrant each of these suppositions; and as far as either of them\r\nis well founded, it shows that the convention must have been compelled\r\nto sacrifice theoretical propriety to the force of extraneous\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nNor could it have been the large and small States only, which would\r\nmarshal themselves in opposition to each other on various points. Other\r\ncombinations, resulting from a difference of local position and policy,\r\nmust have created additional difficulties. As every State may be\r\ndivided into different districts, and its citizens into different\r\nclasses, which give birth to contending interests and local jealousies,\r\nso the different parts of the United States are distinguished from each\r\nother by a variety of circumstances, which produce a like effect on a\r\nlarger scale. And although this variety of interests, for reasons\r\nsufficiently explained in a former paper, may have a salutary influence\r\non the administration of the government when formed, yet every one must\r\nbe sensible of the contrary influence, which must have been experienced\r\nin the task of forming it.\r\n\r\nWould it be wonderful if, under the pressure of all these difficulties,\r\nthe convention should have been forced into some deviations from that\r\nartificial structure and regular symmetry which an abstract view of the\r\nsubject might lead an ingenious theorist to bestow on a Constitution\r\nplanned in his closet or in his imagination? The real wonder is that so\r\nmany difficulties should have been surmounted, and surmounted with a\r\nunanimity almost as unprecedented as it must have been unexpected. It\r\nis impossible for any man of candor to reflect on this circumstance\r\nwithout partaking of the astonishment. It is impossible for the man of\r\npious reflection not to perceive in it a finger of that Almighty hand\r\nwhich has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the\r\ncritical stages of the revolution.\r\n\r\nWe had occasion, in a former paper, to take notice of the repeated\r\ntrials which have been unsuccessfully made in the United Netherlands\r\nfor reforming the baneful and notorious vices of their constitution.\r\nThe history of almost all the great councils and consultations held\r\namong mankind for reconciling their discordant opinions, assuaging\r\ntheir mutual jealousies, and adjusting their respective interests, is a\r\nhistory of factions, contentions, and disappointments, and may be\r\nclassed among the most dark and degraded pictures which display the\r\ninfirmities and depravities of the human character. If, in a few\r\nscattered instances, a brighter aspect is presented, they serve only as\r\nexceptions to admonish us of the general truth; and by their lustre to\r\ndarken the gloom of the adverse prospect to which they are contrasted.\r\nIn revolving the causes from which these exceptions result, and\r\napplying them to the particular instances before us, we are necessarily\r\nled to two important conclusions. The first is, that the convention\r\nmust have enjoyed, in a very singular degree, an exemption from the\r\npestilential influence of party animosities the disease most incident\r\nto deliberative bodies, and most apt to contaminate their proceedings.\r\nThe second conclusion is that all the deputations composing the\r\nconvention were satisfactorily accommodated by the final act, or were\r\ninduced to accede to it by a deep conviction of the necessity of\r\nsacrificing private opinions and partial interests to the public good,\r\nand by a despair of seeing this necessity diminished by delays or by\r\nnew experiments.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued, and the Incoherence of the Objections to\r\nthe New Plan Exposed\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, January 15, 1788.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIt is not a little remarkable that in every case reported by ancient\r\nhistory, in which government has been established with deliberation and\r\nconsent, the task of framing it has not been committed to an assembly\r\nof men, but has been performed by some individual citizen of preeminent\r\nwisdom and approved integrity.\r\n\r\nMinos, we learn, was the primitive founder of the government of Crete,\r\nas Zaleucus was of that of the Locrians. Theseus first, and after him\r\nDraco and Solon, instituted the government of Athens. Lycurgus was the\r\nlawgiver of Sparta. The foundation of the original government of Rome\r\nwas laid by Romulus, and the work completed by two of his elective\r\nsuccessors, Numa and Tullius Hostilius. On the abolition of royalty the\r\nconsular administration was substituted by Brutus, who stepped forward\r\nwith a project for such a reform, which, he alleged, had been prepared\r\nby Tullius Hostilius, and to which his address obtained the assent and\r\nratification of the senate and people. This remark is applicable to\r\nconfederate governments also. Amphictyon, we are told, was the author\r\nof that which bore his name. The Achaean league received its first\r\nbirth from Achaeus, and its second from Aratus.\r\n\r\nWhat degree of agency these reputed lawgivers might have in their\r\nrespective establishments, or how far they might be clothed with the\r\nlegitimate authority of the people, cannot in every instance be\r\nascertained. In some, however, the proceeding was strictly regular.\r\nDraco appears to have been intrusted by the people of Athens with\r\nindefinite powers to reform its government and laws. And Solon,\r\naccording to Plutarch, was in a manner compelled, by the universal\r\nsuffrage of his fellow-citizens, to take upon him the sole and absolute\r\npower of new-modeling the constitution. The proceedings under Lycurgus\r\nwere less regular; but as far as the advocates for a regular reform\r\ncould prevail, they all turned their eyes towards the single efforts of\r\nthat celebrated patriot and sage, instead of seeking to bring about a\r\nrevolution by the intervention of a deliberative body of citizens.\r\n\r\nWhence could it have proceeded, that a people, jealous as the Greeks\r\nwere of their liberty, should so far abandon the rules of caution as to\r\nplace their destiny in the hands of a single citizen? Whence could it\r\nhave proceeded, that the Athenians, a people who would not suffer an\r\narmy to be commanded by fewer than ten generals, and who required no\r\nother proof of danger to their liberties than the illustrious merit of\r\na fellow-citizen, should consider one illustrious citizen as a more\r\neligible depositary of the fortunes of themselves and their posterity,\r\nthan a select body of citizens, from whose common deliberations more\r\nwisdom, as well as more safety, might have been expected? These\r\nquestions cannot be fully answered, without supposing that the fears of\r\ndiscord and disunion among a number of counsellors exceeded the\r\napprehension of treachery or incapacity in a single individual. History\r\ninforms us, likewise, of the difficulties with which these celebrated\r\nreformers had to contend, as well as the expedients which they were\r\nobliged to employ in order to carry their reforms into effect. Solon,\r\nwho seems to have indulged a more temporizing policy, confessed that he\r\nhad not given to his countrymen the government best suited to their\r\nhappiness, but most tolerable to their prejudices. And Lycurgus, more\r\ntrue to his object, was under the necessity of mixing a portion of\r\nviolence with the authority of superstition, and of securing his final\r\nsuccess by a voluntary renunciation, first of his country, and then of\r\nhis life. If these lessons teach us, on one hand, to admire the\r\nimprovement made by America on the ancient mode of preparing and\r\nestablishing regular plans of government, they serve not less, on the\r\nother, to admonish us of the hazards and difficulties incident to such\r\nexperiments, and of the great imprudence of unnecessarily multiplying\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIs it an unreasonable conjecture, that the errors which may be\r\ncontained in the plan of the convention are such as have resulted\r\nrather from the defect of antecedent experience on this complicated and\r\ndifficult subject, than from a want of accuracy or care in the\r\ninvestigation of it; and, consequently such as will not be ascertained\r\nuntil an actual trial shall have pointed them out? This conjecture is\r\nrendered probable, not only by many considerations of a general nature,\r\nbut by the particular case of the Articles of Confederation. It is\r\nobservable that among the numerous objections and amendments suggested\r\nby the several States, when these articles were submitted for their\r\nratification, not one is found which alludes to the great and radical\r\nerror which on actual trial has discovered itself. And if we except the\r\nobservations which New Jersey was led to make, rather by her local\r\nsituation, than by her peculiar foresight, it may be questioned whether\r\na single suggestion was of sufficient moment to justify a revision of\r\nthe system. There is abundant reason, nevertheless, to suppose that\r\nimmaterial as these objections were, they would have been adhered to\r\nwith a very dangerous inflexibility, in some States, had not a zeal for\r\ntheir opinions and supposed interests been stifled by the more powerful\r\nsentiment of selfpreservation. One State, we may remember, persisted\r\nfor several years in refusing her concurrence, although the enemy\r\nremained the whole period at our gates, or rather in the very bowels of\r\nour country. Nor was her pliancy in the end effected by a less motive,\r\nthan the fear of being chargeable with protracting the public\r\ncalamities, and endangering the event of the contest. Every candid\r\nreader will make the proper reflections on these important facts.\r\n\r\nA patient who finds his disorder daily growing worse, and that an\r\nefficacious remedy can no longer be delayed without extreme danger,\r\nafter coolly revolving his situation, and the characters of different\r\nphysicians, selects and calls in such of them as he judges most capable\r\nof administering relief, and best entitled to his confidence. The\r\nphysicians attend; the case of the patient is carefully examined; a\r\nconsultation is held; they are unanimously agreed that the symptoms are\r\ncritical, but that the case, with proper and timely relief, is so far\r\nfrom being desperate, that it may be made to issue in an improvement of\r\nhis constitution. They are equally unanimous in prescribing the remedy,\r\nby which this happy effect is to be produced. The prescription is no\r\nsooner made known, however, than a number of persons interpose, and,\r\nwithout denying the reality or danger of the disorder, assure the\r\npatient that the prescription will be poison to his constitution, and\r\nforbid him, under pain of certain death, to make use of it. Might not\r\nthe patient reasonably demand, before he ventured to follow this\r\nadvice, that the authors of it should at least agree among themselves\r\non some other remedy to be substituted? And if he found them differing\r\nas much from one another as from his first counsellors, would he not\r\nact prudently in trying the experiment unanimously recommended by the\r\nlatter, rather than be hearkening to those who could neither deny the\r\nnecessity of a speedy remedy, nor agree in proposing one?\r\n\r\nSuch a patient and in such a situation is America at this moment. She\r\nhas been sensible of her malady. She has obtained a regular and\r\nunanimous advice from men of her own deliberate choice. And she is\r\nwarned by others against following this advice under pain of the most\r\nfatal consequences. Do the monitors deny the reality of her danger? No.\r\nDo they deny the necessity of some speedy and powerful remedy? No. Are\r\nthey agreed, are any two of them agreed, in their objections to the\r\nremedy proposed, or in the proper one to be substituted? Let them speak\r\nfor themselves. This one tells us that the proposed Constitution ought\r\nto be rejected, because it is not a confederation of the States, but a\r\ngovernment over individuals. Another admits that it ought to be a\r\ngovernment over individuals to a certain extent, but by no means to the\r\nextent proposed. A third does not object to the government over\r\nindividuals, or to the extent proposed, but to the want of a bill of\r\nrights. A fourth concurs in the absolute necessity of a bill of rights,\r\nbut contends that it ought to be declaratory, not of the personal\r\nrights of individuals, but of the rights reserved to the States in\r\ntheir political capacity. A fifth is of opinion that a bill of rights\r\nof any sort would be superfluous and misplaced, and that the plan would\r\nbe unexceptionable but for the fatal power of regulating the times and\r\nplaces of election. An objector in a large State exclaims loudly\r\nagainst the unreasonable equality of representation in the Senate. An\r\nobjector in a small State is equally loud against the dangerous\r\ninequality in the House of Representatives. From this quarter, we are\r\nalarmed with the amazing expense, from the number of persons who are to\r\nadminister the new government. From another quarter, and sometimes from\r\nthe same quarter, on another occasion, the cry is that the Congress\r\nwill be but a shadow of a representation, and that the government would\r\nbe far less objectionable if the number and the expense were doubled. A\r\npatriot in a State that does not import or export, discerns insuperable\r\nobjections against the power of direct taxation. The patriotic\r\nadversary in a State of great exports and imports, is not less\r\ndissatisfied that the whole burden of taxes may be thrown on\r\nconsumption. This politician discovers in the Constitution a direct and\r\nirresistible tendency to monarchy; that is equally sure it will end in\r\naristocracy. Another is puzzled to say which of these shapes it will\r\nultimately assume, but sees clearly it must be one or other of them;\r\nwhilst a fourth is not wanting, who with no less confidence affirms\r\nthat the Constitution is so far from having a bias towards either of\r\nthese dangers, that the weight on that side will not be sufficient to\r\nkeep it upright and firm against its opposite propensities. With\r\nanother class of adversaries to the Constitution the language is that\r\nthe legislative, executive, and judiciary departments are intermixed in\r\nsuch a manner as to contradict all the ideas of regular government and\r\nall the requisite precautions in favor of liberty. Whilst this\r\nobjection circulates in vague and general expressions, there are but a\r\nfew who lend their sanction to it. Let each one come forward with his\r\nparticular explanation, and scarce any two are exactly agreed upon the\r\nsubject. In the eyes of one the junction of the Senate with the\r\nPresident in the responsible function of appointing to offices, instead\r\nof vesting this executive power in the Executive alone, is the vicious\r\npart of the organization. To another, the exclusion of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, whose numbers alone could be a due security against\r\ncorruption and partiality in the exercise of such a power, is equally\r\nobnoxious. With another, the admission of the President into any share\r\nof a power which ever must be a dangerous engine in the hands of the\r\nexecutive magistrate, is an unpardonable violation of the maxims of\r\nrepublican jealousy. No part of the arrangement, according to some, is\r\nmore inadmissible than the trial of impeachments by the Senate, which\r\nis alternately a member both of the legislative and executive\r\ndepartments, when this power so evidently belonged to the judiciary\r\ndepartment. “We concur fully,” reply others, “in the objection to this\r\npart of the plan, but we can never agree that a reference of\r\nimpeachments to the judiciary authority would be an amendment of the\r\nerror. Our principal dislike to the organization arises from the\r\nextensive powers already lodged in that department.” Even among the\r\nzealous patrons of a council of state the most irreconcilable variance\r\nis discovered concerning the mode in which it ought to be constituted.\r\nThe demand of one gentleman is, that the council should consist of a\r\nsmall number to be appointed by the most numerous branch of the\r\nlegislature. Another would prefer a larger number, and considers it as\r\na fundamental condition that the appointment should be made by the\r\nPresident himself.\r\n\r\nAs it can give no umbrage to the writers against the plan of the\r\nfederal Constitution, let us suppose, that as they are the most\r\nzealous, so they are also the most sagacious, of those who think the\r\nlate convention were unequal to the task assigned them, and that a\r\nwiser and better plan might and ought to be substituted. Let us further\r\nsuppose that their country should concur, both in this favorable\r\nopinion of their merits, and in their unfavorable opinion of the\r\nconvention; and should accordingly proceed to form them into a second\r\nconvention, with full powers, and for the express purpose of revising\r\nand remoulding the work of the first. Were the experiment to be\r\nseriously made, though it required some effort to view it seriously\r\neven in fiction, I leave it to be decided by the sample of opinions\r\njust exhibited, whether, with all their enmity to their predecessors,\r\nthey would, in any one point, depart so widely from their example, as\r\nin the discord and ferment that would mark their own deliberations; and\r\nwhether the Constitution, now before the public, would not stand as\r\nfair a chance for immortality, as Lycurgus gave to that of Sparta, by\r\nmaking its change to depend on his own return from exile and death, if\r\nit were to be immediately adopted, and were to continue in force, not\r\nuntil a BETTER, but until ANOTHER should be agreed upon by this new\r\nassembly of lawgivers.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter both of wonder and regret, that those who raise so many\r\nobjections against the new Constitution should never call to mind the\r\ndefects of that which is to be exchanged for it. It is not necessary\r\nthat the former should be perfect; it is sufficient that the latter is\r\nmore imperfect. No man would refuse to give brass for silver or gold,\r\nbecause the latter had some alloy in it. No man would refuse to quit a\r\nshattered and tottering habitation for a firm and commodious building,\r\nbecause the latter had not a porch to it, or because some of the rooms\r\nmight be a little larger or smaller, or the ceilings a little higher or\r\nlower than his fancy would have planned them. But waiving illustrations\r\nof this sort, is it not manifest that most of the capital objections\r\nurged against the new system lie with tenfold weight against the\r\nexisting Confederation? Is an indefinite power to raise money dangerous\r\nin the hands of the federal government? The present Congress can make\r\nrequisitions to any amount they please, and the States are\r\nconstitutionally bound to furnish them; they can emit bills of credit\r\nas long as they will pay for the paper; they can borrow, both abroad\r\nand at home, as long as a shilling will be lent. Is an indefinite power\r\nto raise troops dangerous? The Confederation gives to Congress that\r\npower also; and they have already begun to make use of it. Is it\r\nimproper and unsafe to intermix the different powers of government in\r\nthe same body of men? Congress, a single body of men, are the sole\r\ndepositary of all the federal powers. Is it particularly dangerous to\r\ngive the keys of the treasury, and the command of the army, into the\r\nsame hands? The Confederation places them both in the hands of\r\nCongress. Is a bill of rights essential to liberty? The Confederation\r\nhas no bill of rights. Is it an objection against the new Constitution,\r\nthat it empowers the Senate, with the concurrence of the Executive, to\r\nmake treaties which are to be the laws of the land? The existing\r\nCongress, without any such control, can make treaties which they\r\nthemselves have declared, and most of the States have recognized, to be\r\nthe supreme law of the land. Is the importation of slaves permitted by\r\nthe new Constitution for twenty years? By the old it is permitted\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nI shall be told, that however dangerous this mixture of powers may be\r\nin theory, it is rendered harmless by the dependence of Congress on the\r\nState for the means of carrying them into practice; that however large\r\nthe mass of powers may be, it is in fact a lifeless mass. Then, say I,\r\nin the first place, that the Confederation is chargeable with the still\r\ngreater folly of declaring certain powers in the federal government to\r\nbe absolutely necessary, and at the same time rendering them absolutely\r\nnugatory; and, in the next place, that if the Union is to continue, and\r\nno better government be substituted, effective powers must either be\r\ngranted to, or assumed by, the existing Congress; in either of which\r\nevents, the contrast just stated will hold good. But this is not all.\r\nOut of this lifeless mass has already grown an excrescent power, which\r\ntends to realize all the dangers that can be apprehended from a\r\ndefective construction of the supreme government of the Union. It is\r\nnow no longer a point of speculation and hope, that the Western\r\nterritory is a mine of vast wealth to the United States; and although\r\nit is not of such a nature as to extricate them from their present\r\ndistresses, or for some time to come, to yield any regular supplies for\r\nthe public expenses, yet must it hereafter be able, under proper\r\nmanagement, both to effect a gradual discharge of the domestic debt,\r\nand to furnish, for a certain period, liberal tributes to the federal\r\ntreasury. A very large proportion of this fund has been already\r\nsurrendered by individual States; and it may with reason be expected\r\nthat the remaining States will not persist in withholding similar\r\nproofs of their equity and generosity. We may calculate, therefore,\r\nthat a rich and fertile country, of an area equal to the inhabited\r\nextent of the United States, will soon become a national stock.\r\nCongress have assumed the administration of this stock. They have begun\r\nto render it productive. Congress have undertaken to do more: they have\r\nproceeded to form new States, to erect temporary governments, to\r\nappoint officers for them, and to prescribe the conditions on which\r\nsuch States shall be admitted into the Confederacy. All this has been\r\ndone; and done without the least color of constitutional authority. Yet\r\nno blame has been whispered; no alarm has been sounded. A GREAT and\r\nINDEPENDENT fund of revenue is passing into the hands of a SINGLE BODY\r\nof men, who can RAISE TROOPS to an INDEFINITE NUMBER, and appropriate\r\nmoney to their support for an INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. And yet there\r\nare men, who have not only been silent spectators of this prospect, but\r\nwho are advocates for the system which exhibits it; and, at the same\r\ntime, urge against the new system the objections which we have heard.\r\nWould they not act with more consistency, in urging the establishment\r\nof the latter, as no less necessary to guard the Union against the\r\nfuture powers and resources of a body constructed like the existing\r\nCongress, than to save it from the dangers threatened by the present\r\nimpotency of that Assembly?\r\n\r\nI mean not, by any thing here said, to throw censure on the measures\r\nwhich have been pursued by Congress. I am sensible they could not have\r\ndone otherwise. The public interest, the necessity of the case, imposed\r\nupon them the task of overleaping their constitutional limits. But is\r\nnot the fact an alarming proof of the danger resulting from a\r\ngovernment which does not possess regular powers commensurate to its\r\nobjects? A dissolution or usurpation is the dreadful dilemma to which\r\nit is continually exposed.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XXXIX.\r\n\r\nThe Conformity of the Plan to Republican Principles\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe last paper having concluded the observations which were meant to\r\nintroduce a candid survey of the plan of government reported by the\r\nconvention, we now proceed to the execution of that part of our\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nThe first question that offers itself is, whether the general form and\r\naspect of the government be strictly republican. It is evident that no\r\nother form would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of\r\nAmerica; with the fundamental principles of the Revolution; or with\r\nthat honorable determination which animates every votary of freedom, to\r\nrest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for\r\nself-government. If the plan of the convention, therefore, be found to\r\ndepart from the republican character, its advocates must abandon it as\r\nno longer defensible.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the distinctive characters of the republican form? Were\r\nan answer to this question to be sought, not by recurring to\r\nprinciples, but in the application of the term by political writers, to\r\nthe constitution of different States, no satisfactory one would ever be\r\nfound. Holland, in which no particle of the supreme authority is\r\nderived from the people, has passed almost universally under the\r\ndenomination of a republic. The same title has been bestowed on Venice,\r\nwhere absolute power over the great body of the people is exercised, in\r\nthe most absolute manner, by a small body of hereditary nobles. Poland,\r\nwhich is a mixture of aristocracy and of monarchy in their worst forms,\r\nhas been dignified with the same appellation. The government of\r\nEngland, which has one republican branch only, combined with an\r\nhereditary aristocracy and monarchy, has, with equal impropriety, been\r\nfrequently placed on the list of republics. These examples, which are\r\nnearly as dissimilar to each other as to a genuine republic, show the\r\nextreme inaccuracy with which the term has been used in political\r\ndisquisitions.\r\n\r\nIf we resort for a criterion to the different principles on which\r\ndifferent forms of government are established, we may define a republic\r\nto be, or at least may bestow that name on, a government which derives\r\nall its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the\r\npeople, and is administered by persons holding their offices during\r\npleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior. It is\r\nESSENTIAL to such a government that it be derived from the great body\r\nof the society, not from an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored\r\nclass of it; otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their\r\noppressions by a delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank\r\nof republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of\r\nrepublic. It is SUFFICIENT for such a government that the persons\r\nadministering it be appointed, either directly or indirectly, by the\r\npeople; and that they hold their appointments by either of the tenures\r\njust specified; otherwise every government in the United States, as\r\nwell as every other popular government that has been or can be well\r\norganized or well executed, would be degraded from the republican\r\ncharacter. According to the constitution of every State in the Union,\r\nsome or other of the officers of government are appointed indirectly\r\nonly by the people. According to most of them, the chief magistrate\r\nhimself is so appointed. And according to one, this mode of appointment\r\nis extended to one of the co-ordinate branches of the legislature.\r\nAccording to all the constitutions, also, the tenure of the highest\r\noffices is extended to a definite period, and in many instances, both\r\nwithin the legislative and executive departments, to a period of years.\r\nAccording to the provisions of most of the constitutions, again, as\r\nwell as according to the most respectable and received opinions on the\r\nsubject, the members of the judiciary department are to retain their\r\noffices by the firm tenure of good behavior.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the Constitution planned by the convention with the\r\nstandard here fixed, we perceive at once that it is, in the most rigid\r\nsense, conformable to it. The House of Representatives, like that of\r\none branch at least of all the State legislatures, is elected\r\nimmediately by the great body of the people. The Senate, like the\r\npresent Congress, and the Senate of Maryland, derives its appointment\r\nindirectly from the people. The President is indirectly derived from\r\nthe choice of the people, according to the example in most of the\r\nStates. Even the judges, with all other officers of the Union, will, as\r\nin the several States, be the choice, though a remote choice, of the\r\npeople themselves, the duration of the appointments is equally\r\nconformable to the republican standard, and to the model of State\r\nconstitutions The House of Representatives is periodically elective, as\r\nin all the States; and for the period of two years, as in the State of\r\nSouth Carolina. The Senate is elective, for the period of six years;\r\nwhich is but one year more than the period of the Senate of Maryland,\r\nand but two more than that of the Senates of New York and Virginia. The\r\nPresident is to continue in office for the period of four years; as in\r\nNew York and Delaware, the chief magistrate is elected for three years,\r\nand in South Carolina for two years. In the other States the election\r\nis annual. In several of the States, however, no constitutional\r\nprovision is made for the impeachment of the chief magistrate. And in\r\nDelaware and Virginia he is not impeachable till out of office. The\r\nPresident of the United States is impeachable at any time during his\r\ncontinuance in office. The tenure by which the judges are to hold their\r\nplaces, is, as it unquestionably ought to be, that of good behavior.\r\nThe tenure of the ministerial offices generally, will be a subject of\r\nlegal regulation, conformably to the reason of the case and the example\r\nof the State constitutions.\r\n\r\nCould any further proof be required of the republican complexion of\r\nthis system, the most decisive one might be found in its absolute\r\nprohibition of titles of nobility, both under the federal and the State\r\ngovernments; and in its express guaranty of the republican form to each\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\n“But it was not sufficient,” say the adversaries of the proposed\r\nConstitution, “for the convention to adhere to the republican form.\r\nThey ought, with equal care, to have preserved the FEDERAL form, which\r\nregards the Union as a CONFEDERACY of sovereign states; instead of\r\nwhich, they have framed a NATIONAL government, which regards the Union\r\nas a CONSOLIDATION of the States.” And it is asked by what authority\r\nthis bold and radical innovation was undertaken? The handle which has\r\nbeen made of this objection requires that it should be examined with\r\nsome precision.\r\n\r\nWithout inquiring into the accuracy of the distinction on which the\r\nobjection is founded, it will be necessary to a just estimate of its\r\nforce, first, to ascertain the real character of the government in\r\nquestion; secondly, to inquire how far the convention were authorized\r\nto propose such a government; and thirdly, how far the duty they owed\r\nto their country could supply any defect of regular authority.\r\n\r\nFirst. In order to ascertain the real character of the government, it\r\nmay be considered in relation to the foundation on which it is to be\r\nestablished; to the sources from which its ordinary powers are to be\r\ndrawn; to the operation of those powers; to the extent of them; and to\r\nthe authority by which future changes in the government are to be\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nOn examining the first relation, it appears, on one hand, that the\r\nConstitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the\r\npeople of America, given by deputies elected for the special purpose;\r\nbut, on the other, that this assent and ratification is to be given by\r\nthe people, not as individuals composing one entire nation, but as\r\ncomposing the distinct and independent States to which they\r\nrespectively belong. It is to be the assent and ratification of the\r\nseveral States, derived from the supreme authority in each State, the\r\nauthority of the people themselves. The act, therefore, establishing\r\nthe Constitution, will not be a NATIONAL, but a FEDERAL act.\r\n\r\nThat it will be a federal and not a national act, as these terms are\r\nunderstood by the objectors; the act of the people, as forming so many\r\nindependent States, not as forming one aggregate nation, is obvious\r\nfrom this single consideration, that it is to result neither from the\r\ndecision of a MAJORITY of the people of the Union, nor from that of a\r\nMAJORITY of the States. It must result from the UNANIMOUS assent of the\r\nseveral States that are parties to it, differing no otherwise from\r\ntheir ordinary assent than in its being expressed, not by the\r\nlegislative authority, but by that of the people themselves. Were the\r\npeople regarded in this transaction as forming one nation, the will of\r\nthe majority of the whole people of the United States would bind the\r\nminority, in the same manner as the majority in each State must bind\r\nthe minority; and the will of the majority must be determined either by\r\na comparison of the individual votes, or by considering the will of the\r\nmajority of the States as evidence of the will of a majority of the\r\npeople of the United States. Neither of these rules have been adopted.\r\nEach State, in ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign\r\nbody, independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own\r\nvoluntary act. In this relation, then, the new Constitution will, if\r\nestablished, be a FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL constitution.\r\n\r\nThe next relation is, to the sources from which the ordinary powers of\r\ngovernment are to be derived. The House of Representatives will derive\r\nits powers from the people of America; and the people will be\r\nrepresented in the same proportion, and on the same principle, as they\r\nare in the legislature of a particular State. So far the government is\r\nNATIONAL, not FEDERAL. The Senate, on the other hand, will derive its\r\npowers from the States, as political and coequal societies; and these\r\nwill be represented on the principle of equality in the Senate, as they\r\nnow are in the existing Congress. So far the government is FEDERAL, not\r\nNATIONAL. The executive power will be derived from a very compound\r\nsource. The immediate election of the President is to be made by the\r\nStates in their political characters. The votes allotted to them are in\r\na compound ratio, which considers them partly as distinct and coequal\r\nsocieties, partly as unequal members of the same society. The eventual\r\nelection, again, is to be made by that branch of the legislature which\r\nconsists of the national representatives; but in this particular act\r\nthey are to be thrown into the form of individual delegations, from so\r\nmany distinct and coequal bodies politic. From this aspect of the\r\ngovernment it appears to be of a mixed character, presenting at least\r\nas many FEDERAL as NATIONAL features.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a federal and national government, as it relates\r\nto the OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT, is supposed to consist in this,\r\nthat in the former the powers operate on the political bodies composing\r\nthe Confederacy, in their political capacities; in the latter, on the\r\nindividual citizens composing the nation, in their individual\r\ncapacities. On trying the Constitution by this criterion, it falls\r\nunder the NATIONAL, not the FEDERAL character; though perhaps not so\r\ncompletely as has been understood. In several cases, and particularly\r\nin the trial of controversies to which States may be parties, they must\r\nbe viewed and proceeded against in their collective and political\r\ncapacities only. So far the national countenance of the government on\r\nthis side seems to be disfigured by a few federal features. But this\r\nblemish is perhaps unavoidable in any plan; and the operation of the\r\ngovernment on the people, in their individual capacities, in its\r\nordinary and most essential proceedings, may, on the whole, designate\r\nit, in this relation, a NATIONAL government.\r\n\r\nBut if the government be national with regard to the OPERATION of its\r\npowers, it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in relation\r\nto the EXTENT of its powers. The idea of a national government involves\r\nin it, not only an authority over the individual citizens, but an\r\nindefinite supremacy over all persons and things, so far as they are\r\nobjects of lawful government. Among a people consolidated into one\r\nnation, this supremacy is completely vested in the national\r\nlegislature. Among communities united for particular purposes, it is\r\nvested partly in the general and partly in the municipal legislatures.\r\nIn the former case, all local authorities are subordinate to the\r\nsupreme; and may be controlled, directed, or abolished by it at\r\npleasure. In the latter, the local or municipal authorities form\r\ndistinct and independent portions of the supremacy, no more subject,\r\nwithin their respective spheres, to the general authority, than the\r\ngeneral authority is subject to them, within its own sphere. In this\r\nrelation, then, the proposed government cannot be deemed a NATIONAL\r\none; since its jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects only,\r\nand leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty\r\nover all other objects. It is true that in controversies relating to\r\nthe boundary between the two jurisdictions, the tribunal which is\r\nultimately to decide, is to be established under the general\r\ngovernment. But this does not change the principle of the case. The\r\ndecision is to be impartially made, according to the rules of the\r\nConstitution; and all the usual and most effectual precautions are\r\ntaken to secure this impartiality. Some such tribunal is clearly\r\nessential to prevent an appeal to the sword and a dissolution of the\r\ncompact; and that it ought to be established under the general rather\r\nthan under the local governments, or, to speak more properly, that it\r\ncould be safely established under the first alone, is a position not\r\nlikely to be combated.\r\n\r\nIf we try the Constitution by its last relation to the authority by\r\nwhich amendments are to be made, we find it neither wholly NATIONAL nor\r\nwholly FEDERAL. Were it wholly national, the supreme and ultimate\r\nauthority would reside in the MAJORITY of the people of the Union; and\r\nthis authority would be competent at all times, like that of a majority\r\nof every national society, to alter or abolish its established\r\ngovernment. Were it wholly federal, on the other hand, the concurrence\r\nof each State in the Union would be essential to every alteration that\r\nwould be binding on all. The mode provided by the plan of the\r\nconvention is not founded on either of these principles. In requiring\r\nmore than a majority, and principles. In requiring more than a\r\nmajority, and particularly in computing the proportion by STATES, not\r\nby CITIZENS, it departs from the NATIONAL and advances towards the\r\nFEDERAL character; in rendering the concurrence of less than the whole\r\nnumber of States sufficient, it loses again the FEDERAL and partakes of\r\nthe NATIONAL character.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Constitution, therefore, is, in strictness, neither a\r\nnational nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both. In its\r\nfoundation it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the\r\nordinary powers of the government are drawn, it is partly federal and\r\npartly national; in the operation of these powers, it is national, not\r\nfederal; in the extent of them, again, it is federal, not national;\r\nand, finally, in the authoritative mode of introducing amendments, it\r\nis neither wholly federal nor wholly national.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XL.\r\n\r\nThe Powers of the Convention to Form a Mixed Government Examined and\r\nSustained\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, January 18, 1788.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe second point to be examined is, whether the convention were\r\nauthorized to frame and propose this mixed Constitution. The powers of\r\nthe convention ought, in strictness, to be determined by an inspection\r\nof the commissions given to the members by their respective\r\nconstituents. As all of these, however, had reference, either to the\r\nrecommendation from the meeting at Annapolis, in September, 1786, or to\r\nthat from Congress, in February, 1787, it will be sufficient to recur\r\nto these particular acts. The act from Annapolis recommends the\r\n“appointment of commissioners to take into consideration the situation\r\nof the United States; to devise SUCH FURTHER PROVISIONS as shall appear\r\nto them necessary to render the Constitution of the federal government\r\nADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF THE UNION; and to report such an act for\r\nthat purpose, to the United States in Congress assembled, as when\r\nagreed to by them, and afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every\r\nState, will effectually provide for the same. “The recommendatory act\r\nof Congress is in the words following: “WHEREAS, There is provision in\r\nthe articles of Confederation and perpetual Union, for making\r\nalterations therein, by the assent of a Congress of the United States,\r\nand of the legislatures of the several States; and whereas experience\r\nhath evinced, that there are defects in the present Confederation; as a\r\nmean to remedy which, several of the States, and PARTICULARLY THE STATE\r\nOF NEW YORK, by express instructions to their delegates in Congress,\r\nhave suggested a convention for the purposes expressed in the following\r\nresolution; and such convention appearing to be the most probable mean\r\nof establishing in these States A FIRM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT: “Resolved,\r\nThat in the opinion of Congress it is expedient, that on the second\r\nMonday of May next a convention of delegates, who shall have been\r\nappointed by the several States, be held at Philadelphia, for the sole\r\nand express purpose OF REVISING THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION, and\r\nreporting to Congress and the several legislatures such ALTERATIONS AND\r\nPROVISIONS THEREIN, as shall, when agreed to in Congress, and confirmed\r\nby the States, render the federal Constitution ADEQUATE TO THE\r\nEXIGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION. “From these\r\ntwo acts, it appears, 1st, that the object of the convention was to\r\nestablish, in these States, A FIRM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT; 2d, that this\r\ngovernment was to be such as would be ADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF\r\nGOVERNMENT and THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION; 3d, that these purposes\r\nwere to be effected by ALTERATIONS AND PROVISIONS IN THE ARTICLES OF\r\nCONFEDERATION, as it is expressed in the act of Congress, or by SUCH\r\nFURTHER PROVISIONS AS SHOULD APPEAR NECESSARY, as it stands in the\r\nrecommendatory act from Annapolis; 4th, that the alterations and\r\nprovisions were to be reported to Congress, and to the States, in order\r\nto be agreed to by the former and confirmed by the latter. From a\r\ncomparison and fair construction of these several modes of expression,\r\nis to be deduced the authority under which the convention acted. They\r\nwere to frame a NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, adequate to the EXIGENCIES OF\r\nGOVERNMENT, and OF THE UNION; and to reduce the articles of\r\nConfederation into such form as to accomplish these purposes.\r\n\r\nThere are two rules of construction, dictated by plain reason, as well\r\nas founded on legal axioms. The one is, that every part of the\r\nexpression ought, if possible, to be allowed some meaning, and be made\r\nto conspire to some common end. The other is, that where the several\r\nparts cannot be made to coincide, the less important should give way to\r\nthe more important part; the means should be sacrificed to the end,\r\nrather than the end to the means. Suppose, then, that the expressions\r\ndefining the authority of the convention were irreconcilably at\r\nvariance with each other; that a NATIONAL and ADEQUATE GOVERNMENT could\r\nnot possibly, in the judgment of the convention, be affected by\r\nALTERATIONS and PROVISIONS in the ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION; which part\r\nof the definition ought to have been embraced, and which rejected?\r\nWhich was the more important, which the less important part? Which the\r\nend; which the means? Let the most scrupulous expositors of delegated\r\npowers; let the most inveterate objectors against those exercised by\r\nthe convention, answer these questions. Let them declare, whether it\r\nwas of most importance to the happiness of the people of America, that\r\nthe articles of Confederation should be disregarded, and an adequate\r\ngovernment be provided, and the Union preserved; or that an adequate\r\ngovernment should be omitted, and the articles of Confederation\r\npreserved. Let them declare, whether the preservation of these articles\r\nwas the end, for securing which a reform of the government was to be\r\nintroduced as the means; or whether the establishment of a government,\r\nadequate to the national happiness, was the end at which these articles\r\nthemselves originally aimed, and to which they ought, as insufficient\r\nmeans, to have been sacrificed. But is it necessary to suppose that\r\nthese expressions are absolutely irreconcilable to each other; that no\r\nALTERATIONS or PROVISIONS in THE ARTICLES OF THE CONFEDERATION could\r\npossibly mould them into a national and adequate government; into such\r\na government as has been proposed by the convention? No stress, it is\r\npresumed, will, in this case, be laid on the TITLE; a change of that\r\ncould never be deemed an exercise of ungranted power. ALTERATIONS in\r\nthe body of the instrument are expressly authorized. NEW PROVISIONS\r\ntherein are also expressly authorized. Here then is a power to change\r\nthe title; to insert new articles; to alter old ones. Must it of\r\nnecessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a part\r\nof the old articles remain? Those who maintain the affirmative ought at\r\nleast to mark the boundary between authorized and usurped innovations;\r\nbetween that degree of change which lies within the compass of\r\nALTERATIONS AND FURTHER PROVISIONS, and that which amounts to a\r\nTRANSMUTATION of the government. Will it be said that the alterations\r\nought not to have touched the substance of the Confederation? The\r\nStates would never have appointed a convention with so much solemnity,\r\nnor described its objects with so much latitude, if some SUBSTANTIAL\r\nreform had not been in contemplation. Will it be said that the\r\nFUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES of the Confederation were not within the purview\r\nof the convention, and ought not to have been varied? I ask, What are\r\nthese principles? Do they require that, in the establishment of the\r\nConstitution, the States should be regarded as distinct and independent\r\nsovereigns? They are so regarded by the Constitution proposed. Do they\r\nrequire that the members of the government should derive their\r\nappointment from the legislatures, not from the people of the States?\r\nOne branch of the new government is to be appointed by these\r\nlegislatures; and under the Confederation, the delegates to Congress\r\nMAY ALL be appointed immediately by the people, and in two States[1]\r\nare actually so appointed. Do they require that the powers of the\r\ngovernment should act on the States, and not immediately on\r\nindividuals? In some instances, as has been shown, the powers of the\r\nnew government will act on the States in their collective characters.\r\nIn some instances, also, those of the existing government act\r\nimmediately on individuals. In cases of capture; of piracy; of the post\r\noffice; of coins, weights, and measures; of trade with the Indians; of\r\nclaims under grants of land by different States; and, above all, in the\r\ncase of trials by courts-marshal in the army and navy, by which death\r\nmay be inflicted without the intervention of a jury, or even of a civil\r\nmagistrate; in all these cases the powers of the Confederation operate\r\nimmediately on the persons and interests of individual citizens. Do\r\nthese fundamental principles require, particularly, that no tax should\r\nbe levied without the intermediate agency of the States? The\r\nConfederation itself authorizes a direct tax, to a certain extent, on\r\nthe post office. The power of coinage has been so construed by Congress\r\nas to levy a tribute immediately from that source also. But\r\npretermitting these instances, was it not an acknowledged object of the\r\nconvention and the universal expectation of the people, that the\r\nregulation of trade should be submitted to the general government in\r\nsuch a form as would render it an immediate source of general revenue?\r\nHad not Congress repeatedly recommended this measure as not\r\ninconsistent with the fundamental principles of the Confederation? Had\r\nnot every State but one; had not New York herself, so far complied with\r\nthe plan of Congress as to recognize the PRINCIPLE of the innovation?\r\nDo these principles, in fine, require that the powers of the general\r\ngovernment should be limited, and that, beyond this limit, the States\r\nshould be left in possession of their sovereignty and independence? We\r\nhave seen that in the new government, as in the old, the general powers\r\nare limited; and that the States, in all unenumerated cases, are left\r\nin the enjoyment of their sovereign and independent jurisdiction. The\r\ntruth is, that the great principles of the Constitution proposed by the\r\nconvention may be considered less as absolutely new, than as the\r\nexpansion of principles which are found in the articles of\r\nConfederation. The misfortune under the latter system has been, that\r\nthese principles are so feeble and confined as to justify all the\r\ncharges of inefficiency which have been urged against it, and to\r\nrequire a degree of enlargement which gives to the new system the\r\naspect of an entire transformation of the old. In one particular it is\r\nadmitted that the convention have departed from the tenor of their\r\ncommission. Instead of reporting a plan requiring the confirmation OF\r\nTHE LEGISLATURES OF ALL THE STATES, they have reported a plan which is\r\nto be confirmed by the PEOPLE, and may be carried into effect by NINE\r\nSTATES ONLY. It is worthy of remark that this objection, though the\r\nmost plausible, has been the least urged in the publications which have\r\nswarmed against the convention. The forbearance can only have proceeded\r\nfrom an irresistible conviction of the absurdity of subjecting the fate\r\nof twelve States to the perverseness or corruption of a thirteenth;\r\nfrom the example of inflexible opposition given by a MAJORITY of one\r\nsixtieth of the people of America to a measure approved and called for\r\nby the voice of twelve States, comprising fifty-nine sixtieths of the\r\npeople an example still fresh in the memory and indignation of every\r\ncitizen who has felt for the wounded honor and prosperity of his\r\ncountry. As this objection, therefore, has been in a manner waived by\r\nthose who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it\r\nwithout further observation. The THIRD point to be inquired into is,\r\nhow far considerations of duty arising out of the case itself could\r\nhave supplied any defect of regular authority. In the preceding\r\ninquiries the powers of the convention have been analyzed and tried\r\nwith the same rigor, and by the same rules, as if they had been real\r\nand final powers for the establishment of a Constitution for the United\r\nStates. We have seen in what manner they have borne the trial even on\r\nthat supposition. It is time now to recollect that the powers were\r\nmerely advisory and recommendatory; that they were so meant by the\r\nStates, and so understood by the convention; and that the latter have\r\naccordingly planned and proposed a Constitution which is to be of no\r\nmore consequence than the paper on which it is written, unless it be\r\nstamped with the approbation of those to whom it is addressed. This\r\nreflection places the subject in a point of view altogether different,\r\nand will enable us to judge with propriety of the course taken by the\r\nconvention. Let us view the ground on which the convention stood. It\r\nmay be collected from their proceedings, that they were deeply and\r\nunanimously impressed with the crisis, which had led their country\r\nalmost with one voice to make so singular and solemn an experiment for\r\ncorrecting the errors of a system by which this crisis had been\r\nproduced; that they were no less deeply and unanimously convinced that\r\nsuch a reform as they have proposed was absolutely necessary to effect\r\nthe purposes of their appointment. It could not be unknown to them that\r\nthe hopes and expectations of the great body of citizens, throughout\r\nthis great empire, were turned with the keenest anxiety to the event of\r\ntheir deliberations. They had every reason to believe that the contrary\r\nsentiments agitated the minds and bosoms of every external and internal\r\nfoe to the liberty and prosperity of the United States. They had seen\r\nin the origin and progress of the experiment, the alacrity with which\r\nthe PROPOSITION, made by a single State (Virginia), towards a partial\r\namendment of the Confederation, had been attended to and promoted. They\r\nhad seen the LIBERTY ASSUMED by a VERY FEW deputies from a VERY FEW\r\nStates, convened at Annapolis, of recommending a great and critical\r\nobject, wholly foreign to their commission, not only justified by the\r\npublic opinion, but actually carried into effect by twelve out of the\r\nthirteen States. They had seen, in a variety of instances, assumptions\r\nby Congress, not only of recommendatory, but of operative, powers,\r\nwarranted, in the public estimation, by occasions and objects\r\ninfinitely less urgent than those by which their conduct was to be\r\ngoverned. They must have reflected, that in all great changes of\r\nestablished governments, forms ought to give way to substance; that a\r\nrigid adherence in such cases to the former, would render nominal and\r\nnugatory the transcendent and precious right of the people to “abolish\r\nor alter their governments as to them shall seem most likely to effect\r\ntheir safety and happiness,”[2] since it is impossible for the people\r\nspontaneously and universally to move in concert towards their object;\r\nand it is therefore essential that such changes be instituted by some\r\nINFORMAL AND UNAUTHORIZED PROPOSITIONS, made by some patriotic and\r\nrespectable citizen or number of citizens. They must have recollected\r\nthat it was by this irregular and assumed privilege of proposing to the\r\npeople plans for their safety and happiness, that the States were first\r\nunited against the danger with which they were threatened by their\r\nancient government; that committees and congresses were formed for\r\nconcentrating their efforts and defending their rights; and that\r\nCONVENTIONS were ELECTED in THE SEVERAL STATES for establishing the\r\nconstitutions under which they are now governed; nor could it have been\r\nforgotten that no little ill-timed scruples, no zeal for adhering to\r\nordinary forms, were anywhere seen, except in those who wished to\r\nindulge, under these masks, their secret enmity to the substance\r\ncontended for. They must have borne in mind, that as the plan to be\r\nframed and proposed was to be submitted TO THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, the\r\ndisapprobation of this supreme authority would destroy it forever; its\r\napprobation blot out antecedent errors and irregularities. It might\r\neven have occurred to them, that where a disposition to cavil\r\nprevailed, their neglect to execute the degree of power vested in them,\r\nand still more their recommendation of any measure whatever, not\r\nwarranted by their commission, would not less excite animadversion,\r\nthan a recommendation at once of a measure fully commensurate to the\r\nnational exigencies. Had the convention, under all these impressions,\r\nand in the midst of all these considerations, instead of exercising a\r\nmanly confidence in their country, by whose confidence they had been so\r\npeculiarly distinguished, and of pointing out a system capable, in\r\ntheir judgment, of securing its happiness, taken the cold and sullen\r\nresolution of disappointing its ardent hopes, of sacrificing substance\r\nto forms, of committing the dearest interests of their country to the\r\nuncertainties of delay and the hazard of events, let me ask the man who\r\ncan raise his mind to one elevated conception, who can awaken in his\r\nbosom one patriotic emotion, what judgment ought to have been\r\npronounced by the impartial world, by the friends of mankind, by every\r\nvirtuous citizen, on the conduct and character of this assembly? Or if\r\nthere be a man whose propensity to condemn is susceptible of no\r\ncontrol, let me then ask what sentence he has in reserve for the twelve\r\nStates who USURPED THE POWER of sending deputies to the convention, a\r\nbody utterly unknown to their constitutions; for Congress, who\r\nrecommended the appointment of this body, equally unknown to the\r\nConfederation; and for the State of New York, in particular, which\r\nfirst urged and then complied with this unauthorized interposition? But\r\nthat the objectors may be disarmed of every pretext, it shall be\r\ngranted for a moment that the convention were neither authorized by\r\ntheir commission, nor justified by circumstances in proposing a\r\nConstitution for their country: does it follow that the Constitution\r\nought, for that reason alone, to be rejected? If, according to the\r\nnoble precept, it be lawful to accept good advice even from an enemy,\r\nshall we set the ignoble example of refusing such advice even when it\r\nis offered by our friends? The prudent inquiry, in all cases, ought\r\nsurely to be, not so much FROM WHOM the advice comes, as whether the\r\nadvice be GOOD. The sum of what has been here advanced and proved is,\r\nthat the charge against the convention of exceeding their powers,\r\nexcept in one instance little urged by the objectors, has no foundation\r\nto support it; that if they had exceeded their powers, they were not\r\nonly warranted, but required, as the confidential servants of their\r\ncountry, by the circumstances in which they were placed, to exercise\r\nthe liberty which they assume; and that finally, if they had violated\r\nboth their powers and their obligations, in proposing a Constitution,\r\nthis ought nevertheless to be embraced, if it be calculated to\r\naccomplish the views and happiness of the people of America. How far\r\nthis character is due to the Constitution, is the subject under\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] Connecticut and Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n [2] Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XLI.\r\n\r\nGeneral View of the Powers Conferred by The Constitution\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe Constitution proposed by the convention may be considered under two\r\ngeneral points of view. The FIRST relates to the sum or quantity of\r\npower which it vests in the government, including the restraints\r\nimposed on the States. The SECOND, to the particular structure of the\r\ngovernment, and the distribution of this power among its several\r\nbranches. Under the FIRST view of the subject, two important questions\r\narise: 1. Whether any part of the powers transferred to the general\r\ngovernment be unnecessary or improper? 2. Whether the entire mass of\r\nthem be dangerous to the portion of jurisdiction left in the several\r\nStates? Is the aggregate power of the general government greater than\r\nought to have been vested in it? This is the FIRST question. It cannot\r\nhave escaped those who have attended with candor to the arguments\r\nemployed against the extensive powers of the government, that the\r\nauthors of them have very little considered how far these powers were\r\nnecessary means of attaining a necessary end. They have chosen rather\r\nto dwell on the inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended with\r\nall political advantages; and on the possible abuses which must be\r\nincident to every power or trust, of which a beneficial use can be\r\nmade. This method of handling the subject cannot impose on the good\r\nsense of the people of America. It may display the subtlety of the\r\nwriter; it may open a boundless field for rhetoric and declamation; it\r\nmay inflame the passions of the unthinking, and may confirm the\r\nprejudices of the misthinking: but cool and candid people will at once\r\nreflect, that the purest of human blessings must have a portion of\r\nalloy in them; that the choice must always be made, if not of the\r\nlesser evil, at least of the GREATER, not the PERFECT, good; and that\r\nin every political institution, a power to advance the public happiness\r\ninvolves a discretion which may be misapplied and abused. They will\r\nsee, therefore, that in all cases where power is to be conferred, the\r\npoint first to be decided is, whether such a power be necessary to the\r\npublic good; as the next will be, in case of an affirmative decision,\r\nto guard as effectually as possible against a perversion of the power\r\nto the public detriment. That we may form a correct judgment on this\r\nsubject, it will be proper to review the several powers conferred on\r\nthe government of the Union; and that this may be the more conveniently\r\ndone they may be reduced into different classes as they relate to the\r\nfollowing different objects: 1. Security against foreign danger; 2.\r\nRegulation of the intercourse with foreign nations; 3. Maintenance of\r\nharmony and proper intercourse among the States; 4. Certain\r\nmiscellaneous objects of general utility; 5. Restraint of the States\r\nfrom certain injurious acts; 6. Provisions for giving due efficacy to\r\nall these powers. The powers falling within the FIRST class are those\r\nof declaring war and granting letters of marque; of providing armies\r\nand fleets; of regulating and calling forth the militia; of levying and\r\nborrowing money. Security against foreign danger is one of the\r\nprimitive objects of civil society. It is an avowed and essential\r\nobject of the American Union. The powers requisite for attaining it\r\nmust be effectually confided to the federal councils. Is the power of\r\ndeclaring war necessary? No man will answer this question in the\r\nnegative. It would be superfluous, therefore, to enter into a proof of\r\nthe affirmative. The existing Confederation establishes this power in\r\nthe most ample form. Is the power of raising armies and equipping\r\nfleets necessary? This is involved in the foregoing power. It is\r\ninvolved in the power of self-defense. But was it necessary to give an\r\nINDEFINITE POWER of raising TROOPS, as well as providing fleets; and of\r\nmaintaining both in PEACE, as well as in war? The answer to these\r\nquestions has been too far anticipated in another place to admit an\r\nextensive discussion of them in this place. The answer indeed seems to\r\nbe so obvious and conclusive as scarcely to justify such a discussion\r\nin any place. With what color of propriety could the force necessary\r\nfor defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offense?\r\nIf a federal Constitution could chain the ambition or set bounds to the\r\nexertions of all other nations, then indeed might it prudently chain\r\nthe discretion of its own government, and set bounds to the exertions\r\nfor its own safety.\r\n\r\nHow could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely prohibited,\r\nunless we could prohibit, in like manner, the preparations and\r\nestablishments of every hostile nation? The means of security can only\r\nbe regulated by the means and the danger of attack. They will, in fact,\r\nbe ever determined by these rules, and by no others. It is in vain to\r\noppose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation. It\r\nis worse than in vain; because it plants in the Constitution itself\r\nnecessary usurpations of power, every precedent of which is a germ of\r\nunnecessary and multiplied repetitions. If one nation maintains\r\nconstantly a disciplined army, ready for the service of ambition or\r\nrevenge, it obliges the most pacific nations who may be within the\r\nreach of its enterprises to take corresponding precautions.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century was the unhappy epoch of military establishments\r\nin the time of peace. They were introduced by Charles VII. of France.\r\nAll Europe has followed, or been forced into, the example. Had the\r\nexample not been followed by other nations, all Europe must long ago\r\nhave worn the chains of a universal monarch. Were every nation except\r\nFrance now to disband its peace establishments, the same event might\r\nfollow. The veteran legions of Rome were an overmatch for the\r\nundisciplined valor of all other nations and rendered her the mistress\r\nof the world. Not the less true is it, that the liberties of Rome\r\nproved the final victim to her military triumphs; and that the\r\nliberties of Europe, as far as they ever existed, have, with few\r\nexceptions, been the price of her military establishments. A standing\r\nforce, therefore, is a dangerous, at the same time that it may be a\r\nnecessary, provision. On the smallest scale it has its inconveniences.\r\nOn an extensive scale its consequences may be fatal. On any scale it is\r\nan object of laudable circumspection and precaution. A wise nation will\r\ncombine all these considerations; and, whilst it does not rashly\r\npreclude itself from any resource which may become essential to its\r\nsafety, will exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity\r\nand the danger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its\r\nliberties. The clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on the\r\nproposed Constitution. The Union itself, which it cements and secures,\r\ndestroys every pretext for a military establishment which could be\r\ndangerous. America united, with a handful of troops, or without a\r\nsingle soldier, exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition\r\nthan America disunited, with a hundred thousand veterans ready for\r\ncombat. It was remarked, on a former occasion, that the want of this\r\npretext had saved the liberties of one nation in Europe. Being rendered\r\nby her insular situation and her maritime resources impregnable to the\r\narmies of her neighbors, the rulers of Great Britain have never been\r\nable, by real or artificial dangers, to cheat the public into an\r\nextensive peace establishment. The distance of the United States from\r\nthe powerful nations of the world gives them the same happy security. A\r\ndangerous establishment can never be necessary or plausible, so long as\r\nthey continue a united people. But let it never, for a moment, be\r\nforgotten that they are indebted for this advantage to the Union alone.\r\nThe moment of its dissolution will be the date of a new order of\r\nthings. The fears of the weaker, or the ambition of the stronger\r\nStates, or Confederacies, will set the same example in the New, as\r\nCharles VII. did in the Old World. The example will be followed here\r\nfrom the same motives which produced universal imitation there. Instead\r\nof deriving from our situation the precious advantage which Great\r\nBritain has derived from hers, the face of America will be but a copy\r\nof that of the continent of Europe. It will present liberty everywhere\r\ncrushed between standing armies and perpetual taxes. The fortunes of\r\ndisunited America will be even more disastrous than those of Europe.\r\nThe sources of evil in the latter are confined to her own limits. No\r\nsuperior powers of another quarter of the globe intrigue among her\r\nrival nations, inflame their mutual animosities, and render them the\r\ninstruments of foreign ambition, jealousy, and revenge. In America the\r\nmiseries springing from her internal jealousies, contentions, and wars,\r\nwould form a part only of her lot. A plentiful addition of evils would\r\nhave their source in that relation in which Europe stands to this\r\nquarter of the earth, and which no other quarter of the earth bears to\r\nEurope. This picture of the consequences of disunion cannot be too\r\nhighly colored, or too often exhibited. Every man who loves peace,\r\nevery man who loves his country, every man who loves liberty, ought to\r\nhave it ever before his eyes, that he may cherish in his heart a due\r\nattachment to the Union of America, and be able to set a due value on\r\nthe means of preserving it.\r\n\r\nNext to the effectual establishment of the Union, the best possible\r\nprecaution against danger from standing armies is a limitation of the\r\nterm for which revenue may be appropriated to their support. This\r\nprecaution the Constitution has prudently added. I will not repeat here\r\nthe observations which I flatter myself have placed this subject in a\r\njust and satisfactory light. But it may not be improper to take notice\r\nof an argument against this part of the Constitution, which has been\r\ndrawn from the policy and practice of Great Britain. It is said that\r\nthe continuance of an army in that kingdom requires an annual vote of\r\nthe legislature; whereas the American Constitution has lengthened this\r\ncritical period to two years. This is the form in which the comparison\r\nis usually stated to the public: but is it a just form? Is it a fair\r\ncomparison? Does the British Constitution restrain the parliamentary\r\ndiscretion to one year? Does the American impose on the Congress\r\nappropriations for two years? On the contrary, it cannot be unknown to\r\nthe authors of the fallacy themselves, that the British Constitution\r\nfixes no limit whatever to the discretion of the legislature, and that\r\nthe American ties down the legislature to two years, as the longest\r\nadmissible term. Had the argument from the British example been truly\r\nstated, it would have stood thus: The term for which supplies may be\r\nappropriated to the army establishment, though unlimited by the British\r\nConstitution, has nevertheless, in practice, been limited by\r\nparliamentary discretion to a single year. Now, if in Great Britain,\r\nwhere the House of Commons is elected for seven years; where so great a\r\nproportion of the members are elected by so small a proportion of the\r\npeople; where the electors are so corrupted by the representatives, and\r\nthe representatives so corrupted by the Crown, the representative body\r\ncan possess a power to make appropriations to the army for an\r\nindefinite term, without desiring, or without daring, to extend the\r\nterm beyond a single year, ought not suspicion herself to blush, in\r\npretending that the representatives of the United States, elected\r\nFREELY by the WHOLE BODY of the people, every SECOND YEAR, cannot be\r\nsafely intrusted with the discretion over such appropriations,\r\nexpressly limited to the short period of TWO YEARS? A bad cause seldom\r\nfails to betray itself. Of this truth, the management of the opposition\r\nto the federal government is an unvaried exemplification. But among all\r\nthe blunders which have been committed, none is more striking than the\r\nattempt to enlist on that side the prudent jealousy entertained by the\r\npeople, of standing armies. The attempt has awakened fully the public\r\nattention to that important subject; and has led to investigations\r\nwhich must terminate in a thorough and universal conviction, not only\r\nthat the constitution has provided the most effectual guards against\r\ndanger from that quarter, but that nothing short of a Constitution\r\nfully adequate to the national defense and the preservation of the\r\nUnion, can save America from as many standing armies as it may be split\r\ninto States or Confederacies, and from such a progressive augmentation,\r\nof these establishments in each, as will render them as burdensome to\r\nthe properties and ominous to the liberties of the people, as any\r\nestablishment that can become necessary, under a united and efficient\r\ngovernment, must be tolerable to the former and safe to the latter. The\r\npalpable necessity of the power to provide and maintain a navy has\r\nprotected that part of the Constitution against a spirit of censure,\r\nwhich has spared few other parts. It must, indeed, be numbered among\r\nthe greatest blessings of America, that as her Union will be the only\r\nsource of her maritime strength, so this will be a principal source of\r\nher security against danger from abroad. In this respect our situation\r\nbears another likeness to the insular advantage of Great Britain. The\r\nbatteries most capable of repelling foreign enterprises on our safety,\r\nare happily such as can never be turned by a perfidious government\r\nagainst our liberties. The inhabitants of the Atlantic frontier are all\r\nof them deeply interested in this provision for naval protection, and\r\nif they have hitherto been suffered to sleep quietly in their beds; if\r\ntheir property has remained safe against the predatory spirit of\r\nlicentious adventurers; if their maritime towns have not yet been\r\ncompelled to ransom themselves from the terrors of a conflagration, by\r\nyielding to the exactions of daring and sudden invaders, these\r\ninstances of good fortune are not to be ascribed to the capacity of the\r\nexisting government for the protection of those from whom it claims\r\nallegiance, but to causes that are fugitive and fallacious. If we\r\nexcept perhaps Virginia and Maryland, which are peculiarly vulnerable\r\non their eastern frontiers, no part of the Union ought to feel more\r\nanxiety on this subject than New York. Her seacoast is extensive. A\r\nvery important district of the State is an island. The State itself is\r\npenetrated by a large navigable river for more than fifty leagues. The\r\ngreat emporium of its commerce, the great reservoir of its wealth, lies\r\nevery moment at the mercy of events, and may almost be regarded as a\r\nhostage for ignominious compliances with the dictates of a foreign\r\nenemy, or even with the rapacious demands of pirates and barbarians.\r\nShould a war be the result of the precarious situation of European\r\naffairs, and all the unruly passions attending it be let loose on the\r\nocean, our escape from insults and depredations, not only on that\r\nelement, but every part of the other bordering on it, will be truly\r\nmiraculous. In the present condition of America, the States more\r\nimmediately exposed to these calamities have nothing to hope from the\r\nphantom of a general government which now exists; and if their single\r\nresources were equal to the task of fortifying themselves against the\r\ndanger, the object to be protected would be almost consumed by the\r\nmeans of protecting them. The power of regulating and calling forth the\r\nmilitia has been already sufficiently vindicated and explained. The\r\npower of levying and borrowing money, being the sinew of that which is\r\nto be exerted in the national defense, is properly thrown into the same\r\nclass with it. This power, also, has been examined already with much\r\nattention, and has, I trust, been clearly shown to be necessary, both\r\nin the extent and form given to it by the Constitution. I will address\r\none additional reflection only to those who contend that the power\r\nought to have been restrained to external taxation by which they mean,\r\ntaxes on articles imported from other countries. It cannot be doubted\r\nthat this will always be a valuable source of revenue; that for a\r\nconsiderable time it must be a principal source; that at this moment it\r\nis an essential one. But we may form very mistaken ideas on this\r\nsubject, if we do not call to mind in our calculations, that the extent\r\nof revenue drawn from foreign commerce must vary with the variations,\r\nboth in the extent and the kind of imports; and that these variations\r\ndo not correspond with the progress of population, which must be the\r\ngeneral measure of the public wants. As long as agriculture continues\r\nthe sole field of labor, the importation of manufactures must increase\r\nas the consumers multiply. As soon as domestic manufactures are begun\r\nby the hands not called for by agriculture, the imported manufactures\r\nwill decrease as the numbers of people increase. In a more remote\r\nstage, the imports may consist in a considerable part of raw materials,\r\nwhich will be wrought into articles for exportation, and will,\r\ntherefore, require rather the encouragement of bounties, than to be\r\nloaded with discouraging duties. A system of government, meant for\r\nduration, ought to contemplate these revolutions, and be able to\r\naccommodate itself to them. Some, who have not denied the necessity of\r\nthe power of taxation, have grounded a very fierce attack against the\r\nConstitution, on the language in which it is defined. It has been urged\r\nand echoed, that the power “to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts,\r\nand excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense and\r\ngeneral welfare of the United States,” amounts to an unlimited\r\ncommission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary\r\nfor the common defense or general welfare. No stronger proof could be\r\ngiven of the distress under which these writers labor for objections,\r\nthan their stooping to such a misconstruction. Had no other enumeration\r\nor definition of the powers of the Congress been found in the\r\nConstitution, than the general expressions just cited, the authors of\r\nthe objection might have had some color for it; though it would have\r\nbeen difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing an\r\nauthority to legislate in all possible cases. A power to destroy the\r\nfreedom of the press, the trial by jury, or even to regulate the course\r\nof descents, or the forms of conveyances, must be very singularly\r\nexpressed by the terms “to raise money for the general welfare. “But\r\nwhat color can the objection have, when a specification of the objects\r\nalluded to by these general terms immediately follows, and is not even\r\nseparated by a longer pause than a semicolon? If the different parts of\r\nthe same instrument ought to be so expounded, as to give meaning to\r\nevery part which will bear it, shall one part of the same sentence be\r\nexcluded altogether from a share in the meaning; and shall the more\r\ndoubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent, and the\r\nclear and precise expressions be denied any signification whatsoever?\r\nFor what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be\r\ninserted, if these and all others were meant to be included in the\r\npreceding general power? Nothing is more natural nor common than first\r\nto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\r\nrecital of particulars. But the idea of an enumeration of particulars\r\nwhich neither explain nor qualify the general meaning, and can have no\r\nother effect than to confound and mislead, is an absurdity, which, as\r\nwe are reduced to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the\r\nobjection or on the authors of the Constitution, we must take the\r\nliberty of supposing, had not its origin with the latter. The objection\r\nhere is the more extraordinary, as it appears that the language used by\r\nthe convention is a copy from the articles of Confederation. The\r\nobjects of the Union among the States, as described in article third,\r\nare “their common defense, security of their liberties, and mutual and\r\ngeneral welfare. “ The terms of article eighth are still more\r\nidentical: “All charges of war and all other expenses that shall be\r\nincurred for the common defense or general welfare, and allowed by the\r\nUnited States in Congress, shall be defrayed out of a common treasury,”\r\netc. A similar language again occurs in article ninth. Construe either\r\nof these articles by the rules which would justify the construction put\r\non the new Constitution, and they vest in the existing Congress a power\r\nto legislate in all cases whatsoever.\r\n\r\nBut what would have been thought of that assembly, if, attaching\r\nthemselves to these general expressions, and disregarding the\r\nspecifications which ascertain and limit their import, they had\r\nexercised an unlimited power of providing for the common defense and\r\ngeneral welfare? I appeal to the objectors themselves, whether they\r\nwould in that case have employed the same reasoning in justification of\r\nCongress as they now make use of against the convention. How difficult\r\nit is for error to escape its own condemnation!\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XLII.\r\n\r\nThe Powers Conferred by the Constitution Further Considered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, January 22, 1788.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe second class of powers, lodged in the general government, consists\r\nof those which regulate the intercourse with foreign nations, to wit:\r\nto make treaties; to send and receive ambassadors, other public\r\nministers, and consuls; to define and punish piracies and felonies\r\ncommitted on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations; to\r\nregulate foreign commerce, including a power to prohibit, after the\r\nyear 1808, the importation of slaves, and to lay an intermediate duty\r\nof ten dollars per head, as a discouragement to such importations. This\r\nclass of powers forms an obvious and essential branch of the federal\r\nadministration. If we are to be one nation in any respect, it clearly\r\nought to be in respect to other nations. The powers to make treaties\r\nand to send and receive ambassadors, speak their own propriety. Both of\r\nthem are comprised in the articles of Confederation, with this\r\ndifference only, that the former is disembarrassed, by the plan of the\r\nconvention, of an exception, under which treaties might be\r\nsubstantially frustrated by regulations of the States; and that a power\r\nof appointing and receiving “other public ministers and consuls,” is\r\nexpressly and very properly added to the former provision concerning\r\nambassadors. The term ambassador, if taken strictly, as seems to be\r\nrequired by the second of the articles of Confederation, comprehends\r\nthe highest grade only of public ministers, and excludes the grades\r\nwhich the United States will be most likely to prefer, where foreign\r\nembassies may be necessary. And under no latitude of construction will\r\nthe term comprehend consuls. Yet it has been found expedient, and has\r\nbeen the practice of Congress, to employ the inferior grades of public\r\nministers, and to send and receive consuls. It is true, that where\r\ntreaties of commerce stipulate for the mutual appointment of consuls,\r\nwhose functions are connected with commerce, the admission of foreign\r\nconsuls may fall within the power of making commercial treaties; and\r\nthat where no such treaties exist, the mission of American consuls into\r\nforeign countries may PERHAPS be covered under the authority, given by\r\nthe ninth article of the Confederation, to appoint all such civil\r\nofficers as may be necessary for managing the general affairs of the\r\nUnited States. But the admission of consuls into the United States,\r\nwhere no previous treaty has stipulated it, seems to have been nowhere\r\nprovided for. A supply of the omission is one of the lesser instances\r\nin which the convention have improved on the model before them. But the\r\nmost minute provisions become important when they tend to obviate the\r\nnecessity or the pretext for gradual and unobserved usurpations of\r\npower. A list of the cases in which Congress have been betrayed, or\r\nforced by the defects of the Confederation, into violations of their\r\nchartered authorities, would not a little surprise those who have paid\r\nno attention to the subject; and would be no inconsiderable argument in\r\nfavor of the new Constitution, which seems to have provided no less\r\nstudiously for the lesser, than the more obvious and striking defects\r\nof the old. The power to define and punish piracies and felonies\r\ncommitted on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations,\r\nbelongs with equal propriety to the general government, and is a still\r\ngreater improvement on the articles of Confederation. These articles\r\ncontain no provision for the case of offenses against the law of\r\nnations; and consequently leave it in the power of any indiscreet\r\nmember to embroil the Confederacy with foreign nations. The provision\r\nof the federal articles on the subject of piracies and felonies extends\r\nno further than to the establishment of courts for the trial of these\r\noffenses. The definition of piracies might, perhaps, without\r\ninconveniency, be left to the law of nations; though a legislative\r\ndefinition of them is found in most municipal codes.\r\n\r\nA definition of felonies on the high seas is evidently requisite.\r\nFelony is a term of loose signification, even in the common law of\r\nEngland; and of various import in the statute law of that kingdom. But\r\nneither the common nor the statute law of that, or of any other nation,\r\nought to be a standard for the proceedings of this, unless previously\r\nmade its own by legislative adoption. The meaning of the term, as\r\ndefined in the codes of the several States, would be as impracticable\r\nas the former would be a dishonorable and illegitimate guide. It is not\r\nprecisely the same in any two of the States; and varies in each with\r\nevery revision of its criminal laws. For the sake of certainty and\r\nuniformity, therefore, the power of defining felonies in this case was\r\nin every respect necessary and proper.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of foreign commerce, having fallen within several views\r\nwhich have been taken of this subject, has been too fully discussed to\r\nneed additional proofs here of its being properly submitted to the\r\nfederal administration. It were doubtless to be wished, that the power\r\nof prohibiting the importation of slaves had not been postponed until\r\nthe year 1808, or rather that it had been suffered to have immediate\r\noperation. But it is not difficult to account, either for this\r\nrestriction on the general government, or for the manner in which the\r\nwhole clause is expressed. It ought to be considered as a great point\r\ngained in favor of humanity, that a period of twenty years may\r\nterminate forever, within these States, a traffic which has so long and\r\nso loudly upbraided the barbarism of modern policy; that within that\r\nperiod, it will receive a considerable discouragement from the federal\r\ngovernment, and may be totally abolished, by a concurrence of the few\r\nStates which continue the unnatural traffic, in the prohibitory example\r\nwhich has been given by so great a majority of the Union. Happy would\r\nit be for the unfortunate Africans, if an equal prospect lay before\r\nthem of being redeemed from the oppressions of their European brethren!\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection\r\nagainst the Constitution, by representing it on one side as a criminal\r\ntoleration of an illicit practice, and on another as calculated to\r\nprevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from Europe to America. I\r\nmention these misconstructions, not with a view to give them an answer,\r\nfor they deserve none, but as specimens of the manner and spirit in\r\nwhich some have thought fit to conduct their opposition to the proposed\r\ngovernment. The powers included in the THIRD class are those which\r\nprovide for the harmony and proper intercourse among the States. Under\r\nthis head might be included the particular restraints imposed on the\r\nauthority of the States, and certain powers of the judicial department;\r\nbut the former are reserved for a distinct class, and the latter will\r\nbe particularly examined when we arrive at the structure and\r\norganization of the government. I shall confine myself to a cursory\r\nreview of the remaining powers comprehended under this third\r\ndescription, to wit: to regulate commerce among the several States and\r\nthe Indian tribes; to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of\r\nforeign coin; to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the\r\ncurrent coin and secureties of the United States; to fix the standard\r\nof weights and measures; to establish a uniform rule of naturalization,\r\nand uniform laws of bankruptcy, to prescribe the manner in which the\r\npublic acts, records, and judicial proceedings of each State shall be\r\nproved, and the effect they shall have in other States; and to\r\nestablish post offices and post roads. The defect of power in the\r\nexisting Confederacy to regulate the commerce between its several\r\nmembers, is in the number of those which have been clearly pointed out\r\nby experience. To the proofs and remarks which former papers have\r\nbrought into view on this subject, it may be added that without this\r\nsupplemental provision, the great and essential power of regulating\r\nforeign commerce would have been incomplete and ineffectual. A very\r\nmaterial object of this power was the relief of the States which import\r\nand export through other States, from the improper contributions levied\r\non them by the latter. Were these at liberty to regulate the trade\r\nbetween State and State, it must be foreseen that ways would be found\r\nout to load the articles of import and export, during the passage\r\nthrough their jurisdiction, with duties which would fall on the makers\r\nof the latter and the consumers of the former. We may be assured by\r\npast experience, that such a practice would be introduced by future\r\ncontrivances; and both by that and a common knowledge of human affairs,\r\nthat it would nourish unceasing animosities, and not improbably\r\nterminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquillity. To those\r\nwho do not view the question through the medium of passion or of\r\ninterest, the desire of the commercial States to collect, in any form,\r\nan indirect revenue from their uncommercial neighbors, must appear not\r\nless impolitic than it is unfair; since it would stimulate the injured\r\nparty, by resentment as well as interest, to resort to less convenient\r\nchannels for their foreign trade. But the mild voice of reason,\r\npleading the cause of an enlarged and permanent interest, is but too\r\noften drowned, before public bodies as well as individuals, by the\r\nclamors of an impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate gain. The\r\nnecessity of a superintending authority over the reciprocal trade of\r\nconfederated States, has been illustrated by other examples as well as\r\nour own. In Switzerland, where the Union is so very slight, each canton\r\nis obliged to allow to merchandises a passage through its jurisdiction\r\ninto other cantons, without an augmentation of the tolls. In Germany it\r\nis a law of the empire, that the princes and states shall not lay tolls\r\nor customs on bridges, rivers, or passages, without the consent of the\r\nemperor and the diet; though it appears from a quotation in an\r\nantecedent paper, that the practice in this, as in many other instances\r\nin that confederacy, has not followed the law, and has produced there\r\nthe mischiefs which have been foreseen here. Among the restraints\r\nimposed by the Union of the Netherlands on its members, one is, that\r\nthey shall not establish imposts disadvantageous to their neighbors,\r\nwithout the general permission. The regulation of commerce with the\r\nIndian tribes is very properly unfettered from two limitations in the\r\narticles of Confederation, which render the provision obscure and\r\ncontradictory. The power is there restrained to Indians, not members of\r\nany of the States, and is not to violate or infringe the legislative\r\nright of any State within its own limits. What description of Indians\r\nare to be deemed members of a State, is not yet settled, and has been a\r\nquestion of frequent perplexity and contention in the federal councils.\r\nAnd how the trade with Indians, though not members of a State, yet\r\nresiding within its legislative jurisdiction, can be regulated by an\r\nexternal authority, without so far intruding on the internal rights of\r\nlegislation, is absolutely incomprehensible. This is not the only case\r\nin which the articles of Confederation have inconsiderately endeavored\r\nto accomplish impossibilities; to reconcile a partial sovereignty in\r\nthe Union, with complete sovereignty in the States; to subvert a\r\nmathematical axiom, by taking away a part, and letting the whole\r\nremain. All that need be remarked on the power to coin money, regulate\r\nthe value thereof, and of foreign coin, is, that by providing for this\r\nlast case, the Constitution has supplied a material omission in the\r\narticles of Confederation. The authority of the existing Congress is\r\nrestrained to the regulation of coin STRUCK by their own authority, or\r\nthat of the respective States. It must be seen at once that the\r\nproposed uniformity in the VALUE of the current coin might be destroyed\r\nby subjecting that of foreign coin to the different regulations of the\r\ndifferent States. The punishment of counterfeiting the public\r\nsecurities, as well as the current coin, is submitted of course to that\r\nauthority which is to secure the value of both. The regulation of\r\nweights and measures is transferred from the articles of Confederation,\r\nand is founded on like considerations with the preceding power of\r\nregulating coin.\r\n\r\nThe dissimilarity in the rules of naturalization has long been remarked\r\nas a fault in our system, and as laying a foundation for intricate and\r\ndelicate questions. In the fourth article of the Confederation, it is\r\ndeclared “that the FREE INHABITANTS of each of these States, paupers,\r\nvagabonds, and fugitives from justice, excepted, shall be entitled to\r\nall privileges and immunities of FREE CITIZENS in the several States;\r\nand THE PEOPLE of each State shall, in every other, enjoy all the\r\nprivileges of trade and commerce,” etc. There is a confusion of\r\nlanguage here, which is remarkable. Why the terms FREE INHABITANTS are\r\nused in one part of the article, FREE CITIZENS in another, and PEOPLE\r\nin another; or what was meant by superadding to “all privileges and\r\nimmunities of free citizens,” “all the privileges of trade and\r\ncommerce,” cannot easily be determined. It seems to be a construction\r\nscarcely avoidable, however, that those who come under the denomination\r\nof FREE INHABITANTS of a State, although not citizens of such State,\r\nare entitled, in every other State, to all the privileges of FREE\r\nCITIZENS of the latter; that is, to greater privileges than they may be\r\nentitled to in their own State: so that it may be in the power of a\r\nparticular State, or rather every State is laid under a necessity, not\r\nonly to confer the rights of citizenship in other States upon any whom\r\nit may admit to such rights within itself, but upon any whom it may\r\nallow to become inhabitants within its jurisdiction. But were an\r\nexposition of the term “inhabitants” to be admitted which would confine\r\nthe stipulated privileges to citizens alone, the difficulty is\r\ndiminished only, not removed. The very improper power would still be\r\nretained by each State, of naturalizing aliens in every other State. In\r\none State, residence for a short term confirms all the rights of\r\ncitizenship: in another, qualifications of greater importance are\r\nrequired. An alien, therefore, legally incapacitated for certain rights\r\nin the latter, may, by previous residence only in the former, elude his\r\nincapacity; and thus the law of one State be preposterously rendered\r\nparamount to the law of another, within the jurisdiction of the other.\r\nWe owe it to mere casualty, that very serious embarrassments on this\r\nsubject have been hitherto escaped. By the laws of several States,\r\ncertain descriptions of aliens, who had rendered themselves obnoxious,\r\nwere laid under interdicts inconsistent not only with the rights of\r\ncitizenship but with the privilege of residence. What would have been\r\nthe consequence, if such persons, by residence or otherwise, had\r\nacquired the character of citizens under the laws of another State, and\r\nthen asserted their rights as such, both to residence and citizenship,\r\nwithin the State proscribing them? Whatever the legal consequences\r\nmight have been, other consequences would probably have resulted, of\r\ntoo serious a nature not to be provided against. The new Constitution\r\nhas accordingly, with great propriety, made provision against them, and\r\nall others proceeding from the defect of the Confederation on this\r\nhead, by authorizing the general government to establish a uniform rule\r\nof naturalization throughout the United States. The power of\r\nestablishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is so intimately connected with\r\nthe regulation of commerce, and will prevent so many frauds where the\r\nparties or their property may lie or be removed into different States,\r\nthat the expediency of it seems not likely to be drawn into question.\r\nThe power of prescribing by general laws, the manner in which the\r\npublic acts, records and judicial proceedings of each State shall be\r\nproved, and the effect they shall have in other States, is an evident\r\nand valuable improvement on the clause relating to this subject in the\r\narticles of Confederation. The meaning of the latter is extremely\r\nindeterminate, and can be of little importance under any interpretation\r\nwhich it will bear. The power here established may be rendered a very\r\nconvenient instrument of justice, and be particularly beneficial on the\r\nborders of contiguous States, where the effects liable to justice may\r\nbe suddenly and secretly translated, in any stage of the process,\r\nwithin a foreign jurisdiction. The power of establishing post roads\r\nmust, in every view, be a harmless power, and may, perhaps, by\r\njudicious management, become productive of great public conveniency.\r\n\r\nNothing which tends to facilitate the intercourse between the States\r\ncan be deemed unworthy of the public care.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XLIII.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued (The Powers Conferred by the Constitution\r\nFurther Considered)\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe fourth class comprises the following miscellaneous powers:1. A\r\npower “to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing,\r\nfor a limited time, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to\r\ntheir respective writings and discoveries. “The utility of this power\r\nwill scarcely be questioned. The copyright of authors has been solemnly\r\nadjudged, in Great Britain, to be a right of common law. The right to\r\nuseful inventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors.\r\n\r\nThe public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of\r\nindividuals. The States cannot separately make effectual provisions for\r\neither of the cases, and most of them have anticipated the decision of\r\nthis point, by laws passed at the instance of Congress. 2. “To exercise\r\nexclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over such district (not\r\nexceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular States and\r\nthe acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the\r\nUnited States; and to exercise like authority over all places purchased\r\nby the consent of the legislatures of the States in which the same\r\nshall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards,\r\nand other needful buildings. “The indispensable necessity of complete\r\nauthority at the seat of government, carries its own evidence with it.\r\nIt is a power exercised by every legislature of the Union, I might say\r\nof the world, by virtue of its general supremacy. Without it, not only\r\nthe public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted\r\nwith impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general\r\ngovernment on the State comprehending the seat of the government, for\r\nprotection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national\r\ncouncils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the\r\ngovernment and dissatisfactory to the other members of the Confederacy.\r\nThis consideration has the more weight, as the gradual accumulation of\r\npublic improvements at the stationary residence of the government would\r\nbe both too great a public pledge to be left in the hands of a single\r\nState, and would create so many obstacles to a removal of the\r\ngovernment, as still further to abridge its necessary independence. The\r\nextent of this federal district is sufficiently circumscribed to\r\nsatisfy every jealousy of an opposite nature. And as it is to be\r\nappropriated to this use with the consent of the State ceding it; as\r\nthe State will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights and the\r\nconsent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the inhabitants will find\r\nsufficient inducements of interest to become willing parties to the\r\ncession; as they will have had their voice in the election of the\r\ngovernment which is to exercise authority over them; as a municipal\r\nlegislature for local purposes, derived from their own suffrages, will\r\nof course be allowed them; and as the authority of the legislature of\r\nthe State, and of the inhabitants of the ceded part of it, to concur in\r\nthe cession, will be derived from the whole people of the State in\r\ntheir adoption of the Constitution, every imaginable objection seems to\r\nbe obviated. The necessity of a like authority over forts, magazines,\r\netc., established by the general government, is not less evident. The\r\npublic money expended on such places, and the public property deposited\r\nin them, requires that they should be exempt from the authority of the\r\nparticular State. Nor would it be proper for the places on which the\r\nsecurity of the entire Union may depend, to be in any degree dependent\r\non a particular member of it. All objections and scruples are here also\r\nobviated, by requiring the concurrence of the States concerned, in\r\nevery such establishment. 3. “To declare the punishment of treason, but\r\nno attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture,\r\nexcept during the life of the person attained. “As treason may be\r\ncommitted against the United States, the authority of the United States\r\nought to be enabled to punish it. But as new-fangled and artificial\r\ntreasons have been the great engines by which violent factions, the\r\nnatural offspring of free government, have usually wreaked their\r\nalternate malignity on each other, the convention have, with great\r\njudgment, opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a\r\nconstitutional definition of the crime, fixing the proof necessary for\r\nconviction of it, and restraining the Congress, even in punishing it,\r\nfrom extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of its\r\nauthor. 4. “To admit new States into the Union; but no new State shall\r\nbe formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other State; nor\r\nany State be formed by the junction of two or more States, or parts of\r\nStates, without the consent of the legislatures of the States\r\nconcerned, as well as of the Congress. “In the articles of\r\nConfederation, no provision is found on this important subject. Canada\r\nwas to be admitted of right, on her joining in the measures of the\r\nUnited States; and the other COLONIES, by which were evidently meant\r\nthe other British colonies, at the discretion of nine States. The\r\neventual establishment of NEW STATES seems to have been overlooked by\r\nthe compilers of that instrument. We have seen the inconvenience of\r\nthis omission, and the assumption of power into which Congress have\r\nbeen led by it. With great propriety, therefore, has the new system\r\nsupplied the defect. The general precaution, that no new States shall\r\nbe formed, without the concurrence of the federal authority, and that\r\nof the States concerned, is consonant to the principles which ought to\r\ngovern such transactions. The particular precaution against the\r\nerection of new States, by the partition of a State without its\r\nconsent, quiets the jealousy of the larger States; as that of the\r\nsmaller is quieted by a like precaution, against a junction of States\r\nwithout their consent. 5. “To dispose of and make all needful rules and\r\nregulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the\r\nUnited States, with a proviso, that nothing in the Constitution shall\r\nbe so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of\r\nany particular State. “This is a power of very great importance, and\r\nrequired by considerations similar to those which show the propriety of\r\nthe former. The proviso annexed is proper in itself, and was probably\r\nrendered absolutely necessary by jealousies and questions concerning\r\nthe Western territory sufficiently known to the public. 6. “To\r\nguarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of government;\r\nto protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the\r\nlegislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be\r\nconvened), against domestic violence. “In a confederacy founded on\r\nrepublican principles, and composed of republican members, the\r\nsuperintending government ought clearly to possess authority to defend\r\nthe system against aristocratic or monarchial innovations. The more\r\nintimate the nature of such a union may be, the greater interest have\r\nthe members in the political institutions of each other; and the\r\ngreater right to insist that the forms of government under which the\r\ncompact was entered into should be SUBSTANTIALLY maintained. But a\r\nright implies a remedy; and where else could the remedy be deposited,\r\nthan where it is deposited by the Constitution? Governments of\r\ndissimilar principles and forms have been found less adapted to a\r\nfederal coalition of any sort, than those of a kindred nature. “As the\r\nconfederate republic of Germany,” says Montesquieu, “consists of free\r\ncities and petty states, subject to different princes, experience shows\r\nus that it is more imperfect than that of Holland and Switzerland. “\r\n“Greece was undone,” he adds, “as soon as the king of Macedon obtained\r\na seat among the Amphictyons. “ In the latter case, no doubt, the\r\ndisproportionate force, as well as the monarchical form, of the new\r\nconfederate, had its share of influence on the events. It may possibly\r\nbe asked, what need there could be of such a precaution, and whether it\r\nmay not become a pretext for alterations in the State governments,\r\nwithout the concurrence of the States themselves. These questions admit\r\nof ready answers. If the interposition of the general government should\r\nnot be needed, the provision for such an event will be a harmless\r\nsuperfluity only in the Constitution. But who can say what experiments\r\nmay be produced by the caprice of particular States, by the ambition of\r\nenterprising leaders, or by the intrigues and influence of foreign\r\npowers? To the second question it may be answered, that if the general\r\ngovernment should interpose by virtue of this constitutional authority,\r\nit will be, of course, bound to pursue the authority. But the authority\r\nextends no further than to a GUARANTY of a republican form of\r\ngovernment, which supposes a pre-existing government of the form which\r\nis to be guaranteed. As long, therefore, as the existing republican\r\nforms are continued by the States, they are guaranteed by the federal\r\nConstitution. Whenever the States may choose to substitute other\r\nrepublican forms, they have a right to do so, and to claim the federal\r\nguaranty for the latter. The only restriction imposed on them is, that\r\nthey shall not exchange republican for antirepublican Constitutions; a\r\nrestriction which, it is presumed, will hardly be considered as a\r\ngrievance.\r\n\r\nA protection against invasion is due from every society to the parts\r\ncomposing it. The latitude of the expression here used seems to secure\r\neach State, not only against foreign hostility, but against ambitious\r\nor vindictive enterprises of its more powerful neighbors. The history,\r\nboth of ancient and modern confederacies, proves that the weaker\r\nmembers of the union ought not to be insensible to the policy of this\r\narticle. Protection against domestic violence is added with equal\r\npropriety. It has been remarked, that even among the Swiss cantons,\r\nwhich, properly speaking, are not under one government, provision is\r\nmade for this object; and the history of that league informs us that\r\nmutual aid is frequently claimed and afforded; and as well by the most\r\ndemocratic, as the other cantons. A recent and well-known event among\r\nourselves has warned us to be prepared for emergencies of a like\r\nnature. At first view, it might seem not to square with the republican\r\ntheory, to suppose, either that a majority have not the right, or that\r\na minority will have the force, to subvert a government; and\r\nconsequently, that the federal interposition can never be required, but\r\nwhen it would be improper. But theoretic reasoning, in this as in most\r\nother cases, must be qualified by the lessons of practice. Why may not\r\nillicit combinations, for purposes of violence, be formed as well by a\r\nmajority of a State, especially a small State as by a majority of a\r\ncounty, or a district of the same State; and if the authority of the\r\nState ought, in the latter case, to protect the local magistracy, ought\r\nnot the federal authority, in the former, to support the State\r\nauthority? Besides, there are certain parts of the State constitutions\r\nwhich are so interwoven with the federal Constitution, that a violent\r\nblow cannot be given to the one without communicating the wound to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nInsurrections in a State will rarely induce a federal interposition,\r\nunless the number concerned in them bear some proportion to the friends\r\nof government. It will be much better that the violence in such cases\r\nshould be repressed by the superintending power, than that the majority\r\nshould be left to maintain their cause by a bloody and obstinate\r\ncontest. The existence of a right to interpose, will generally prevent\r\nthe necessity of exerting it. Is it true that force and right are\r\nnecessarily on the same side in republican governments? May not the\r\nminor party possess such a superiority of pecuniary resources, of\r\nmilitary talents and experience, or of secret succors from foreign\r\npowers, as will render it superior also in an appeal to the sword? May\r\nnot a more compact and advantageous position turn the scale on the same\r\nside, against a superior number so situated as to be less capable of a\r\nprompt and collected exertion of its strength? Nothing can be more\r\nchimerical than to imagine that in a trial of actual force, victory may\r\nbe calculated by the rules which prevail in a census of the\r\ninhabitants, or which determine the event of an election!\r\n\r\nMay it not happen, in fine, that the minority of CITIZENS may become a\r\nmajority of PERSONS, by the accession of alien residents, of a casual\r\nconcourse of adventurers, or of those whom the constitution of the\r\nState has not admitted to the rights of suffrage? I take no notice of\r\nan unhappy species of population abounding in some of the States, who,\r\nduring the calm of regular government, are sunk below the level of men;\r\nbut who, in the tempestuous scenes of civil violence, may emerge into\r\nthe human character, and give a superiority of strength to any party\r\nwith which they may associate themselves. In cases where it may be\r\ndoubtful on which side justice lies, what better umpires could be\r\ndesired by two violent factions, flying to arms, and tearing a State to\r\npieces, than the representatives of confederate States, not heated by\r\nthe local flame? To the impartiality of judges, they would unite the\r\naffection of friends. Happy would it be if such a remedy for its\r\ninfirmities could be enjoyed by all free governments; if a project\r\nequally effectual could be established for the universal peace of\r\nmankind! Should it be asked, what is to be the redress for an\r\ninsurrection pervading all the States, and comprising a superiority of\r\nthe entire force, though not a constitutional right? the answer must\r\nbe, that such a case, as it would be without the compass of human\r\nremedies, so it is fortunately not within the compass of human\r\nprobability; and that it is a sufficient recommendation of the federal\r\nConstitution, that it diminishes the risk of a calamity for which no\r\npossible constitution can provide a cure. Among the advantages of a\r\nconfederate republic enumerated by Montesquieu, an important one is,\r\n“that should a popular insurrection happen in one of the States, the\r\nothers are able to quell it. Should abuses creep into one part, they\r\nare reformed by those that remain sound. “7. “To consider all debts\r\ncontracted, and engagements entered into, before the adoption of this\r\nConstitution, as being no less valid against the United States, under\r\nthis Constitution, than under the Confederation. “This can only be\r\nconsidered as a declaratory proposition; and may have been inserted,\r\namong other reasons, for the satisfaction of the foreign creditors of\r\nthe United States, who cannot be strangers to the pretended doctrine,\r\nthat a change in the political form of civil society has the magical\r\neffect of dissolving its moral obligations. Among the lesser criticisms\r\nwhich have been exercised on the Constitution, it has been remarked\r\nthat the validity of engagements ought to have been asserted in favor\r\nof the United States, as well as against them; and in the spirit which\r\nusually characterizes little critics, the omission has been transformed\r\nand magnified into a plot against the national rights. The authors of\r\nthis discovery may be told, what few others need to be informed of,\r\nthat as engagements are in their nature reciprocal, an assertion of\r\ntheir validity on one side, necessarily involves a validity on the\r\nother side; and that as the article is merely declaratory, the\r\nestablishment of the principle in one case is sufficient for every\r\ncase. They may be further told, that every constitution must limit its\r\nprecautions to dangers that are not altogether imaginary; and that no\r\nreal danger can exist that the government would DARE, with, or even\r\nwithout, this constitutional declaration before it, to remit the debts\r\njustly due to the public, on the pretext here condemned. 8. “To provide\r\nfor amendments to be ratified by three fourths of the States under two\r\nexceptions only. “That useful alterations will be suggested by\r\nexperience, could not but be foreseen. It was requisite, therefore,\r\nthat a mode for introducing them should be provided. The mode preferred\r\nby the convention seems to be stamped with every mark of propriety. It\r\nguards equally against that extreme facility, which would render the\r\nConstitution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty, which might\r\nperpetuate its discovered faults. It, moreover, equally enables the\r\ngeneral and the State governments to originate the amendment of errors,\r\nas they may be pointed out by the experience on one side, or on the\r\nother. The exception in favor of the equality of suffrage in the\r\nSenate, was probably meant as a palladium to the residuary sovereignty\r\nof the States, implied and secured by that principle of representation\r\nin one branch of the legislature; and was probably insisted on by the\r\nStates particularly attached to that equality. The other exception must\r\nhave been admitted on the same considerations which produced the\r\nprivilege defended by it. 9. “The ratification of the conventions of\r\nnine States shall be sufficient for the establishment of this\r\nConstitution between the States, ratifying the same. “This article\r\nspeaks for itself.\r\n\r\nThe express authority of the people alone could give due validity to\r\nthe Constitution. To have required the unanimous ratification of the\r\nthirteen States, would have subjected the essential interests of the\r\nwhole to the caprice or corruption of a single member. It would have\r\nmarked a want of foresight in the convention, which our own experience\r\nwould have rendered inexcusable. Two questions of a very delicate\r\nnature present themselves on this occasion: 1. On what principle the\r\nConfederation, which stands in the solemn form of a compact among the\r\nStates, can be superseded without the unanimous consent of the parties\r\nto it? 2. What relation is to subsist between the nine or more States\r\nratifying the Constitution, and the remaining few who do not become\r\nparties to it? The first question is answered at once by recurring to\r\nthe absolute necessity of the case; to the great principle of\r\nself-preservation; to the transcendent law of nature and of nature’s\r\nGod, which declares that the safety and happiness of society are the\r\nobjects at which all political institutions aim, and to which all such\r\ninstitutions must be sacrificed. PERHAPS, also, an answer may be found\r\nwithout searching beyond the principles of the compact itself. It has\r\nbeen heretofore noted among the defects of the Confederation, that in\r\nmany of the States it had received no higher sanction than a mere\r\nlegislative ratification. The principle of reciprocality seems to\r\nrequire that its obligation on the other States should be reduced to\r\nthe same standard. A compact between independent sovereigns, founded on\r\nordinary acts of legislative authority, can pretend to no higher\r\nvalidity than a league or treaty between the parties. It is an\r\nestablished doctrine on the subject of treaties, that all the articles\r\nare mutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any one article\r\nis a breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach, committed by either\r\nof the parties, absolves the others, and authorizes them, if they\r\nplease, to pronounce the compact violated and void. Should it unhappily\r\nbe necessary to appeal to these delicate truths for a justification for\r\ndispensing with the consent of particular States to a dissolution of\r\nthe federal pact, will not the complaining parties find it a difficult\r\ntask to answer the MULTIPLIED and IMPORTANT infractions with which they\r\nmay be confronted? The time has been when it was incumbent on us all to\r\nveil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits. The scene is now changed,\r\nand with it the part which the same motives dictate. The second\r\nquestion is not less delicate; and the flattering prospect of its being\r\nmerely hypothetical forbids an overcurious discussion of it. It is one\r\nof those cases which must be left to provide for itself. In general, it\r\nmay be observed, that although no political relation can subsist\r\nbetween the assenting and dissenting States, yet the moral relations\r\nwill remain uncancelled. The claims of justice, both on one side and on\r\nthe other, will be in force, and must be fulfilled; the rights of\r\nhumanity must in all cases be duly and mutually respected; whilst\r\nconsiderations of a common interest, and, above all, the remembrance of\r\nthe endearing scenes which are past, and the anticipation of a speedy\r\ntriumph over the obstacles to reunion, will, it is hoped, not urge in\r\nvain MODERATION on one side, and PRUDENCE on the other.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XLIV.\r\n\r\nRestrictions on the Authority of the Several States\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, January 25, 1788.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nA fifth class of provisions in favor of the federal authority consists\r\nof the following restrictions on the authority of the several States:1.\r\n“No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;\r\ngrant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit;\r\nmake any thing but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debts;\r\npass any bill of attainder, ex-post-facto law, or law impairing the\r\nobligation of contracts; or grant any title of nobility. “The\r\nprohibition against treaties, alliances, and confederations makes a\r\npart of the existing articles of Union; and for reasons which need no\r\nexplanation, is copied into the new Constitution. The prohibition of\r\nletters of marque is another part of the old system, but is somewhat\r\nextended in the new. According to the former, letters of marque could\r\nbe granted by the States after a declaration of war; according to the\r\nlatter, these licenses must be obtained, as well during war as previous\r\nto its declaration, from the government of the United States. This\r\nalteration is fully justified by the advantage of uniformity in all\r\npoints which relate to foreign powers; and of immediate responsibility\r\nto the nation in all those for whose conduct the nation itself is to be\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nThe right of coining money, which is here taken from the States, was\r\nleft in their hands by the Confederation, as a concurrent right with\r\nthat of Congress, under an exception in favor of the exclusive right of\r\nCongress to regulate the alloy and value. In this instance, also, the\r\nnew provision is an improvement on the old. Whilst the alloy and value\r\ndepended on the general authority, a right of coinage in the particular\r\nStates could have no other effect than to multiply expensive mints and\r\ndiversify the forms and weights of the circulating pieces. The latter\r\ninconveniency defeats one purpose for which the power was originally\r\nsubmitted to the federal head; and as far as the former might prevent\r\nan inconvenient remittance of gold and silver to the central mint for\r\nrecoinage, the end can be as well attained by local mints established\r\nunder the general authority.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure\r\nto every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his\r\nknowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which\r\nAmerica has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of\r\npaper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the\r\nnecessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals\r\nof the people, and on the character of republican government,\r\nconstitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this\r\nunadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an\r\naccumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a\r\nvoluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has\r\nbeen the instrument of it. In addition to these persuasive\r\nconsiderations, it may be observed, that the same reasons which show\r\nthe necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin,\r\nprove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to\r\nsubstitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right\r\nto regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different\r\ncurrencies as States, and thus the intercourse among them would be\r\nimpeded; retrospective alterations in its value might be made, and thus\r\nthe citizens of other States be injured, and animosities be kindled\r\namong the States themselves. The subjects of foreign powers might\r\nsuffer from the same cause, and hence the Union be discredited and\r\nembroiled by the indiscretion of a single member. No one of these\r\nmischiefs is less incident to a power in the States to emit paper\r\nmoney, than to coin gold or silver. The power to make any thing but\r\ngold and silver a tender in payment of debts, is withdrawn from the\r\nStates, on the same principle with that of issuing a paper currency.\r\nBills of attainder, ex-post-facto laws, and laws impairing the\r\nobligation of contracts, are contrary to the first principles of the\r\nsocial compact, and to every principle of sound legislation. The two\r\nformer are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of\r\nthe State constitutions, and all of them are prohibited by the spirit\r\nand scope of these fundamental charters. Our own experience has taught\r\nus, nevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers ought\r\nnot to be omitted. Very properly, therefore, have the convention added\r\nthis constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private\r\nrights; and I am much deceived if they have not, in so doing, as\r\nfaithfully consulted the genuine sentiments as the undoubted interests\r\nof their constituents. The sober people of America are weary of the\r\nfluctuating policy which has directed the public councils. They have\r\nseen with regret and indignation that sudden changes and legislative\r\ninterferences, in cases affecting personal rights, become jobs in the\r\nhands of enterprising and influential speculators, and snares to the\r\nmore-industrious and less-informed part of the community. They have\r\nseen, too, that one legislative interference is but the first link of a\r\nlong chain of repetitions, every subsequent interference being\r\nnaturally produced by the effects of the preceding. They very rightly\r\ninfer, therefore, that some thorough reform is wanting, which will\r\nbanish speculations on public measures, inspire a general prudence and\r\nindustry, and give a regular course to the business of society. The\r\nprohibition with respect to titles of nobility is copied from the\r\narticles of Confederation and needs no comment. 2. “No State shall,\r\nwithout the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on\r\nimports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for\r\nexecuting its inspection laws, and the net produce of all duties and\r\nimposts laid by any State on imports or exports, shall be for the use\r\nof the treasury of the United States; and all such laws shall be\r\nsubject to the revision and control of the Congress. No State shall,\r\nwithout the consent of Congress, lay any duty on tonnage, keep troops\r\nor ships of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact\r\nwith another State, or with a foreign power, or engage in war unless\r\nactually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of\r\ndelay. “The restraint on the power of the States over imports and\r\nexports is enforced by all the arguments which prove the necessity of\r\nsubmitting the regulation of trade to the federal councils. It is\r\nneedless, therefore, to remark further on this head, than that the\r\nmanner in which the restraint is qualified seems well calculated at\r\nonce to secure to the States a reasonable discretion in providing for\r\nthe conveniency of their imports and exports, and to the United States\r\na reasonable check against the abuse of this discretion.\r\n\r\nThe remaining particulars of this clause fall within reasonings which\r\nare either so obvious, or have been so fully developed, that they may\r\nbe passed over without remark. The SIXTH and last class consists of the\r\nseveral powers and provisions by which efficacy is given to all the\r\nrest. 1. Of these the first is, the “power to make all laws which shall\r\nbe necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing\r\npowers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the\r\ngovernment of the United States, or in any department or officer\r\nthereof. “Few parts of the Constitution have been assailed with more\r\nintemperance than this; yet on a fair investigation of it, no part can\r\nappear more completely invulnerable. Without the SUBSTANCE of this\r\npower, the whole Constitution would be a dead letter. Those who object\r\nto the article, therefore, as a part of the Constitution, can only mean\r\nthat the FORM of the provision is improper. But have they considered\r\nwhether a better form could have been substituted? There are four other\r\npossible methods which the Constitution might have taken on this\r\nsubject. They might have copied the second article of the existing\r\nConfederation, which would have prohibited the exercise of any power\r\nnot EXPRESSLY delegated; they might have attempted a positive\r\nenumeration of the powers comprehended under the general terms\r\n“necessary and proper”; they might have attempted a negative\r\nenumeration of them, by specifying the powers excepted from the general\r\ndefinition; they might have been altogether silent on the subject,\r\nleaving these necessary and proper powers to construction and\r\ninference. Had the convention taken the first method of adopting the\r\nsecond article of Confederation, it is evident that the new Congress\r\nwould be continually exposed, as their predecessors have been, to the\r\nalternative of construing the term “EXPRESSLY” with so much rigor, as\r\nto disarm the government of all real authority whatever, or with so\r\nmuch latitude as to destroy altogether the force of the restriction.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to show, if it were necessary, that no important\r\npower, delegated by the articles of Confederation, has been or can be\r\nexecuted by Congress, without recurring more or less to the doctrine of\r\nCONSTRUCTION or IMPLICATION. As the powers delegated under the new\r\nsystem are more extensive, the government which is to administer it\r\nwould find itself still more distressed with the alternative of\r\nbetraying the public interests by doing nothing, or of violating the\r\nConstitution by exercising powers indispensably necessary and proper,\r\nbut, at the same time, not EXPRESSLY granted. Had the convention\r\nattempted a positive enumeration of the powers necessary and proper for\r\ncarrying their other powers into effect, the attempt would have\r\ninvolved a complete digest of laws on every subject to which the\r\nConstitution relates; accommodated too, not only to the existing state\r\nof things, but to all the possible changes which futurity may produce;\r\nfor in every new application of a general power, the PARTICULAR POWERS,\r\nwhich are the means of attaining the OBJECT of the general power, must\r\nalways necessarily vary with that object, and be often properly varied\r\nwhilst the object remains the same.\r\n\r\nHad they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means not\r\nnecessary or proper for carrying the general powers into execution, the\r\ntask would have been no less chimerical; and would have been liable to\r\nthis further objection, that every defect in the enumeration would have\r\nbeen equivalent to a positive grant of authority. If, to avoid this\r\nconsequence, they had attempted a partial enumeration of the\r\nexceptions, and described the residue by the general terms, NOT\r\nNECESSARY OR PROPER, it must have happened that the enumeration would\r\ncomprehend a few of the excepted powers only; that these would be such\r\nas would be least likely to be assumed or tolerated, because the\r\nenumeration would of course select such as would be least necessary or\r\nproper; and that the unnecessary and improper powers included in the\r\nresiduum, would be less forcibly excepted, than if no partial\r\nenumeration had been made. Had the Constitution been silent on this\r\nhead, there can be no doubt that all the particular powers requisite as\r\nmeans of executing the general powers would have resulted to the\r\ngovernment, by unavoidable implication. No axiom is more clearly\r\nestablished in law, or in reason, than that wherever the end is\r\nrequired, the means are authorized; wherever a general power to do a\r\nthing is given, every particular power necessary for doing it is\r\nincluded. Had this last method, therefore, been pursued by the\r\nconvention, every objection now urged against their plan would remain\r\nin all its plausibility; and the real inconveniency would be incurred\r\nof not removing a pretext which may be seized on critical occasions for\r\ndrawing into question the essential powers of the Union. If it be asked\r\nwhat is to be the consequence, in case the Congress shall misconstrue\r\nthis part of the Constitution, and exercise powers not warranted by its\r\ntrue meaning, I answer, the same as if they should misconstrue or\r\nenlarge any other power vested in them; as if the general power had\r\nbeen reduced to particulars, and any one of these were to be violated;\r\nthe same, in short, as if the State legislatures should violate the\r\nirrespective constitutional authorities. In the first instance, the\r\nsuccess of the usurpation will depend on the executive and judiciary\r\ndepartments, which are to expound and give effect to the legislative\r\nacts; and in the last resort a remedy must be obtained from the people\r\nwho can, by the election of more faithful representatives, annul the\r\nacts of the usurpers. The truth is, that this ultimate redress may be\r\nmore confided in against unconstitutional acts of the federal than of\r\nthe State legislatures, for this plain reason, that as every such act\r\nof the former will be an invasion of the rights of the latter, these\r\nwill be ever ready to mark the innovation, to sound the alarm to the\r\npeople, and to exert their local influence in effecting a change of\r\nfederal representatives. There being no such intermediate body between\r\nthe State legislatures and the people interested in watching the\r\nconduct of the former, violations of the State constitutions are more\r\nlikely to remain unnoticed and unredressed. 2. “This Constitution and\r\nthe laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof,\r\nand all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of\r\nthe United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges\r\nin every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or\r\nlaws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. “The indiscreet zeal\r\nof the adversaries to the Constitution has betrayed them into an attack\r\non this part of it also, without which it would have been evidently and\r\nradically defective. To be fully sensible of this, we need only suppose\r\nfor a moment that the supremacy of the State constitutions had been\r\nleft complete by a saving clause in their favor. In the first place, as\r\nthese constitutions invest the State legislatures with absolute\r\nsovereignty, in all cases not excepted by the existing articles of\r\nConfederation, all the authorities contained in the proposed\r\nConstitution, so far as they exceed those enumerated in the\r\nConfederation, would have been annulled, and the new Congress would\r\nhave been reduced to the same impotent condition with their\r\npredecessors. In the next place, as the constitutions of some of the\r\nStates do not even expressly and fully recognize the existing powers of\r\nthe Confederacy, an express saving of the supremacy of the former\r\nwould, in such States, have brought into question every power contained\r\nin the proposed Constitution. In the third place, as the constitutions\r\nof the States differ much from each other, it might happen that a\r\ntreaty or national law, of great and equal importance to the States,\r\nwould interfere with some and not with other constitutions, and would\r\nconsequently be valid in some of the States, at the same time that it\r\nwould have no effect in others. In fine, the world would have seen, for\r\nthe first time, a system of government founded on an inversion of the\r\nfundamental principles of all government; it would have seen the\r\nauthority of the whole society every where subordinate to the authority\r\nof the parts; it would have seen a monster, in which the head was under\r\nthe direction of the members. 3. “The Senators and Representatives, and\r\nthe members of the several State legislatures, and all executive and\r\njudicial officers, both of the United States and the several States,\r\nshall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution. “It\r\nhas been asked why it was thought necessary, that the State magistracy\r\nshould be bound to support the federal Constitution, and unnecessary\r\nthat a like oath should be imposed on the officers of the United\r\nStates, in favor of the State constitutions. Several reasons might be\r\nassigned for the distinction. I content myself with one, which is\r\nobvious and conclusive. The members of the federal government will have\r\nno agency in carrying the State constitutions into effect. The members\r\nand officers of the State governments, on the contrary, will have an\r\nessential agency in giving effect to the federal Constitution. The\r\nelection of the President and Senate will depend, in all cases, on the\r\nlegislatures of the several States. And the election of the House of\r\nRepresentatives will equally depend on the same authority in the first\r\ninstance; and will, probably, forever be conducted by the officers, and\r\naccording to the laws, of the States. 4. Among the provisions for\r\ngiving efficacy to the federal powers might be added those which belong\r\nto the executive and judiciary departments: but as these are reserved\r\nfor particular examination in another place, I pass them over in this.\r\nWe have now reviewed, in detail, all the articles composing the sum or\r\nquantity of power delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal\r\ngovernment, and are brought to this undeniable conclusion, that no part\r\nof the power is unnecessary or improper for accomplishing the necessary\r\nobjects of the Union. The question, therefore, whether this amount of\r\npower shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question,\r\nwhether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union\r\nshall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union itself\r\nshall be preserved.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XLV.\r\n\r\nThe Alleged Danger From the Powers of the Union to the State\r\nGovernments Considered\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nHaving shown that no one of the powers transferred to the federal\r\ngovernment is unnecessary or improper, the next question to be\r\nconsidered is, whether the whole mass of them will be dangerous to the\r\nportion of authority left in the several States. The adversaries to the\r\nplan of the convention, instead of considering in the first place what\r\ndegree of power was absolutely necessary for the purposes of the\r\nfederal government, have exhausted themselves in a secondary inquiry\r\ninto the possible consequences of the proposed degree of power to the\r\ngovernments of the particular States. But if the Union, as has been\r\nshown, be essential to the security of the people of America against\r\nforeign danger; if it be essential to their security against\r\ncontentions and wars among the different States; if it be essential to\r\nguard them against those violent and oppressive factions which embitter\r\nthe blessings of liberty, and against those military establishments\r\nwhich must gradually poison its very fountain; if, in a word, the Union\r\nbe essential to the happiness of the people of America, is it not\r\npreposterous, to urge as an objection to a government, without which\r\nthe objects of the Union cannot be attained, that such a government may\r\nderogate from the importance of the governments of the individual\r\nStates? Was, then, the American Revolution effected, was the American\r\nConfederacy formed, was the precious blood of thousands spilt, and the\r\nhard-earned substance of millions lavished, not that the people of\r\nAmerica should enjoy peace, liberty, and safety, but that the\r\ngovernment of the individual States, that particular municipal\r\nestablishments, might enjoy a certain extent of power, and be arrayed\r\nwith certain dignities and attributes of sovereignty? We have heard of\r\nthe impious doctrine in the Old World, that the people were made for\r\nkings, not kings for the people. Is the same doctrine to be revived in\r\nthe New, in another shape that the solid happiness of the people is to\r\nbe sacrificed to the views of political institutions of a different\r\nform? It is too early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that\r\nthe public good, the real welfare of the great body of the people, is\r\nthe supreme object to be pursued; and that no form of government\r\nwhatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the\r\nattainment of this object. Were the plan of the convention adverse to\r\nthe public happiness, my voice would be, Reject the plan. Were the\r\nUnion itself inconsistent with the public happiness, it would be,\r\nAbolish the Union. In like manner, as far as the sovereignty of the\r\nStates cannot be reconciled to the happiness of the people, the voice\r\nof every good citizen must be,\r\n\r\nLet the former be sacrificed to the latter. How far the sacrifice is\r\nnecessary, has been shown. How far the unsacrificed residue will be\r\nendangered, is the question before us. Several important considerations\r\nhave been touched in the course of these papers, which discountenance\r\nthe supposition that the operation of the federal government will by\r\ndegrees prove fatal to the State governments. The more I revolve the\r\nsubject, the more fully I am persuaded that the balance is much more\r\nlikely to be disturbed by the preponderancy of the last than of the\r\nfirst scale. We have seen, in all the examples of ancient and modern\r\nconfederacies, the strongest tendency continually betraying itself in\r\nthe members, to despoil the general government of its authorities, with\r\na very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself against the\r\nencroachments. Although, in most of these examples, the system has been\r\nso dissimilar from that under consideration as greatly to weaken any\r\ninference concerning the latter from the fate of the former, yet, as\r\nthe States will retain, under the proposed Constitution, a very\r\nextensive portion of active sovereignty, the inference ought not to be\r\nwholly disregarded. In the Achaean league it is probable that the\r\nfederal head had a degree and species of power, which gave it a\r\nconsiderable likeness to the government framed by the convention. The\r\nLycian Confederacy, as far as its principles and form are transmitted,\r\nmust have borne a still greater analogy to it. Yet history does not\r\ninform us that either of them ever degenerated, or tended to\r\ndegenerate, into one consolidated government. On the contrary, we know\r\nthat the ruin of one of them proceeded from the incapacity of the\r\nfederal authority to prevent the dissensions, and finally the disunion,\r\nof the subordinate authorities. These cases are the more worthy of our\r\nattention, as the external causes by which the component parts were\r\npressed together were much more numerous and powerful than in our case;\r\nand consequently less powerful ligaments within would be sufficient to\r\nbind the members to the head, and to each other. In the feudal system,\r\nwe have seen a similar propensity exemplified. Notwithstanding the want\r\nof proper sympathy in every instance between the local sovereigns and\r\nthe people, and the sympathy in some instances between the general\r\nsovereign and the latter, it usually happened that the local sovereigns\r\nprevailed in the rivalship for encroachments.\r\n\r\nHad no external dangers enforced internal harmony and subordination,\r\nand particularly, had the local sovereigns possessed the affections of\r\nthe people, the great kingdoms in Europe would at this time consist of\r\nas many independent princes as there were formerly feudatory barons.\r\nThe State government will have the advantage of the Federal government,\r\nwhether we compare them in respect to the immediate dependence of the\r\none on the other; to the weight of personal influence which each side\r\nwill possess; to the powers respectively vested in them; to the\r\npredilection and probable support of the people; to the disposition and\r\nfaculty of resisting and frustrating the measures of each other. The\r\nState governments may be regarded as constituent and essential parts of\r\nthe federal government; whilst the latter is nowise essential to the\r\noperation or organization of the former. Without the intervention of\r\nthe State legislatures, the President of the United States cannot be\r\nelected at all. They must in all cases have a great share in his\r\nappointment, and will, perhaps, in most cases, of themselves determine\r\nit. The Senate will be elected absolutely and exclusively by the State\r\nlegislatures. Even the House of Representatives, though drawn\r\nimmediately from the people, will be chosen very much under the\r\ninfluence of that class of men, whose influence over the people obtains\r\nfor themselves an election into the State legislatures. Thus, each of\r\nthe principal branches of the federal government will owe its existence\r\nmore or less to the favor of the State governments, and must\r\nconsequently feel a dependence, which is much more likely to beget a\r\ndisposition too obsequious than too overbearing towards them. On the\r\nother side, the component parts of the State governments will in no\r\ninstance be indebted for their appointment to the direct agency of the\r\nfederal government, and very little, if at all, to the local influence\r\nof its members. The number of individuals employed under the\r\nConstitution of the United States will be much smaller than the number\r\nemployed under the particular States.\r\n\r\nThere will consequently be less of personal influence on the side of\r\nthe former than of the latter. The members of the legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judiciary departments of thirteen and more States, the\r\njustices of peace, officers of militia, ministerial officers of\r\njustice, with all the county, corporation, and town officers, for three\r\nmillions and more of people, intermixed, and having particular\r\nacquaintance with every class and circle of people, must exceed, beyond\r\nall proportion, both in number and influence, those of every\r\ndescription who will be employed in the administration of the federal\r\nsystem. Compare the members of the three great departments of the\r\nthirteen States, excluding from the judiciary department the justices\r\nof peace, with the members of the corresponding departments of the\r\nsingle government of the Union; compare the militia officers of three\r\nmillions of people with the military and marine officers of any\r\nestablishment which is within the compass of probability, or, I may\r\nadd, of possibility, and in this view alone, we may pronounce the\r\nadvantage of the States to be decisive. If the federal government is to\r\nhave collectors of revenue, the State governments will have theirs\r\nalso. And as those of the former will be principally on the seacoast,\r\nand not very numerous, whilst those of the latter will be spread over\r\nthe face of the country, and will be very numerous, the advantage in\r\nthis view also lies on the same side. I\r\n\r\nt is true, that the Confederacy is to possess, and may exercise, the\r\npower of collecting internal as well as external taxes throughout the\r\nStates; but it is probable that this power will not be resorted to,\r\nexcept for supplemental purposes of revenue; that an option will then\r\nbe given to the States to supply their quotas by previous collections\r\nof their own; and that the eventual collection, under the immediate\r\nauthority of the Union, will generally be made by the officers, and\r\naccording to the rules, appointed by the several States. Indeed it is\r\nextremely probable, that in other instances, particularly in the\r\norganization of the judicial power, the officers of the States will be\r\nclothed with the correspondent authority of the Union.\r\n\r\nShould it happen, however, that separate collectors of internal revenue\r\nshould be appointed under the federal government, the influence of the\r\nwhole number would not bear a comparison with that of the multitude of\r\nState officers in the opposite scale.\r\n\r\nWithin every district to which a federal collector would be allotted,\r\nthere would not be less than thirty or forty, or even more, officers of\r\ndifferent descriptions, and many of them persons of character and\r\nweight, whose influence would lie on the side of the State. The powers\r\ndelegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are\r\nfew and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are\r\nnumerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on\r\nexternal objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce;\r\nwith which last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be\r\nconnected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all\r\nthe objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the\r\nlives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order,\r\nimprovement, and prosperity of the State. The operations of the federal\r\ngovernment will be most extensive and important in times of war and\r\ndanger; those of the State governments, in times of peace and security.\r\nAs the former periods will probably bear a small proportion to the\r\nlatter, the State governments will here enjoy another advantage over\r\nthe federal government. The more adequate, indeed, the federal powers\r\nmay be rendered to the national defense, the less frequent will be\r\nthose scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over the\r\ngovernments of the particular States. If the new Constitution be\r\nexamined with accuracy and candor, it will be found that the change\r\nwhich it proposes consists much less in the addition of NEW POWERS to\r\nthe Union, than in the invigoration of its ORIGINAL POWERS. The\r\nregulation of commerce, it is true, is a new power; but that seems to\r\nbe an addition which few oppose, and from which no apprehensions are\r\nentertained. The powers relating to war and peace, armies and fleets,\r\ntreaties and finance, with the other more considerable powers, are all\r\nvested in the existing Congress by the articles of Confederation. The\r\nproposed change does not enlarge these powers; it only substitutes a\r\nmore effectual mode of administering them. The change relating to\r\ntaxation may be regarded as the most important; and yet the present\r\nCongress have as complete authority to REQUIRE of the States indefinite\r\nsupplies of money for the common defense and general welfare, as the\r\nfuture Congress will have to require them of individual citizens; and\r\nthe latter will be no more bound than the States themselves have been,\r\nto pay the quotas respectively taxed on them. Had the States complied\r\npunctually with the articles of Confederation, or could their\r\ncompliance have been enforced by as peaceable means as may be used with\r\nsuccess towards single persons, our past experience is very far from\r\ncountenancing an opinion, that the State governments would have lost\r\ntheir constitutional powers, and have gradually undergone an entire\r\nconsolidation. To maintain that such an event would have ensued, would\r\nbe to say at once, that the existence of the State governments is\r\nincompatible with any system whatever that accomplishes the essential\r\npurposes of the Union.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XLVI.\r\n\r\nThe Influence of the State and Federal Governments Compared\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, January 29, 1788.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nResuming the subject of the last paper, I proceed to inquire whether\r\nthe federal government or the State governments will have the advantage\r\nwith regard to the predilection and support of the people.\r\nNotwithstanding the different modes in which they are appointed, we\r\nmust consider both of them as substantially dependent on the great body\r\nof the citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nI assume this position here as it respects the first, reserving the\r\nproofs for another place. The federal and State governments are in fact\r\nbut different agents and trustees of the people, constituted with\r\ndifferent powers, and designed for different purposes. The adversaries\r\nof the Constitution seem to have lost sight of the people altogether in\r\ntheir reasonings on this subject; and to have viewed these different\r\nestablishments, not only as mutual rivals and enemies, but as\r\nuncontrolled by any common superior in their efforts to usurp the\r\nauthorities of each other. These gentlemen must here be reminded of\r\ntheir error. They must be told that the ultimate authority, wherever\r\nthe derivative may be found, resides in the people alone, and that it\r\nwill not depend merely on the comparative ambition or address of the\r\ndifferent governments, whether either, or which of them, will be able\r\nto enlarge its sphere of jurisdiction at the expense of the other.\r\nTruth, no less than decency, requires that the event in every case\r\nshould be supposed to depend on the sentiments and sanction of their\r\ncommon constituents. Many considerations, besides those suggested on a\r\nformer occasion, seem to place it beyond doubt that the first and most\r\nnatural attachment of the people will be to the governments of their\r\nrespective States.\r\n\r\nInto the administration of these a greater number of individuals will\r\nexpect to rise. From the gift of these a greater number of offices and\r\nemoluments will flow. By the superintending care of these, all the more\r\ndomestic and personal interests of the people will be regulated and\r\nprovided for. With the affairs of these, the people will be more\r\nfamiliarly and minutely conversant. And with the members of these, will\r\na greater proportion of the people have the ties of personal\r\nacquaintance and friendship, and of family and party attachments; on\r\nthe side of these, therefore, the popular bias may well be expected\r\nmost strongly to incline. Experience speaks the same language in this\r\ncase. The federal administration, though hitherto very defective in\r\ncomparison with what may be hoped under a better system, had, during\r\nthe war, and particularly whilst the independent fund of paper\r\nemissions was in credit, an activity and importance as great as it can\r\nwell have in any future circumstances whatever.\r\n\r\nIt was engaged, too, in a course of measures which had for their object\r\nthe protection of everything that was dear, and the acquisition of\r\neverything that could be desirable to the people at large. It was,\r\nnevertheless, invariably found, after the transient enthusiasm for the\r\nearly Congresses was over, that the attention and attachment of the\r\npeople were turned anew to their own particular governments; that the\r\nfederal council was at no time the idol of popular favor; and that\r\nopposition to proposed enlargements of its powers and importance was\r\nthe side usually taken by the men who wished to build their political\r\nconsequence on the prepossessions of their fellow-citizens. If,\r\ntherefore, as has been elsewhere remarked, the people should in future\r\nbecome more partial to the federal than to the State governments, the\r\nchange can only result from such manifest and irresistible proofs of a\r\nbetter administration, as will overcome all their antecedent\r\npropensities. And in that case, the people ought not surely to be\r\nprecluded from giving most of their confidence where they may discover\r\nit to be most due; but even in that case the State governments could\r\nhave little to apprehend, because it is only within a certain sphere\r\nthat the federal power can, in the nature of things, be advantageously\r\nadministered. The remaining points on which I propose to compare the\r\nfederal and State governments, are the disposition and the faculty they\r\nmay respectively possess, to resist and frustrate the measures of each\r\nother. It has been already proved that the members of the federal will\r\nbe more dependent on the members of the State governments, than the\r\nlatter will be on the former. It has appeared also, that the\r\nprepossessions of the people, on whom both will depend, will be more on\r\nthe side of the State governments, than of the federal government. So\r\nfar as the disposition of each towards the other may be influenced by\r\nthese causes, the State governments must clearly have the advantage.\r\n\r\nBut in a distinct and very important point of view, the advantage will\r\nlie on the same side. The prepossessions, which the members themselves\r\nwill carry into the federal government, will generally be favorable to\r\nthe States; whilst it will rarely happen, that the members of the State\r\ngovernments will carry into the public councils a bias in favor of the\r\ngeneral government. A local spirit will infallibly prevail much more in\r\nthe members of Congress, than a national spirit will prevail in the\r\nlegislatures of the particular States. Every one knows that a great\r\nproportion of the errors committed by the State legislatures proceeds\r\nfrom the disposition of the members to sacrifice the comprehensive and\r\npermanent interest of the State, to the particular and separate views\r\nof the counties or districts in which they reside. And if they do not\r\nsufficiently enlarge their policy to embrace the collective welfare of\r\ntheir particular State, how can it be imagined that they will make the\r\naggregate prosperity of the Union, and the dignity and respectability\r\nof its government, the objects of their affections and consultations?\r\nFor the same reason that the members of the State legislatures will be\r\nunlikely to attach themselves sufficiently to national objects, the\r\nmembers of the federal legislature will be likely to attach themselves\r\ntoo much to local objects. The States will be to the latter what\r\ncounties and towns are to the former. Measures will too often be\r\ndecided according to their probable effect, not on the national\r\nprosperity and happiness, but on the prejudices, interests, and\r\npursuits of the governments and people of the individual States. What\r\nis the spirit that has in general characterized the proceedings of\r\nCongress? A perusal of their journals, as well as the candid\r\nacknowledgments of such as have had a seat in that assembly, will\r\ninform us, that the members have but too frequently displayed the\r\ncharacter, rather of partisans of their respective States, than of\r\nimpartial guardians of a common interest; that where on one occasion\r\nimproper sacrifices have been made of local considerations, to the\r\naggrandizement of the federal government, the great interests of the\r\nnation have suffered on a hundred, from an undue attention to the local\r\nprejudices, interests, and views of the particular States. I mean not\r\nby these reflections to insinuate, that the new federal government will\r\nnot embrace a more enlarged plan of policy than the existing government\r\nmay have pursued; much less, that its views will be as confined as\r\nthose of the State legislatures; but only that it will partake\r\nsufficiently of the spirit of both, to be disinclined to invade the\r\nrights of the individual States, or the preorgatives of their\r\ngovernments. The motives on the part of the State governments, to\r\naugment their prerogatives by defalcations from the federal government,\r\nwill be overruled by no reciprocal predispositions in the members. Were\r\nit admitted, however, that the Federal government may feel an equal\r\ndisposition with the State governments to extend its power beyond the\r\ndue limits, the latter would still have the advantage in the means of\r\ndefeating such encroachments. If an act of a particular State, though\r\nunfriendly to the national government, be generally popular in that\r\nState and should not too grossly violate the oaths of the State\r\nofficers, it is executed immediately and, of course, by means on the\r\nspot and depending on the State alone. The opposition of the federal\r\ngovernment, or the interposition of federal officers, would but inflame\r\nthe zeal of all parties on the side of the State, and the evil could\r\nnot be prevented or repaired, if at all, without the employment of\r\nmeans which must always be resorted to with reluctance and difficulty.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, should an unwarrantable measure of the federal\r\ngovernment be unpopular in particular States, which would seldom fail\r\nto be the case, or even a warrantable measure be so, which may\r\nsometimes be the case, the means of opposition to it are powerful and\r\nat hand. The disquietude of the people; their repugnance and, perhaps,\r\nrefusal to co-operate with the officers of the Union; the frowns of the\r\nexecutive magistracy of the State; the embarrassments created by\r\nlegislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions,\r\nwould oppose, in any State, difficulties not to be despised; would\r\nform, in a large State, very serious impediments; and where the\r\nsentiments of several adjoining States happened to be in unison, would\r\npresent obstructions which the federal government would hardly be\r\nwilling to encounter. But ambitious encroachments of the federal\r\ngovernment, on the authority of the State governments, would not excite\r\nthe opposition of a single State, or of a few States only. They would\r\nbe signals of general alarm. Every government would espouse the common\r\ncause. A correspondence would be opened. Plans of resistance would be\r\nconcerted. One spirit would animate and conduct the whole. The same\r\ncombinations, in short, would result from an apprehension of the\r\nfederal, as was produced by the dread of a foreign, yoke; and unless\r\nthe projected innovations should be voluntarily renounced, the same\r\nappeal to a trial of force would be made in the one case as was made in\r\nthe other. But what degree of madness could ever drive the federal\r\ngovernment to such an extremity. In the contest with Great Britain, one\r\npart of the empire was employed against the other.\r\n\r\nThe more numerous part invaded the rights of the less numerous part.\r\nThe attempt was unjust and unwise; but it was not in speculation\r\nabsolutely chimerical. But what would be the contest in the case we are\r\nsupposing? Who would be the parties? A few representatives of the\r\npeople would be opposed to the people themselves; or rather one set of\r\nrepresentatives would be contending against thirteen sets of\r\nrepresentatives, with the whole body of their common constituents on\r\nthe side of the latter. The only refuge left for those who prophesy the\r\ndownfall of the State governments is the visionary supposition that the\r\nfederal government may previously accumulate a military force for the\r\nprojects of ambition. The reasonings contained in these papers must\r\nhave been employed to little purpose indeed, if it could be necessary\r\nnow to disprove the reality of this danger. That the people and the\r\nStates should, for a sufficient period of time, elect an uninterrupted\r\nsuccession of men ready to betray both; that the traitors should,\r\nthroughout this period, uniformly and systematically pursue some fixed\r\nplan for the extension of the military establishment; that the\r\ngovernments and the people of the States should silently and patiently\r\nbehold the gathering storm, and continue to supply the materials, until\r\nit should be prepared to burst on their own heads, must appear to every\r\none more like the incoherent dreams of a delirious jealousy, or the\r\nmisjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal, than like the sober\r\napprehensions of genuine patriotism.\r\n\r\nExtravagant as the supposition is, let it however be made. Let a\r\nregular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed;\r\nand let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still\r\nit would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with\r\nthe people on their side, would be able to repel the danger. The\r\nhighest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing\r\narmy can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part\r\nof the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number\r\nable to bear arms. This proportion would not yield, in the United\r\nStates, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To\r\nthese would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of\r\ncitizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among\r\nthemselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and\r\nconducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It\r\nmay well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be\r\nconquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who are best\r\nacquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against\r\nthe British arms, will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it.\r\nBesides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over\r\nthe people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate\r\ngovernments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia\r\nofficers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of\r\nambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any\r\nform can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the\r\nseveral kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public\r\nresources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people\r\nwith arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would\r\nnot be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess\r\nthe additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves,\r\nwho could collect the national will and direct the national force, and\r\nof officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and\r\nattached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the\r\ngreatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be\r\nspeedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it. Let us\r\nnot insult the free and gallant citizens of America with the suspicion,\r\nthat they would be less able to defend the rights of which they would\r\nbe in actual possession, than the debased subjects of arbitrary power\r\nwould be to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors. Let us\r\nrather no longer insult them with the supposition that they can ever\r\nreduce themselves to the necessity of making the experiment, by a blind\r\nand tame submission to the long train of insidious measures which must\r\nprecede and produce it. The argument under the present head may be put\r\ninto a very concise form, which appears altogether conclusive. Either\r\nthe mode in which the federal government is to be constructed will\r\nrender it sufficiently dependent on the people, or it will not. On the\r\nfirst supposition, it will be restrained by that dependence from\r\nforming schemes obnoxious to their constituents. On the other\r\nsupposition, it will not possess the confidence of the people, and its\r\nschemes of usurpation will be easily defeated by the State governments,\r\nwho will be supported by the people. On summing up the considerations\r\nstated in this and the last paper, they seem to amount to the most\r\nconvincing evidence, that the powers proposed to be lodged in the\r\nfederal government are as little formidable to those reserved to the\r\nindividual States, as they are indispensably necessary to accomplish\r\nthe purposes of the Union; and that all those alarms which have been\r\nsounded, of a meditated and consequential annihilation of the State\r\ngovernments, must, on the most favorable interpretation, be ascribed to\r\nthe chimerical fears of the authors of them.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XLVII.\r\n\r\nThe Particular Structure of the New Government and the Distribution of\r\nPower Among Its Different Parts\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 1, 1788.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nHaving reviewed the general form of the proposed government and the\r\ngeneral mass of power allotted to it, I proceed to examine the\r\nparticular structure of this government, and the distribution of this\r\nmass of power among its constituent parts. One of the principal\r\nobjections inculcated by the more respectable adversaries to the\r\nConstitution, is its supposed violation of the political maxim, that\r\nthe legislative, executive, and judiciary departments ought to be\r\nseparate and distinct. In the structure of the federal government, no\r\nregard, it is said, seems to have been paid to this essential\r\nprecaution in favor of liberty. The several departments of power are\r\ndistributed and blended in such a manner as at once to destroy all\r\nsymmetry and beauty of form, and to expose some of the essential parts\r\nof the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the disproportionate\r\nweight of other parts. No political truth is certainly of greater\r\nintrinsic value, or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened\r\npatrons of liberty, than that on which the objection is founded.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary,\r\nin the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether\r\nhereditary, selfappointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the\r\nvery definition of tyranny. Were the federal Constitution, therefore,\r\nreally chargeable with the accumulation of power, or with a mixture of\r\npowers, having a dangerous tendency to such an accumulation, no further\r\narguments would be necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the\r\nsystem. I persuade myself, however, that it will be made apparent to\r\nevery one, that the charge cannot be supported, and that the maxim on\r\nwhich it relies has been totally misconceived and misapplied. In order\r\nto form correct ideas on this important subject, it will be proper to\r\ninvestigate the sense in which the preservation of liberty requires\r\nthat the three great departments of power should be separate and\r\ndistinct. The oracle who is always consulted and cited on this subject\r\nis the celebrated Montesquieu. If he be not the author of this\r\ninvaluable precept in the science of politics, he has the merit at\r\nleast of displaying and recommending it most effectually to the\r\nattention of mankind. Let us endeavor, in the first place, to ascertain\r\nhis meaning on this point. The British Constitution was to Montesquieu\r\nwhat Homer has been to the didactic writers on epic poetry. As the\r\nlatter have considered the work of the immortal bard as the perfect\r\nmodel from which the principles and rules of the epic art were to be\r\ndrawn, and by which all similar works were to be judged, so this great\r\npolitical critic appears to have viewed the Constitution of England as\r\nthe standard, or to use his own expression, as the mirror of political\r\nliberty; and to have delivered, in the form of elementary truths, the\r\nseveral characteristic principles of that particular system. That we\r\nmay be sure, then, not to mistake his meaning in this case, let us\r\nrecur to the source from which the maxim was drawn. On the slightest\r\nview of the British Constitution, we must perceive that the\r\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary departments are by no means\r\ntotally separate and distinct from each other. The executive magistrate\r\nforms an integral part of the legislative authority. He alone has the\r\nprerogative of making treaties with foreign sovereigns, which, when\r\nmade, have, under certain limitations, the force of legislative acts.\r\nAll the members of the judiciary department are appointed by him, can\r\nbe removed by him on the address of the two Houses of Parliament, and\r\nform, when he pleases to consult them, one of his constitutional\r\ncouncils. One branch of the legislative department forms also a great\r\nconstitutional council to the executive chief, as, on another hand, it\r\nis the sole depositary of judicial power in cases of impeachment, and\r\nis invested with the supreme appellate jurisdiction in all other cases.\r\nThe judges, again, are so far connected with the legislative department\r\nas often to attend and participate in its deliberations, though not\r\nadmitted to a legislative vote. From these facts, by which Montesquieu\r\nwas guided, it may clearly be inferred that, in saying “There can be no\r\nliberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the\r\nsame person, or body of magistrates,” or, “if the power of judging be\r\nnot separated from the legislative and executive powers,” he did not\r\nmean that these departments ought to have no PARTIAL AGENCY in, or no\r\nCONTROL over, the acts of each other. His meaning, as his own words\r\nimport, and still more conclusively as illustrated by the example in\r\nhis eye, can amount to no more than this, that where the WHOLE power of\r\none department is exercised by the same hands which possess the WHOLE\r\npower of another department, the fundamental principles of a free\r\nconstitution are subverted. This would have been the case in the\r\nconstitution examined by him, if the king, who is the sole executive\r\nmagistrate, had possessed also the complete legislative power, or the\r\nsupreme administration of justice; or if the entire legislative body\r\nhad possessed the supreme judiciary, or the supreme executive\r\nauthority. This, however, is not among the vices of that constitution.\r\nThe magistrate in whom the whole executive power resides cannot of\r\nhimself make a law, though he can put a negative on every law; nor\r\nadminister justice in person, though he has the appointment of those\r\nwho do administer it. The judges can exercise no executive prerogative,\r\nthough they are shoots from the executive stock; nor any legislative\r\nfunction, though they may be advised with by the legislative councils.\r\nThe entire legislature can perform no judiciary act, though by the\r\njoint act of two of its branches the judges may be removed from their\r\noffices, and though one of its branches is possessed of the judicial\r\npower in the last resort. The entire legislature, again, can exercise\r\nno executive prerogative, though one of its branches constitutes the\r\nsupreme executive magistracy, and another, on the impeachment of a\r\nthird, can try and condemn all the subordinate officers in the\r\nexecutive department. The reasons on which Montesquieu grounds his\r\nmaxim are a further demonstration of his meaning. “When the legislative\r\nand executive powers are united in the same person or body,” says he,\r\n“there can be no liberty, because apprehensions may arise lest THE SAME\r\nmonarch or senate should ENACT tyrannical laws to EXECUTE them in a\r\ntyrannical manner. “ Again: “Were the power of judging joined with the\r\nlegislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to\r\narbitrary control, for THE JUDGE would then be THE LEGISLATOR.\r\n\r\nWere it joined to the executive power, THE JUDGE might behave with all\r\nthe violence of AN OPPRESSOR. “ Some of these reasons are more fully\r\nexplained in other passages; but briefly stated as they are here, they\r\nsufficiently establish the meaning which we have put on this celebrated\r\nmaxim of this celebrated author.\r\n\r\nIf we look into the constitutions of the several States, we find that,\r\nnotwithstanding the emphatical and, in some instances, the unqualified\r\nterms in which this axiom has been laid down, there is not a single\r\ninstance in which the several departments of power have been kept\r\nabsolutely separate and distinct. New Hampshire, whose constitution was\r\nthe last formed, seems to have been fully aware of the impossibility\r\nand inexpediency of avoiding any mixture whatever of these departments,\r\nand has qualified the doctrine by declaring “that the legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judiciary powers ought to be kept as separate from, and\r\nindependent of, each other AS THE NATURE OF A FREE GOVERNMENT WILL\r\nADMIT; OR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT CHAIN OF CONNECTION THAT BINDS THE\r\nWHOLE FABRIC OF THE CONSTITUTION IN ONE INDISSOLUBLE BOND OF UNITY AND\r\nAMITY. “ Her constitution accordingly mixes these departments in\r\nseveral respects. The Senate, which is a branch of the legislative\r\ndepartment, is also a judicial tribunal for the trial of impeachments.\r\nThe President, who is the head of the executive department, is the\r\npresiding member also of the Senate; and, besides an equal vote in all\r\ncases, has a casting vote in case of a tie. The executive head is\r\nhimself eventually elective every year by the legislative department,\r\nand his council is every year chosen by and from the members of the\r\nsame department. Several of the officers of state are also appointed by\r\nthe legislature. And the members of the judiciary department are\r\nappointed by the executive department. The constitution of\r\nMassachusetts has observed a sufficient though less pointed caution, in\r\nexpressing this fundamental article of liberty. It declares “that the\r\nlegislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial\r\npowers, or either of them; the executive shall never exercise the\r\nlegislative and judicial powers, or either of them; the judicial shall\r\nnever exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them.\r\n“ This declaration corresponds precisely with the doctrine of\r\nMontesquieu, as it has been explained, and is not in a single point\r\nviolated by the plan of the convention. It goes no farther than to\r\nprohibit any one of the entire departments from exercising the powers\r\nof another department. In the very Constitution to which it is\r\nprefixed, a partial mixture of powers has been admitted. The executive\r\nmagistrate has a qualified negative on the legislative body, and the\r\nSenate, which is a part of the legislature, is a court of impeachment\r\nfor members both of the executive and judiciary departments. The\r\nmembers of the judiciary department, again, are appointable by the\r\nexecutive department, and removable by the same authority on the\r\naddress of the two legislative branches.\r\n\r\nLastly, a number of the officers of government are annually appointed\r\nby the legislative department. As the appointment to offices,\r\nparticularly executive offices, is in its nature an executive function,\r\nthe compilers of the Constitution have, in this last point at least,\r\nviolated the rule established by themselves. I pass over the\r\nconstitutions of Rhode Island and Connecticut, because they were formed\r\nprior to the Revolution, and even before the principle under\r\nexamination had become an object of political attention. The\r\nconstitution of New York contains no declaration on this subject; but\r\nappears very clearly to have been framed with an eye to the danger of\r\nimproperly blending the different departments. It gives, nevertheless,\r\nto the executive magistrate, a partial control over the legislative\r\ndepartment; and, what is more, gives a like control to the judiciary\r\ndepartment; and even blends the executive and judiciary departments in\r\nthe exercise of this control. In its council of appointment members of\r\nthe legislative are associated with the executive authority, in the\r\nappointment of officers, both executive and judiciary. And its court\r\nfor the trial of impeachments and correction of errors is to consist of\r\none branch of the legislature and the principal members of the\r\njudiciary department. The constitution of New Jersey has blended the\r\ndifferent powers of government more than any of the preceding. The\r\ngovernor, who is the executive magistrate, is appointed by the\r\nlegislature; is chancellor and ordinary, or surrogate of the State; is\r\na member of the Supreme Court of Appeals, and president, with a casting\r\nvote, of one of the legislative branches. The same legislative branch\r\nacts again as executive council of the governor, and with him\r\nconstitutes the Court of Appeals. The members of the judiciary\r\ndepartment are appointed by the legislative department and removable by\r\none branch of it, on the impeachment of the other. According to the\r\nconstitution of Pennsylvania, the president, who is the head of the\r\nexecutive department, is annually elected by a vote in which the\r\nlegislative department predominates. In conjunction with an executive\r\ncouncil, he appoints the members of the judiciary department, and forms\r\na court of impeachment for trial of all officers, judiciary as well as\r\nexecutive. The judges of the Supreme Court and justices of the peace\r\nseem also to be removable by the legislature; and the executive power\r\nof pardoning in certain cases, to be referred to the same department.\r\nThe members of the executive council are made EX-OFFICIO justices of\r\npeace throughout the State. In Delaware, the chief executive magistrate\r\nis annually elected by the legislative department. The speakers of the\r\ntwo legislative branches are vice-presidents in the executive\r\ndepartment. The executive chief, with six others, appointed, three by\r\neach of the legislative branches constitutes the Supreme Court of\r\nAppeals; he is joined with the legislative department in the\r\nappointment of the other judges. Throughout the States, it appears that\r\nthe members of the legislature may at the same time be justices of the\r\npeace; in this State, the members of one branch of it are EX-OFFICIO\r\njustices of the peace; as are also the members of the executive\r\ncouncil. The principal officers of the executive department are\r\nappointed by the legislative; and one branch of the latter forms a\r\ncourt of impeachments. All officers may be removed on address of the\r\nlegislature. Maryland has adopted the maxim in the most unqualified\r\nterms; declaring that the legislative, executive, and judicial powers\r\nof government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each\r\nother. Her constitution, notwithstanding, makes the executive\r\nmagistrate appointable by the legislative department; and the members\r\nof the judiciary by the executive department. The language of Virginia\r\nis still more pointed on this subject. Her constitution declares, “that\r\nthe legislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate\r\nand distinct; so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to\r\nthe other; nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of\r\nthem at the same time, except that the justices of county courts shall\r\nbe eligible to either House of Assembly. “ Yet we find not only this\r\nexpress exception, with respect to the members of the inferior courts,\r\nbut that the chief magistrate, with his executive council, are\r\nappointable by the legislature; that two members of the latter are\r\ntriennially displaced at the pleasure of the legislature; and that all\r\nthe principal offices, both executive and judiciary, are filled by the\r\nsame department. The executive prerogative of pardon, also, is in one\r\ncase vested in the legislative department. The constitution of North\r\nCarolina, which declares “that the legislative, executive, and supreme\r\njudicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and distinct\r\nfrom each other,” refers, at the same time, to the legislative\r\ndepartment, the appointment not only of the executive chief, but all\r\nthe principal officers within both that and the judiciary department.\r\nIn South Carolina, the constitution makes the executive magistracy\r\neligible by the legislative department.\r\n\r\nIt gives to the latter, also, the appointment of the members of the\r\njudiciary department, including even justices of the peace and\r\nsheriffs; and the appointment of officers in the executive department,\r\ndown to captains in the army and navy of the State.\r\n\r\nIn the constitution of Georgia, where it is declared “that the\r\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and\r\ndistinct, so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the\r\nother,” we find that the executive department is to be filled by\r\nappointments of the legislature; and the executive prerogative of\r\npardon to be finally exercised by the same authority. Even justices of\r\nthe peace are to be appointed by the legislature. In citing these\r\ncases, in which the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments\r\nhave not been kept totally separate and distinct, I wish not to be\r\nregarded as an advocate for the particular organizations of the several\r\nState governments. I am fully aware that among the many excellent\r\nprinciples which they exemplify, they carry strong marks of the haste,\r\nand still stronger of the inexperience, under which they were framed.\r\nIt is but too obvious that in some instances the fundamental principle\r\nunder consideration has been violated by too great a mixture, and even\r\nan actual consolidation, of the different powers; and that in no\r\ninstance has a competent provision been made for maintaining in\r\npractice the separation delineated on paper. What I have wished to\r\nevince is, that the charge brought against the proposed Constitution,\r\nof violating the sacred maxim of free government, is warranted neither\r\nby the real meaning annexed to that maxim by its author, nor by the\r\nsense in which it has hitherto been understood in America. This\r\ninteresting subject will be resumed in the ensuing paper.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XLVIII.\r\n\r\nThese Departments Should Not Be So Far Separated as to Have No\r\nConstitutional Control Over Each Other\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 1, 1788.\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIt was shown in the last paper that the political apothegm there\r\nexamined does not require that the legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary departments should be wholly unconnected with each other. I\r\nshall undertake, in the next place, to show that unless these\r\ndepartments be so far connected and blended as to give to each a\r\nconstitutional control over the others, the degree of separation which\r\nthe maxim requires, as essential to a free government, can never in\r\npractice be duly maintained. It is agreed on all sides, that the powers\r\nproperly belonging to one of the departments ought not to be directly\r\nand completely administered by either of the other departments. It is\r\nequally evident, that none of them ought to possess, directly or\r\nindirectly, an overruling influence over the others, in the\r\nadministration of their respective powers. It will not be denied, that\r\npower is of an encroaching nature, and that it ought to be effectually\r\nrestrained from passing the limits assigned to it.\r\n\r\nAfter discriminating, therefore, in theory, the several classes of\r\npower, as they may in their nature be legislative, executive, or\r\njudiciary, the next and most difficult task is to provide some\r\npractical security for each, against the invasion of the others.\r\n\r\nWhat this security ought to be, is the great problem to be solved. Will\r\nit be sufficient to mark, with precision, the boundaries of these\r\ndepartments, in the constitution of the government, and to trust to\r\nthese parchment barriers against the encroaching spirit of power? This\r\nis the security which appears to have been principally relied on by the\r\ncompilers of most of the American constitutions. But experience assures\r\nus, that the efficacy of the provision has been greatly overrated; and\r\nthat some more adequate defense is indispensably necessary for the more\r\nfeeble, against the more powerful, members of the government. The\r\nlegislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its\r\nactivity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex. The founders\r\nof our republics have so much merit for the wisdom which they have\r\ndisplayed, that no task can be less pleasing than that of pointing out\r\nthe errors into which they have fallen. A respect for truth, however,\r\nobliges us to remark, that they seem never for a moment to have turned\r\ntheir eyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown and\r\nall-grasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate, supported and\r\nfortified by an hereditary branch of the legislative authority. They\r\nseem never to have recollected the danger from legislative usurpations,\r\nwhich, by assembling all power in the same hands, must lead to the same\r\ntyranny as is threatened by executive usurpations. In a government\r\nwhere numerous and extensive prerogatives are placed in the hands of an\r\nhereditary monarch, the executive department is very justly regarded as\r\nthe source of danger, and watched with all the jealousy which a zeal\r\nfor liberty ought to inspire. In a democracy, where a multitude of\r\npeople exercise in person the legislative functions, and are\r\ncontinually exposed, by their incapacity for regular deliberation and\r\nconcerted measures, to the ambitious intrigues of their executive\r\nmagistrates, tyranny may well be apprehended, on some favorable\r\nemergency, to start up in the same quarter. But in a representative\r\nrepublic, where the executive magistracy is carefully limited; both in\r\nthe extent and the duration of its power; and where the legislative\r\npower is exercised by an assembly, which is inspired, by a supposed\r\ninfluence over the people, with an intrepid confidence in its own\r\nstrength; which is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which\r\nactuate a multitude, yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing\r\nthe objects of its passions, by means which reason prescribes; it is\r\nagainst the enterprising ambition of this department that the people\r\nought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions.\r\nThe legislative department derives a superiority in our governments\r\nfrom other circumstances. Its constitutional powers being at once more\r\nextensive, and less susceptible of precise limits, it can, with the\r\ngreater facility, mask, under complicated and indirect measures, the\r\nencroachments which it makes on the co-ordinate departments. It is not\r\nunfrequently a question of real nicety in legislative bodies, whether\r\nthe operation of a particular measure will, or will not, extend beyond\r\nthe legislative sphere. On the other side, the executive power being\r\nrestrained within a narrower compass, and being more simple in its\r\nnature, and the judiciary being described by landmarks still less\r\nuncertain, projects of usurpation by either of these departments would\r\nimmediately betray and defeat themselves. Nor is this all: as the\r\nlegislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people,\r\nand has in some constitutions full discretion, and in all a prevailing\r\ninfluence, over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other\r\ndepartments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives\r\nstill greater facility to encroachments of the former. I have appealed\r\nto our own experience for the truth of what I advance on this subject.\r\nWere it necessary to verify this experience by particular proofs, they\r\nmight be multiplied without end. I might find a witness in every\r\ncitizen who has shared in, or been attentive to, the course of public\r\nadministrations. I might collect vouchers in abundance from the records\r\nand archives of every State in the Union. But as a more concise, and at\r\nthe same time equally satisfactory, evidence, I will refer to the\r\nexample of two States, attested by two unexceptionable authorities. The\r\nfirst example is that of Virginia, a State which, as we have seen, has\r\nexpressly declared in its constitution, that the three great\r\ndepartments ought not to be intermixed. The authority in support of it\r\nis Mr. Jefferson, who, besides his other advantages for remarking the\r\noperation of the government, was himself the chief magistrate of it. In\r\norder to convey fully the ideas with which his experience had impressed\r\nhim on this subject, it will be necessary to quote a passage of some\r\nlength from his very interesting “Notes on the State of Virginia,” p.\r\n195. “All the powers of government, legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary, result to the legislative body. The concentrating these in\r\nthe same hands, is precisely the definition of despotic government. It\r\nwill be no alleviation, that these powers will be exercised by a\r\nplurality of hands, and not by a single one. One hundred and\r\nseventy-three despots would surely be as oppressive as one. Let those\r\nwho doubt it, turn their eyes on the republic of Venice. As little will\r\nit avail us, that they are chosen by ourselves. An ELECTIVE DESPOTISM\r\nwas not the government we fought for; but one which should not only be\r\nfounded on free principles, but in which the powers of government\r\nshould be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy,\r\nas that no one could transcend their legal limits, without being\r\neffectually checked and restrained by the others.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, that convention which passed the ordinance of\r\ngovernment, laid its foundation on this basis, that the legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judiciary departments should be separate and distinct,\r\nso that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them\r\nat the same time. BUT NO BARRIER WAS PROVIDED BETWEEN THESE SEVERAL\r\nPOWERS. The judiciary and the executive members were left dependent on\r\nthe legislative for their subsistence in office, and some of them for\r\ntheir continuance in it. If, therefore, the legislature assumes\r\nexecutive and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be made;\r\nnor, if made, can be effectual; because in that case they may put their\r\nproceedings into the form of acts of Assembly, which will render them\r\nobligatory on the other branches. They have accordingly, IN MANY\r\ninstances, DECIDED RIGHTS which should have been left to JUDICIARY\r\nCONTROVERSY, and THE DIRECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE, DURING THE WHOLE TIME\r\nOF THEIR SESSION, IS BECOMING HABITUAL AND FAMILIAR. “The other State\r\nwhich I shall take for an example is Pennsylvania; and the other\r\nauthority, the Council of Censors, which assembled in the years 1783\r\nand 1784. A part of the duty of this body, as marked out by the\r\nconstitution, was “to inquire whether the constitution had been\r\npreserved inviolate in every part; and whether the legislative and\r\nexecutive branches of government had performed their duty as guardians\r\nof the people, or assumed to themselves, or exercised, other or greater\r\npowers than they are entitled to by the constitution. “ In the\r\nexecution of this trust, the council were necessarily led to a\r\ncomparison of both the legislative and executive proceedings, with the\r\nconstitutional powers of these departments; and from the facts\r\nenumerated, and to the truth of most of which both sides in the council\r\nsubscribed, it appears that the constitution had been flagrantly\r\nviolated by the legislature in a variety of important instances. A\r\ngreat number of laws had been passed, violating, without any apparent\r\nnecessity, the rule requiring that all bills of a public nature shall\r\nbe previously printed for the consideration of the people; although\r\nthis is one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the constitution\r\nagainst improper acts of legislature. The constitutional trial by jury\r\nhad been violated, and powers assumed which had not been delegated by\r\nthe constitution.\r\n\r\nExecutive powers had been usurped. The salaries of the judges, which\r\nthe constitution expressly requires to be fixed, had been occasionally\r\nvaried; and cases belonging to the judiciary department frequently\r\ndrawn within legislative cognizance and determination. Those who wish\r\nto see the several particulars falling under each of these heads, may\r\nconsult the journals of the council, which are in print. Some of them,\r\nit will be found, may be imputable to peculiar circumstances connected\r\nwith the war; but the greater part of them may be considered as the\r\nspontaneous shoots of an ill-constituted government. It appears, also,\r\nthat the executive department had not been innocent of frequent\r\nbreaches of the constitution. There are three observations, however,\r\nwhich ought to be made on this head: FIRST, a great proportion of the\r\ninstances were either immediately produced by the necessities of the\r\nwar, or recommended by Congress or the commander-in-chief; SECONDLY, in\r\nmost of the other instances, they conformed either to the declared or\r\nthe known sentiments of the legislative department; THIRDLY, the\r\nexecutive department of Pennsylvania is distinguished from that of the\r\nother States by the number of members composing it. In this respect, it\r\nhas as much affinity to a legislative assembly as to an executive\r\ncouncil. And being at once exempt from the restraint of an individual\r\nresponsibility for the acts of the body, and deriving confidence from\r\nmutual example and joint influence, unauthorized measures would, of\r\ncourse, be more freely hazarded, than where the executive department is\r\nadministered by a single hand, or by a few hands.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion which I am warranted in drawing from these observations\r\nis, that a mere demarcation on parchment of the constitutional limits\r\nof the several departments, is not a sufficient guard against those\r\nencroachments which lead to a tyrannical concentration of all the\r\npowers of government in the same hands.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. XLIX.\r\n\r\nMethod of Guarding Against the Encroachments of Any One Department of\r\nGovernment by Appealing to the People Through a Convention\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 5, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe author of the “Notes on the State of Virginia,” quoted in the last\r\npaper, has subjoined to that valuable work the draught of a\r\nconstitution, which had been prepared in order to be laid before a\r\nconvention, expected to be called in 1783, by the legislature, for the\r\nestablishment of a constitution for that commonwealth. The plan, like\r\nevery thing from the same pen, marks a turn of thinking, original,\r\ncomprehensive, and accurate; and is the more worthy of attention as it\r\nequally displays a fervent attachment to republican government and an\r\nenlightened view of the dangerous propensities against which it ought\r\nto be guarded.\r\n\r\nOne of the precautions which he proposes, and on which he appears\r\nultimately to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of power\r\nagainst the invasions of the stronger, is perhaps altogether his own,\r\nand as it immediately relates to the subject of our present inquiry,\r\nought not to be overlooked. His proposition is, “that whenever any two\r\nof the three branches of government shall concur in opinion, each by\r\nthe voices of two thirds of their whole number, that a convention is\r\nnecessary for altering the constitution, or CORRECTING BREACHES OF IT,\r\na convention shall be called for the purpose. “As the people are the\r\nonly legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the\r\nconstitutional charter, under which the several branches of government\r\nhold their power, is derived, it seems strictly consonant to the\r\nrepublican theory, to recur to the same original authority, not only\r\nwhenever it may be necessary to enlarge, diminish, or new-model the\r\npowers of the government, but also whenever any one of the departments\r\nmay commit encroachments on the chartered authorities of the others.\r\nThe several departments being perfectly co-ordinate by the terms of\r\ntheir common commission, none of them, it is evident, can pretend to an\r\nexclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between their\r\nrespective powers; and how are the encroachments of the stronger to be\r\nprevented, or the wrongs of the weaker to be redressed, without an\r\nappeal to the people themselves, who, as the grantors of the\r\ncommissions, can alone declare its true meaning, and enforce its\r\nobservance? There is certainly great force in this reasoning, and it\r\nmust be allowed to prove that a constitutional road to the decision of\r\nthe people ought to be marked out and kept open, for certain great and\r\nextraordinary occasions. But there appear to be insuperable objections\r\nagainst the proposed recurrence to the people, as a provision in all\r\ncases for keeping the several departments of power within their\r\nconstitutional limits. In the first place, the provision does not reach\r\nthe case of a combination of two of the departments against the third.\r\nIf the legislative authority, which possesses so many means of\r\noperating on the motives of the other departments, should be able to\r\ngain to its interest either of the others, or even one third of its\r\nmembers, the remaining department could derive no advantage from its\r\nremedial provision. I do not dwell, however, on this objection, because\r\nit may be thought to be rather against the modification of the\r\nprinciple, than against the principle itself. In the next place, it may\r\nbe considered as an objection inherent in the principle, that as every\r\nappeal to the people would carry an implication of some defect in the\r\ngovernment, frequent appeals would, in a great measure, deprive the\r\ngovernment of that veneration which time bestows on every thing, and\r\nwithout which perhaps the wisest and freest governments would not\r\npossess the requisite stability. If it be true that all governments\r\nrest on opinion, it is no less true that the strength of opinion in\r\neach individual, and its practical influence on his conduct, depend\r\nmuch on the number which he supposes to have entertained the same\r\nopinion. The reason of man, like man himself, is timid and cautious\r\nwhen left alone, and acquires firmness and confidence in proportion to\r\nthe number with which it is associated. When the examples which fortify\r\nopinion are ANCIENT as well as NUMEROUS, they are known to have a\r\ndouble effect. In a nation of philosophers, this consideration ought to\r\nbe disregarded. A reverence for the laws would be sufficiently\r\ninculcated by the voice of an enlightened reason. But a nation of\r\nphilosophers is as little to be expected as the philosophical race of\r\nkings wished for by Plato. And in every other nation, the most rational\r\ngovernment will not find it a superfluous advantage to have the\r\nprejudices of the community on its side. The danger of disturbing the\r\npublic tranquillity by interesting too strongly the public passions, is\r\na still more serious objection against a frequent reference of\r\nconstitutional questions to the decision of the whole society.\r\nNotwithstanding the success which has attended the revisions of our\r\nestablished forms of government, and which does so much honor to the\r\nvirtue and intelligence of the people of America, it must be confessed\r\nthat the experiments are of too ticklish a nature to be unnecessarily\r\nmultiplied. We are to recollect that all the existing constitutions\r\nwere formed in the midst of a danger which repressed the passions most\r\nunfriendly to order and concord; of an enthusiastic confidence of the\r\npeople in their patriotic leaders, which stifled the ordinary diversity\r\nof opinions on great national questions; of a universal ardor for new\r\nand opposite forms, produced by a universal resentment and indignation\r\nagainst the ancient government; and whilst no spirit of party connected\r\nwith the changes to be made, or the abuses to be reformed, could mingle\r\nits leaven in the operation. The future situations in which we must\r\nexpect to be usually placed, do not present any equivalent security\r\nagainst the danger which is apprehended. But the greatest objection of\r\nall is, that the decisions which would probably result from such\r\nappeals would not answer the purpose of maintaining the constitutional\r\nequilibrium of the government. We have seen that the tendency of\r\nrepublican governments is to an aggrandizement of the legislative at\r\nthe expense of the other departments. The appeals to the people,\r\ntherefore, would usually be made by the executive and judiciary\r\ndepartments. But whether made by one side or the other, would each side\r\nenjoy equal advantages on the trial? Let us view their different\r\nsituations. The members of the executive and judiciary departments are\r\nfew in number, and can be personally known to a small part only of the\r\npeople. The latter, by the mode of their appointment, as well as by the\r\nnature and permanency of it, are too far removed from the people to\r\nshare much in their prepossessions. The former are generally the\r\nobjects of jealousy, and their administration is always liable to be\r\ndiscolored and rendered unpopular. The members of the legislative\r\ndepartment, on the other hand, are numberous. They are distributed and\r\ndwell among the people at large. Their connections of blood, of\r\nfriendship, and of acquaintance embrace a great proportion of the most\r\ninfluential part of the society. The nature of their public trust\r\nimplies a personal influence among the people, and that they are more\r\nimmediately the confidential guardians of the rights and liberties of\r\nthe people. With these advantages, it can hardly be supposed that the\r\nadverse party would have an equal chance for a favorable issue. But the\r\nlegislative party would not only be able to plead their cause most\r\nsuccessfully with the people. They would probably be constituted\r\nthemselves the judges.\r\n\r\nThe same influence which had gained them an election into the\r\nlegislature, would gain them a seat in the convention. If this should\r\nnot be the case with all, it would probably be the case with many, and\r\npretty certainly with those leading characters, on whom every thing\r\ndepends in such bodies. The convention, in short, would be composed\r\nchiefly of men who had been, who actually were, or who expected to be,\r\nmembers of the department whose conduct was arraigned. They would\r\nconsequently be parties to the very question to be decided by them. It\r\nmight, however, sometimes happen, that appeals would be made under\r\ncircumstances less adverse to the executive and judiciary departments.\r\nThe usurpations of the legislature might be so flagrant and so sudden,\r\nas to admit of no specious coloring. A strong party among themselves\r\nmight take side with the other branches. The executive power might be\r\nin the hands of a peculiar favorite of the people. In such a posture of\r\nthings, the public decision might be less swayed by prepossessions in\r\nfavor of the legislative party. But still it could never be expected to\r\nturn on the true merits of the question. It would inevitably be\r\nconnected with the spirit of pre-existing parties, or of parties\r\nspringing out of the question itself. It would be connected with\r\npersons of distinguished character and extensive influence in the\r\ncommunity. It would be pronounced by the very men who had been agents\r\nin, or opponents of, the measures to which the decision would relate.\r\nThe PASSIONS, therefore, not the REASON, of the public would sit in\r\njudgment. But it is the reason, alone, of the public, that ought to\r\ncontrol and regulate the government. The passions ought to be\r\ncontrolled and regulated by the government.\r\n\r\nWe found in the last paper, that mere declarations in the written\r\nconstitution are not sufficient to restrain the several departments\r\nwithin their legal rights. It appears in this, that occasional appeals\r\nto the people would be neither a proper nor an effectual provision for\r\nthat purpose. How far the provisions of a different nature contained in\r\nthe plan above quoted might be adequate, I do not examine. Some of them\r\nare unquestionably founded on sound political principles, and all of\r\nthem are framed with singular ingenuity and precision.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. L.\r\n\r\nPeriodical Appeals to the People Considered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 5, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIt may be contended, perhaps, that instead of OCCASIONAL appeals to the\r\npeople, which are liable to the objections urged against them,\r\nPERIODICAL appeals are the proper and adequate means of PREVENTING AND\r\nCORRECTING INFRACTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION. It will be attended to,\r\nthat in the examination of these expedients, I confine myself to their\r\naptitude for ENFORCING the Constitution, by keeping the several\r\ndepartments of power within their due bounds, without particularly\r\nconsidering them as provisions for ALTERING the Constitution itself. In\r\nthe first view, appeals to the people at fixed periods appear to be\r\nnearly as ineligible as appeals on particular occasions as they emerge.\r\n\r\nIf the periods be separated by short intervals, the measures to be\r\nreviewed and rectified will have been of recent date, and will be\r\nconnected with all the circumstances which tend to vitiate and pervert\r\nthe result of occasional revisions. If the periods be distant from each\r\nother, the same remark will be applicable to all recent measures; and\r\nin proportion as the remoteness of the others may favor a dispassionate\r\nreview of them, this advantage is inseparable from inconveniences which\r\nseem to counterbalance it. In the first place, a distant prospect of\r\npublic censure would be a very feeble restraint on power from those\r\nexcesses to which it might be urged by the force of present motives. Is\r\nit to be imagined that a legislative assembly, consisting of a hundred\r\nor two hundred members, eagerly bent on some favorite object, and\r\nbreaking through the restraints of the Constitution in pursuit of it,\r\nwould be arrested in their career, by considerations drawn from a\r\ncensorial revision of their conduct at the future distance of ten,\r\nfifteen, or twenty years? In the next place, the abuses would often\r\nhave completed their mischievous effects before the remedial provision\r\nwould be applied. And in the last place, where this might not be the\r\ncase, they would be of long standing, would have taken deep root, and\r\nwould not easily be extirpated. The scheme of revising the\r\nconstitution, in order to correct recent breaches of it, as well as for\r\nother purposes, has been actually tried in one of the States. One of\r\nthe objects of the Council of Censors which met in Pennsylvania in 1783\r\nand 1784, was, as we have seen, to inquire, “whether the constitution\r\nhad been violated, and whether the legislative and executive\r\ndepartments had encroached upon each other. “ This important and novel\r\nexperiment in politics merits, in several points of view, very\r\nparticular attention. In some of them it may, perhaps, as a single\r\nexperiment, made under circumstances somewhat peculiar, be thought to\r\nbe not absolutely conclusive. But as applied to the case under\r\nconsideration, it involves some facts, which I venture to remark, as a\r\ncomplete and satisfactory illustration of the reasoning which I have\r\nemployed. First. It appears, from the names of the gentlemen who\r\ncomposed the council, that some, at least, of its most active members\r\nhad also been active and leading characters in the parties which\r\npre-existed in the State.\r\n\r\nSecondly. It appears that the same active and leading members of the\r\ncouncil had been active and influential members of the legislative and\r\nexecutive branches, within the period to be reviewed; and even patrons\r\nor opponents of the very measures to be thus brought to the test of the\r\nconstitution. Two of the members had been vice-presidents of the State,\r\nand several other members of the executive council, within the seven\r\npreceding years. One of them had been speaker, and a number of others\r\ndistinguished members, of the legislative assembly within the same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThirdly. Every page of their proceedings witnesses the effect of all\r\nthese circumstances on the temper of their deliberations. Throughout\r\nthe continuance of the council, it was split into two fixed and violent\r\nparties. The fact is acknowledged and lamented by themselves. Had this\r\nnot been the case, the face of their proceedings exhibits a proof\r\nequally satisfactory. In all questions, however unimportant in\r\nthemselves, or unconnected with each other, the same names stand\r\ninvariably contrasted on the opposite columns. Every unbiased observer\r\nmay infer, without danger of mistake, and at the same time without\r\nmeaning to reflect on either party, or any individuals of either party,\r\nthat, unfortunately, PASSION, not REASON, must have presided over their\r\ndecisions. When men exercise their reason coolly and freely on a\r\nvariety of distinct questions, they inevitably fall into different\r\nopinions on some of them. When they are governed by a common passion,\r\ntheir opinions, if they are so to be called, will be the same.\r\n\r\nFourthly. It is at least problematical, whether the decisions of this\r\nbody do not, in several instances, misconstrue the limits prescribed\r\nfor the legislative and executive departments, instead of reducing and\r\nlimiting them within their constitutional places.\r\n\r\nFifthly. I have never understood that the decisions of the council on\r\nconstitutional questions, whether rightly or erroneously formed, have\r\nhad any effect in varying the practice founded on legislative\r\nconstructions. It even appears, if I mistake not, that in one instance\r\nthe contemporary legislature denied the constructions of the council,\r\nand actually prevailed in the contest. This censorial body, therefore,\r\nproves at the same time, by its researches, the existence of the\r\ndisease, and by its example, the inefficacy of the remedy. This\r\nconclusion cannot be invalidated by alleging that the State in which\r\nthe experiment was made was at that crisis, and had been for a long\r\ntime before, violently heated and distracted by the rage of party. Is\r\nit to be presumed, that at any future septennial epoch the same State\r\nwill be free from parties? Is it to be presumed that any other State,\r\nat the same or any other given period, will be exempt from them? Such\r\nan event ought to be neither presumed nor desired; because an\r\nextinction of parties necessarily implies either a universal alarm for\r\nthe public safety, or an absolute extinction of liberty. Were the\r\nprecaution taken of excluding from the assemblies elected by the\r\npeople, to revise the preceding administration of the government, all\r\npersons who should have been concerned with the government within the\r\ngiven period, the difficulties would not be obviated. The important\r\ntask would probably devolve on men, who, with inferior capacities,\r\nwould in other respects be little better qualified. Although they might\r\nnot have been personally concerned in the administration, and therefore\r\nnot immediately agents in the measures to be examined, they would\r\nprobably have been involved in the parties connected with these\r\nmeasures, and have been elected under their auspices.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LI.\r\n\r\nThe Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks and\r\nBalances Between the Different Departments\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 8, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTo what expedient, then, shall we finally resort, for maintaining in\r\npractice the necessary partition of power among the several\r\ndepartments, as laid down in the Constitution? The only answer that can\r\nbe given is, that as all these exterior provisions are found to be\r\ninadequate, the defect must be supplied, by so contriving the interior\r\nstructure of the government as that its several constituent parts may,\r\nby their mutual relations, be the means of keeping each other in their\r\nproper places. Without presuming to undertake a full development of\r\nthis important idea, I will hazard a few general observations, which\r\nmay perhaps place it in a clearer light, and enable us to form a more\r\ncorrect judgment of the principles and structure of the government\r\nplanned by the convention. In order to lay a due foundation for that\r\nseparate and distinct exercise of the different powers of government,\r\nwhich to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to be essential to\r\nthe preservation of liberty, it is evident that each department should\r\nhave a will of its own; and consequently should be so constituted that\r\nthe members of each should have as little agency as possible in the\r\nappointment of the members of the others. Were this principle\r\nrigorously adhered to, it would require that all the appointments for\r\nthe supreme executive, legislative, and judiciary magistracies should\r\nbe drawn from the same fountain of authority, the people, through\r\nchannels having no communication whatever with one another. Perhaps\r\nsuch a plan of constructing the several departments would be less\r\ndifficult in practice than it may in contemplation appear. Some\r\ndifficulties, however, and some additional expense would attend the\r\nexecution of it. Some deviations, therefore, from the principle must be\r\nadmitted. In the constitution of the judiciary department in\r\nparticular, it might be inexpedient to insist rigorously on the\r\nprinciple: first, because peculiar qualifications being essential in\r\nthe members, the primary consideration ought to be to select that mode\r\nof choice which best secures these qualifications; secondly, because\r\nthe permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that\r\ndepartment, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the authority\r\nconferring them. It is equally evident, that the members of each\r\ndepartment should be as little dependent as possible on those of the\r\nothers, for the emoluments annexed to their offices. Were the executive\r\nmagistrate, or the judges, not independent of the legislature in this\r\nparticular, their independence in every other would be merely nominal.\r\nBut the great security against a gradual concentration of the several\r\npowers in the same department, consists in giving to those who\r\nadminister each department the necessary constitutional means and\r\npersonal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The provision\r\nfor defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate\r\nto the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.\r\nThe interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional\r\nrights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such\r\ndevices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But\r\nwhat is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human\r\nnature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels\r\nwere to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on\r\ngovernment would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be\r\nadministered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you\r\nmust first enable the government to control the governed; and in the\r\nnext place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is,\r\nno doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has\r\ntaught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions. This policy of\r\nsupplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better\r\nmotives, might be traced through the whole system of human affairs,\r\nprivate as well as public. We see it particularly displayed in all the\r\nsubordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to divide\r\nand arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a\r\ncheck on the other that the private interest of every individual may be\r\na sentinel over the public rights. These inventions of prudence cannot\r\nbe less requisite in the distribution of the supreme powers of the\r\nState. But it is not possible to give to each department an equal power\r\nof self-defense. In republican government, the legislative authority\r\nnecessarily predominates. The remedy for this inconveniency is to\r\ndivide the legislature into different branches; and to render them, by\r\ndifferent modes of election and different principles of action, as\r\nlittle connected with each other as the nature of their common\r\nfunctions and their common dependence on the society will admit. It may\r\neven be necessary to guard against dangerous encroachments by still\r\nfurther precautions. As the weight of the legislative authority\r\nrequires that it should be thus divided, the weakness of the executive\r\nmay require, on the other hand, that it should be fortified. An\r\nabsolute negative on the legislature appears, at first view, to be the\r\nnatural defense with which the executive magistrate should be armed.\r\nBut perhaps it would be neither altogether safe nor alone sufficient.\r\nOn ordinary occasions it might not be exerted with the requisite\r\nfirmness, and on extraordinary occasions it might be perfidiously\r\nabused. May not this defect of an absolute negative be supplied by some\r\nqualified connection between this weaker department and the weaker\r\nbranch of the stronger department, by which the latter may be led to\r\nsupport the constitutional rights of the former, without being too much\r\ndetached from the rights of its own department? If the principles on\r\nwhich these observations are founded be just, as I persuade myself they\r\nare, and they be applied as a criterion to the several State\r\nconstitutions, and to the federal Constitution it will be found that if\r\nthe latter does not perfectly correspond with them, the former are\r\ninfinitely less able to bear such a test. There are, moreover, two\r\nconsiderations particularly applicable to the federal system of\r\nAmerica, which place that system in a very interesting point of view.\r\nFirst. In a single republic, all the power surrendered by the people is\r\nsubmitted to the administration of a single government; and the\r\nusurpations are guarded against by a division of the government into\r\ndistinct and separate departments. In the compound republic of America,\r\nthe power surrendered by the people is first divided between two\r\ndistinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each subdivided\r\namong distinct and separate departments. Hence a double security arises\r\nto the rights of the people. The different governments will control\r\neach other, at the same time that each will be controlled by itself.\r\nSecond. It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the\r\nsociety against the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of\r\nthe society against the injustice of the other part. Different\r\ninterests necessarily exist in different classes of citizens. If a\r\nmajority be united by a common interest, the rights of the minority\r\nwill be insecure. There are but two methods of providing against this\r\nevil: the one by creating a will in the community independent of the\r\nmajority that is, of the society itself; the other, by comprehending in\r\nthe society so many separate descriptions of citizens as will render an\r\nunjust combination of a majority of the whole very improbable, if not\r\nimpracticable. The first method prevails in all governments possessing\r\nan hereditary or self-appointed authority. This, at best, is but a\r\nprecarious security; because a power independent of the society may as\r\nwell espouse the unjust views of the major, as the rightful interests\r\nof the minor party, and may possibly be turned against both parties.\r\nThe second method will be exemplified in the federal republic of the\r\nUnited States. Whilst all authority in it will be derived from and\r\ndependent on the society, the society itself will be broken into so\r\nmany parts, interests, and classes of citizens, that the rights of\r\nindividuals, or of the minority, will be in little danger from\r\ninterested combinations of the majority. In a free government the\r\nsecurity for civil rights must be the same as that for religious\r\nrights. It consists in the one case in the multiplicity of interests,\r\nand in the other in the multiplicity of sects. The degree of security\r\nin both cases will depend on the number of interests and sects; and\r\nthis may be presumed to depend on the extent of country and number of\r\npeople comprehended under the same government. This view of the subject\r\nmust particularly recommend a proper federal system to all the sincere\r\nand considerate friends of republican government, since it shows that\r\nin exact proportion as the territory of the Union may be formed into\r\nmore circumscribed Confederacies, or States oppressive combinations of\r\na majority will be facilitated: the best security, under the republican\r\nforms, for the rights of every class of citizens, will be diminished:\r\nand consequently the stability and independence of some member of the\r\ngovernment, the only other security, must be proportionately increased.\r\nJustice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It\r\never has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained, or until\r\nliberty be lost in the pursuit. In a society under the forms of which\r\nthe stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy\r\nmay as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature, where the weaker\r\nindividual is not secured against the violence of the stronger; and as,\r\nin the latter state, even the stronger individuals are prompted, by the\r\nuncertainty of their condition, to submit to a government which may\r\nprotect the weak as well as themselves; so, in the former state, will\r\nthe more powerful factions or parties be gradually induced, by a like\r\nmotive, to wish for a government which will protect all parties, the\r\nweaker as well as the more powerful. It can be little doubted that if\r\nthe State of Rhode Island was separated from the Confederacy and left\r\nto itself, the insecurity of rights under the popular form of\r\ngovernment within such narrow limits would be displayed by such\r\nreiterated oppressions of factious majorities that some power\r\naltogether independent of the people would soon be called for by the\r\nvoice of the very factions whose misrule had proved the necessity of\r\nit. In the extended republic of the United States, and among the great\r\nvariety of interests, parties, and sects which it embraces, a coalition\r\nof a majority of the whole society could seldom take place on any other\r\nprinciples than those of justice and the general good; whilst there\r\nbeing thus less danger to a minor from the will of a major party, there\r\nmust be less pretext, also, to provide for the security of the former,\r\nby introducing into the government a will not dependent on the latter,\r\nor, in other words, a will independent of the society itself. It is no\r\nless certain than it is important, notwithstanding the contrary\r\nopinions which have been entertained, that the larger the society,\r\nprovided it lie within a practical sphere, the more duly capable it\r\nwill be of self-government. And happily for the REPUBLICAN CAUSE, the\r\npracticable sphere may be carried to a very great extent, by a\r\njudicious modification and mixture of the FEDERAL PRINCIPLE.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LII.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 8, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nFrom the more general inquiries pursued in the four last papers, I pass\r\non to a more particular examination of the several parts of the\r\ngovernment. I shall begin with the House of Representatives. The first\r\nview to be taken of this part of the government relates to the\r\nqualifications of the electors and the elected. Those of the former are\r\nto be the same with those of the electors of the most numerous branch\r\nof the State legislatures.\r\n\r\nThe definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded as a\r\nfundamental article of republican government. It was incumbent on the\r\nconvention, therefore, to define and establish this right in the\r\nConstitution. To have left it open for the occasional regulation of the\r\nCongress, would have been improper for the reason just mentioned. To\r\nhave submitted it to the legislative discretion of the States, would\r\nhave been improper for the same reason; and for the additional reason\r\nthat it would have rendered too dependent on the State governments that\r\nbranch of the federal government which ought to be dependent on the\r\npeople alone. To have reduced the different qualifications in the\r\ndifferent States to one uniform rule, would probably have been as\r\ndissatisfactory to some of the States as it would have been difficult\r\nto the convention. The provision made by the convention appears,\r\ntherefore, to be the best that lay within their option.\r\n\r\nIt must be satisfactory to every State, because it is conformable to\r\nthe standard already established, or which may be established, by the\r\nState itself. It will be safe to the United States, because, being\r\nfixed by the State constitutions, it is not alterable by the State\r\ngovernments, and it cannot be feared that the people of the States will\r\nalter this part of their constitutions in such a manner as to abridge\r\nthe rights secured to them by the federal Constitution. The\r\nqualifications of the elected, being less carefully and properly\r\ndefined by the State constitutions, and being at the same time more\r\nsusceptible of uniformity, have been very properly considered and\r\nregulated by the convention. A representative of the United States must\r\nbe of the age of twenty-five years; must have been seven years a\r\ncitizen of the United States; must, at the time of his election, be an\r\ninhabitant of the State he is to represent; and, during the time of his\r\nservice, must be in no office under the United States. Under these\r\nreasonable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government\r\nis open to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive,\r\nwhether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to\r\nany particular profession of religious faith. The term for which the\r\nrepresentatives are to be elected falls under a second view which may\r\nbe taken of this branch. In order to decide on the propriety of this\r\narticle, two questions must be considered: first, whether biennial\r\nelections will, in this case, be safe; secondly, whether they be\r\nnecessary or useful. First. As it is essential to liberty that the\r\ngovernment in general should have a common interest with the people, so\r\nit is particularly essential that the branch of it under consideration\r\nshould have an immediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with,\r\nthe people. Frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by\r\nwhich this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured. But what\r\nparticular degree of frequency may be absolutely necessary for the\r\npurpose, does not appear to be susceptible of any precise calculation,\r\nand must depend on a variety of circumstances with which it may be\r\nconnected. Let us consult experience, the guide that ought always to be\r\nfollowed whenever it can be found. The scheme of representation, as a\r\nsubstitute for a meeting of the citizens in person, being at most but\r\nvery imperfectly known to ancient polity, it is in more modern times\r\nonly that we are to expect instructive examples. And even here, in\r\norder to avoid a research too vague and diffusive, it will be proper to\r\nconfine ourselves to the few examples which are best known, and which\r\nbear the greatest analogy to our particular case. The first to which\r\nthis character ought to be applied, is the House of Commons in Great\r\nBritain. The history of this branch of the English Constitution,\r\nanterior to the date of Magna Charta, is too obscure to yield\r\ninstruction. The very existence of it has been made a question among\r\npolitical antiquaries. The earliest records of subsequent date prove\r\nthat parliaments were to SIT only every year; not that they were to be\r\nELECTED every year. And even these annual sessions were left so much at\r\nthe discretion of the monarch, that, under various pretexts, very long\r\nand dangerous intermissions were often contrived by royal ambition. To\r\nremedy this grievance, it was provided by a statute in the reign of\r\nCharles II. , that the intermissions should not be protracted beyond a\r\nperiod of three years. On the accession of William III., when a\r\nrevolution took place in the government, the subject was still more\r\nseriously resumed, and it was declared to be among the fundamental\r\nrights of the people that parliaments ought to be held FREQUENTLY. By\r\nanother statute, which passed a few years later in the same reign, the\r\nterm “frequently,” which had alluded to the triennial period settled in\r\nthe time of Charles II., is reduced to a precise meaning, it being\r\nexpressly enacted that a new parliament shall be called within three\r\nyears after the termination of the former. The last change, from three\r\nto seven years, is well known to have been introduced pretty early in\r\nthe present century, under on alarm for the Hanoverian succession. From\r\nthese facts it appears that the greatest frequency of elections which\r\nhas been deemed necessary in that kingdom, for binding the\r\nrepresentatives to their constituents, does not exceed a triennial\r\nreturn of them. And if we may argue from the degree of liberty retained\r\neven under septennial elections, and all the other vicious ingredients\r\nin the parliamentary constitution, we cannot doubt that a reduction of\r\nthe period from seven to three years, with the other necessary reforms,\r\nwould so far extend the influence of the people over their\r\nrepresentatives as to satisfy us that biennial elections, under the\r\nfederal system, cannot possibly be dangerous to the requisite\r\ndependence of the House of Representatives on their constituents.\r\nElections in Ireland, till of late, were regulated entirely by the\r\ndiscretion of the crown, and were seldom repeated, except on the\r\naccession of a new prince, or some other contingent event. The\r\nparliament which commenced with George II. was continued throughout his\r\nwhole reign, a period of about thirty-five years. The only dependence\r\nof the representatives on the people consisted in the right of the\r\nlatter to supply occasional vacancies by the election of new members,\r\nand in the chance of some event which might produce a general new\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nThe ability also of the Irish parliament to maintain the rights of\r\ntheir constituents, so far as the disposition might exist, was\r\nextremely shackled by the control of the crown over the subjects of\r\ntheir deliberation. Of late these shackles, if I mistake not, have been\r\nbroken; and octennial parliaments have besides been established. What\r\neffect may be produced by this partial reform, must be left to further\r\nexperience. The example of Ireland, from this view of it, can throw but\r\nlittle light on the subject. As far as we can draw any conclusion from\r\nit, it must be that if the people of that country have been able under\r\nall these disadvantages to retain any liberty whatever, the advantage\r\nof biennial elections would secure to them every degree of liberty,\r\nwhich might depend on a due connection between their representatives\r\nand themselves. Let us bring our inquiries nearer home. The example of\r\nthese States, when British colonies, claims particular attention, at\r\nthe same time that it is so well known as to require little to be said\r\non it. The principle of representation, in one branch of the\r\nlegislature at least, was established in all of them. But the periods\r\nof election were different. They varied from one to seven years. Have\r\nwe any reason to infer, from the spirit and conduct of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people, prior to the Revolution, that biennial\r\nelections would have been dangerous to the public liberties? The spirit\r\nwhich everywhere displayed itself at the commencement of the struggle,\r\nand which vanquished the obstacles to independence, is the best of\r\nproofs that a sufficient portion of liberty had been everywhere enjoyed\r\nto inspire both a sense of its worth and a zeal for its proper\r\nenlargement This remark holds good, as well with regard to the then\r\ncolonies whose elections were least frequent, as to those whose\r\nelections were most frequent Virginia was the colony which stood first\r\nin resisting the parliamentary usurpations of Great Britain; it was the\r\nfirst also in espousing, by public act, the resolution of independence.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, nevertheless, if I have not been misinformed, elections\r\nunder the former government were septennial. This particular example is\r\nbrought into view, not as a proof of any peculiar merit, for the\r\npriority in those instances was probably accidental; and still less of\r\nany advantage in SEPTENNIAL elections, for when compared with a greater\r\nfrequency they are inadmissible; but merely as a proof, and I conceive\r\nit to be a very substantial proof, that the liberties of the people can\r\nbe in no danger from BIENNIAL elections. The conclusion resulting from\r\nthese examples will be not a little strengthened by recollecting three\r\ncircumstances. The first is, that the federal legislature will possess\r\na part only of that supreme legislative authority which is vested\r\ncompletely in the British Parliament; and which, with a few exceptions,\r\nwas exercised by the colonial assemblies and the Irish legislature. It\r\nis a received and well-founded maxim, that where no other circumstances\r\naffect the case, the greater the power is, the shorter ought to be its\r\nduration; and, conversely, the smaller the power, the more safely may\r\nits duration be protracted. In the second place, it has, on another\r\noccasion, been shown that the federal legislature will not only be\r\nrestrained by its dependence on its people, as other legislative bodies\r\nare, but that it will be, moreover, watched and controlled by the\r\nseveral collateral legislatures, which other legislative bodies are\r\nnot. And in the third place, no comparison can be made between the\r\nmeans that will be possessed by the more permanent branches of the\r\nfederal government for seducing, if they should be disposed to seduce,\r\nthe House of Representatives from their duty to the people, and the\r\nmeans of influence over the popular branch possessed by the other\r\nbranches of the government above cited. With less power, therefore, to\r\nabuse, the federal representatives can be less tempted on one side, and\r\nwill be doubly watched on the other.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LIII.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued (The House of Representatives)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 12, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nI shall here, perhaps, be reminded of a current observation, “that\r\nwhere annual elections end, tyranny begins. “ If it be true, as has\r\noften been remarked, that sayings which become proverbial are generally\r\nfounded in reason, it is not less true, that when once established,\r\nthey are often applied to cases to which the reason of them does not\r\nextend. I need not look for a proof beyond the case before us. What is\r\nthe reason on which this proverbial observation is founded? No man will\r\nsubject himself to the ridicule of pretending that any natural\r\nconnection subsists between the sun or the seasons, and the period\r\nwithin which human virtue can bear the temptations of power. Happily\r\nfor mankind, liberty is not, in this respect, confined to any single\r\npoint of time; but lies within extremes, which afford sufficient\r\nlatitude for all the variations which may be required by the various\r\nsituations and circumstances of civil society. The election of\r\nmagistrates might be, if it were found expedient, as in some instances\r\nit actually has been, daily, weekly, or monthly, as well as annual; and\r\nif circumstances may require a deviation from the rule on one side, why\r\nnot also on the other side? Turning our attention to the periods\r\nestablished among ourselves, for the election of the most numerous\r\nbranches of the State legislatures, we find them by no means coinciding\r\nany more in this instance, than in the elections of other civil\r\nmagistrates. In Connecticut and Rhode Island, the periods are\r\nhalf-yearly. In the other States, South Carolina excepted, they are\r\nannual. In South Carolina they are biennial as is proposed in the\r\nfederal government. Here is a difference, as four to one, between the\r\nlongest and shortest periods; and yet it would be not easy to show,\r\nthat Connecticut or Rhode Island is better governed, or enjoys a\r\ngreater share of rational liberty, than South Carolina; or that either\r\nthe one or the other of these States is distinguished in these\r\nrespects, and by these causes, from the States whose elections are\r\ndifferent from both. In searching for the grounds of this doctrine, I\r\ncan discover but one, and that is wholly inapplicable to our case. The\r\nimportant distinction so well understood in America, between a\r\nConstitution established by the people and unalterable by the\r\ngovernment, and a law established by the government and alterable by\r\nthe government, seems to have been little understood and less observed\r\nin any other country. Wherever the supreme power of legislation has\r\nresided, has been supposed to reside also a full power to change the\r\nform of the government. Even in Great Britain, where the principles of\r\npolitical and civil liberty have been most discussed, and where we hear\r\nmost of the rights of the Constitution, it is maintained that the\r\nauthority of the Parliament is transcendent and uncontrollable, as well\r\nwith regard to the Constitution, as the ordinary objects of legislative\r\nprovision. They have accordingly, in several instances, actually\r\nchanged, by legislative acts, some of the most fundamental articles of\r\nthe government. They have in particular, on several occasions, changed\r\nthe period of election; and, on the last occasion, not only introduced\r\nseptennial in place of triennial elections, but by the same act,\r\ncontinued themselves in place four years beyond the term for which they\r\nwere elected by the people. An attention to these dangerous practices\r\nhas produced a very natural alarm in the votaries of free government,\r\nof which frequency of elections is the corner-stone; and has led them\r\nto seek for some security to liberty, against the danger to which it is\r\nexposed. Where no Constitution, paramount to the government, either\r\nexisted or could be obtained, no constitutional security, similar to\r\nthat established in the United States, was to be attempted. Some other\r\nsecurity, therefore, was to be sought for; and what better security\r\nwould the case admit, than that of selecting and appealing to some\r\nsimple and familiar portion of time, as a standard for measuring the\r\ndanger of innovations, for fixing the national sentiment, and for\r\nuniting the patriotic exertions? The most simple and familiar portion\r\nof time, applicable to the subject was that of a year; and hence the\r\ndoctrine has been inculcated by a laudable zeal, to erect some barrier\r\nagainst the gradual innovations of an unlimited government, that the\r\nadvance towards tyranny was to be calculated by the distance of\r\ndeparture from the fixed point of annual elections. But what necessity\r\ncan there be of applying this expedient to a government limited, as the\r\nfederal government will be, by the authority of a paramount\r\nConstitution? Or who will pretend that the liberties of the people of\r\nAmerica will not be more secure under biennial elections, unalterably\r\nfixed by such a Constitution, than those of any other nation would be,\r\nwhere elections were annual, or even more frequent, but subject to\r\nalterations by the ordinary power of the government? The second\r\nquestion stated is, whether biennial elections be necessary or useful.\r\nThe propriety of answering this question in the affirmative will appear\r\nfrom several very obvious considerations. No man can be a competent\r\nlegislator who does not add to an upright intention and a sound\r\njudgment a certain degree of knowledge of the subjects on which he is\r\nto legislate. A part of this knowledge may be acquired by means of\r\ninformation which lie within the compass of men in private as well as\r\npublic stations. Another part can only be attained, or at least\r\nthoroughly attained, by actual experience in the station which requires\r\nthe use of it. The period of service, ought, therefore, in all such\r\ncases, to bear some proportion to the extent of practical knowledge\r\nrequisite to the due performance of the service. The period of\r\nlegislative service established in most of the States for the more\r\nnumerous branch is, as we have seen, one year. The question then may be\r\nput into this simple form: does the period of two years bear no greater\r\nproportion to the knowledge requisite for federal legislation than one\r\nyear does to the knowledge requisite for State legislation? The very\r\nstatement of the question, in this form, suggests the answer that ought\r\nto be given to it. In a single State, the requisite knowledge relates\r\nto the existing laws which are uniform throughout the State, and with\r\nwhich all the citizens are more or less conversant; and to the general\r\naffairs of the State, which lie within a small compass, are not very\r\ndiversified, and occupy much of the attention and conversation of every\r\nclass of people. The great theatre of the United States presents a very\r\ndifferent scene. The laws are so far from being uniform, that they vary\r\nin every State; whilst the public affairs of the Union are spread\r\nthroughout a very extensive region, and are extremely diversified by t\r\ne local affairs connected with them, and can with difficulty be\r\ncorrectly learnt in any other place than in the central councils to\r\nwhich a knowledge of them will be brought by the representatives of\r\nevery part of the empire. Yet some knowledge of the affairs, and even\r\nof the laws, of all the States, ought to be possessed by the members\r\nfrom each of the States. How can foreign trade be properly regulated by\r\nuniform laws, without some acquaintance with the commerce, the ports,\r\nthe usages, and the regulatious of the different States? How can the\r\ntrade between the different States be duly regulated, without some\r\nknowledge of their relative situations in these and other respects? How\r\ncan taxes be judiciously imposed and effectually collected, if they be\r\nnot accommodated to the different laws and local circumstances relating\r\nto these objects in the different States? How can uniform regulations\r\nfor the militia be duly provided, without a similar knowledge of many\r\ninternal circumstances by which the States are distinguished from each\r\nother? These are the principal objects of federal legislation, and\r\nsuggest most forcibly the extensive information which the\r\nrepresentatives ought to acquire. The other interior objects will\r\nrequire a proportional degree of information with regard to them. It is\r\ntrue that all these difficulties will, by degrees, be very much\r\ndiminished. The most laborious task will be the proper inauguration of\r\nthe government and the primeval formation of a federal code.\r\nImprovements on the first draughts will every year become both easier\r\nand fewer. Past transactions of the government will be a ready and\r\naccurate source of information to new members. The affairs of the Union\r\nwill become more and more objects of curiosity and conversation among\r\nthe citizens at large. And the increased intercourse among those of\r\ndifferent States will contribute not a little to diffuse a mutual\r\nknowledge of their affairs, as this again will contribute to a general\r\nassimilation of their manners and laws. But with all these abatements,\r\nthe business of federal legislation must continue so far to exceed,\r\nboth in novelty and difficulty, the legislative business of a single\r\nState, as to justify the longer period of service assigned to those who\r\nare to transact it. A branch of knowledge which belongs to the\r\nacquirements of a federal representative, and which has not been\r\nmentioned is that of foreign affairs. In regulating our own commerce he\r\nought to be not only acquainted with the treaties between the United\r\nStates and other nations, but also with the commercial policy and laws\r\nof other nations. He ought not to be altogether ignorant of the law of\r\nnations; for that, as far as it is a proper object of municipal\r\nlegislation, is submitted to the federal government.\r\n\r\nAnd although the House of Representatives is not immediately to\r\nparticipate in foreign negotiations and arrangements, yet from the\r\nnecessary connection between the several branches of public affairs,\r\nthose particular branches will frequently deserve attention in the\r\nordinary course of legislation, and will sometimes demand particular\r\nlegislative sanction and co-operation. Some portion of this knowledge\r\nmay, no doubt, be acquired in a man’s closet; but some of it also can\r\nonly be derived from the public sources of information; and all of it\r\nwill be acquired to best effect by a practical attention to the subject\r\nduring the period of actual service in the legislature.\r\n\r\nThere are other considerations, of less importance, perhaps, but which\r\nare not unworthy of notice. The distance which many of the\r\nrepresentatives will be obliged to travel, and the arrangements\r\nrendered necessary by that circumstance, might be much more serious\r\nobjections with fit men to this service, if limited to a single year,\r\nthan if extended to two years. No argument can be drawn on this\r\nsubject, from the case of the delegates to the existing Congress. They\r\nare elected annually, it is true; but their re-election is considered\r\nby the legislative assemblies almost as a matter of course. The\r\nelection of the representatives by the people would not be governed by\r\nthe same principle. A few of the members, as happens in all such\r\nassemblies, will possess superior talents; will, by frequent\r\nreelections, become members of long standing; will be thoroughly\r\nmasters of the public business, and perhaps not unwilling to avail\r\nthemselves of those advantages. The greater the proportion of new\r\nmembers, and the less the information of the bulk of the members the\r\nmore apt will they be to fall into the snares that may be laid for\r\nthem. This remark is no less applicable to the relation which will\r\nsubsist between the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is an\r\ninconvenience mingled with the advantages of our frequent elections\r\neven in single States, where they are large, and hold but one\r\nlegislative session in a year, that spurious elections cannot be\r\ninvestigated and annulled in time for the decision to have its due\r\neffect. If a return can be obtained, no matter by what unlawful means,\r\nthe irregular member, who takes his seat of course, is sure of holding\r\nit a sufficient time to answer his purposes. Hence, a very pernicious\r\nencouragement is given to the use of unlawful means, for obtaining\r\nirregular returns. Were elections for the federal legislature to be\r\nannual, this practice might become a very serious abuse, particularly\r\nin the more distant States. Each house is, as it necessarily must be,\r\nthe judge of the elections, qualifications, and returns of its members;\r\nand whatever improvements may be suggested by experience, for\r\nsimplifying and accelerating the process in disputed cases, so great a\r\nportion of a year would unavoidably elapse, before an illegitimate\r\nmember could be dispossessed of his seat, that the prospect of such an\r\nevent would be little check to unfair and illicit means of obtaining a\r\nseat. All these considerations taken together warrant us in affirming,\r\nthat biennial elections will be as useful to the affairs of the public\r\nas we have seen that they will be safe to the liberty of the people.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LIV.\r\n\r\nThe Apportionment of Members Among the States\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 12, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe next view which I shall take of the House of Representatives\r\nrelates to the appointment of its members to the several States which\r\nis to be determined by the same rule with that of direct taxes. It is\r\nnot contended that the number of people in each State ought not to be\r\nthe standard for regulating the proportion of those who are to\r\nrepresent the people of each State. The establishment of the same rule\r\nfor the appointment of taxes, will probably be as little contested;\r\nthough the rule itself in this case, is by no means founded on the same\r\nprinciple. In the former case, the rule is understood to refer to the\r\npersonal rights of the people, with which it has a natural and\r\nuniversal connection.\r\n\r\nIn the latter, it has reference to the proportion of wealth, of which\r\nit is in no case a precise measure, and in ordinary cases a very unfit\r\none. But notwithstanding the imperfection of the rule as applied to the\r\nrelative wealth and contributions of the States, it is evidently the\r\nleast objectionable among the practicable rules, and had too recently\r\nobtained the general sanction of America, not to have found a ready\r\npreference with the convention. All this is admitted, it will perhaps\r\nbe said; but does it follow, from an admission of numbers for the\r\nmeasure of representation, or of slaves combined with free citizens as\r\na ratio of taxation, that slaves ought to be included in the numerical\r\nrule of representation? Slaves are considered as property, not as\r\npersons. They ought therefore to be comprehended in estimates of\r\ntaxation which are founded on property, and to be excluded from\r\nrepresentation which is regulated by a census of persons. This is the\r\nobjection, as I understand it, stated in its full force. I shall be\r\nequally candid in stating the reasoning which may be offered on the\r\nopposite side. “We subscribe to the doctrine,” might one of our\r\nSouthern brethren observe, “that representation relates more\r\nimmediately to persons, and taxation more immediately to property, and\r\nwe join in the application of this distinction to the case of our\r\nslaves. But we must deny the fact, that slaves are considered merely as\r\nproperty, and in no respect whatever as persons. The true state of the\r\ncase is, that they partake of both these qualities: being considered by\r\nour laws, in some respects, as persons, and in other respects as\r\nproperty. In being compelled to labor, not for himself, but for a\r\nmaster; in being vendible by one master to another master; and in being\r\nsubject at all times to be restrained in his liberty and chastised in\r\nhis body, by the capricious will of another, the slave may appear to be\r\ndegraded from the human rank, and classed with those irrational animals\r\nwhich fall under the legal denomination of property. In being\r\nprotected, on the other hand, in his life and in his limbs, against the\r\nviolence of all others, even the master of his labor and his liberty;\r\nand in being punishable himself for all violence committed against\r\nothers, the slave is no less evidently regarded by the law as a member\r\nof the society, not as a part of the irrational creation; as a moral\r\nperson, not as a mere article of property. The federal Constitution,\r\ntherefore, decides with great propriety on the case of our slaves, when\r\nit views them in the mixed character of persons and of property. This\r\nis in fact their true character. It is the character bestowed on them\r\nby the laws under which they live; and it will not be denied, that\r\nthese are the proper criterion; because it is only under the pretext\r\nthat the laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of property,\r\nthat a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers; and it is\r\nadmitted, that if the laws were to restore the rights which have been\r\ntaken away, the negroes could no longer be refused an equal share of\r\nrepresentation with the other inhabitants. “This question may be placed\r\nin another light. It is agreed on all sides, that numbers are the best\r\nscale of wealth and taxation, as they are the only proper scale of\r\nrepresentation. Would the convention have been impartial or consistent,\r\nif they had rejected the slaves from the list of inhabitants, when the\r\nshares of representation were to be calculated, and inserted them on\r\nthe lists when the tariff of contributions was to be adjusted? Could it\r\nbe reasonably expected, that the Southern States would concur in a\r\nsystem, which considered their slaves in some degree as men, when\r\nburdens were to be imposed, but refused to consider them in the same\r\nlight, when advantages were to be conferred? Might not some surprise\r\nalso be expressed, that those who reproach the Southern States with the\r\nbarbarous policy of considering as property a part of their human\r\nbrethren, should themselves contend, that the government to which all\r\nthe States are to be parties, ought to consider this unfortunate race\r\nmore completely in the unnatural light of property, than the very laws\r\nof which they complain? “It may be replied, perhaps, that slaves are\r\nnot included in the estimate of representatives in any of the States\r\npossessing them. They neither vote themselves nor increase the votes of\r\ntheir masters. Upon what principle, then, ought they to be taken into\r\nthe federal estimate of representation? In rejecting them altogether,\r\nthe Constitution would, in this respect, have followed the very laws\r\nwhich have been appealed to as the proper guide. “This objection is\r\nrepelled by a single observation. It is a fundamental principle of the\r\nproposed Constitution, that as the aggregate number of representatives\r\nallotted to the several States is to be determined by a federal rule,\r\nfounded on the aggregate number of inhabitants, so the right of\r\nchoosing this allotted number in each State is to be exercised by such\r\npart of the inhabitants as the State itself may designate. The\r\nqualifications on which the right of suffrage depend are not, perhaps,\r\nthe same in any two States. In some of the States the difference is\r\nvery material. In every State, a certain proportion of inhabitants are\r\ndeprived of this right by the constitution of the State, who will be\r\nincluded in the census by which the federal Constitution apportions the\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIn this point of view the Southern States might retort the complaint,\r\nby insisting that the principle laid down by the convention required\r\nthat no regard should be had to the policy of particular States towards\r\ntheir own inhabitants; and consequently, that the slaves, as\r\ninhabitants, should have been admitted into the census according to\r\ntheir full number, in like manner with other inhabitants, who, by the\r\npolicy of other States, are not admitted to all the rights of citizens.\r\nA rigorous adherence, however, to this principle, is waived by those\r\nwho would be gainers by it. All that they ask is that equal moderation\r\nbe shown on the other side. Let the case of the slaves be considered,\r\nas it is in truth, a peculiar one. Let the compromising expedient of\r\nthe Constitution be mutually adopted, which regards them as\r\ninhabitants, but as debased by servitude below the equal level of free\r\ninhabitants, which regards the SLAVE as divested of two fifths of the\r\nMAN. “After all, may not another ground be taken on which this article\r\nof the Constitution will admit of a still more ready defense? We have\r\nhitherto proceeded on the idea that representation related to persons\r\nonly, and not at all to property. But is it a just idea?\r\n\r\nGovernment is instituted no less for protection of the property, than\r\nof the persons, of individuals. The one as well as the other,\r\ntherefore, may be considered as represented by those who are charged\r\nwith the government. Upon this principle it is, that in several of the\r\nStates, and particularly in the State of New York, one branch of the\r\ngovernment is intended more especially to be the guardian of property,\r\nand is accordingly elected by that part of the society which is most\r\ninterested in this object of government. In the federal Constitution,\r\nthis policy does not prevail. The rights of property are committed into\r\nthe same hands with the personal rights. Some attention ought,\r\ntherefore, to be paid to property in the choice of those hands. “For\r\nanother reason, the votes allowed in the federal legislature to the\r\npeople of each State, ought to bear some proportion to the comparative\r\nwealth of the States. States have not, like individuals, an influence\r\nover each other, arising from superior advantages of fortune. If the\r\nlaw allows an opulent citizen but a single vote in the choice of his\r\nrepresentative, the respect and consequence which he derives from his\r\nfortunate situation very frequently guide the votes of others to the\r\nobjects of his choice; and through this imperceptible channel the\r\nrights of property are conveyed into the public representation. A State\r\npossesses no such influence over other States. It is not probable that\r\nthe richest State in the Confederacy will ever influence the choice of\r\na single representative in any other State. Nor will the\r\nrepresentatives of the larger and richer States possess any other\r\nadvantage in the federal legislature, over the representatives of other\r\nStates, than what may result from their superior number alone. As far,\r\ntherefore, as their superior wealth and weight may justly entitle them\r\nto any advantage, it ought to be secured to them by a superior share of\r\nrepresentation. The new Constitution is, in this respect, materially\r\ndifferent from the existing Confederation, as well as from that of the\r\nUnited Netherlands, and other similar confederacies. In each of the\r\nlatter, the efficacy of the federal resolutions depends on the\r\nsubsequent and voluntary resolutions of the states composing the union.\r\nHence the states, though possessing an equal vote in the public\r\ncouncils, have an unequal influence, corresponding with the unequal\r\nimportance of these subsequent and voluntary resolutions. Under the\r\nproposed Constitution, the federal acts will take effect without the\r\nnecessary intervention of the individual States. They will depend\r\nmerely on the majority of votes in the federal legislature, and\r\nconsequently each vote, whether proceeding from a larger or smaller\r\nState, or a State more or less wealthy or powerful, will have an equal\r\nweight and efficacy: in the same manner as the votes individually given\r\nin a State legislature, by the representatives of unequal counties or\r\nother districts, have each a precise equality of value and effect; or\r\nif there be any difference in the case, it proceeds from the difference\r\nin the personal character of the individual representative, rather than\r\nfrom any regard to the extent of the district from which he comes.\r\n“Such is the reasoning which an advocate for the Southern interests\r\nmight employ on this subject; and although it may appear to be a little\r\nstrained in some points, yet, on the whole, I must confess that it\r\nfully reconciles me to the scale of representation which the convention\r\nhave established. In one respect, the establishment of a common measure\r\nfor representation and taxation will have a very salutary effect. As\r\nthe accuracy of the census to be obtained by the Congress will\r\nnecessarily depend, in a considerable degree on the disposition, if not\r\non the co-operation, of the States, it is of great importance that the\r\nStates should feel as little bias as possible, to swell or to reduce\r\nthe amount of their numbers. Were their share of representation alone\r\nto be governed by this rule, they would have an interest in\r\nexaggerating their inhabitants. Were the rule to decide their share of\r\ntaxation alone, a contrary temptation would prevail. By extending the\r\nrule to both objects, the States will have opposite interests, which\r\nwill control and balance each other, and produce the requisite\r\nimpartiality.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LV.\r\n\r\nThe Total Number of the House of Representatives\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 15, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe number of which the House of Representatives is to consist, forms\r\nanother and a very interesting point of view, under which this branch\r\nof the federal legislature may be contemplated.\r\n\r\nScarce any article, indeed, in the whole Constitution seems to be\r\nrendered more worthy of attention, by the weight of character and the\r\napparent force of argument with which it has been assailed.\r\n\r\nThe charges exhibited against it are, first, that so small a number of\r\nrepresentatives will be an unsafe depositary of the public interests;\r\nsecondly, that they will not possess a proper knowledge of the local\r\ncircumstances of their numerous constituents; thirdly, that they will\r\nbe taken from that class of citizens which will sympathize least with\r\nthe feelings of the mass of the people, and be most likely to aim at a\r\npermanent elevation of the few on the depression of the many; fourthly,\r\nthat defective as the number will be in the first instance, it will be\r\nmore and more disproportionate, by the increase of the people, and the\r\nobstacles which will prevent a correspondent increase of the\r\nrepresentatives. In general it may be remarked on this subject, that no\r\npolitical problem is less susceptible of a precise solution than that\r\nwhich relates to the number most convenient for a representative\r\nlegislature; nor is there any point on which the policy of the several\r\nStates is more at variance, whether we compare their legislative\r\nassemblies directly with each other, or consider the proportions which\r\nthey respectively bear to the number of their constituents. Passing\r\nover the difference between the smallest and largest States, as\r\nDelaware, whose most numerous branch consists of twenty-one\r\nrepresentatives, and Massachusetts, where it amounts to between three\r\nand four hundred, a very considerable difference is observable among\r\nStates nearly equal in population. The number of representatives in\r\nPennsylvania is not more than one fifth of that in the State last\r\nmentioned. New York, whose population is to that of South Carolina as\r\nsix to five, has little more than one third of the number of\r\nrepresentatives. As great a disparity prevails between the States of\r\nGeorgia and Delaware or Rhode Island. In Pennsylvania, the\r\nrepresentatives do not bear a greater proportion to their constituents\r\nthan of one for every four or five thousand. In Rhode Island, they bear\r\na proportion of at least one for every thousand. And according to the\r\nconstitution of Georgia, the proportion may be carried to one to every\r\nten electors; and must unavoidably far exceed the proportion in any of\r\nthe other States. Another general remark to be made is, that the ratio\r\nbetween the representatives and the people ought not to be the same\r\nwhere the latter are very numerous as where they are very few. Were the\r\nrepresentatives in Virginia to be regulated by the standard in Rhode\r\nIsland, they would, at this time, amount to between four and five\r\nhundred; and twenty or thirty years hence, to a thousand. On the other\r\nhand, the ratio of Pennsylvania, if applied to the State of Delaware,\r\nwould reduce the representative assembly of the latter to seven or\r\neight members. Nothing can be more fallacious than to found our\r\npolitical calculations on arithmetical principles. Sixty or seventy men\r\nmay be more properly trusted with a given degree of power than six or\r\nseven. But it does not follow that six or seven hundred would be\r\nproportionably a better depositary. And if we carry on the supposition\r\nto six or seven thousand, the whole reasoning ought to be reversed. The\r\ntruth is, that in all cases a certain number at least seems to be\r\nnecessary to secure the benefits of free consultation and discussion,\r\nand to guard against too easy a combination for improper purposes; as,\r\non the other hand, the number ought at most to be kept within a certain\r\nlimit, in order to avoid the confusion and intemperance of a multitude.\r\nIn all very numerous assemblies, of whatever character composed,\r\npassion never fails to wrest the sceptre from reason.\r\n\r\nHad every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly\r\nwould still have been a mob.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary also to recollect here the observations which were\r\napplied to the case of biennial elections. For the same reason that the\r\nlimited powers of the Congress, and the control of the State\r\nlegislatures, justify less frequent elections than the public safely\r\nmight otherwise require, the members of the Congress need be less\r\nnumerous than if they possessed the whole power of legislation, and\r\nwere under no other than the ordinary restraints of other legislative\r\nbodies. With these general ideas in our mind, let us weigh the\r\nobjections which have been stated against the number of members\r\nproposed for the House of Representatives. It is said, in the first\r\nplace, that so small a number cannot be safely trusted with so much\r\npower. The number of which this branch of the legislature is to\r\nconsist, at the outset of the government, will be sixtyfive. Within\r\nthree years a census is to be taken, when the number may be augmented\r\nto one for every thirty thousand inhabitants; and within every\r\nsuccessive period of ten years the census is to be renewed, and\r\naugmentations may continue to be made under the above limitation. It\r\nwill not be thought an extravagant conjecture that the first census\r\nwill, at the rate of one for every thirty thousand, raise the number of\r\nrepresentatives to at least one hundred. Estimating the negroes in the\r\nproportion of three fifths, it can scarcely be doubted that the\r\npopulation of the United States will by that time, if it does not\r\nalready, amount to three millions. At the expiration of twenty-five\r\nyears, according to the computed rate of increase, the number of\r\nrepresentatives will amount to two hundred, and of fifty years, to four\r\nhundred. This is a number which, I presume, will put an end to all\r\nfears arising from the smallness of the body. I take for granted here\r\nwhat I shall, in answering the fourth objection, hereafter show, that\r\nthe number of representatives will be augmented from time to time in\r\nthe manner provided by the Constitution. On a contrary supposition, I\r\nshould admit the objection to have very great weight indeed. The true\r\nquestion to be decided then is, whether the smallness of the number, as\r\na temporary regulation, be dangerous to the public liberty? Whether\r\nsixty-five members for a few years, and a hundred or two hundred for a\r\nfew more, be a safe depositary for a limited and well-guarded power of\r\nlegislating for the United States? I must own that I could not give a\r\nnegative answer to this question, without first obliterating every\r\nimpression which I have received with regard to the present genius of\r\nthe people of America, the spirit which actuates the State\r\nlegislatures, and the principles which are incorporated with the\r\npolitical character of every class of citizens I am unable to conceive\r\nthat the people of America, in their present temper, or under any\r\ncircumstances which can speedily happen, will choose, and every second\r\nyear repeat the choice of, sixty-five or a hundred men who would be\r\ndisposed to form and pursue a scheme of tyranny or treachery. I am\r\nunable to conceive that the State legislatures, which must feel so many\r\nmotives to watch, and which possess so many means of counteracting, the\r\nfederal legislature, would fail either to detect or to defeat a\r\nconspiracy of the latter against the liberties of their common\r\nconstituents. I am equally unable to conceive that there are at this\r\ntime, or can be in any short time, in the United States, any sixty-five\r\nor a hundred men capable of recommending themselves to the choice of\r\nthe people at large, who would either desire or dare, within the short\r\nspace of two years, to betray the solemn trust committed to them. What\r\nchange of circumstances, time, and a fuller population of our country\r\nmay produce, requires a prophetic spirit to declare, which makes no\r\npart of my pretensions. But judging from the circumstances now before\r\nus, and from the probable state of them within a moderate period of\r\ntime, I must pronounce that the liberties of America cannot be unsafe\r\nin the number of hands proposed by the federal Constitution. From what\r\nquarter can the danger proceed? Are we afraid of foreign gold? If\r\nforeign gold could so easily corrupt our federal rulers and enable them\r\nto ensnare and betray their constituents, how has it happened that we\r\nare at this time a free and independent nation? The Congress which\r\nconducted us through the Revolution was a less numerous body than their\r\nsuccessors will be; they were not chosen by, nor responsible to, their\r\nfellowcitizens at large; though appointed from year to year, and\r\nrecallable at pleasure, they were generally continued for three years,\r\nand prior to the ratification of the federal articles, for a still\r\nlonger term.\r\n\r\nThey held their consultations always under the veil of secrecy; they\r\nhad the sole transaction of our affairs with foreign nations; through\r\nthe whole course of the war they had the fate of their country more in\r\ntheir hands than it is to be hoped will ever be the case with our\r\nfuture representatives; and from the greatness of the prize at stake,\r\nand the eagerness of the party which lost it, it may well be supposed\r\nthat the use of other means than force would not have been scrupled.\r\nYet we know by happy experience that the public trust was not betrayed;\r\nnor has the purity of our public councils in this particular ever\r\nsuffered, even from the whispers of calumny. Is the danger apprehended\r\nfrom the other branches of the federal government?\r\n\r\nBut where are the means to be found by the President, or the Senate, or\r\nboth? Their emoluments of office, it is to be presumed, will not, and\r\nwithout a previous corruption of the House of Representatives cannot,\r\nmore than suffice for very different purposes; their private fortunes,\r\nas they must allbe American citizens, cannot possibly be sources of\r\ndanger. The only means, then, which they can possess, will be in the\r\ndispensation of appointments. Is it here that suspicion rests her\r\ncharge? Sometimes we are told that this fund of corruption is to be\r\nexhausted by the President in subduing the virtue of the Senate. Now,\r\nthe fidelity of the other House is to be the victim. The improbability\r\nof such a mercenary and perfidious combination of the several members\r\nof government, standing on as different foundations as republican\r\nprinciples will well admit, and at the same time accountable to the\r\nsociety over which they are placed, ought alone to quiet this\r\napprehension. But, fortunately, the Constitution has provided a still\r\nfurther safeguard. The members of the Congress are rendered ineligible\r\nto any civil offices that may be created, or of which the emoluments\r\nmay be increased, during the term of their election.\r\n\r\nNo offices therefore can be dealt out to the existing members but such\r\nas may become vacant by ordinary casualties: and to suppose that these\r\nwould be sufficient to purchase the guardians of the people, selected\r\nby the people themselves, is to renounce every rule by which events\r\nought to be calculated, and to substitute an indiscriminate and\r\nunbounded jealousy, with which all reasoning must be vain. The sincere\r\nfriends of liberty, who give themselves up to the extravagancies of\r\nthis passion, are not aware of the injury they do their own cause. As\r\nthere is a degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain\r\ndegree of circumspection and distrust, so there are other qualities in\r\nhuman nature which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence.\r\nRepublican government presupposes the existence of these qualities in a\r\nhigher degree than any other form. Were the pictures which have been\r\ndrawn by the political jealousy of some among us faithful likenesses of\r\nthe human character, the inference would be, that there is not\r\nsufficient virtue among men for self-government; and that nothing less\r\nthan the chains of despotism can restrain them from destroying and\r\ndevouring one another.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LVI.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued (The Total Number of the House of\r\nRepresentatives)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe second charge against the House of Representatives is, that it will\r\nbe too small to possess a due knowledge of the interests of its\r\nconstituents. As this objection evidently proceeds from a comparison of\r\nthe proposed number of representatives with the great extent of the\r\nUnited States, the number of their inhabitants, and the diversity of\r\ntheir interests, without taking into view at the same time the\r\ncircumstances which will distinguish the Congress from other\r\nlegislative bodies, the best answer that can be given to it will be a\r\nbrief explanation of these peculiarities. It is a sound and important\r\nprinciple that the representative ought to be acquainted with the\r\ninterests and circumstances of his constituents. But this principle can\r\nextend no further than to those circumstances and interests to which\r\nthe authority and care of the representative relate. An ignorance of a\r\nvariety of minute and particular objects, which do not lie within the\r\ncompass of legislation, is consistent with every attribute necessary to\r\na due performance of the legislative trust. In determining the extent\r\nof information required in the exercise of a particular authority,\r\nrecourse then must be had to the objects within the purview of that\r\nauthority. What are to be the objects of federal legislation? Those\r\nwhich are of most importance, and which seem most to require local\r\nknowledge, are commerce, taxation, and the militia. A proper regulation\r\nof commerce requires much information, as has been elsewhere remarked;\r\nbut as far as this information relates to the laws and local situation\r\nof each individual State, a very few representatives would be very\r\nsufficient vehicles of it to the federal councils. Taxation will\r\nconsist, in a great measure, of duties which will be involved in the\r\nregulation of commerce. So far the preceding remark is applicable to\r\nthis object. As far as it may consist of internal collections, a more\r\ndiffusive knowledge of the circumstances of the State may be necessary.\r\nBut will not this also be possessed in sufficient degree by a very few\r\nintelligent men, diffusively elected within the State? Divide the\r\nlargest State into ten or twelve districts, and it will be found that\r\nthere will be no peculiar local interests in either, which will not be\r\nwithin the knowledge of the representative of the district. Besides\r\nthis source of information, the laws of the State, framed by\r\nrepresentatives from every part of it, will be almost of themselves a\r\nsufficient guide. In every State there have been made, and must\r\ncontinue to be made, regulations on this subject which will, in many\r\ncases, leave little more to be done by the federal legislature, than to\r\nreview the different laws, and reduce them in one general act. A\r\nskillful individual in his closet with all the local codes before him,\r\nmight compile a law on some subjects of taxation for the whole union,\r\nwithout any aid from oral information, and it may be expected that\r\nwhenever internal taxes may be necessary, and particularly in cases\r\nrequiring uniformity throughout the States, the more simple objects\r\nwill be preferred. To be fully sensible of the facility which will be\r\ngiven to this branch of federal legislation by the assistance of the\r\nState codes, we need only suppose for a moment that this or any other\r\nState were divided into a number of parts, each having and exercising\r\nwithin itself a power of local legislation. Is it not evident that a\r\ndegree of local information and preparatory labor would be found in the\r\nseveral volumes of their proceedings, which would very much shorten the\r\nlabors of the general legislature, and render a much smaller number of\r\nmembers sufficient for it? The federal councils will derive great\r\nadvantage from another circumstance. The representatives of each State\r\nwill not only bring with them a considerable knowledge of its laws, and\r\na local knowledge of their respective districts, but will probably in\r\nall cases have been members, and may even at the very time be members,\r\nof the State legislature, where all the local information and interests\r\nof the State are assembled, and from whence they may easily be conveyed\r\nby a very few hands into the legislature of the United States. The\r\nobservations made on the subject of taxation apply with greater force\r\nto the case of the militia. For however different the rules of\r\ndiscipline may be in different States, they are the same throughout\r\neach particular State; and depend on circumstances which can differ but\r\nlittle in different parts of the same State. The attentive reader will\r\ndiscern that the reasoning here used, to prove the sufficiency of a\r\nmoderate number of representatives, does not in any respect contradict\r\nwhat was urged on another occasion with regard to the extensive\r\ninformation which the representatives ought to possess, and the time\r\nthat might be necessary for acquiring it. This information, so far as\r\nit may relate to local objects, is rendered necessary and difficult,\r\nnot by a difference of laws and local circumstances within a single\r\nState, but of those among different States. Taking each State by\r\nitself, its laws are the same, and its interests but little\r\ndiversified. A few men, therefore, will possess all the knowledge\r\nrequisite for a proper representation of them. Were the interests and\r\naffairs of each individual State perfectly simple and uniform, a\r\nknowledge of them in one part would involve a knowledge of them in\r\nevery other, and the whole State might be competently represented by a\r\nsingle member taken from any part of it. On a comparison of the\r\ndifferent States together, we find a great dissimilarity in their laws,\r\nand in many other circumstances connected with the objects of federal\r\nlegislation, with all of which the federal representatives ought to\r\nhave some acquaintance. Whilst a few representatives, therefore, from\r\neach State, may bring with them a due knowledge of their own State,\r\nevery representative will have much information to acquire concerning\r\nall the other States.\r\n\r\nThe changes of time, as was formerly remarked, on the comparative\r\nsituation of the different States, will have an assimilating effect.\r\nThe effect of time on the internal affairs of the States, taken singly,\r\nwill be just the contrary. At present some of the States are little\r\nmore than a society of husbandmen. Few of them have made much progress\r\nin those branches of industry which give a variety and complexity to\r\nthe affairs of a nation. These, however, will in all of them be the\r\nfruits of a more advanced population, and will require, on the part of\r\neach State, a fuller representation. The foresight of the convention\r\nhas accordingly taken care that the progress of population may be\r\naccompanied with a proper increase of the representative branch of the\r\ngovernment. The experience of Great Britain, which presents to mankind\r\nso many political lessons, both of the monitory and exemplary kind, and\r\nwhich has been frequently consulted in the course of these inquiries,\r\ncorroborates the result of the reflections which we have just made. The\r\nnumber of inhabitants in the two kingdoms of England and Scotland\r\ncannot be stated at less than eight millions. The representatives of\r\nthese eight millions in the House of Commons amount to five hundred and\r\nfifty-eight.\r\n\r\nOf this number, one ninth are elected by three hundred and sixty-four\r\npersons, and one half, by five thousand seven hundred and twenty-three\r\npersons.[1] It cannot be supposed that the half thus elected, and who\r\ndo not even reside among the people at large, can add any thing either\r\nto the security of the people against the government, or to the\r\nknowledge of their circumstances and interests in the legislative\r\ncouncils. On the contrary, it is notorious, that they are more\r\nfrequently the representatives and instruments of the executive\r\nmagistrate, than the guardians and advocates of the popular rights.\r\nThey might therefore, with great propriety, be considered as something\r\nmore than a mere deduction from the real representatives of the nation.\r\nWe will, however, consider them in this light alone, and will not\r\nextend the deduction to a considerable number of others, who do not\r\nreside among their constitutents, are very faintly connected with them,\r\nand have very little particular knowledge of their affairs. With all\r\nthese concessions, two hundred and seventy-nine persons only will be\r\nthe depository of the safety, interest, and happiness of eight millions\r\nthat is to say, there will be one representative only to maintain the\r\nrights and explain the situation OF TWENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED\r\nAND SEVENTY constitutents, in an assembly exposed to the whole force of\r\nexecutive influence, and extending its authority to every object of\r\nlegislation within a nation whose affairs are in the highest degree\r\ndiversified and complicated. Yet it is very certain, not only that a\r\nvaluable portion of freedom has been preserved under all these\r\ncircumstances, but that the defects in the British code are chargeable,\r\nin a very small proportion, on the ignorance of the legislature\r\nconcerning the circumstances of the people. Allowing to this case the\r\nweight which is due to it, and comparing it with that of the House of\r\nRepresentatives as above explained it seems to give the fullest\r\nassurance, that a representative for every THIRTY THOUSAND INHABITANTS\r\nwill render the latter both a safe and competent guardian of the\r\ninterests which will be confided to it.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] Burgh’s _Political Disquisitions_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LVII.\r\n\r\nThe Alleged Tendency of the New Plan to Elevate the Few at the Expense\r\nof the Many Considered in Connection with Representation\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe third charge against the House of Representatives is, that it will\r\nbe taken from that class of citizens which will have least sympathy\r\nwith the mass of the people, and be most likely to aim at an ambitious\r\nsacrifice of the many to the aggrandizement of the few. Of all the\r\nobjections which have been framed against the federal Constitution,\r\nthis is perhaps the most extraordinary.\r\n\r\nWhilst the objection itself is levelled against a pretended oligarchy,\r\nthe principle of it strikes at the very root of republican government.\r\nThe aim of every political constitution is, or ought to be, first to\r\nobtain for rulers men who possess most wisdom to discern, and most\r\nvirtue to pursue, the common good of the society; and in the next\r\nplace, to take the most effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous\r\nwhilst they continue to hold their public trust. The elective mode of\r\nobtaining rulers is the characteristic policy of republican government.\r\nThe means relied on in this form of government for preventing their\r\ndegeneracy are numerous and various. The most effectual one, is such a\r\nlimitation of the term of appointments as will maintain a proper\r\nresponsibility to the people. Let me now ask what circumstance there is\r\nin the constitution of the House of Representatives that violates the\r\nprinciples of republican government, or favors the elevation of the few\r\non the ruins of the many? Let me ask whether every circumstance is not,\r\non the contrary, strictly conformable to these principles, and\r\nscrupulously impartial to the rights and pretensions of every class and\r\ndescription of citizens? Who are to be the electors of the federal\r\nrepresentatives? Not the rich, more than the poor; not the learned,\r\nmore than the ignorant; not the haughty heirs of distinguished names,\r\nmore than the humble sons of obscurity and unpropitious fortune. The\r\nelectors are to be the great body of the people of the United States.\r\nThey are to be the same who exercise the right in every State of\r\nelecting the corresponding branch of the legislature of the State. Who\r\nare to be the objects of popular choice? Every citizen whose merit may\r\nrecommend him to the esteem and confidence of his country. No\r\nqualification of wealth, of birth, of religious faith, or of civil\r\nprofession is permitted to fetter the judgement or disappoint the\r\ninclination of the people. If we consider the situation of the men on\r\nwhom the free suffrages of their fellow-citizens may confer the\r\nrepresentative trust, we shall find it involving every security which\r\ncan be devised or desired for their fidelity to their constituents. In\r\nthe first place, as they will have been distinguished by the preference\r\nof their fellow-citizens, we are to presume that in general they will\r\nbe somewhat distinguished also by those qualities which entitle them to\r\nit, and which promise a sincere and scrupulous regard to the nature of\r\ntheir engagements. In the second place, they will enter into the public\r\nservice under circumstances which cannot fail to produce a temporary\r\naffection at least to their constituents. There is in every breast a\r\nsensibility to marks of honor, of favor, of esteem, and of confidence,\r\nwhich, apart from all considerations of interest, is some pledge for\r\ngrateful and benevolent returns.\r\n\r\nIngratitude is a common topic of declamation against human nature; and\r\nit must be confessed that instances of it are but too frequent and\r\nflagrant, both in public and in private life. But the universal and\r\nextreme indignation which it inspires is itself a proof of the energy\r\nand prevalence of the contrary sentiment.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, those ties which bind the representative to his\r\nconstituents are strengthened by motives of a more selfish nature. His\r\npride and vanity attach him to a form of government which favors his\r\npretensions and gives him a share in its honors and distinctions.\r\nWhatever hopes or projects might be entertained by a few aspiring\r\ncharacters, it must generally happen that a great proportion of the men\r\nderiving their advancement from their influence with the people, would\r\nhave more to hope from a preservation of the favor, than from\r\ninnovations in the government subversive of the authority of the\r\npeople. All these securities, however, would be found very insufficient\r\nwithout the restraint of frequent elections. Hence, in the fourth\r\nplace, the House of Representatives is so constituted as to support in\r\nthe members an habitual recollection of their dependence on the people.\r\nBefore the sentiments impressed on their minds by the mode of their\r\nelevation can be effaced by the exercise of power, they will be\r\ncompelled to anticipate the moment when their power is to cease, when\r\ntheir exercise of it is to be reviewed, and when they must descend to\r\nthe level from which they were raised; there forever to remain unless a\r\nfaithful discharge of their trust shall have established their title to\r\na renewal of it. I will add, as a fifth circumstance in the situation\r\nof the House of Representatives, restraining them from oppressive\r\nmeasures, that they can make no law which will not have its full\r\noperation on themselves and their friends, as well as on the great mass\r\nof the society. This has always been deemed one of the strongest bonds\r\nby which human policy can connect the rulers and the people together.\r\nIt creates between them that communion of interests and sympathy of\r\nsentiments, of which few governments have furnished examples; but\r\nwithout which every government degenerates into tyranny. If it be\r\nasked, what is to restrain the House of Representatives from making\r\nlegal discriminations in favor of themselves and a particular class of\r\nthe society? I answer: the genius of the whole system; the nature of\r\njust and constitutional laws; and above all, the vigilant and manly\r\nspirit which actuates the people of America, a spirit which nourishes\r\nfreedom, and in return is nourished by it. If this spirit shall ever be\r\nso far debased as to tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature,\r\nas well as on the people, the people will be prepared to tolerate any\r\nthing but liberty. Such will be the relation between the House of\r\nRepresentatives and their constituents. Duty, gratitude, interest,\r\nambition itself, are the chords by which they will be bound to fidelity\r\nand sympathy with the great mass of the people.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that these may all be insufficient to control the\r\ncaprice and wickedness of man. But are they not all that government\r\nwill admit, and that human prudence can devise? Are they not the\r\ngenuine and the characteristic means by which republican government\r\nprovides for the liberty and happiness of the people? Are they not the\r\nidentical means on which every State government in the Union relies for\r\nthe attainment of these important ends? What then are we to understand\r\nby the objection which this paper has combated? What are we to say to\r\nthe men who profess the most flaming zeal for republican government,\r\nyet boldly impeach the fundamental principle of it; who pretend to be\r\nchampions for the right and the capacity of the people to choose their\r\nown rulers, yet maintain that they will prefer those only who will\r\nimmediately and infallibly betray the trust committed to them? Were the\r\nobjection to be read by one who had not seen the mode prescribed by the\r\nConstitution for the choice of representatives, he could suppose\r\nnothing less than that some unreasonable qualification of property was\r\nannexed to the right of suffrage; or that the right of eligibility was\r\nlimited to persons of particular families or fortunes; or at least that\r\nthe mode prescribed by the State constitutions was in some respect or\r\nother, very grossly departed from. We have seen how far such a\r\nsupposition would err, as to the two first points. Nor would it, in\r\nfact, be less erroneous as to the last. The only difference\r\ndiscoverable between the two cases is, that each representative of the\r\nUnited States will be elected by five or six thousand citizens; whilst\r\nin the individual States, the election of a representative is left to\r\nabout as many hundreds. Will it be pretended that this difference is\r\nsufficient to justify an attachment to the State governments, and an\r\nabhorrence to the federal government? If this be the point on which the\r\nobjection turns, it deserves to be examined. Is it supported by REASON?\r\n\r\nThis cannot be said, without maintaining that five or six thousand\r\ncitizens are less capable of choosing a fit representative, or more\r\nliable to be corrupted by an unfit one, than five or six hundred.\r\nReason, on the contrary, assures us, that as in so great a number a fit\r\nrepresentative would be most likely to be found, so the choice would be\r\nless likely to be diverted from him by the intrigues of the ambitious\r\nor the ambitious or the bribes of the rich. Is the CONSEQUENCE from\r\nthis doctrine admissible? If we say that five or six hundred citizens\r\nare as many as can jointly exercise their right of suffrage, must we\r\nnot deprive the people of the immediate choice of their public\r\nservants, in every instance where the administration of the government\r\ndoes not require as many of them as will amount to one for that number\r\nof citizens? Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS? It was shown in the\r\nlast paper, that the real representation in the British House of\r\nCommons very little exceeds the proportion of one for every thirty\r\nthousand inhabitants. Besides a variety of powerful causes not existing\r\nhere, and which favor in that country the pretensions of rank and\r\nwealth, no person is eligible as a representative of a county, unless\r\nhe possess real estate of the clear value of six hundred pounds\r\nsterling per year; nor of a city or borough, unless he possess a like\r\nestate of half that annual value. To this qualification on the part of\r\nthe county representatives is added another on the part of the county\r\nelectors, which restrains the right of suffrage to persons having a\r\nfreehold estate of the annual value of more than twenty pounds\r\nsterling, according to the present rate of money. Notwithstanding these\r\nunfavorable circumstances, and notwithstanding some very unequal laws\r\nin the British code, it cannot be said that the representatives of the\r\nnation have elevated the few on the ruins of the many. But we need not\r\nresort to foreign experience on this subject. Our own is explicit and\r\ndecisive. The districts in New Hampshire in which the senators are\r\nchosen immediately by the people, are nearly as large as will be\r\nnecessary for her representatives in the Congress. Those of\r\nMassachusetts are larger than will be necessary for that purpose; and\r\nthose of New York still more so.\r\n\r\nIn the last State the members of Assembly for the cities and counties\r\nof New York and Albany are elected by very nearly as many voters as\r\nwill be entitled to a representative in the Congress, calculating on\r\nthe number of sixty-five representatives only. It makes no difference\r\nthat in these senatorial districts and counties a number of\r\nrepresentatives are voted for by each elector at the same time. If the\r\nsame electors at the same time are capable of choosing four or five\r\nrepresentatives, they cannot be incapable of choosing one. Pennsylvania\r\nis an additional example. Some of her counties, which elect her State\r\nrepresentatives, are almost as large as her districts will be by which\r\nher federal representatives will be elected. The city of Philadelphia\r\nis supposed to contain between fifty and sixty thousand souls. It will\r\ntherefore form nearly two districts for the choice of federal\r\nrepresentatives. It forms, however, but one county, in which every\r\nelector votes for each of its representatives in the State legislature.\r\nAnd what may appear to be still more directly to our purpose, the whole\r\ncity actually elects a SINGLE MEMBER for the executive council. This is\r\nthe case in all the other counties of the State. Are not these facts\r\nthe most satisfactory proofs of the fallacy which has been employed\r\nagainst the branch of the federal government under consideration? Has\r\nit appeared on trial that the senators of New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nand New York, or the executive council of Pennsylvania, or the members\r\nof the Assembly in the two last States, have betrayed any peculiar\r\ndisposition to sacrifice the many to the few, or are in any respect\r\nless worthy of their places than the representatives and magistrates\r\nappointed in other States by very small divisions of the people? But\r\nthere are cases of a stronger complexion than any which I have yet\r\nquoted.\r\n\r\nOne branch of the legislature of Connecticut is so constituted that\r\neach member of it is elected by the whole State. So is the governor of\r\nthat State, of Massachusetts, and of this State, and the president of\r\nNew Hampshire. I leave every man to decide whether the result of any\r\none of these experiments can be said to countenance a suspicion, that a\r\ndiffusive mode of choosing representatives of the people tends to\r\nelevate traitors and to undermine the public liberty.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LVIII.\r\n\r\nObjection That The Number of Members Will Not Be Augmented as the\r\nProgress of Population Demands Considered\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe remaining charge against the House of Representatives, which I am\r\nto examine, is grounded on a supposition that the number of members\r\nwill not be augmented from time to time, as the progress of population\r\nmay demand. It has been admitted, that this objection, if well\r\nsupported, would have great weight. The following observations will\r\nshow that, like most other objections against the Constitution, it can\r\nonly proceed from a partial view of the subject, or from a jealousy\r\nwhich discolors and disfigures every object which is beheld. 1. Those\r\nwho urge the objection seem not to have recollected that the federal\r\nConstitution will not suffer by a comparison with the State\r\nconstitutions, in the security provided for a gradual augmentation of\r\nthe number of representatives. The number which is to prevail in the\r\nfirst instance is declared to be temporary. Its duration is limited to\r\nthe short term of three years. Within every successive term of ten\r\nyears a census of inhabitants is to be repeated. The unequivocal\r\nobjects of these regulations are, first, to readjust, from time to\r\ntime, the apportionment of representatives to the number of\r\ninhabitants, under the single exception that each State shall have one\r\nrepresentative at least; secondly, to augment the number of\r\nrepresentatives at the same periods, under the sole limitation that the\r\nwhole number shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants. If we review the constitutions of the several States, we\r\nshall find that some of them contain no determinate regulations on this\r\nsubject, that others correspond pretty much on this point with the\r\nfederal Constitution, and that the most effectual security in any of\r\nthem is resolvable into a mere directory provision. 2. As far as\r\nexperience has taken place on this subject, a gradual increase of\r\nrepresentatives under the State constitutions has at least kept pace\r\nwith that of the constituents, and it appears that the former have been\r\nas ready to concur in such measures as the latter have been to call for\r\nthem. 3. There is a peculiarity in the federal Constitution which\r\ninsures a watchful attention in a majority both of the people and of\r\ntheir representatives to a constitutional augmentation of the latter.\r\nThe peculiarity lies in this, that one branch of the legislature is a\r\nrepresentation of citizens, the other of the States: in the former,\r\nconsequently, the larger States will have most weight; in the latter,\r\nthe advantage will be in favor of the smaller States. From this\r\ncircumstance it may with certainty be inferred that the larger States\r\nwill be strenuous advocates for increasing the number and weight of\r\nthat part of the legislature in which their influence predominates. And\r\nit so happens that four only of the largest will have a majority of the\r\nwhole votes in the House of Representatives. Should the representatives\r\nor people, therefore, of the smaller States oppose at any time a\r\nreasonable addition of members, a coalition of a very few States will\r\nbe sufficient to overrule the opposition; a coalition which,\r\nnotwithstanding the rivalship and local prejudices which might prevent\r\nit on ordinary occasions, would not fail to take place, when not merely\r\nprompted by common interest, but justified by equity and the principles\r\nof the Constitution. It may be alleged, perhaps, that the Senate would\r\nbe prompted by like motives to an adverse coalition; and as their\r\nconcurrence would be indispensable, the just and constitutional views\r\nof the other branch might be defeated. This is the difficulty which has\r\nprobably created the most serious apprehensions in the jealous friends\r\nof a numerous representation. Fortunately it is among the difficulties\r\nwhich, existing only in appearance, vanish on a close and accurate\r\ninspection. The following reflections will, if I mistake not, be\r\nadmitted to be conclusive and satisfactory on this point.\r\nNotwithstanding the equal authority which will subsist between the two\r\nhouses on all legislative subjects, except the originating of money\r\nbills, it cannot be doubted that the House, composed of the greater\r\nnumber of members, when supported by the more powerful States, and\r\nspeaking the known and determined sense of a majority of the people,\r\nwill have no small advantage in a question depending on the comparative\r\nfirmness of the two houses. This advantage must be increased by the\r\nconsciousness, felt by the same side of being supported in its demands\r\nby right, by reason, and by the Constitution; and the consciousness, on\r\nthe opposite side, of contending against the force of all these solemn\r\nconsiderations. It is farther to be considered, that in the gradation\r\nbetween the smallest and largest States, there are several, which,\r\nthough most likely in general to arrange themselves among the former\r\nare too little removed in extent and population from the latter, to\r\nsecond an opposition to their just and legitimate pretensions. Hence it\r\nis by no means certain that a majority of votes, even in the Senate,\r\nwould be unfriendly to proper augmentations in the number of\r\nrepresentatives. It will not be looking too far to add, that the\r\nsenators from all the new States may be gained over to the just views\r\nof the House of Representatives, by an expedient too obvious to be\r\noverlooked. As these States will, for a great length of time, advance\r\nin population with peculiar rapidity, they will be interested in\r\nfrequent reapportionments of the representatives to the number of\r\ninhabitants. The large States, therefore, who will prevail in the House\r\nof Representatives, will have nothing to do but to make\r\nreapportionments and augmentations mutually conditions of each other;\r\nand the senators from all the most growing States will be bound to\r\ncontend for the latter, by the interest which their States will feel in\r\nthe former. These considerations seem to afford ample security on this\r\nsubject, and ought alone to satisfy all the doubts and fears which have\r\nbeen indulged with regard to it. Admitting, however, that they should\r\nall be insufficient to subdue the unjust policy of the smaller States,\r\nor their predominant influence in the councils of the Senate, a\r\nconstitutional and infallible resource still remains with the larger\r\nStates, by which they will be able at all times to accomplish their\r\njust purposes. The House of Representatives cannot only refuse, but\r\nthey alone can propose, the supplies requisite for the support of\r\ngovernment. They, in a word, hold the purse that powerful instrument by\r\nwhich we behold, in the history of the British Constitution, an infant\r\nand humble representation of the people gradually enlarging the sphere\r\nof its activity and importance, and finally reducing, as far as it\r\nseems to have wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other\r\nbranches of the government. This power over the purse may, in fact, be\r\nregarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any\r\nconstitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for\r\nobtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect\r\nevery just and salutary measure. But will not the House of\r\nRepresentatives be as much interested as the Senate in maintaining the\r\ngovernment in its proper functions, and will they not therefore be\r\nunwilling to stake its existence or its reputation on the pliancy of\r\nthe Senate? Or, if such a trial of firmness between the two branches\r\nwere hazarded, would not the one be as likely first to yield as the\r\nother? These questions will create no difficulty with those who reflect\r\nthat in all cases the smaller the number, and the more permanent and\r\nconspicuous the station, of men in power, the stronger must be the\r\ninterest which they will individually feel in whatever concerns the\r\ngovernment. Those who represent the dignity of their country in the\r\neyes of other nations, will be particularly sensible to every prospect\r\nof public danger, or of dishonorable stagnation in public affairs. To\r\nthose causes we are to ascribe the continual triumph of the British\r\nHouse of Commons over the other branches of the government, whenever\r\nthe engine of a money bill has been employed. An absolute inflexibility\r\non the side of the latter, although it could not have failed to involve\r\nevery department of the state in the general confusion, has neither\r\nbeen apprehended nor experienced. The utmost degree of firmness that\r\ncan be displayed by the federal Senate or President, will not be more\r\nthan equal to a resistance in which they will be supported by\r\nconstitutional and patriotic principles. In this review of the\r\nConstitution of the House of Representatives, I have passed over the\r\ncircumstances of economy, which, in the present state of affairs, might\r\nhave had some effect in lessening the temporary number of\r\nrepresentatives, and a disregard of which would probably have been as\r\nrich a theme of declamation against the Constitution as has been shown\r\nby the smallness of the number proposed. I omit also any remarks on the\r\ndifficulty which might be found, under present circumstances, in\r\nengaging in the federal service a large number of such characters as\r\nthe people will probably elect. One observation, however, I must be\r\npermitted to add on this subject as claiming, in my judgment, a very\r\nserious attention. It is, that in all legislative assemblies the\r\ngreater the number composing them may be, the fewer will be the men who\r\nwill in fact direct their proceedings. In the first place, the more\r\nnumerous an assembly may be, of whatever characters composed, the\r\ngreater is known to be the ascendency of passion over reason. In the\r\nnext place, the larger the number, the greater will be the proportion\r\nof members of limited information and of weak capacities. Now, it is\r\nprecisely on characters of this description that the eloquence and\r\naddress of the few are known to act with all their force. In the\r\nancient republics, where the whole body of the people assembled in\r\nperson, a single orator, or an artful statesman, was generally seen to\r\nrule with as complete a sway as if a sceptre had been placed in his\r\nsingle hand. On the same principle, the more multitudinous a\r\nrepresentative assembly may be rendered, the more it will partake of\r\nthe infirmities incident to collective meetings of the people.\r\n\r\nIgnorance will be the dupe of cunning, and passion the slave of\r\nsophistry and declamation. The people can never err more than in\r\nsupposing that by multiplying their representatives beyond a certain\r\nlimit, they strengthen the barrier against the government of a few.\r\nExperience will forever admonish them that, on the contrary, AFTER\r\nSECURING A SUFFICIENT NUMBER FOR THE PURPOSES OF SAFETY, OF LOCAL\r\nINFORMATION, AND OF DIFFUSIVE SYMPATHY WITH THE WHOLE SOCIETY, they\r\nwill counteract their own views by every addition to their\r\nrepresentatives. The countenance of the government may become more\r\ndemocratic, but the soul that animates it will be more oligarchic. The\r\nmachine will be enlarged, but the fewer, and often the more secret,\r\nwill be the springs by which its motions are directed. As connected\r\nwith the objection against the number of representatives, may properly\r\nbe here noticed, that which has been suggested against the number made\r\ncompetent for legislative business. It has been said that more than a\r\nmajority ought to have been required for a quorum; and in particular\r\ncases, if not in all, more than a majority of a quorum for a decision.\r\nThat some advantages might have resulted from such a precaution, cannot\r\nbe denied. It might have been an additional shield to some particular\r\ninterests, and another obstacle generally to hasty and partial\r\nmeasures. But these considerations are outweighed by the inconveniences\r\nin the opposite scale. In all cases where justice or the general good\r\nmight require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be pursued,\r\nthe fundamental principle of free government would be reversed. It\r\nwould be no longer the majority that would rule: the power would be\r\ntransferred to the minority. Were the defensive privilege limited to\r\nparticular cases, an interested minority might take advantage of it to\r\nscreen themselves from equitable sacrifices to the general weal, or, in\r\nparticular emergencies, to extort unreasonable indulgences. Lastly, it\r\nwould facilitate and foster the baneful practice of secessions; a\r\npractice which has shown itself even in States where a majority only is\r\nrequired; a practice subversive of all the principles of order and\r\nregular government; a practice which leads more directly to public\r\nconvulsions, and the ruin of popular governments, than any other which\r\nhas yet been displayed among us.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LIX.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of Members\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 22, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe natural order of the subject leads us to consider, in this place,\r\nthat provision of the Constitution which authorizes the national\r\nlegislature to regulate, in the last resort, the election of its own\r\nmembers. It is in these words: “The TIMES, PLACES, and MANNER of\r\nholding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed\r\nin each State by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may, at any\r\ntime, by law, make or alter SUCH REGULATIONS, except as to the PLACES\r\nof choosing senators.”[1] This provision has not only been declaimed\r\nagainst by those who condemn the Constitution in the gross, but it has\r\nbeen censured by those who have objected with less latitude and greater\r\nmoderation; and, in one instance it has been thought exceptionable by a\r\ngentleman who has declared himself the advocate of every other part of\r\nthe system. I am greatly mistaken, notwithstanding, if there be any\r\narticle in the whole plan more completely defensible than this. Its\r\npropriety rests upon the evidence of this plain proposition, that EVERY\r\nGOVERNMENT OUGHT TO CONTAIN IN ITSELF THE MEANS OF ITS OWN\r\nPRESERVATION. Every just reasoner will, at first sight, approve an\r\nadherence to this rule, in the work of the convention; and will\r\ndisapprove every deviation from it which may not appear to have been\r\ndictated by the necessity of incorporating into the work some\r\nparticular ingredient, with which a rigid conformity to the rule was\r\nincompatible. Even in this case, though he may acquiesce in the\r\nnecessity, yet he will not cease to regard and to regret a departure\r\nfrom so fundamental a principle, as a portion of imperfection in the\r\nsystem which may prove the seed of future weakness, and perhaps\r\nanarchy. It will not be alleged, that an election law could have been\r\nframed and inserted in the Constitution, which would have been always\r\napplicable to every probable change in the situation of the country;\r\nand it will therefore not be denied, that a discretionary power over\r\nelections ought to exist somewhere. It will, I presume, be as readily\r\nconceded, that there were only three ways in which this power could\r\nhave been reasonably modified and disposed: that it must either have\r\nbeen lodged wholly in the national legislature, or wholly in the State\r\nlegislatures, or primarily in the latter and ultimately in the former.\r\nThe last mode has, with reason, been preferred by the convention. They\r\nhave submitted the regulation of elections for the federal government,\r\nin the first instance, to the local administrations; which, in ordinary\r\ncases, and when no improper views prevail, may be both more convenient\r\nand more satisfactory; but they have reserved to the national authority\r\na right to interpose, whenever extraordinary circumstances might render\r\nthat interposition necessary to its safety. Nothing can be more\r\nevident, than that an exclusive power of regulating elections for the\r\nnational government, in the hands of the State legislatures, would\r\nleave the existence of the Union entirely at their mercy. They could at\r\nany moment annihilate it, by neglecting to provide for the choice of\r\npersons to administer its affairs. It is to little purpose to say, that\r\na neglect or omission of this kind would not be likely to take place.\r\nThe constitutional possibility of the thing, without an equivalent for\r\nthe risk, is an unanswerable objection. Nor has any satisfactory reason\r\nbeen yet assigned for incurring that risk. The extravagant surmises of\r\na distempered jealousy can never be dignified with that character. If\r\nwe are in a humor to presume abuses of power, it is as fair to presume\r\nthem on the part of the State governments as on the part of the general\r\ngovernment. And as it is more consonant to the rules of a just theory,\r\nto trust the Union with the care of its own existence, than to transfer\r\nthat care to any other hands, if abuses of power are to be hazarded on\r\nthe one side or on the other, it is more rational to hazard them where\r\nthe power would naturally be placed, than where it would unnaturally be\r\nplaced. Suppose an article had been introduced into the Constitution,\r\nempowering the United States to regulate the elections for the\r\nparticular States, would any man have hesitated to condemn it, both as\r\nan unwarrantable transposition of power, and as a premeditated engine\r\nfor the destruction of the State governments? The violation of\r\nprinciple, in this case, would have required no comment; and, to an\r\nunbiased observer, it will not be less apparent in the project of\r\nsubjecting the existence of the national government, in a similar\r\nrespect, to the pleasure of the State governments. An impartial view of\r\nthe matter cannot fail to result in a conviction, that each, as far as\r\npossible, ought to depend on itself for its own preservation. As an\r\nobjection to this position, it may be remarked that the constitution of\r\nthe national Senate would involve, in its full extent, the danger which\r\nit is suggested might flow from an exclusive power in the State\r\nlegislatures to regulate the federal elections. It may be alleged, that\r\nby declining the appointment of Senators, they might at any time give a\r\nfatal blow to the Union; and from this it may be inferred, that as its\r\nexistence would be thus rendered dependent upon them in so essential a\r\npoint, there can be no objection to intrusting them with it in the\r\nparticular case under consideration. The interest of each State, it may\r\nbe added, to maintain its representation in the national councils,\r\nwould be a complete security against an abuse of the trust. This\r\nargument, though specious, will not, upon examination, be found solid.\r\nIt is certainly true that the State legislatures, by forbearing the\r\nappointment of senators, may destroy the national government. But it\r\nwill not follow that, because they have a power to do this in one\r\ninstance, they ought to have it in every other. There are cases in\r\nwhich the pernicious tendency of such a power may be far more decisive,\r\nwithout any motive equally cogent with that which must have regulated\r\nthe conduct of the convention in respect to the formation of the\r\nSenate, to recommend their admission into the system. So far as that\r\nconstruction may expose the Union to the possibility of injury from the\r\nState legislatures, it is an evil; but it is an evil which could not\r\nhave been avoided without excluding the States, in their political\r\ncapacities, wholly from a place in the organization of the national\r\ngovernment. If this had been done, it would doubtless have been\r\ninterpreted into an entire dereliction of the federal principle; and\r\nwould certainly have deprived the State governments of that absolute\r\nsafeguard which they will enjoy under this provision. But however wise\r\nit may have been to have submitted in this instance to an\r\ninconvenience, for the attainment of a necessary advantage or a greater\r\ngood, no inference can be drawn from thence to favor an accumulation of\r\nthe evil, where no necessity urges, nor any greater good invites. It\r\nmay be easily discerned also that the national government would run a\r\nmuch greater risk from a power in the State legislatures over the\r\nelections of its House of Representatives, than from their power of\r\nappointing the members of its Senate. The senators are to be chosen for\r\nthe period of six years; there is to be a rotation, by which the seats\r\nof a third part of them are to be vacated and replenished every two\r\nyears; and no State is to be entitled to more than two senators; a\r\nquorum of the body is to consist of sixteen members. The joint result\r\nof these circumstances would be, that a temporary combination of a few\r\nStates to intermit the appointment of senators, could neither annul the\r\nexistence nor impair the activity of the body; and it is not from a\r\ngeneral and permanent combination of the States that we can have any\r\nthing to fear. The first might proceed from sinister designs in the\r\nleading members of a few of the State legislatures; the last would\r\nsuppose a fixed and rooted disaffection in the great body of the\r\npeople, which will either never exist at all, or will, in all\r\nprobability, proceed from an experience of the inaptitude of the\r\ngeneral government to the advancement of their happiness in which event\r\nno good citizen could desire its continuance. But with regard to the\r\nfederal House of Representatives, there is intended to be a general\r\nelection of members once in two years. If the State legislatures were\r\nto be invested with an exclusive power of regulating these elections,\r\nevery period of making them would be a delicate crisis in the national\r\nsituation, which might issue in a dissolution of the Union, if the\r\nleaders of a few of the most important States should have entered into\r\na previous conspiracy to prevent an election. I shall not deny, that\r\nthere is a degree of weight in the observation, that the interests of\r\neach State, to be represented in the federal councils, will be a\r\nsecurity against the abuse of a power over its elections in the hands\r\nof the State legislatures. But the security will not be considered as\r\ncomplete, by those who attend to the force of an obvious distinction\r\nbetween the interest of the people in the public felicity, and the\r\ninterest of their local rulers in the power and consequence of their\r\noffices. The people of America may be warmly attached to the government\r\nof the Union, at times when the particular rulers of particular States,\r\nstimulated by the natural rivalship of power, and by the hopes of\r\npersonal aggrandizement, and supported by a strong faction in each of\r\nthose States, may be in a very opposite temper. This diversity of\r\nsentiment between a majority of the people, and the individuals who\r\nhave the greatest credit in their councils, is exemplified in some of\r\nthe States at the present moment, on the present question. The scheme\r\nof separate confederacies, which will always multiply the chances of\r\nambition, will be a never failing bait to all such influential\r\ncharacters in the State administrations as are capable of preferring\r\ntheir own emolument and advancement to the public weal. With so\r\neffectual a weapon in their hands as the exclusive power of regulating\r\nelections for the national government, a combination of a few such men,\r\nin a few of the most considerable States, where the temptation will\r\nalways be the strongest, might accomplish the destruction of the Union,\r\nby seizing the opportunity of some casual dissatisfaction among the\r\npeople (and which perhaps they may themselves have excited), to\r\ndiscontinue the choice of members for the federal House of\r\nRepresentatives. It ought never to be forgotten, that a firm union of\r\nthis country, under an efficient government, will probably be an\r\nincreasing object of jealousy to more than one nation of Europe; and\r\nthat enterprises to subvert it will sometimes originate in the\r\nintrigues of foreign powers, and will seldom fail to be patronized and\r\nabetted by some of them. Its preservation, therefore ought in no case\r\nthat can be avoided, to be committed to the guardianship of any but\r\nthose whose situation will uniformly beget an immediate interest in the\r\nfaithful and vigilant performance of the trust.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] 1st clause, 4th section, of the 1st article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LX.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of Members)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, February 26, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nWe have seen, that an uncontrollable power over the elections to the\r\nfederal government could not, without hazard, be committed to the State\r\nlegislatures. Let us now see, what would be the danger on the other\r\nside; that is, from confiding the ultimate right of regulating its own\r\nelections to the Union itself. It is not pretended, that this right\r\nwould ever be used for the exclusion of any State from its share in the\r\nrepresentation. The interest of all would, in this respect at least, be\r\nthe security of all. But it is alleged, that it might be employed in\r\nsuch a manner as to promote the election of some favorite class of men\r\nin exclusion of others, by confining the places of election to\r\nparticular districts, and rendering it impracticable to the citizens at\r\nlarge to partake in the choice. Of all chimerical suppositions, this\r\nseems to be the most chimerical. On the one hand, no rational\r\ncalculation of probabilities would lead us to imagine that the\r\ndisposition which a conduct so violent and extraordinary would imply,\r\ncould ever find its way into the national councils; and on the other,\r\nit may be concluded with certainty, that if so improper a spirit should\r\never gain admittance into them, it would display itself in a form\r\naltogether different and far more decisive.\r\n\r\nThe improbability of the attempt may be satisfactorily inferred from\r\nthis single reflection, that it could never be made without causing an\r\nimmediate revolt of the great body of the people, headed and directed\r\nby the State governments. It is not difficult to conceive that this\r\ncharacteristic right of freedom may, in certain turbulent and factious\r\nseasons, be violated, in respect to a particular class of citizens, by\r\na victorious and overbearing majority; but that so fundamental a\r\nprivilege, in a country so situated and enlightened, should be invaded\r\nto the prejudice of the great mass of the people, by the deliberate\r\npolicy of the government, without occasioning a popular revolution, is\r\naltogether inconceivable and incredible.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this general reflection, there are considerations of a\r\nmore precise nature, which forbid all apprehension on the subject. The\r\ndissimilarity in the ingredients which will compose the national\r\ngovernment, and still more in the manner in which they will be brought\r\ninto action in its various branches, must form a powerful obstacle to a\r\nconcert of views in any partial scheme of elections. There is\r\nsufficient diversity in the state of property, in the genius, manners,\r\nand habits of the people of the different parts of the Union, to\r\noccasion a material diversity of disposition in their representatives\r\ntowards the different ranks and conditions in society. And though an\r\nintimate intercourse under the same government will promote a gradual\r\nassimilation in some of these respects, yet there are causes, as well\r\nphysical as moral, which may, in a greater or less degree, permanently\r\nnourish different propensities and inclinations in this respect. But\r\nthe circumstance which will be likely to have the greatest influence in\r\nthe matter, will be the dissimilar modes of constituting the several\r\ncomponent parts of the government. The House of Representatives being\r\nto be elected immediately by the people, the Senate by the State\r\nlegislatures, the President by electors chosen for that purpose by the\r\npeople, there would be little probability of a common interest to\r\ncement these different branches in a predilection for any particular\r\nclass of electors.\r\n\r\nAs to the Senate, it is impossible that any regulation of “time and\r\nmanner,” which is all that is proposed to be submitted to the national\r\ngovernment in respect to that body, can affect the spirit which will\r\ndirect the choice of its members. The collective sense of the State\r\nlegislatures can never be influenced by extraneous circumstances of\r\nthat sort; a consideration which alone ought to satisfy us that the\r\ndiscrimination apprehended would never be attempted. For what\r\ninducement could the Senate have to concur in a preference in which\r\nitself would not be included? Or to what purpose would it be\r\nestablished, in reference to one branch of the legislature, if it could\r\nnot be extended to the other? The composition of the one would in this\r\ncase counteract that of the other. And we can never suppose that it\r\nwould embrace the appointments to the Senate, unless we can at the same\r\ntime suppose the voluntary co-operation of the State legislatures. If\r\nwe make the latter supposition, it then becomes immaterial where the\r\npower in question is placed whether in their hands or in those of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nBut what is to be the object of this capricious partiality in the\r\nnational councils? Is it to be exercised in a discrimination between\r\nthe different departments of industry, or between the different kinds\r\nof property, or between the different degrees of property? Will it lean\r\nin favor of the landed interest, or the moneyed interest, or the\r\nmercantile interest, or the manufacturing interest? Or, to speak in the\r\nfashionable language of the adversaries to the Constitution, will it\r\ncourt the elevation of “the wealthy and the well-born,” to the\r\nexclusion and debasement of all the rest of the society?\r\n\r\nIf this partiality is to be exerted in favor of those who are concerned\r\nin any particular description of industry or property, I presume it\r\nwill readily be admitted, that the competition for it will lie between\r\nlanded men and merchants. And I scruple not to affirm, that it is\r\ninfinitely less likely that either of them should gain an ascendant in\r\nthe national councils, than that the one or the other of them should\r\npredominate in all the local councils. The inference will be, that a\r\nconduct tending to give an undue preference to either is much less to\r\nbe dreaded from the former than from the latter.\r\n\r\nThe several States are in various degrees addicted to agriculture and\r\ncommerce. In most, if not all of them, agriculture is predominant. In a\r\nfew of them, however, commerce nearly divides its empire, and in most\r\nof them has a considerable share of influence. In proportion as either\r\nprevails, it will be conveyed into the national representation; and for\r\nthe very reason, that this will be an emanation from a greater variety\r\nof interests, and in much more various proportions, than are to be\r\nfound in any single State, it will be much less apt to espouse either\r\nof them with a decided partiality, than the representation of any\r\nsingle State.\r\n\r\nIn a country consisting chiefly of the cultivators of land, where the\r\nrules of an equal representation obtain, the landed interest must, upon\r\nthe whole, preponderate in the government. As long as this interest\r\nprevails in most of the State legislatures, so long it must maintain a\r\ncorrespondent superiority in the national Senate, which will generally\r\nbe a faithful copy of the majorities of those assemblies. It cannot\r\ntherefore be presumed, that a sacrifice of the landed to the mercantile\r\nclass will ever be a favorite object of this branch of the federal\r\nlegislature. In applying thus particularly to the Senate a general\r\nobservation suggested by the situation of the country, I am governed by\r\nthe consideration, that the credulous votaries of State power cannot,\r\nupon their own principles, suspect, that the State legislatures would\r\nbe warped from their duty by any external influence. But in reality the\r\nsame situation must have the same effect, in the primative composition\r\nat least of the federal House of Representatives: an improper bias\r\ntowards the mercantile class is as little to be expected from this\r\nquarter as from the other.\r\n\r\nIn order, perhaps, to give countenance to the objection at any rate, it\r\nmay be asked, is there not danger of an opposite bias in the national\r\ngovernment, which may dispose it to endeavor to secure a monopoly of\r\nthe federal administration to the landed class? As there is little\r\nlikelihood that the supposition of such a bias will have any terrors\r\nfor those who would be immediately injured by it, a labored answer to\r\nthis question will be dispensed with. It will be sufficient to remark,\r\nfirst, that for the reasons elsewhere assigned, it is less likely that\r\nany decided partiality should prevail in the councils of the Union than\r\nin those of any of its members. Secondly, that there would be no\r\ntemptation to violate the Constitution in favor of the landed class,\r\nbecause that class would, in the natural course of things, enjoy as\r\ngreat a preponderancy as itself could desire. And thirdly, that men\r\naccustomed to investigate the sources of public prosperity upon a large\r\nscale, must be too well convinced of the utility of commerce, to be\r\ninclined to inflict upon it so deep a wound as would result from the\r\nentire exclusion of those who would best understand its interest from a\r\nshare in the management of them. The importance of commerce, in the\r\nview of revenue alone, must effectually guard it against the enmity of\r\na body which would be continually importuned in its favor, by the\r\nurgent calls of public necessity.\r\n\r\nI the rather consult brevity in discussing the probability of a\r\npreference founded upon a discrimination between the different kinds of\r\nindustry and property, because, as far as I understand the meaning of\r\nthe objectors, they contemplate a discrimination of another kind. They\r\nappear to have in view, as the objects of the preference with which\r\nthey endeavor to alarm us, those whom they designate by the description\r\nof “the wealthy and the well-born.” These, it seems, are to be exalted\r\nto an odious pre-eminence over the rest of their fellow-citizens. At\r\none time, however, their elevation is to be a necessary consequence of\r\nthe smallness of the representative body; at another time it is to be\r\neffected by depriving the people at large of the opportunity of\r\nexercising their right of suffrage in the choice of that body.\r\n\r\nBut upon what principle is the discrimination of the places of election\r\nto be made, in order to answer the purpose of the meditated preference?\r\nAre “the wealthy and the well-born,” as they are called, confined to\r\nparticular spots in the several States? Have they, by some miraculous\r\ninstinct or foresight, set apart in each of them a common place of\r\nresidence? Are they only to be met with in the towns or cities? Or are\r\nthey, on the contrary, scattered over the face of the country as\r\navarice or chance may have happened to cast their own lot or that of\r\ntheir predecessors? If the latter is the case, (as every intelligent\r\nman knows it to be[1]) is it not evident that the policy of confining\r\nthe places of election to particular districts would be as subversive\r\nof its own aim as it would be exceptionable on every other account? The\r\ntruth is, that there is no method of securing to the rich the\r\npreference apprehended, but by prescribing qualifications of property\r\neither for those who may elect or be elected. But this forms no part of\r\nthe power to be conferred upon the national government. Its authority\r\nwould be expressly restricted to the regulation of the TIMES, the\r\nPLACES, the MANNER of elections. The qualifications of the persons who\r\nmay choose or be chosen, as has been remarked upon other occasions, are\r\ndefined and fixed in the Constitution, and are unalterable by the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nLet it, however, be admitted, for argument sake, that the expedient\r\nsuggested might be successful; and let it at the same time be equally\r\ntaken for granted that all the scruples which a sense of duty or an\r\napprehension of the danger of the experiment might inspire, were\r\novercome in the breasts of the national rulers, still I imagine it will\r\nhardly be pretended that they could ever hope to carry such an\r\nenterprise into execution without the aid of a military force\r\nsufficient to subdue the resistance of the great body of the people.\r\nThe improbability of the existence of a force equal to that object has\r\nbeen discussed and demonstrated in different parts of these papers; but\r\nthat the futility of the objection under consideration may appear in\r\nthe strongest light, it shall be conceded for a moment that such a\r\nforce might exist, and the national government shall be supposed to be\r\nin the actual possession of it. What will be the conclusion? With a\r\ndisposition to invade the essential rights of the community, and with\r\nthe means of gratifying that disposition, is it presumable that the\r\npersons who were actuated by it would amuse themselves in the\r\nridiculous task of fabricating election laws for securing a preference\r\nto a favorite class of men? Would they not be likely to prefer a\r\nconduct better adapted to their own immediate aggrandizement? Would\r\nthey not rather boldly resolve to perpetuate themselves in office by\r\none decisive act of usurpation, than to trust to precarious expedients\r\nwhich, in spite of all the precautions that might accompany them, might\r\nterminate in the dismission, disgrace, and ruin of their authors? Would\r\nthey not fear that citizens, not less tenacious than conscious of their\r\nrights, would flock from the remote extremes of their respective States\r\nto the places of election, to overthrow their tyrants, and to\r\nsubstitute men who would be disposed to avenge the violated majesty of\r\nthe people?\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] Particularly in the Southern States and in this State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXI.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of Members)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, February 26, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe more candid opposers of the provision respecting elections,\r\ncontained in the plan of the convention, when pressed in argument, will\r\nsometimes concede the propriety of that provision; with this\r\nqualification, however, that it ought to have been accompanied with a\r\ndeclaration, that all elections should be had in the counties where the\r\nelectors resided. This, say they, was a necessary precaution against an\r\nabuse of the power. A declaration of this nature would certainly have\r\nbeen harmless; so far as it would have had the effect of quieting\r\napprehensions, it might not have been undesirable. But it would, in\r\nfact, have afforded little or no additional security against the danger\r\napprehended; and the want of it will never be considered, by an\r\nimpartial and judicious examiner, as a serious, still less as an\r\ninsuperable, objection to the plan. The different views taken of the\r\nsubject in the two preceding papers must be sufficient to satisfy all\r\ndispassionate and discerning men, that if the public liberty should\r\never be the victim of the ambition of the national rulers, the power\r\nunder examination, at least, will be guiltless of the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIf those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only, would\r\nexercise it in a careful inspection of the several State constitutions,\r\nthey would find little less room for disquietude and alarm, from the\r\nlatitude which most of them allow in respect to elections, than from\r\nthe latitude which is proposed to be allowed to the national government\r\nin the same respect. A review of their situation, in this particular,\r\nwould tend greatly to remove any ill impressions which may remain in\r\nregard to this matter. But as that view would lead into long and\r\ntedious details, I shall content myself with the single example of the\r\nState in which I write. The constitution of New York makes no other\r\nprovision for LOCALITY of elections, than that the members of the\r\nAssembly shall be elected in the COUNTIES; those of the Senate, in the\r\ngreat districts into which the State is or may be divided: these at\r\npresent are four in number, and comprehend each from two to six\r\ncounties. It may readily be perceived that it would not be more\r\ndifficult to the legislature of New York to defeat the suffrages of the\r\ncitizens of New York, by confining elections to particular places, than\r\nfor the legislature of the United States to defeat the suffrages of the\r\ncitizens of the Union, by the like expedient. Suppose, for instance,\r\nthe city of Albany was to be appointed the sole place of election for\r\nthe county and district of which it is a part, would not the\r\ninhabitants of that city speedily become the only electors of the\r\nmembers both of the Senate and Assembly for that county and district?\r\nCan we imagine that the electors who reside in the remote subdivisions\r\nof the counties of Albany, Saratoga, Cambridge, etc., or in any part of\r\nthe county of Montgomery, would take the trouble to come to the city of\r\nAlbany, to give their votes for members of the Assembly or Senate,\r\nsooner than they would repair to the city of New York, to participate\r\nin the choice of the members of the federal House of Representatives?\r\nThe alarming indifference discoverable in the exercise of so invaluable\r\na privilege under the existing laws, which afford every facility to it,\r\nfurnishes a ready answer to this question. And, abstracted from any\r\nexperience on the subject, we can be at no loss to determine, that when\r\nthe place of election is at an INCONVENIENT DISTANCE from the elector,\r\nthe effect upon his conduct will be the same whether that distance be\r\ntwenty miles or twenty thousand miles. Hence it must appear, that\r\nobjections to the particular modification of the federal power of\r\nregulating elections will, in substance, apply with equal force to the\r\nmodification of the like power in the constitution of this State; and\r\nfor this reason it will be impossible to acquit the one, and to condemn\r\nthe other. A similar comparison would lead to the same conclusion in\r\nrespect to the constitutions of most of the other States.\r\n\r\nIf it should be said that defects in the State constitutions furnish no\r\napology for those which are to be found in the plan proposed, I answer,\r\nthat as the former have never been thought chargeable with inattention\r\nto the security of liberty, where the imputations thrown on the latter\r\ncan be shown to be applicable to them also, the presumption is that\r\nthey are rather the cavilling refinements of a predetermined\r\nopposition, than the well-founded inferences of a candid research after\r\ntruth. To those who are disposed to consider, as innocent omissions in\r\nthe State constitutions, what they regard as unpardonable blemishes in\r\nthe plan of the convention, nothing can be said; or at most, they can\r\nonly be asked to assign some substantial reason why the representatives\r\nof the people in a single State should be more impregnable to the lust\r\nof power, or other sinister motives, than the representatives of the\r\npeople of the United States? If they cannot do this, they ought at\r\nleast to prove to us that it is easier to subvert the liberties of\r\nthree millions of people, with the advantage of local governments to\r\nhead their opposition, than of two hundred thousand people who are\r\ndestitute of that advantage. And in relation to the point immediately\r\nunder consideration, they ought to convince us that it is less probable\r\nthat a predominant faction in a single State should, in order to\r\nmaintain its superiority, incline to a preference of a particular class\r\nof electors, than that a similar spirit should take possession of the\r\nrepresentatives of thirteen States, spread over a vast region, and in\r\nseveral respects distinguishable from each other by a diversity of\r\nlocal circumstances, prejudices, and interests.\r\n\r\nHitherto my observations have only aimed at a vindication of the\r\nprovision in question, on the ground of theoretic propriety, on that of\r\nthe danger of placing the power elsewhere, and on that of the safety of\r\nplacing it in the manner proposed. But there remains to be mentioned a\r\npositive advantage which will result from this disposition, and which\r\ncould not as well have been obtained from any other: I allude to the\r\ncircumstance of uniformity in the time of elections for the federal\r\nHouse of Representatives. It is more than possible that this uniformity\r\nmay be found by experience to be of great importance to the public\r\nwelfare, both as a security against the perpetuation of the same spirit\r\nin the body, and as a cure for the diseases of faction. If each State\r\nmay choose its own time of election, it is possible there may be at\r\nleast as many different periods as there are months in the year. The\r\ntimes of election in the several States, as they are now established\r\nfor local purposes, vary between extremes as wide as March and\r\nNovember. The consequence of this diversity would be that there could\r\nnever happen a total dissolution or renovation of the body at one time.\r\nIf an improper spirit of any kind should happen to prevail in it, that\r\nspirit would be apt to infuse itself into the new members, as they come\r\nforward in succession. The mass would be likely to remain nearly the\r\nsame, assimilating constantly to itself its gradual accretions. There\r\nis a contagion in example which few men have sufficient force of mind\r\nto resist. I am inclined to think that treble the duration in office,\r\nwith the condition of a total dissolution of the body at the same time,\r\nmight be less formidable to liberty than one third of that duration\r\nsubject to gradual and successive alterations.\r\n\r\nUniformity in the time of elections seems not less requisite for\r\nexecuting the idea of a regular rotation in the Senate, and for\r\nconveniently assembling the legislature at a stated period in each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, Why, then, could not a time have been fixed in the\r\nConstitution? As the most zealous adversaries of the plan of the\r\nconvention in this State are, in general, not less zealous admirers of\r\nthe constitution of the State, the question may be retorted, and it may\r\nbe asked, Why was not a time for the like purpose fixed in the\r\nconstitution of this State? No better answer can be given than that it\r\nwas a matter which might safely be entrusted to legislative discretion;\r\nand that if a time had been appointed, it might, upon experiment, have\r\nbeen found less convenient than some other time. The same answer may be\r\ngiven to the question put on the other side. And it may be added that\r\nthe supposed danger of a gradual change being merely speculative, it\r\nwould have been hardly advisable upon that speculation to establish, as\r\na fundamental point, what would deprive several States of the\r\nconvenience of having the elections for their own governments and for\r\nthe national government at the same epochs.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXII.\r\n\r\nThe Senate\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nHaving examined the constitution of the House of Representatives, and\r\nanswered such of the objections against it as seemed to merit notice, I\r\nenter next on the examination of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe heads into which this member of the government may be considered\r\nare: I. The qualification of senators; II. The appointment of them by\r\nthe State legislatures; III. The equality of representation in the\r\nSenate; IV. The number of senators, and the term for which they are to\r\nbe elected; V. The powers vested in the Senate.\r\n\r\nI. The qualifications proposed for senators, as distinguished from\r\nthose of representatives, consist in a more advanced age and a longer\r\nperiod of citizenship. A senator must be thirty years of age at least;\r\nas a representative must be twenty-five. And the former must have been\r\na citizen nine years; as seven years are required for the latter. The\r\npropriety of these distinctions is explained by the nature of the\r\nsenatorial trust, which, requiring greater extent of information and\r\nstability of character, requires at the same time that the senator\r\nshould have reached a period of life most likely to supply these\r\nadvantages; and which, participating immediately in transactions with\r\nforeign nations, ought to be exercised by none who are not thoroughly\r\nweaned from the prepossessions and habits incident to foreign birth and\r\neducation. The term of nine years appears to be a prudent mediocrity\r\nbetween a total exclusion of adopted citizens, whose merits and talents\r\nmay claim a share in the public confidence, and an indiscriminate and\r\nhasty admission of them, which might create a channel for foreign\r\ninfluence on the national councils.\r\n\r\nII. It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of senators\r\nby the State legislatures. Among the various modes which might have\r\nbeen devised for constituting this branch of the government, that which\r\nhas been proposed by the convention is probably the most congenial with\r\nthe public opinion. It is recommended by the double advantage of\r\nfavoring a select appointment, and of giving to the State governments\r\nsuch an agency in the formation of the federal government as must\r\nsecure the authority of the former, and may form a convenient link\r\nbetween the two systems.\r\n\r\nIII. The equality of representation in the Senate is another point,\r\nwhich, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite\r\npretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much\r\ndiscussion. If indeed it be right, that among a people thoroughly\r\nincorporated into one nation, every district ought to have a\r\nPROPORTIONAL share in the government, and that among independent and\r\nsovereign States, bound together by a simple league, the parties,\r\nhowever unequal in size, ought to have an EQUAL share in the common\r\ncouncils, it does not appear to be without some reason that in a\r\ncompound republic, partaking both of the national and federal\r\ncharacter, the government ought to be founded on a mixture of the\r\nprinciples of proportional and equal representation. But it is\r\nsuperfluous to try, by the standard of theory, a part of the\r\nConstitution which is allowed on all hands to be the result, not of\r\ntheory, but “of a spirit of amity, and that mutual deference and\r\nconcession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered\r\nindispensable.” A common government, with powers equal to its objects,\r\nis called for by the voice, and still more loudly by the political\r\nsituation, of America. A government founded on principles more\r\nconsonant to the wishes of the larger States, is not likely to be\r\nobtained from the smaller States. The only option, then, for the\r\nformer, lies between the proposed government and a government still\r\nmore objectionable. Under this alternative, the advice of prudence must\r\nbe to embrace the lesser evil; and, instead of indulging a fruitless\r\nanticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue, to contemplate\r\nrather the advantageous consequences which may qualify the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed to each\r\nState is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion of\r\nsovereignty remaining in the individual States, and an instrument for\r\npreserving that residuary sovereignty. So far the equality ought to be\r\nno less acceptable to the large than to the small States; since they\r\nare not less solicitous to guard, by every possible expedient, against\r\nan improper consolidation of the States into one simple republic.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage accruing from this ingredient in the constitution of\r\nthe Senate is, the additional impediment it must prove against improper\r\nacts of legislation. No law or resolution can now be passed without the\r\nconcurrence, first, of a majority of the people, and then, of a\r\nmajority of the States. It must be acknowledged that this complicated\r\ncheck on legislation may in some instances be injurious as well as\r\nbeneficial; and that the peculiar defense which it involves in favor of\r\nthe smaller States, would be more rational, if any interests common to\r\nthem, and distinct from those of the other States, would otherwise be\r\nexposed to peculiar danger. But as the larger States will always be\r\nable, by their power over the supplies, to defeat unreasonable\r\nexertions of this prerogative of the lesser States, and as the faculty\r\nand excess of law-making seem to be the diseases to which our\r\ngovernments are most liable, it is not impossible that this part of the\r\nConstitution may be more convenient in practice than it appears to many\r\nin contemplation.\r\n\r\nIV. The number of senators, and the duration of their appointment, come\r\nnext to be considered. In order to form an accurate judgment on both of\r\nthese points, it will be proper to inquire into the purposes which are\r\nto be answered by a senate; and in order to ascertain these, it will be\r\nnecessary to review the inconveniences which a republic must suffer\r\nfrom the want of such an institution.\r\n\r\nFirst. It is a misfortune incident to republican government, though in\r\na less degree than to other governments, that those who administer it\r\nmay forget their obligations to their constituents, and prove\r\nunfaithful to their important trust. In this point of view, a senate,\r\nas a second branch of the legislative assembly, distinct from, and\r\ndividing the power with, a first, must be in all cases a salutary check\r\non the government. It doubles the security to the people, by requiring\r\nthe concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or\r\nperfidy, where the ambition or corruption of one would otherwise be\r\nsufficient. This is a precaution founded on such clear principles, and\r\nnow so well understood in the United States, that it would be more than\r\nsuperfluous to enlarge on it. I will barely remark, that as the\r\nimprobability of sinister combinations will be in proportion to the\r\ndissimilarity in the genius of the two bodies, it must be politic to\r\ndistinguish them from each other by every circumstance which will\r\nconsist with a due harmony in all proper measures, and with the genuine\r\nprinciples of republican government.\r\n\r\nSecondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the\r\npropensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to the\r\nimpulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced by factious\r\nleaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions. Examples on this\r\nsubject might be cited without number; and from proceedings within the\r\nUnited States, as well as from the history of other nations. But a\r\nposition that will not be contradicted, need not be proved. All that\r\nneed be remarked is, that a body which is to correct this infirmity\r\nought itself to be free from it, and consequently ought to be less\r\nnumerous. It ought, moreover, to possess great firmness, and\r\nconsequently ought to hold its authority by a tenure of considerable\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nThirdly. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in a want of\r\ndue acquaintance with the objects and principles of legislation. It is\r\nnot possible that an assembly of men called for the most part from\r\npursuits of a private nature, continued in appointment for a short\r\ntime, and led by no permanent motive to devote the intervals of public\r\noccupation to a study of the laws, the affairs, and the comprehensive\r\ninterests of their country, should, if left wholly to themselves,\r\nescape a variety of important errors in the exercise of their\r\nlegislative trust. It may be affirmed, on the best grounds, that no\r\nsmall share of the present embarrassments of America is to be charged\r\non the blunders of our governments; and that these have proceeded from\r\nthe heads rather than the hearts of most of the authors of them. What\r\nindeed are all the repealing, explaining, and amending laws, which fill\r\nand disgrace our voluminous codes, but so many monuments of deficient\r\nwisdom; so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding against each\r\npreceding session; so many admonitions to the people, of the value of\r\nthose aids which may be expected from a well-constituted senate?\r\n\r\nA good government implies two things: first, fidelity to the object of\r\ngovernment, which is the happiness of the people; secondly, a knowledge\r\nof the means by which that object can be best attained. Some\r\ngovernments are deficient in both these qualities; most governments are\r\ndeficient in the first. I scruple not to assert, that in American\r\ngovernments too little attention has been paid to the last. The federal\r\nConstitution avoids this error; and what merits particular notice, it\r\nprovides for the last in a mode which increases the security for the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nFourthly. The mutability in the public councils arising from a rapid\r\nsuccession of new members, however qualified they may be, points out,\r\nin the strongest manner, the necessity of some stable institution in\r\nthe government. Every new election in the States is found to change one\r\nhalf of the representatives. From this change of men must proceed a\r\nchange of opinions; and from a change of opinions, a change of\r\nmeasures. But a continual change even of good measures is inconsistent\r\nwith every rule of prudence and every prospect of success. The remark\r\nis verified in private life, and becomes more just, as well as more\r\nimportant, in national transactions.\r\n\r\nTo trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would fill a\r\nvolume. I will hint a few only, each of which will be perceived to be a\r\nsource of innumerable others.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it forfeits the respect and confidence of other\r\nnations, and all the advantages connected with national character. An\r\nindividual who is observed to be inconstant to his plans, or perhaps to\r\ncarry on his affairs without any plan at all, is marked at once, by all\r\nprudent people, as a speedy victim to his own unsteadiness and folly.\r\nHis more friendly neighbors may pity him, but all will decline to\r\nconnect their fortunes with his; and not a few will seize the\r\nopportunity of making their fortunes out of his. One nation is to\r\nanother what one individual is to another; with this melancholy\r\ndistinction perhaps, that the former, with fewer of the benevolent\r\nemotions than the latter, are under fewer restraints also from taking\r\nundue advantage from the indiscretions of each other. Every nation,\r\nconsequently, whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability, may\r\ncalculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic\r\npolicy of their wiser neighbors. But the best instruction on this\r\nsubject is unhappily conveyed to America by the example of her own\r\nsituation. She finds that she is held in no respect by her friends;\r\nthat she is the derision of her enemies; and that she is a prey to\r\nevery nation which has an interest in speculating on her fluctuating\r\ncouncils and embarrassed affairs.\r\n\r\nThe internal effects of a mutable policy are still more calamitous. It\r\npoisons the blessing of liberty itself. It will be of little avail to\r\nthe people, that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if the\r\nlaws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that\r\nthey cannot be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they\r\nare promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who\r\nknows what the law is to-day, can guess what it will be to-morrow. Law\r\nis defined to be a rule of action; but how can that be a rule, which is\r\nlittle known, and less fixed?\r\n\r\nAnother effect of public instability is the unreasonable advantage it\r\ngives to the sagacious, the enterprising, and the moneyed few over the\r\nindustrious and uniformed mass of the people. Every new regulation\r\nconcerning commerce or revenue, or in any way affecting the value of\r\nthe different species of property, presents a new harvest to those who\r\nwatch the change, and can trace its consequences; a harvest, reared not\r\nby themselves, but by the toils and cares of the great body of their\r\nfellow-citizens. This is a state of things in which it may be said with\r\nsome truth that laws are made for the FEW, not for the MANY.\r\n\r\nIn another point of view, great injury results from an unstable\r\ngovernment. The want of confidence in the public councils damps every\r\nuseful undertaking, the success and profit of which may depend on a\r\ncontinuance of existing arrangements. What prudent merchant will hazard\r\nhis fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows not but that\r\nhis plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be executed? What\r\nfarmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the encouragement given\r\nto any particular cultivation or establishment, when he can have no\r\nassurance that his preparatory labors and advances will not render him\r\na victim to an inconstant government? In a word, no great improvement\r\nor laudable enterprise can go forward which requires the auspices of a\r\nsteady system of national policy.\r\n\r\nBut the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of attachment\r\nand reverence which steals into the hearts of the people, towards a\r\npolitical system which betrays so many marks of infirmity, and\r\ndisappoints so many of their flattering hopes. No government, any more\r\nthan an individual, will long be respected without being truly\r\nrespectable; nor be truly respectable, without possessing a certain\r\nportion of order and stability.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Continued\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nA fifth desideratum, illustrating the utility of a senate, is the want\r\nof a due sense of national character. Without a select and stable\r\nmember of the government, the esteem of foreign powers will not only be\r\nforfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy, proceeding from the\r\ncauses already mentioned, but the national councils will not possess\r\nthat sensibility to the opinion of the world, which is perhaps not less\r\nnecessary in order to merit, than it is to obtain, its respect and\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nAn attention to the judgment of other nations is important to every\r\ngovernment for two reasons: the one is, that, independently of the\r\nmerits of any particular plan or measure, it is desirable, on various\r\naccounts, that it should appear to other nations as the offspring of a\r\nwise and honorable policy; the second is, that in doubtful cases,\r\nparticularly where the national councils may be warped by some strong\r\npassion or momentary interest, the presumed or known opinion of the\r\nimpartial world may be the best guide that can be followed. What has\r\nnot America lost by her want of character with foreign nations; and how\r\nmany errors and follies would she not have avoided, if the justice and\r\npropriety of her measures had, in every instance, been previously tried\r\nby the light in which they would probably appear to the unbiased part\r\nof mankind?\r\n\r\nYet however requisite a sense of national character may be, it is\r\nevident that it can never be sufficiently possessed by a numerous and\r\nchangeable body. It can only be found in a number so small that a\r\nsensible degree of the praise and blame of public measures may be the\r\nportion of each individual; or in an assembly so durably invested with\r\npublic trust, that the pride and consequence of its members may be\r\nsensibly incorporated with the reputation and prosperity of the\r\ncommunity. The half-yearly representatives of Rhode Island would\r\nprobably have been little affected in their deliberations on the\r\niniquitous measures of that State, by arguments drawn from the light in\r\nwhich such measures would be viewed by foreign nations, or even by the\r\nsister States; whilst it can scarcely be doubted that if the\r\nconcurrence of a select and stable body had been necessary, a regard to\r\nnational character alone would have prevented the calamities under\r\nwhich that misguided people is now laboring.\r\n\r\nI add, as a SIXTH defect the want, in some important cases, of a due\r\nresponsibility in the government to the people, arising from that\r\nfrequency of elections which in other cases produces this\r\nresponsibility. This remark will, perhaps, appear not only new, but\r\nparadoxical. It must nevertheless be acknowledged, when explained, to\r\nbe as undeniable as it is important.\r\n\r\nResponsibility, in order to be reasonable, must be limited to objects\r\nwithin the power of the responsible party, and in order to be\r\neffectual, must relate to operations of that power, of which a ready\r\nand proper judgment can be formed by the constituents. The objects of\r\ngovernment may be divided into two general classes: the one depending\r\non measures which have singly an immediate and sensible operation; the\r\nother depending on a succession of well-chosen and well-connected\r\nmeasures, which have a gradual and perhaps unobserved operation. The\r\nimportance of the latter description to the collective and permanent\r\nwelfare of every country, needs no explanation. And yet it is evident\r\nthat an assembly elected for so short a term as to be unable to provide\r\nmore than one or two links in a chain of measures, on which the general\r\nwelfare may essentially depend, ought not to be answerable for the\r\nfinal result, any more than a steward or tenant, engaged for one year,\r\ncould be justly made to answer for places or improvements which could\r\nnot be accomplished in less than half a dozen years. Nor is it possible\r\nfor the people to estimate the SHARE of influence which their annual\r\nassemblies may respectively have on events resulting from the mixed\r\ntransactions of several years. It is sufficiently difficult to preserve\r\na personal responsibility in the members of a NUMEROUS body, for such\r\nacts of the body as have an immediate, detached, and palpable operation\r\non its constituents.\r\n\r\nThe proper remedy for this defect must be an additional body in the\r\nlegislative department, which, having sufficient permanency to provide\r\nfor such objects as require a continued attention, and a train of\r\nmeasures, may be justly and effectually answerable for the attainment\r\nof those objects.\r\n\r\nThus far I have considered the circumstances which point out the\r\nnecessity of a well-constructed Senate only as they relate to the\r\nrepresentatives of the people. To a people as little blinded by\r\nprejudice or corrupted by flattery as those whom I address, I shall not\r\nscruple to add, that such an institution may be sometimes necessary as\r\na defense to the people against their own temporary errors and\r\ndelusions. As the cool and deliberate sense of the community ought, in\r\nall governments, and actually will, in all free governments, ultimately\r\nprevail over the views of its rulers; so there are particular moments\r\nin public affairs when the people, stimulated by some irregular\r\npassion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful\r\nmisrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures which they\r\nthemselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn. In\r\nthese critical moments, how salutary will be the interference of some\r\ntemperate and respectable body of citizens, in order to check the\r\nmisguided career, and to suspend the blow meditated by the people\r\nagainst themselves, until reason, justice, and truth can regain their\r\nauthority over the public mind? What bitter anguish would not the\r\npeople of Athens have often escaped if their government had contained\r\nso provident a safeguard against the tyranny of their own passions?\r\nPopular liberty might then have escaped the indelible reproach of\r\ndecreeing to the same citizens the hemlock on one day and statues on\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested, that a people spread over an extensive region\r\ncannot, like the crowded inhabitants of a small district, be subject to\r\nthe infection of violent passions, or to the danger of combining in\r\npursuit of unjust measures. I am far from denying that this is a\r\ndistinction of peculiar importance. I have, on the contrary, endeavored\r\nin a former paper to show, that it is one of the principal\r\nrecommendations of a confederated republic. At the same time, this\r\nadvantage ought not to be considered as superseding the use of\r\nauxiliary precautions. It may even be remarked, that the same extended\r\nsituation, which will exempt the people of America from some of the\r\ndangers incident to lesser republics, will expose them to the\r\ninconveniency of remaining for a longer time under the influence of\r\nthose misrepresentations which the combined industry of interested men\r\nmay succeed in distributing among them.\r\n\r\nIt adds no small weight to all these considerations, to recollect that\r\nhistory informs us of no long-lived republic which had not a senate.\r\nSparta, Rome, and Carthage are, in fact, the only states to whom that\r\ncharacter can be applied. In each of the two first there was a senate\r\nfor life. The constitution of the senate in the last is less known.\r\nCircumstantial evidence makes it probable that it was not different in\r\nthis particular from the two others. It is at least certain, that it\r\nhad some quality or other which rendered it an anchor against popular\r\nfluctuations; and that a smaller council, drawn out of the senate, was\r\nappointed not only for life, but filled up vacancies itself. These\r\nexamples, though as unfit for the imitation, as they are repugnant to\r\nthe genius, of America, are, notwithstanding, when compared with the\r\nfugitive and turbulent existence of other ancient republics, very\r\ninstructive proofs of the necessity of some institution that will blend\r\nstability with liberty. I am not unaware of the circumstances which\r\ndistinguish the American from other popular governments, as well\r\nancient as modern; and which render extreme circumspection necessary,\r\nin reasoning from the one case to the other. But after allowing due\r\nweight to this consideration, it may still be maintained, that there\r\nare many points of similitude which render these examples not unworthy\r\nof our attention. Many of the defects, as we have seen, which can only\r\nbe supplied by a senatorial institution, are common to a numerous\r\nassembly frequently elected by the people, and to the people\r\nthemselves. There are others peculiar to the former, which require the\r\ncontrol of such an institution. The people can never wilfully betray\r\ntheir own interests; but they may possibly be betrayed by the\r\nrepresentatives of the people; and the danger will be evidently greater\r\nwhere the whole legislative trust is lodged in the hands of one body of\r\nmen, than where the concurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is\r\nrequired in every public act.\r\n\r\nThe difference most relied on, between the American and other\r\nrepublics, consists in the principle of representation; which is the\r\npivot on which the former move, and which is supposed to have been\r\nunknown to the latter, or at least to the ancient part of them. The use\r\nwhich has been made of this difference, in reasonings contained in\r\nformer papers, will have shown that I am disposed neither to deny its\r\nexistence nor to undervalue its importance. I feel the less restraint,\r\ntherefore, in observing, that the position concerning the ignorance of\r\nthe ancient governments on the subject of representation, is by no\r\nmeans precisely true in the latitude commonly given to it. Without\r\nentering into a disquisition which here would be misplaced, I will\r\nrefer to a few known facts, in support of what I advance.\r\n\r\nIn the most pure democracies of Greece, many of the executive functions\r\nwere performed, not by the people themselves, but by officers elected\r\nby the people, and REPRESENTING the people in their EXECUTIVE capacity.\r\n\r\nPrior to the reform of Solon, Athens was governed by nine Archons,\r\nannually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. The degree of power delegated\r\nto them seems to be left in great obscurity. Subsequent to that period,\r\nwe find an assembly, first of four, and afterwards of six hundred\r\nmembers, annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE; and PARTIALLY representing\r\nthem in their LEGISLATIVE capacity, since they were not only associated\r\nwith the people in the function of making laws, but had the exclusive\r\nright of originating legislative propositions to the people. The senate\r\nof Carthage, also, whatever might be its power, or the duration of its\r\nappointment, appears to have been ELECTIVE by the suffrages of the\r\npeople. Similar instances might be traced in most, if not all the\r\npopular governments of antiquity.\r\n\r\nLastly, in Sparta we meet with the Ephori, and in Rome with the\r\nTribunes; two bodies, small indeed in numbers, but annually ELECTED BY\r\nTHE WHOLE BODY OF THE PEOPLE, and considered as the REPRESENTATIVES of\r\nthe people, almost in their PLENIPOTENTIARY capacity. The Cosmi of\r\nCrete were also annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, and have been\r\nconsidered by some authors as an institution analogous to those of\r\nSparta and Rome, with this difference only, that in the election of\r\nthat representative body the right of suffrage was communicated to a\r\npart only of the people.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, to which many others might be added, it is clear that\r\nthe principle of representation was neither unknown to the ancients nor\r\nwholly overlooked in their political constitutions. The true\r\ndistinction between these and the American governments, lies IN THE\r\nTOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE PEOPLE, IN THEIR COLLECTIVE CAPACITY, from any\r\nshare in the LATTER, and not in the TOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE\r\nREPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE from the administration of the FORMER.\r\nThe distinction, however, thus qualified, must be admitted to leave a\r\nmost advantageous superiority in favor of the United States. But to\r\ninsure to this advantage its full effect, we must be careful not to\r\nseparate it from the other advantage, of an extensive territory. For it\r\ncannot be believed, that any form of representative government could\r\nhave succeeded within the narrow limits occupied by the democracies of\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nIn answer to all these arguments, suggested by reason, illustrated by\r\nexamples, and enforced by our own experience, the jealous adversary of\r\nthe Constitution will probably content himself with repeating, that a\r\nsenate appointed not immediately by the people, and for the term of six\r\nyears, must gradually acquire a dangerous pre-eminence in the\r\ngovernment, and finally transform it into a tyrannical aristocracy.\r\n\r\nTo this general answer, the general reply ought to be sufficient, that\r\nliberty may be endangered by the abuses of liberty as well as by the\r\nabuses of power; that there are numerous instances of the former as\r\nwell as of the latter; and that the former, rather than the latter, are\r\napparently most to be apprehended by the United States. But a more\r\nparticular reply may be given.\r\n\r\nBefore such a revolution can be effected, the Senate, it is to be\r\nobserved, must in the first place corrupt itself; must next corrupt the\r\nState legislatures; must then corrupt the House of Representatives; and\r\nmust finally corrupt the people at large. It is evident that the Senate\r\nmust be first corrupted before it can attempt an establishment of\r\ntyranny. Without corrupting the State legislatures, it cannot prosecute\r\nthe attempt, because the periodical change of members would otherwise\r\nregenerate the whole body. Without exerting the means of corruption\r\nwith equal success on the House of Representatives, the opposition of\r\nthat coequal branch of the government would inevitably defeat the\r\nattempt; and without corrupting the people themselves, a succession of\r\nnew representatives would speedily restore all things to their pristine\r\norder. Is there any man who can seriously persuade himself that the\r\nproposed Senate can, by any possible means within the compass of human\r\naddress, arrive at the object of a lawless ambition, through all these\r\nobstructions?\r\n\r\nIf reason condemns the suspicion, the same sentence is pronounced by\r\nexperience. The constitution of Maryland furnishes the most apposite\r\nexample. The Senate of that State is elected, as the federal Senate\r\nwill be, indirectly by the people, and for a term less by one year only\r\nthan the federal Senate. It is distinguished, also, by the remarkable\r\nprerogative of filling up its own vacancies within the term of its\r\nappointment, and, at the same time, is not under the control of any\r\nsuch rotation as is provided for the federal Senate. There are some\r\nother lesser distinctions, which would expose the former to colorable\r\nobjections, that do not lie against the latter. If the federal Senate,\r\ntherefore, really contained the danger which has been so loudly\r\nproclaimed, some symptoms at least of a like danger ought by this time\r\nto have been betrayed by the Senate of Maryland, but no such symptoms\r\nhave appeared. On the contrary, the jealousies at first entertained by\r\nmen of the same description with those who view with terror the\r\ncorrespondent part of the federal Constitution, have been gradually\r\nextinguished by the progress of the experiment; and the Maryland\r\nconstitution is daily deriving, from the salutary operation of this\r\npart of it, a reputation in which it will probably not be rivalled by\r\nthat of any State in the Union.\r\n\r\nBut if any thing could silence the jealousies on this subject, it ought\r\nto be the British example. The Senate there instead of being elected\r\nfor a term of six years, and of being unconfined to particular families\r\nor fortunes, is an hereditary assembly of opulent nobles. The House of\r\nRepresentatives, instead of being elected for two years, and by the\r\nwhole body of the people, is elected for seven years, and, in very\r\ngreat proportion, by a very small proportion of the people. Here,\r\nunquestionably, ought to be seen in full display the aristocratic\r\nusurpations and tyranny which are at some future period to be\r\nexemplified in the United States. Unfortunately, however, for the\r\nanti-federal argument, the British history informs us that this\r\nhereditary assembly has not been able to defend itself against the\r\ncontinual encroachments of the House of Representatives; and that it no\r\nsooner lost the support of the monarch, than it was actually crushed by\r\nthe weight of the popular branch.\r\n\r\nAs far as antiquity can instruct us on this subject, its examples\r\nsupport the reasoning which we have employed. In Sparta, the Ephori,\r\nthe annual representatives of the people, were found an overmatch for\r\nthe senate for life, continually gained on its authority and finally\r\ndrew all power into their own hands. The Tribunes of Rome, who were the\r\nrepresentatives of the people, prevailed, it is well known, in almost\r\nevery contest with the senate for life, and in the end gained the most\r\ncomplete triumph over it. The fact is the more remarkable, as unanimity\r\nwas required in every act of the Tribunes, even after their number was\r\naugmented to ten. It proves the irresistible force possessed by that\r\nbranch of a free government, which has the people on its side. To these\r\nexamples might be added that of Carthage, whose senate, according to\r\nthe testimony of Polybius, instead of drawing all power into its\r\nvortex, had, at the commencement of the second Punic War, lost almost\r\nthe whole of its original portion.\r\n\r\nBesides the conclusive evidence resulting from this assemblage of\r\nfacts, that the federal Senate will never be able to transform itself,\r\nby gradual usurpations, into an independent and aristocratic body, we\r\nare warranted in believing, that if such a revolution should ever\r\nhappen from causes which the foresight of man cannot guard against, the\r\nHouse of Representatives, with the people on their side, will at all\r\ntimes be able to bring back the Constitution to its primitive form and\r\nprinciples. Against the force of the immediate representatives of the\r\npeople, nothing will be able to maintain even the constitutional\r\nauthority of the Senate, but such a display of enlightened policy, and\r\nattachment to the public good, as will divide with that branch of the\r\nlegislature the affections and support of the entire body of the people\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Powers of the Senate\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, March 7, 1788.\r\n\r\nJAY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIt is a just and not a new observation, that enemies to particular\r\npersons, and opponents to particular measures, seldom confine their\r\ncensures to such things only in either as are worthy of blame. Unless\r\non this principle, it is difficult to explain the motives of their\r\nconduct, who condemn the proposed Constitution in the aggregate, and\r\ntreat with severity some of the most unexceptionable articles in it.\r\n\r\nThe second section gives power to the President, “BY AND WITH THE\r\nADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE, TO MAKE TREATIES, PROVIDED TWO THIRDS\r\nOF THE SENATORS PRESENT CONCUR.”\r\n\r\nThe power of making treaties is an important one, especially as it\r\nrelates to war, peace, and commerce; and it should not be delegated but\r\nin such a mode, and with such precautions, as will afford the highest\r\nsecurity that it will be exercised by men the best qualified for the\r\npurpose, and in the manner most conducive to the public good. The\r\nconvention appears to have been attentive to both these points: they\r\nhave directed the President to be chosen by select bodies of electors,\r\nto be deputed by the people for that express purpose; and they have\r\ncommitted the appointment of senators to the State legislatures. This\r\nmode has, in such cases, vastly the advantage of elections by the\r\npeople in their collective capacity, where the activity of party zeal,\r\ntaking the advantage of the supineness, the ignorance, and the hopes\r\nand fears of the unwary and interested, often places men in office by\r\nthe votes of a small proportion of the electors.\r\n\r\nAs the select assemblies for choosing the President, as well as the\r\nState legislatures who appoint the senators, will in general be\r\ncomposed of the most enlightened and respectable citizens, there is\r\nreason to presume that their attention and their votes will be directed\r\nto those men only who have become the most distinguished by their\r\nabilities and virtue, and in whom the people perceive just grounds for\r\nconfidence. The Constitution manifests very particular attention to\r\nthis object. By excluding men under thirty-five from the first office,\r\nand those under thirty from the second, it confines the electors to men\r\nof whom the people have had time to form a judgment, and with respect\r\nto whom they will not be liable to be deceived by those brilliant\r\nappearances of genius and patriotism, which, like transient meteors,\r\nsometimes mislead as well as dazzle. If the observation be well\r\nfounded, that wise kings will always be served by able ministers, it is\r\nfair to argue, that as an assembly of select electors possess, in a\r\ngreater degree than kings, the means of extensive and accurate\r\ninformation relative to men and characters, so will their appointments\r\nbear at least equal marks of discretion and discernment. The inference\r\nwhich naturally results from these considerations is this, that the\r\nPresident and senators so chosen will always be of the number of those\r\nwho best understand our national interests, whether considered in\r\nrelation to the several States or to foreign nations, who are best able\r\nto promote those interests, and whose reputation for integrity inspires\r\nand merits confidence. With such men the power of making treaties may\r\nbe safely lodged.\r\n\r\nAlthough the absolute necessity of system, in the conduct of any\r\nbusiness, is universally known and acknowledged, yet the high\r\nimportance of it in national affairs has not yet become sufficiently\r\nimpressed on the public mind. They who wish to commit the power under\r\nconsideration to a popular assembly, composed of members constantly\r\ncoming and going in quick succession, seem not to recollect that such a\r\nbody must necessarily be inadequate to the attainment of those great\r\nobjects, which require to be steadily contemplated in all their\r\nrelations and circumstances, and which can only be approached and\r\nachieved by measures which not only talents, but also exact\r\ninformation, and often much time, are necessary to concert and to\r\nexecute. It was wise, therefore, in the convention to provide, not only\r\nthat the power of making treaties should be committed to able and\r\nhonest men, but also that they should continue in place a sufficient\r\ntime to become perfectly acquainted with our national concerns, and to\r\nform and introduce a a system for the management of them. The duration\r\nprescribed is such as will give them an opportunity of greatly\r\nextending their political information, and of rendering their\r\naccumulating experience more and more beneficial to their country. Nor\r\nhas the convention discovered less prudence in providing for the\r\nfrequent elections of senators in such a way as to obviate the\r\ninconvenience of periodically transferring those great affairs entirely\r\nto new men; for by leaving a considerable residue of the old ones in\r\nplace, uniformity and order, as well as a constant succession of\r\nofficial information will be preserved.\r\n\r\nThere are a few who will not admit that the affairs of trade and\r\nnavigation should be regulated by a system cautiously formed and\r\nsteadily pursued; and that both our treaties and our laws should\r\ncorrespond with and be made to promote it. It is of much consequence\r\nthat this correspondence and conformity be carefully maintained; and\r\nthey who assent to the truth of this position will see and confess that\r\nit is well provided for by making concurrence of the Senate necessary\r\nboth to treaties and to laws.\r\n\r\nIt seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature,\r\nbut that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes\r\nrequisite. These are cases where the most useful intelligence may be\r\nobtained, if the persons possessing it can be relieved from\r\napprehensions of discovery. Those apprehensions will operate on those\r\npersons whether they are actuated by mercenary or friendly motives; and\r\nthere doubtless are many of both descriptions, who would rely on the\r\nsecrecy of the President, but who would not confide in that of the\r\nSenate, and still less in that of a large popular Assembly. The\r\nconvention have done well, therefore, in so disposing of the power of\r\nmaking treaties, that although the President must, in forming them, act\r\nby the advice and consent of the Senate, yet he will be able to manage\r\nthe business of intelligence in such a manner as prudence may suggest.\r\n\r\nThey who have turned their attention to the affairs of men, must have\r\nperceived that there are tides in them; tides very irregular in their\r\nduration, strength, and direction, and seldom found to run twice\r\nexactly in the same manner or measure. To discern and to profit by\r\nthese tides in national affairs is the business of those who preside\r\nover them; and they who have had much experience on this head inform\r\nus, that there frequently are occasions when days, nay, even when\r\nhours, are precious. The loss of a battle, the death of a prince, the\r\nremoval of a minister, or other circumstances intervening to change the\r\npresent posture and aspect of affairs, may turn the most favorable tide\r\ninto a course opposite to our wishes. As in the field, so in the\r\ncabinet, there are moments to be seized as they pass, and they who\r\npreside in either should be left in capacity to improve them. So often\r\nand so essentially have we heretofore suffered from the want of secrecy\r\nand despatch, that the Constitution would have been inexcusably\r\ndefective, if no attention had been paid to those objects. Those\r\nmatters which in negotiations usually require the most secrecy and the\r\nmost despatch, are those preparatory and auxiliary measures which are\r\nnot otherwise important in a national view, than as they tend to\r\nfacilitate the attainment of the objects of the negotiation. For these,\r\nthe President will find no difficulty to provide; and should any\r\ncircumstance occur which requires the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\nhe may at any time convene them. Thus we see that the Constitution\r\nprovides that our negotiations for treaties shall have every advantage\r\nwhich can be derived from talents, information, integrity, and\r\ndeliberate investigations, on the one hand, and from secrecy and\r\ndespatch on the other.\r\n\r\nBut to this plan, as to most others that have ever appeared, objections\r\nare contrived and urged.\r\n\r\nSome are displeased with it, not on account of any errors or defects in\r\nit, but because, as the treaties, when made, are to have the force of\r\nlaws, they should be made only by men invested with legislative\r\nauthority. These gentlemen seem not to consider that the judgments of\r\nour courts, and the commissions constitutionally given by our governor,\r\nare as valid and as binding on all persons whom they concern, as the\r\nlaws passed by our legislature. All constitutional acts of power,\r\nwhether in the executive or in the judicial department, have as much\r\nlegal validity and obligation as if they proceeded from the\r\nlegislature; and therefore, whatever name be given to the power of\r\nmaking treaties, or however obligatory they may be when made, certain\r\nit is, that the people may, with much propriety, commit the power to a\r\ndistinct body from the legislature, the executive, or the judicial. It\r\nsurely does not follow, that because they have given the power of\r\nmaking laws to the legislature, that therefore they should likewise\r\ngive them the power to do every other act of sovereignty by which the\r\ncitizens are to be bound and affected.\r\n\r\nOthers, though content that treaties should be made in the mode\r\nproposed, are averse to their being the SUPREME laws of the land. They\r\ninsist, and profess to believe, that treaties like acts of assembly,\r\nshould be repealable at pleasure. This idea seems to be new and\r\npeculiar to this country, but new errors, as well as new truths, often\r\nappear. These gentlemen would do well to reflect that a treaty is only\r\nanother name for a bargain, and that it would be impossible to find a\r\nnation who would make any bargain with us, which should be binding on\r\nthem ABSOLUTELY, but on us only so long and so far as we may think\r\nproper to be bound by it. They who make laws may, without doubt, amend\r\nor repeal them; and it will not be disputed that they who make treaties\r\nmay alter or cancel them; but still let us not forget that treaties are\r\nmade, not by only one of the contracting parties, but by both; and\r\nconsequently, that as the consent of both was essential to their\r\nformation at first, so must it ever afterwards be to alter or cancel\r\nthem. The proposed Constitution, therefore, has not in the least\r\nextended the obligation of treaties. They are just as binding, and just\r\nas far beyond the lawful reach of legislative acts now, as they will be\r\nat any future period, or under any form of government.\r\n\r\nHowever useful jealousy may be in republics, yet when like bile in the\r\nnatural, it abounds too much in the body politic, the eyes of both\r\nbecome very liable to be deceived by the delusive appearances which\r\nthat malady casts on surrounding objects. From this cause, probably,\r\nproceed the fears and apprehensions of some, that the President and\r\nSenate may make treaties without an equal eye to the interests of all\r\nthe States. Others suspect that two thirds will oppress the remaining\r\nthird, and ask whether those gentlemen are made sufficiently\r\nresponsible for their conduct; whether, if they act corruptly, they can\r\nbe punished; and if they make disadvantageous treaties, how are we to\r\nget rid of those treaties?\r\n\r\nAs all the States are equally represented in the Senate, and by men the\r\nmost able and the most willing to promote the interests of their\r\nconstituents, they will all have an equal degree of influence in that\r\nbody, especially while they continue to be careful in appointing proper\r\npersons, and to insist on their punctual attendance. In proportion as\r\nthe United States assume a national form and a national character, so\r\nwill the good of the whole be more and more an object of attention, and\r\nthe government must be a weak one indeed, if it should forget that the\r\ngood of the whole can only be promoted by advancing the good of each of\r\nthe parts or members which compose the whole. It will not be in the\r\npower of the President and Senate to make any treaties by which they\r\nand their families and estates will not be equally bound and affected\r\nwith the rest of the community; and, having no private interests\r\ndistinct from that of the nation, they will be under no temptations to\r\nneglect the latter.\r\n\r\nAs to corruption, the case is not supposable. He must either have been\r\nvery unfortunate in his intercourse with the world, or possess a heart\r\nvery susceptible of such impressions, who can think it probable that\r\nthe President and two thirds of the Senate will ever be capable of such\r\nunworthy conduct. The idea is too gross and too invidious to be\r\nentertained. But in such a case, if it should ever happen, the treaty\r\nso obtained from us would, like all other fraudulent contracts, be null\r\nand void by the law of nations.\r\n\r\nWith respect to their responsibility, it is difficult to conceive how\r\nit could be increased. Every consideration that can influence the human\r\nmind, such as honor, oaths, reputations, conscience, the love of\r\ncountry, and family affections and attachments, afford security for\r\ntheir fidelity. In short, as the Constitution has taken the utmost care\r\nthat they shall be men of talents and integrity, we have reason to be\r\npersuaded that the treaties they make will be as advantageous as, all\r\ncircumstances considered, could be made; and so far as the fear of\r\npunishment and disgrace can operate, that motive to good behavior is\r\namply afforded by the article on the subject of impeachments.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXV.\r\n\r\nThe Powers of the Senate Continued\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, March 7, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe remaining powers which the plan of the convention allots to the\r\nSenate, in a distinct capacity, are comprised in their participation\r\nwith the executive in the appointment to offices, and in their judicial\r\ncharacter as a court for the trial of impeachments. As in the business\r\nof appointments the executive will be the principal agent, the\r\nprovisions relating to it will most properly be discussed in the\r\nexamination of that department. We will, therefore, conclude this head\r\nwith a view of the judicial character of the Senate.\r\n\r\nA well-constituted court for the trial of impeachments is an object not\r\nmore to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a government wholly\r\nelective. The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which\r\nproceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the\r\nabuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may\r\nwith peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate\r\nchiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself. The\r\nprosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the\r\npassions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or\r\nless friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect\r\nitself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their\r\nanimosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on\r\nthe other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger\r\nthat the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of\r\nparties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.\r\n\r\nThe delicacy and magnitude of a trust which so deeply concerns the\r\npolitical reputation and existence of every man engaged in the\r\nadministration of public affairs, speak for themselves. The difficulty\r\nof placing it rightly, in a government resting entirely on the basis of\r\nperiodical elections, will as readily be perceived, when it is\r\nconsidered that the most conspicuous characters in it will, from that\r\ncircumstance, be too often the leaders or the tools of the most cunning\r\nor the most numerous faction, and on this account, can hardly be\r\nexpected to possess the requisite neutrality towards those whose\r\nconduct may be the subject of scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThe convention, it appears, thought the Senate the most fit depositary\r\nof this important trust. Those who can best discern the intrinsic\r\ndifficulty of the thing, will be least hasty in condemning that\r\nopinion, and will be most inclined to allow due weight to the arguments\r\nwhich may be supposed to have produced it.\r\n\r\nWhat, it may be asked, is the true spirit of the institution itself? Is\r\nit not designed as a method of NATIONAL INQUEST into the conduct of\r\npublic men? If this be the design of it, who can so properly be the\r\ninquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation\r\nthemselves? It is not disputed that the power of originating the\r\ninquiry, or, in other words, of preferring the impeachment, ought to be\r\nlodged in the hands of one branch of the legislative body. Will not the\r\nreasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement strongly plead\r\nfor an admission of the other branch of that body to a share of the\r\ninquiry? The model from which the idea of this institution has been\r\nborrowed, pointed out that course to the convention. In Great Britain\r\nit is the province of the House of Commons to prefer the impeachment,\r\nand of the House of Lords to decide upon it. Several of the State\r\nconstitutions have followed the example. As well the latter, as the\r\nformer, seem to have regarded the practice of impeachments as a bridle\r\nin the hands of the legislative body upon the executive servants of the\r\ngovernment. Is not this the true light in which it ought to be\r\nregarded?\r\n\r\nWhere else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal\r\nsufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? What other body\r\nwould be likely to feel CONFIDENCE ENOUGH IN ITS OWN SITUATION, to\r\npreserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality between\r\nan INDIVIDUAL accused, and the REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE, HIS\r\nACCUSERS?\r\n\r\nCould the Supreme Court have been relied upon as answering this\r\ndescription? It is much to be doubted, whether the members of that\r\ntribunal would at all times be endowed with so eminent a portion of\r\nfortitude, as would be called for in the execution of so difficult a\r\ntask; and it is still more to be doubted, whether they would possess\r\nthe degree of credit and authority, which might, on certain occasions,\r\nbe indispensable towards reconciling the people to a decision that\r\nshould happen to clash with an accusation brought by their immediate\r\nrepresentatives. A deficiency in the first, would be fatal to the\r\naccused; in the last, dangerous to the public tranquillity. The hazard\r\nin both these respects, could only be avoided, if at all, by rendering\r\nthat tribunal more numerous than would consist with a reasonable\r\nattention to economy. The necessity of a numerous court for the trial\r\nof impeachments, is equally dictated by the nature of the proceeding.\r\nThis can never be tied down by such strict rules, either in the\r\ndelineation of the offense by the prosecutors, or in the construction\r\nof it by the judges, as in common cases serve to limit the discretion\r\nof courts in favor of personal security. There will be no jury to stand\r\nbetween the judges who are to pronounce the sentence of the law, and\r\nthe party who is to receive or suffer it. The awful discretion which a\r\ncourt of impeachments must necessarily have, to doom to honor or to\r\ninfamy the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of\r\nthe community, forbids the commitment of the trust to a small number of\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nThese considerations seem alone sufficient to authorize a conclusion,\r\nthat the Supreme Court would have been an improper substitute for the\r\nSenate, as a court of impeachments. There remains a further\r\nconsideration, which will not a little strengthen this conclusion. It\r\nis this: The punishment which may be the consequence of conviction upon\r\nimpeachment, is not to terminate the chastisement of the offender.\r\nAfter having been sentenced to a perpetual ostracism from the esteem\r\nand confidence, and honors and emoluments of his country, he will still\r\nbe liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.\r\nWould it be proper that the persons who had disposed of his fame, and\r\nhis most valuable rights as a citizen in one trial, should, in another\r\ntrial, for the same offense, be also the disposers of his life and his\r\nfortune? Would there not be the greatest reason to apprehend, that\r\nerror, in the first sentence, would be the parent of error in the\r\nsecond sentence? That the strong bias of one decision would be apt to\r\noverrule the influence of any new lights which might be brought to vary\r\nthe complexion of another decision? Those who know anything of human\r\nnature, will not hesitate to answer these questions in the affirmative;\r\nand will be at no loss to perceive, that by making the same persons\r\njudges in both cases, those who might happen to be the objects of\r\nprosecution would, in a great measure, be deprived of the double\r\nsecurity intended them by a double trial. The loss of life and estate\r\nwould often be virtually included in a sentence which, in its terms,\r\nimported nothing more than dismission from a present, and\r\ndisqualification for a future, office. It may be said, that the\r\nintervention of a jury, in the second instance, would obviate the\r\ndanger. But juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of judges.\r\nThey are sometimes induced to find special verdicts, which refer the\r\nmain question to the decision of the court. Who would be willing to\r\nstake his life and his estate upon the verdict of a jury acting under\r\nthe auspices of judges who had predetermined his guilt?\r\n\r\nWould it have been an improvement of the plan, to have united the\r\nSupreme Court with the Senate, in the formation of the court of\r\nimpeachments? This union would certainly have been attended with\r\nseveral advantages; but would they not have been overbalanced by the\r\nsignal disadvantage, already stated, arising from the agency of the\r\nsame judges in the double prosecution to which the offender would be\r\nliable? To a certain extent, the benefits of that union will be\r\nobtained from making the chief justice of the Supreme Court the\r\npresident of the court of impeachments, as is proposed to be done in\r\nthe plan of the convention; while the inconveniences of an entire\r\nincorporation of the former into the latter will be substantially\r\navoided. This was perhaps the prudent mean. I forbear to remark upon\r\nthe additional pretext for clamor against the judiciary, which so\r\nconsiderable an augmentation of its authority would have afforded.\r\n\r\nWould it have been desirable to have composed the court for the trial\r\nof impeachments, of persons wholly distinct from the other departments\r\nof the government? There are weighty arguments, as well against, as in\r\nfavor of, such a plan. To some minds it will not appear a trivial\r\nobjection, that it could tend to increase the complexity of the\r\npolitical machine, and to add a new spring to the government, the\r\nutility of which would at best be questionable. But an objection which\r\nwill not be thought by any unworthy of attention, is this: a court\r\nformed upon such a plan, would either be attended with a heavy expense,\r\nor might in practice be subject to a variety of casualties and\r\ninconveniences. It must either consist of permanent officers,\r\nstationary at the seat of government, and of course entitled to fixed\r\nand regular stipends, or of certain officers of the State governments\r\nto be called upon whenever an impeachment was actually depending. It\r\nwill not be easy to imagine any third mode materially different, which\r\ncould rationally be proposed. As the court, for reasons already given,\r\nought to be numerous, the first scheme will be reprobated by every man\r\nwho can compare the extent of the public wants with the means of\r\nsupplying them. The second will be espoused with caution by those who\r\nwill seriously consider the difficulty of collecting men dispersed over\r\nthe whole Union; the injury to the innocent, from the procrastinated\r\ndetermination of the charges which might be brought against them; the\r\nadvantage to the guilty, from the opportunities which delay would\r\nafford to intrigue and corruption; and in some cases the detriment to\r\nthe State, from the prolonged inaction of men whose firm and faithful\r\nexecution of their duty might have exposed them to the persecution of\r\nan intemperate or designing majority in the House of Representatives.\r\nThough this latter supposition may seem harsh, and might not be likely\r\noften to be verified, yet it ought not to be forgotten that the demon\r\nof faction will, at certain seasons, extend his sceptre over all\r\nnumerous bodies of men.\r\n\r\nBut though one or the other of the substitutes which have been\r\nexamined, or some other that might be devised, should be thought\r\npreferable to the plan in this respect, reported by the convention, it\r\nwill not follow that the Constitution ought for this reason to be\r\nrejected. If mankind were to resolve to agree in no institution of\r\ngovernment, until every part of it had been adjusted to the most exact\r\nstandard of perfection, society would soon become a general scene of\r\nanarchy, and the world a desert. Where is the standard of perfection to\r\nbe found? Who will undertake to unite the discordant opinions of a\r\nwhole community, in the same judgment of it; and to prevail upon one\r\nconceited projector to renounce his INFALLIBLE criterion for the\r\nFALLIBLE criterion of his more CONCEITED NEIGHBOR? To answer the\r\npurpose of the adversaries of the Constitution, they ought to prove,\r\nnot merely that particular provisions in it are not the best which\r\nmight have been imagined, but that the plan upon the whole is bad and\r\npernicious.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXVI.\r\n\r\nObjections to the Power of the Senate To Set as a Court for\r\nImpeachments Further Considered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 11, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nA review of the principal objections that have appeared against the\r\nproposed court for the trial of impeachments, will not improbably\r\neradicate the remains of any unfavorable impressions which may still\r\nexist in regard to this matter.\r\n\r\nThe FIRST of these objections is, that the provision in question\r\nconfounds legislative and judiciary authorities in the same body, in\r\nviolation of that important and wellestablished maxim which requires a\r\nseparation between the different departments of power. The true meaning\r\nof this maxim has been discussed and ascertained in another place, and\r\nhas been shown to be entirely compatible with a partial intermixture of\r\nthose departments for special purposes, preserving them, in the main,\r\ndistinct and unconnected. This partial intermixture is even, in some\r\ncases, not only proper but necessary to the mutual defense of the\r\nseveral members of the government against each other. An absolute or\r\nqualified negative in the executive upon the acts of the legislative\r\nbody, is admitted, by the ablest adepts in political science, to be an\r\nindispensable barrier against the encroachments of the latter upon the\r\nformer. And it may, perhaps, with no less reason be contended, that the\r\npowers relating to impeachments are, as before intimated, an essential\r\ncheck in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the\r\nexecutive. The division of them between the two branches of the\r\nlegislature, assigning to one the right of accusing, to the other the\r\nright of judging, avoids the inconvenience of making the same persons\r\nboth accusers and judges; and guards against the danger of persecution,\r\nfrom the prevalency of a factious spirit in either of those branches.\r\nAs the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate will be requisite to a\r\ncondemnation, the security to innocence, from this additional\r\ncircumstance, will be as complete as itself can desire.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe, with what vehemence this part of the plan is\r\nassailed, on the principle here taken notice of, by men who profess to\r\nadmire, without exception, the constitution of this State; while that\r\nconstitution makes the Senate, together with the chancellor and judges\r\nof the Supreme Court, not only a court of impeachments, but the highest\r\njudicatory in the State, in all causes, civil and criminal. The\r\nproportion, in point of numbers, of the chancellor and judges to the\r\nsenators, is so inconsiderable, that the judiciary authority of New\r\nYork, in the last resort, may, with truth, be said to reside in its\r\nSenate. If the plan of the convention be, in this respect, chargeable\r\nwith a departure from the celebrated maxim which has been so often\r\nmentioned, and seems to be so little understood, how much more culpable\r\nmust be the constitution of New York?[1]\r\n\r\nA SECOND objection to the Senate, as a court of impeachments, is, that\r\nit contributes to an undue accumulation of power in that body, tending\r\nto give to the government a countenance too aristocratic. The Senate,\r\nit is observed, is to have concurrent authority with the Executive in\r\nthe formation of treaties and in the appointment to offices: if, say\r\nthe objectors, to these prerogatives is added that of deciding in all\r\ncases of impeachment, it will give a decided predominancy to senatorial\r\ninfluence. To an objection so little precise in itself, it is not easy\r\nto find a very precise answer. Where is the measure or criterion to\r\nwhich we can appeal, for determining what will give the Senate too\r\nmuch, too little, or barely the proper degree of influence? Will it not\r\nbe more safe, as well as more simple, to dismiss such vague and\r\nuncertain calculations, to examine each power by itself, and to decide,\r\non general principles, where it may be deposited with most advantage\r\nand least inconvenience?\r\n\r\nIf we take this course, it will lead to a more intelligible, if not to\r\na more certain result. The disposition of the power of making treaties,\r\nwhich has obtained in the plan of the convention, will, then, if I\r\nmistake not, appear to be fully justified by the considerations stated\r\nin a former number, and by others which will occur under the next head\r\nof our inquiries. The expediency of the junction of the Senate with the\r\nExecutive, in the power of appointing to offices, will, I trust, be\r\nplaced in a light not less satisfactory, in the disquisitions under the\r\nsame head. And I flatter myself the observations in my last paper must\r\nhave gone no inconsiderable way towards proving that it was not easy,\r\nif practicable, to find a more fit receptacle for the power of\r\ndetermining impeachments, than that which has been chosen. If this be\r\ntruly the case, the hypothetical dread of the too great weight of the\r\nSenate ought to be discarded from our reasonings.\r\n\r\nBut this hypothesis, such as it is, has already been refuted in the\r\nremarks applied to the duration in office prescribed for the senators.\r\nIt was by them shown, as well on the credit of historical examples, as\r\nfrom the reason of the thing, that the most POPULAR branch of every\r\ngovernment, partaking of the republican genius, by being generally the\r\nfavorite of the people, will be as generally a full match, if not an\r\novermatch, for every other member of the Government.\r\n\r\nBut independent of this most active and operative principle, to secure\r\nthe equilibrium of the national House of Representatives, the plan of\r\nthe convention has provided in its favor several important\r\ncounterpoises to the additional authorities to be conferred upon the\r\nSenate. The exclusive privilege of originating money bills will belong\r\nto the House of Representatives. The same house will possess the sole\r\nright of instituting impeachments: is not this a complete\r\ncounterbalance to that of determining them? The same house will be the\r\numpire in all elections of the President, which do not unite the\r\nsuffrages of a majority of the whole number of electors; a case which\r\nit cannot be doubted will sometimes, if not frequently, happen. The\r\nconstant possibility of the thing must be a fruitful source of\r\ninfluence to that body. The more it is contemplated, the more important\r\nwill appear this ultimate though contingent power, of deciding the\r\ncompetitions of the most illustrious citizens of the Union, for the\r\nfirst office in it. It would not perhaps be rash to predict, that as a\r\nmean of influence it will be found to outweigh all the peculiar\r\nattributes of the Senate.\r\n\r\nA THIRD objection to the Senate as a court of impeachments, is drawn\r\nfrom the agency they are to have in the appointments to office. It is\r\nimagined that they would be too indulgent judges of the conduct of men,\r\nin whose official creation they had participated. The principle of this\r\nobjection would condemn a practice, which is to be seen in all the\r\nState governments, if not in all the governments with which we are\r\nacquainted: I mean that of rendering those who hold offices during\r\npleasure, dependent on the pleasure of those who appoint them. With\r\nequal plausibility might it be alleged in this case, that the\r\nfavoritism of the latter would always be an asylum for the misbehavior\r\nof the former. But that practice, in contradiction to this principle,\r\nproceeds upon the presumption, that the responsibility of those who\r\nappoint, for the fitness and competency of the persons on whom they\r\nbestow their choice, and the interest they will have in the respectable\r\nand prosperous administration of affairs, will inspire a sufficient\r\ndisposition to dismiss from a share in it all such who, by their\r\nconduct, shall have proved themselves unworthy of the confidence\r\nreposed in them. Though facts may not always correspond with this\r\npresumption, yet if it be, in the main, just, it must destroy the\r\nsupposition that the Senate, who will merely sanction the choice of the\r\nExecutive, should feel a bias, towards the objects of that choice,\r\nstrong enough to blind them to the evidences of guilt so extraordinary,\r\nas to have induced the representatives of the nation to become its\r\naccusers.\r\n\r\nIf any further arguments were necessary to evince the improbability of\r\nsuch a bias, it might be found in the nature of the agency of the\r\nSenate in the business of appointments.\r\n\r\nIt will be the office of the President to NOMINATE, and, with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate, to APPOINT. There will, of course, be\r\nno exertion of CHOICE on the part of the Senate. They may defeat one\r\nchoice of the Executive, and oblige him to make another; but they\r\ncannot themselves CHOOSE, they can only ratify or reject the choice of\r\nthe President. They might even entertain a preference to some other\r\nperson, at the very moment they were assenting to the one proposed,\r\nbecause there might be no positive ground of opposition to him; and\r\nthey could not be sure, if they withheld their assent, that the\r\nsubsequent nomination would fall upon their own favorite, or upon any\r\nother person in their estimation more meritorious than the one\r\nrejected. Thus it could hardly happen, that the majority of the Senate\r\nwould feel any other complacency towards the object of an appointment\r\nthan such as the appearances of merit might inspire, and the proofs of\r\nthe want of it destroy.\r\n\r\nA FOURTH objection to the Senate in the capacity of a court of\r\nimpeachments, is derived from its union with the Executive in the power\r\nof making treaties. This, it has been said, would constitute the\r\nsenators their own judges, in every case of a corrupt or perfidious\r\nexecution of that trust. After having combined with the Executive in\r\nbetraying the interests of the nation in a ruinous treaty, what\r\nprospect, it is asked, would there be of their being made to suffer the\r\npunishment they would deserve, when they were themselves to decide upon\r\nthe accusation brought against them for the treachery of which they\r\nhave been guilty?\r\n\r\nThis objection has been circulated with more earnestness and with\r\ngreater show of reason than any other which has appeared against this\r\npart of the plan; and yet I am deceived if it does not rest upon an\r\nerroneous foundation.\r\n\r\nThe security essentially intended by the Constitution against\r\ncorruption and treachery in the formation of treaties, is to be sought\r\nfor in the numbers and characters of those who are to make them. The\r\nJOINT AGENCY of the Chief Magistrate of the Union, and of two thirds of\r\nthe members of a body selected by the collective wisdom of the\r\nlegislatures of the several States, is designed to be the pledge for\r\nthe fidelity of the national councils in this particular. The\r\nconvention might with propriety have meditated the punishment of the\r\nExecutive, for a deviation from the instructions of the Senate, or a\r\nwant of integrity in the conduct of the negotiations committed to him;\r\nthey might also have had in view the punishment of a few leading\r\nindividuals in the Senate, who should have prostituted their influence\r\nin that body as the mercenary instruments of foreign corruption: but\r\nthey could not, with more or with equal propriety, have contemplated\r\nthe impeachment and punishment of two thirds of the Senate, consenting\r\nto an improper treaty, than of a majority of that or of the other\r\nbranch of the national legislature, consenting to a pernicious or\r\nunconstitutional law, a principle which, I believe, has never been\r\nadmitted into any government. How, in fact, could a majority in the\r\nHouse of Representatives impeach themselves? Not better, it is evident,\r\nthan two thirds of the Senate might try themselves. And yet what reason\r\nis there, that a majority of the House of Representatives, sacrificing\r\nthe interests of the society by an unjust and tyrannical act of\r\nlegislation, should escape with impunity, more than two thirds of the\r\nSenate, sacrificing the same interests in an injurious treaty with a\r\nforeign power? The truth is, that in all such cases it is essential to\r\nthe freedom and to the necessary independence of the deliberations of\r\nthe body, that the members of it should be exempt from punishment for\r\nacts done in a collective capacity; and the security to the society\r\nmust depend on the care which is taken to confide the trust to proper\r\nhands, to make it their interest to execute it with fidelity, and to\r\nmake it as difficult as possible for them to combine in any interest\r\nopposite to that of the public good.\r\n\r\nSo far as might concern the misbehavior of the Executive in perverting\r\nthe instructions or contravening the views of the Senate, we need not\r\nbe apprehensive of the want of a disposition in that body to punish the\r\nabuse of their confidence or to vindicate their own authority. We may\r\nthus far count upon their pride, if not upon their virtue. And so far\r\neven as might concern the corruption of leading members, by whose arts\r\nand influence the majority may have been inveigled into measures odious\r\nto the community, if the proofs of that corruption should be\r\nsatisfactory, the usual propensity of human nature will warrant us in\r\nconcluding that there would be commonly no defect of inclination in the\r\nbody to divert the public resentment from themselves by a ready\r\nsacrifice of the authors of their mismanagement and disgrace.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] In that of New Jersey, also, the final judiciary authority is in a\r\n branch of the legislature. In New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\n Pennsylvanis, and South Carolina, one branch of the legislature is the\r\n court for the trial of impeachments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXVII.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Department\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 11, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the executive department of the proposed\r\ngovernment, claims next our attention.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended\r\nwith greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than this; and there\r\nis, perhaps, none which has been inveighed against with less candor or\r\ncriticised with less judgment.\r\n\r\nHere the writers against the Constitution seem to have taken pains to\r\nsignalize their talent of misrepresentation. Calculating upon the\r\naversion of the people to monarchy, they have endeavored to enlist all\r\ntheir jealousies and apprehensions in opposition to the intended\r\nPresident of the United States; not merely as the embryo, but as the\r\nfull-grown progeny, of that detested parent. To establish the pretended\r\naffinity, they have not scrupled to draw resources even from the\r\nregions of fiction. The authorities of a magistrate, in few instances\r\ngreater, in some instances less, than those of a governor of New York,\r\nhave been magnified into more than royal prerogatives. He has been\r\ndecorated with attributes superior in dignity and splendor to those of\r\na king of Great Britain. He has been shown to us with the diadem\r\nsparkling on his brow and the imperial purple flowing in his train. He\r\nhas been seated on a throne surrounded with minions and mistresses,\r\ngiving audience to the envoys of foreign potentates, in all the\r\nsupercilious pomp of majesty. The images of Asiatic despotism and\r\nvoluptuousness have scarcely been wanting to crown the exaggerated\r\nscene. We have been taught to tremble at the terrific visages of\r\nmurdering janizaries, and to blush at the unveiled mysteries of a\r\nfuture seraglio.\r\n\r\nAttempts so extravagant as these to disfigure or, it might rather be\r\nsaid, to metamorphose the object, render it necessary to take an\r\naccurate view of its real nature and form: in order as well to\r\nascertain its true aspect and genuine appearance, as to unmask the\r\ndisingenuity and expose the fallacy of the counterfeit resemblances\r\nwhich have been so insidiously, as well as industriously, propagated.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of this task, there is no man who would not find it an\r\narduous effort either to behold with moderation, or to treat with\r\nseriousness, the devices, not less weak than wicked, which have been\r\ncontrived to pervert the public opinion in relation to the subject.\r\nThey so far exceed the usual though unjustifiable licenses of party\r\nartifice, that even in a disposition the most candid and tolerant, they\r\nmust force the sentiments which favor an indulgent construction of the\r\nconduct of political adversaries to give place to a voluntary and\r\nunreserved indignation. It is impossible not to bestow the imputation\r\nof deliberate imposture and deception upon the gross pretense of a\r\nsimilitude between a king of Great Britain and a magistrate of the\r\ncharacter marked out for that of the President of the United States. It\r\nis still more impossible to withhold that imputation from the rash and\r\nbarefaced expedients which have been employed to give success to the\r\nattempted imposition.\r\n\r\nIn one instance, which I cite as a sample of the general spirit, the\r\ntemerity has proceeded so far as to ascribe to the President of the\r\nUnited States a power which by the instrument reported is EXPRESSLY\r\nallotted to the Executives of the individual States. I mean the power\r\nof filling casual vacancies in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThis bold experiment upon the discernment of his countrymen has been\r\nhazarded by a writer who (whatever may be his real merit) has had no\r\ninconsiderable share in the applauses of his party;[1] and who, upon\r\nthis false and unfounded suggestion, has built a series of observations\r\nequally false and unfounded. Let him now be confronted with the\r\nevidence of the fact, and let him, if he be able, justify or extenuate\r\nthe shameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of truth and to the\r\nrules of fair dealing.\r\n\r\nThe second clause of the second section of the second article empowers\r\nthe President of the United States “to nominate, and by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate, to appoint ambassadors, other public\r\nministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other\r\nOFFICERS of United States whose appointments are NOT in the\r\nConstitution OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR, and WHICH SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY\r\nLAW.” Immediately after this clause follows another in these words:\r\n“The President shall have power to fill up ?? VACANCIES that may happen\r\nDURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE, by granting commissions which shall\r\nEXPIRE AT THE END OF THEIR NEXT SESSION.” It is from this last\r\nprovision that the pretended power of the President to fill vacancies\r\nin the Senate has been deduced. A slight attention to the connection of\r\nthe clauses, and to the obvious meaning of the terms, will satisfy us\r\nthat the deduction is not even colorable.\r\n\r\nThe first of these two clauses, it is clear, only provides a mode for\r\nappointing such officers, “whose appointments are NOT OTHERWISE\r\nPROVIDED FOR in the Constitution, and which SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY\r\nLAW”; of course it cannot extend to the appointments of senators, whose\r\nappointments are OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR in the Constitution,[2] and who\r\nare ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION, and will not require a future\r\nestablishment by law. This position will hardly be contested.\r\n\r\nThe last of these two clauses, it is equally clear, cannot be\r\nunderstood to comprehend the power of filling vacancies in the Senate,\r\nfor the following reasons: First. The relation in which that clause\r\nstands to the other, which declares the general mode of appointing\r\nofficers of the United States, denotes it to be nothing more than a\r\nsupplement to the other, for the purpose of establishing an auxiliary\r\nmethod of appointment, in cases to which the general method was\r\ninadequate. The ordinary power of appointment is confined to the\r\nPresident and Senate JOINTLY, and can therefore only be exercised\r\nduring the session of the Senate; but as it would have been improper to\r\noblige this body to be continually in session for the appointment of\r\nofficers and as vacancies might happen IN THEIR RECESS, which it might\r\nbe necessary for the public service to fill without delay, the\r\nsucceeding clause is evidently intended to authorize the President,\r\nSINGLY, to make temporary appointments “during the recess of the\r\nSenate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their\r\nnext session.” Secondly. If this clause is to be considered as\r\nsupplementary to the one which precedes, the VACANCIES of which it\r\nspeaks must be construed to relate to the “officers” described in the\r\npreceding one; and this, we have seen, excludes from its description\r\nthe members of the Senate. Thirdly. The time within which the power is\r\nto operate, “during the recess of the Senate,” and the duration of the\r\nappointments, “to the end of the next session” of that body, conspire\r\nto elucidate the sense of the provision, which, if it had been intended\r\nto comprehend senators, would naturally have referred the temporary\r\npower of filling vacancies to the recess of the State legislatures, who\r\nare to make the permanent appointments, and not to the recess of the\r\nnational Senate, who are to have no concern in those appointments; and\r\nwould have extended the duration in office of the temporary senators to\r\nthe next session of the legislature of the State, in whose\r\nrepresentation the vacancies had happened, instead of making it to\r\nexpire at the end of the ensuing session of the national Senate. The\r\ncircumstances of the body authorized to make the permanent appointments\r\nwould, of course, have governed the modification of a power which\r\nrelated to the temporary appointments; and as the national Senate is\r\nthe body, whose situation is alone contemplated in the clause upon\r\nwhich the suggestion under examination has been founded, the vacancies\r\nto which it alludes can only be deemed to respect those officers in\r\nwhose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the President.\r\nBut lastly, the first and second clauses of the third section of the\r\nfirst article, not only obviate all possibility of doubt, but destroy\r\nthe pretext of misconception. The former provides, that “the Senate of\r\nthe United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State,\r\nchosen BY THE LEGISLATURE THEREOF for six years”; and the latter\r\ndirects, that, “if vacancies in that body should happen by resignation\r\nor otherwise, DURING THE RECESS OF THE LEGISLATURE OF ANY STATE, the\r\nExecutive THEREOF may make temporary appointments until the NEXT\r\nMEETING OF THE LEGISLATURE, which shall then fill such vacancies.” Here\r\nis an express power given, in clear and unambiguous terms, to the State\r\nExecutives, to fill casual vacancies in the Senate, by temporary\r\nappointments; which not only invalidates the supposition, that the\r\nclause before considered could have been intended to confer that power\r\nupon the President of the United States, but proves that this\r\nsupposition, destitute as it is even of the merit of plausibility, must\r\nhave originated in an intention to deceive the people, too palpable to\r\nbe obscured by sophistry, too atrocious to be palliated by hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nI have taken the pains to select this instance of misrepresentation,\r\nand to place it in a clear and strong light, as an unequivocal proof of\r\nthe unwarrantable arts which are practiced to prevent a fair and\r\nimpartial judgment of the real merits of the Constitution submitted to\r\nthe consideration of the people. Nor have I scrupled, in so flagrant a\r\ncase, to allow myself a severity of animadversion little congenial with\r\nthe general spirit of these papers. I hesitate not to submit it to the\r\ndecision of any candid and honest adversary of the proposed government,\r\nwhether language can furnish epithets of too much asperity, for so\r\nshameless and so prostitute an attempt to impose on the citizens of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] See CATO, No. V.\r\n\r\n [2] Article 1, section 3, clause 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe Mode of Electing the President\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, March 14, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe mode of appointment of the Chief Magistrate of the United States is\r\nalmost the only part of the system, of any consequence, which has\r\nescaped without severe censure, or which has received the slightest\r\nmark of approbation from its opponents. The most plausible of these,\r\nwho has appeared in print, has even deigned to admit that the election\r\nof the President is pretty well guarded.[1] I venture somewhat further,\r\nand hesitate not to affirm, that if the manner of it be not perfect, it\r\nis at least excellent. It unites in an eminent degree all the\r\nadvantages, the union of which was to be wished for.\r\n\r\nIt was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in the\r\nchoice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided.\r\nThis end will be answered by committing the right of making it, not to\r\nany preestablished body, but to men chosen by the people for the\r\nspecial purpose, and at the particular conjuncture.\r\n\r\nIt was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by\r\nmen most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and\r\nacting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a\r\njudicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were\r\nproper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by\r\ntheir fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to\r\npossess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nIt was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as\r\npossible to tumult and disorder. This evil was not least to be dreaded\r\nin the election of a magistrate, who was to have so important an agency\r\nin the administration of the government as the President of the United\r\nStates. But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the\r\nsystem under consideration, promise an effectual security against this\r\nmischief. The choice of SEVERAL, to form an intermediate body of\r\nelectors, will be much less apt to convulse the community with any\r\nextraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of ONE who was\r\nhimself to be the final object of the public wishes. And as the\r\nelectors, chosen in each State, are to assemble and vote in the State\r\nin which they are chosen, this detached and divided situation will\r\nexpose them much less to heats and ferments, which might be\r\ncommunicated from them to the people, than if they were all to be\r\nconvened at one time, in one place.\r\n\r\nNothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle\r\nshould be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most deadly\r\nadversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected\r\nto make their approaches from more than one quarter, but chiefly from\r\nthe desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our\r\ncouncils. How could they better gratify this, than by raising a\r\ncreature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union? But the\r\nconvention have guarded against all danger of this sort, with the most\r\nprovident and judicious attention. They have not made the appointment\r\nof the President to depend on any preexisting bodies of men, who might\r\nbe tampered with beforehand to prostitute their votes; but they have\r\nreferred it in the first instance to an immediate act of the people of\r\nAmerica, to be exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary and\r\nsole purpose of making the appointment. And they have excluded from\r\neligibility to this trust, all those who from situation might be\r\nsuspected of too great devotion to the President in office. No senator,\r\nrepresentative, or other person holding a place of trust or profit\r\nunder the United States, can be of the numbers of the electors. Thus\r\nwithout corrupting the body of the people, the immediate agents in the\r\nelection will at least enter upon the task free from any sinister bias.\r\nTheir transient existence, and their detached situation, already taken\r\nnotice of, afford a satisfactory prospect of their continuing so, to\r\nthe conclusion of it. The business of corruption, when it is to embrace\r\nso considerable a number of men, requires time as well as means. Nor\r\nwould it be found easy suddenly to embark them, dispersed as they would\r\nbe over thirteen States, in any combinations founded upon motives,\r\nwhich though they could not properly be denominated corrupt, might yet\r\nbe of a nature to mislead them from their duty.\r\n\r\nAnother and no less important desideratum was, that the Executive\r\nshould be independent for his continuance in office on all but the\r\npeople themselves. He might otherwise be tempted to sacrifice his duty\r\nto his complaisance for those whose favor was necessary to the duration\r\nof his official consequence. This advantage will also be secured, by\r\nmaking his re-election to depend on a special body of representatives,\r\ndeputed by the society for the single purpose of making the important\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nAll these advantages will happily combine in the plan devised by the\r\nconvention; which is, that the people of each State shall choose a\r\nnumber of persons as electors, equal to the number of senators and\r\nrepresentatives of such State in the national government, who shall\r\nassemble within the State, and vote for some fit person as President.\r\nTheir votes, thus given, are to be transmitted to the seat of the\r\nnational government, and the person who may happen to have a majority\r\nof the whole number of votes will be the President. But as a majority\r\nof the votes might not always happen to centre in one man, and as it\r\nmight be unsafe to permit less than a majority to be conclusive, it is\r\nprovided that, in such a contingency, the House of Representatives\r\nshall select out of the candidates who shall have the five highest\r\nnumber of votes, the man who in their opinion may be best qualified for\r\nthe office.\r\n\r\nThe process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of\r\nPresident will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an\r\neminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. Talents for\r\nlow intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may alone suffice to\r\nelevate a man to the first honors in a single State; but it will\r\nrequire other talents, and a different kind of merit, to establish him\r\nin the esteem and confidence of the whole Union, or of so considerable\r\na portion of it as would be necessary to make him a successful\r\ncandidate for the distinguished office of President of the United\r\nStates. It will not be too strong to say, that there will be a constant\r\nprobability of seeing the station filled by characters pre-eminent for\r\nability and virtue. And this will be thought no inconsiderable\r\nrecommendation of the Constitution, by those who are able to estimate\r\nthe share which the executive in every government must necessarily have\r\nin its good or ill administration. Though we cannot acquiesce in the\r\npolitical heresy of the poet who says:\r\n\r\n“For forms of government let fools contest\r\nThat which is best administered is best,”\r\n\r\nyet we may safely pronounce, that the true test of a good government is\r\nits aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration.\r\n\r\nThe Vice-President is to be chosen in the same manner with the\r\nPresident; with this difference, that the Senate is to do, in respect\r\nto the former, what is to be done by the House of Representatives, in\r\nrespect to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of an extraordinary person, as Vice-President, has been\r\nobjected to as superfluous, if not mischievous. It has been alleged,\r\nthat it would have been preferable to have authorized the Senate to\r\nelect out of their own body an officer answering that description. But\r\ntwo considerations seem to justify the ideas of the convention in this\r\nrespect. One is, that to secure at all times the possibility of a\r\ndefinite resolution of the body, it is necessary that the President\r\nshould have only a casting vote. And to take the senator of any State\r\nfrom his seat as senator, to place him in that of President of the\r\nSenate, would be to exchange, in regard to the State from which he\r\ncame, a constant for a contingent vote. The other consideration is,\r\nthat as the Vice-President may occasionally become a substitute for the\r\nPresident, in the supreme executive magistracy, all the reasons which\r\nrecommend the mode of election prescribed for the one, apply with great\r\nif not with equal force to the manner of appointing the other. It is\r\nremarkable that in this, as in most other instances, the objection\r\nwhich is made would lie against the constitution of this State. We have\r\na Lieutenant-Governor, chosen by the people at large, who presides in\r\nthe Senate, and is the constitutional substitute for the Governor, in\r\ncasualties similar to those which would authorize the Vice-President to\r\nexercise the authorities and discharge the duties of the President.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] _Vide Federal Farmer_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXIX.\r\n\r\nThe Real Character of the Executive\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, March 14, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nI proceed now to trace the real characters of the proposed Executive,\r\nas they are marked out in the plan of the convention. This will serve\r\nto place in a strong light the unfairness of the representations which\r\nhave been made in regard to it.\r\n\r\nThe first thing which strikes our attention is, that the executive\r\nauthority, with few exceptions, is to be vested in a single magistrate.\r\nThis will scarcely, however, be considered as a point upon which any\r\ncomparison can be grounded; for if, in this particular, there be a\r\nresemblance to the king of Great Britain, there is not less a\r\nresemblance to the Grand Seignior, to the khan of Tartary, to the Man\r\nof the Seven Mountains, or to the governor of New York.\r\n\r\nThat magistrate is to be elected for FOUR years; and is to be\r\nre-eligible as often as the people of the United States shall think him\r\nworthy of their confidence. In these circumstances there is a total\r\ndissimilitude between HIM and a king of Great Britain, who is an\r\nHEREDITARY monarch, possessing the crown as a patrimony descendible to\r\nhis heirs forever; but there is a close analogy between HIM and a\r\ngovernor of New York, who is elected for THREE years, and is\r\nre-eligible without limitation or intermission. If we consider how much\r\nless time would be requisite for establishing a dangerous influence in\r\na single State, than for establishing a like influence throughout the\r\nUnited States, we must conclude that a duration of FOUR years for the\r\nChief Magistrate of the Union is a degree of permanency far less to be\r\ndreaded in that office, than a duration of THREE years for a\r\ncorresponding office in a single State.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States would be liable to be impeached,\r\ntried, and, upon conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes\r\nor misdemeanors, removed from office; and would afterwards be liable to\r\nprosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law. The person of\r\nthe king of Great Britain is sacred and inviolable; there is no\r\nconstitutional tribunal to which he is amenable; no punishment to which\r\nhe can be subjected without involving the crisis of a national\r\nrevolution. In this delicate and important circumstance of personal\r\nresponsibility, the President of Confederated America would stand upon\r\nno better ground than a governor of New York, and upon worse ground\r\nthan the governors of Maryland and Delaware.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States is to have power to return a bill,\r\nwhich shall have passed the two branches of the legislature, for\r\nreconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law, if, upon\r\nthat reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both houses. The\r\nking of Great Britain, on his part, has an absolute negative upon the\r\nacts of the two houses of Parliament. The disuse of that power for a\r\nconsiderable time past does not affect the reality of its existence;\r\nand is to be ascribed wholly to the crown’s having found the means of\r\nsubstituting influence to authority, or the art of gaining a majority\r\nin one or the other of the two houses, to the necessity of exerting a\r\nprerogative which could seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree\r\nof national agitation. The qualified negative of the President differs\r\nwidely from this absolute negative of the British sovereign; and\r\ntallies exactly with the revisionary authority of the council of\r\nrevision of this State, of which the governor is a constituent part. In\r\nthis respect the power of the President would exceed that of the\r\ngovernor of New York, because the former would possess, singly, what\r\nthe latter shares with the chancellor and judges; but it would be\r\nprecisely the same with that of the governor of Massachusetts, whose\r\nconstitution, as to this article, seems to have been the original from\r\nwhich the convention have copied.\r\n\r\nThe President is to be the “commander-in-chief of the army and navy of\r\nthe United States, and of the militia of the several States, when\r\ncalled into the actual service of the United States. He is to have\r\npower to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United\r\nStates, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT; to recommend to the\r\nconsideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and\r\nexpedient; to convene, on extraordinary occasions, both houses of the\r\nlegislature, or either of them, and, in case of disagreement between\r\nthem WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME OF ADJOURNMENT, to adjourn them to such\r\ntime as he shall think proper; to take care that the laws be faithfully\r\nexecuted; and to commission all officers of the United States.” In most\r\nof these particulars, the power of the President will resemble equally\r\nthat of the king of Great Britain and of the governor of New York. The\r\nmost material points of difference are these: First. The President will\r\nhave only the occasional command of such part of the militia of the\r\nnation as by legislative provision may be called into the actual\r\nservice of the Union. The king of Great Britain and the governor of New\r\nYork have at all times the entire command of all the militia within\r\ntheir several jurisdictions. In this article, therefore, the power of\r\nthe President would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the\r\ngovernor. Secondly. The President is to be commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy and navy of the United States. In this respect his authority would\r\nbe nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in\r\nsubstance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the\r\nsupreme command and direction of the military and naval forces, as\r\nfirst General and admiral of the Confederacy; while that of the British\r\nking extends to the DECLARING of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING\r\nof fleets and armies, all which, by the Constitution under\r\nconsideration, would appertain to the legislature.[1] The governor of\r\nNew York, on the other hand, is by the constitution of the State vested\r\nonly with the command of its militia and navy. But the constitutions of\r\nseveral of the States expressly declare their governors to be\r\ncommanders-in-chief, as well of the army as navy; and it may well be a\r\nquestion, whether those of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, in\r\nparticular, do not, in this instance, confer larger powers upon their\r\nrespective governors, than could be claimed by a President of the\r\nUnited States. Thirdly. The power of the President, in respect to\r\npardons, would extend to all cases, EXCEPT THOSE OF IMPEACHMENT. The\r\ngovernor of New York may pardon in all cases, even in those of\r\nimpeachment, except for treason and murder. Is not the power of the\r\ngovernor, in this article, on a calculation of political consequences,\r\ngreater than that of the President? All conspiracies and plots against\r\nthe government, which have not been matured into actual treason, may be\r\nscreened from punishment of every kind, by the interposition of the\r\nprerogative of pardoning. If a governor of New York, therefore, should\r\nbe at the head of any such conspiracy, until the design had been\r\nripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices and\r\nadherents an entire impunity. A President of the Union, on the other\r\nhand, though he may even pardon treason, when prosecuted in the\r\nordinary course of law, could shelter no offender, in any degree, from\r\nthe effects of impeachment and conviction. Would not the prospect of a\r\ntotal indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a greater temptation\r\nto undertake and persevere in an enterprise against the public liberty,\r\nthan the mere prospect of an exemption from death and confiscation, if\r\nthe final execution of the design, upon an actual appeal to arms,\r\nshould miscarry? Would this last expectation have any influence at all,\r\nwhen the probability was computed, that the person who was to afford\r\nthat exemption might himself be involved in the consequences of the\r\nmeasure, and might be incapacitated by his agency in it from affording\r\nthe desired impunity? The better to judge of this matter, it will be\r\nnecessary to recollect, that, by the proposed Constitution, the offense\r\nof treason is limited “to levying war upon the United States, and\r\nadhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort”; and that by\r\nthe laws of New York it is confined within similar bounds. Fourthly.\r\nThe President can only adjourn the national legislature in the single\r\ncase of disagreement about the time of adjournment. The British monarch\r\nmay prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament. The governor of New York\r\nmay also prorogue the legislature of this State for a limited time; a\r\npower which, in certain situations, may be employed to very important\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe President is to have power, with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators present\r\nconcur. The king of Great Britain is the sole and absolute\r\nrepresentative of the nation in all foreign transactions. He can of his\r\nown accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of every\r\nother description. It has been insinuated, that his authority in this\r\nrespect is not conclusive, and that his conventions with foreign powers\r\nare subject to the revision, and stand in need of the ratification, of\r\nParliament. But I believe this doctrine was never heard of, until it\r\nwas broached upon the present occasion. Every jurist[2] of that\r\nkingdom, and every other man acquainted with its Constitution, knows,\r\nas an established fact, that the prerogative of making treaties exists\r\nin the crown in its utmost plentitude; and that the compacts entered\r\ninto by the royal authority have the most complete legal validity and\r\nperfection, independent of any other sanction. The Parliament, it is\r\ntrue, is sometimes seen employing itself in altering the existing laws\r\nto conform them to the stipulations in a new treaty; and this may have\r\npossibly given birth to the imagination, that its co-operation was\r\nnecessary to the obligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this\r\nparliamentary interposition proceeds from a different cause: from the\r\nnecessity of adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of\r\nrevenue and commercial laws, to the changes made in them by the\r\noperation of the treaty; and of adapting new provisions and precautions\r\nto the new state of things, to keep the machine from running into\r\ndisorder. In this respect, therefore, there is no comparison between\r\nthe intended power of the President and the actual power of the British\r\nsovereign. The one can perform alone what the other can do only with\r\nthe concurrence of a branch of the legislature. It must be admitted,\r\nthat, in this instance, the power of the federal Executive would exceed\r\nthat of any State Executive. But this arises naturally from the\r\nsovereign power which relates to treaties. If the Confederacy were to\r\nbe dissolved, it would become a question, whether the Executives of the\r\nseveral States were not solely invested with that delicate and\r\nimportant prerogative.\r\n\r\nThe President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors and other\r\npublic ministers. This, though it has been a rich theme of declamation,\r\nis more a matter of dignity than of authority. It is a circumstance\r\nwhich will be without consequence in the administration of the\r\ngovernment; and it was far more convenient that it should be arranged\r\nin this manner, than that there should be a necessity of convening the\r\nlegislature, or one of its branches, upon every arrival of a foreign\r\nminister, though it were merely to take the place of a departed\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\nThe President is to nominate, and, WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE\r\nSENATE, to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers, judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court, and in general all officers of the United States\r\nestablished by law, and whose appointments are not otherwise provided\r\nfor by the Constitution. The king of Great Britain is emphatically and\r\ntruly styled the fountain of honor. He not only appoints to all\r\noffices, but can create offices. He can confer titles of nobility at\r\npleasure; and has the disposal of an immense number of church\r\npreferments. There is evidently a great inferiority in the power of the\r\nPresident, in this particular, to that of the British king; nor is it\r\nequal to that of the governor of New York, if we are to interpret the\r\nmeaning of the constitution of the State by the practice which has\r\nobtained under it. The power of appointment is with us lodged in a\r\ncouncil, composed of the governor and four members of the Senate,\r\nchosen by the Assembly. The governor CLAIMS, and has frequently\r\nEXERCISED, the right of nomination, and is ENTITLED to a casting vote\r\nin the appointment. If he really has the right of nominating, his\r\nauthority is in this respect equal to that of the President, and\r\nexceeds it in the article of the casting vote. In the national\r\ngovernment, if the Senate should be divided, no appointment could be\r\nmade; in the government of New York, if the council should be divided,\r\nthe governor can turn the scale, and confirm his own nomination.[3] If\r\nwe compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode of\r\nappointment by the President and an entire branch of the national\r\nlegislature, with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the\r\ngovernor of New York, closeted in a secret apartment with at most four,\r\nand frequently with only two persons; and if we at the same time\r\nconsider how much more easy it must be to influence the small number of\r\nwhich a council of appointment consists, than the considerable number\r\nof which the national Senate would consist, we cannot hesitate to\r\npronounce that the power of the chief magistrate of this State, in the\r\ndisposition of offices, must, in practice, be greatly superior to that\r\nof the Chief Magistrate of the Union.\r\n\r\nHence it appears that, except as to the concurrent authority of the\r\nPresident in the article of treaties, it would be difficult to\r\ndetermine whether that magistrate would, in the aggregate, possess more\r\nor less power than the Governor of New York. And it appears yet more\r\nunequivocally, that there is no pretense for the parallel which has\r\nbeen attempted between him and the king of Great Britain. But to render\r\nthe contrast in this respect still more striking, it may be of use to\r\nthrow the principal circumstances of dissimilitude into a closer group.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States would be an officer elected by the\r\npeople for FOUR years; the king of Great Britain is a perpetual and\r\nHEREDITARY prince. The one would be amenable to personal punishment and\r\ndisgrace; the person of the other is sacred and inviolable. The one\r\nwould have a QUALIFIED negative upon the acts of the legislative body;\r\nthe other has an ABSOLUTE negative. The one would have a right to\r\ncommand the military and naval forces of the nation; the other, in\r\naddition to this right, possesses that of DECLARING war, and of RAISING\r\nand REGULATING fleets and armies by his own authority. The one would\r\nhave a concurrent power with a branch of the legislature in the\r\nformation of treaties; the other is the SOLE POSSESSOR of the power of\r\nmaking treaties. The one would have a like concurrent authority in\r\nappointing to offices; the other is the sole author of all\r\nappointments. The one can confer no privileges whatever; the other can\r\nmake denizens of aliens, noblemen of commoners; can erect corporations\r\nwith all the rights incident to corporate bodies. The one can prescribe\r\nno rules concerning the commerce or currency of the nation; the other\r\nis in several respects the arbiter of commerce, and in this capacity\r\ncan establish markets and fairs, can regulate weights and measures, can\r\nlay embargoes for a limited time, can coin money, can authorize or\r\nprohibit the circulation of foreign coin. The one has no particle of\r\nspiritual jurisdiction; the other is the supreme head and governor of\r\nthe national church! What answer shall we give to those who would\r\npersuade us that things so unlike resemble each other? The same that\r\nought to be given to those who tell us that a government, the whole\r\npower of which would be in the hands of the elective and periodical\r\nservants of the people, is an aristocracy, a monarchy, and a despotism.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] A writer in a Pennsylvania paper, under the signature of TAMONY,\r\n has asserted that the king of Great Britain owes his prerogative as\r\n commander-in-chief to an annual mutiny bill. The truth is, on the\r\n contrary, that his prerogative, in this respect, is immemorial, and\r\n was only disputed, “contrary to all reason and precedent,” as\r\n Blackstone vol. i., page 262, expresses it, by the Long Parliament of\r\n Charles I. but by the statute the 13th of Charles II., chap. 6, it was\r\n declared to be in the king alone, for that the sole supreme government\r\n and command of the militia within his Majesty’s realms and dominions,\r\n and of all forces by sea and land, and of all forts and places of\r\n strength, EVER WAS AND IS the undoubted right of his Majesty and his\r\n royal predecessors, kings and queens of England, and that both or\r\n either house of Parliament cannot nor ought to pretend to the same.\r\n\r\n [2] _Vide_ Blackstone’s _Commentaries_, vol i., p. 257.\r\n\r\n [3] Candor, however, demands an acknowledgment that I do not think the\r\n claim of the governor to a right of nomination well founded. Yet it is\r\n always justifiable to reason from the practice of a government, till\r\n its propriety has been constitutionally questioned. And independent of\r\n this claim, when we take into view the other considerations, and\r\n pursue them through all their consequences, we shall be inclined to\r\n draw much the same conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXX.\r\n\r\n(There are two slightly different versions of No. 70 included here.)\r\n\r\nThe Executive Department Further Considered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 18, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThere is an idea, which is not without its advocates, that a vigorous\r\nExecutive is inconsistent with the genius of republican government. The\r\nenlightened well-wishers to this species of government must at least\r\nhope that the supposition is destitute of foundation; since they can\r\nnever admit its truth, without at the same time admitting the\r\ncondemnation of their own principles. Energy in the Executive is a\r\nleading character in the definition of good government. It is essential\r\nto the protection of the community against foreign attacks; it is not\r\nless essential to the steady administration of the laws; to the\r\nprotection of property against those irregular and high-handed\r\ncombinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice;\r\nto the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of\r\nambition, of faction, and of anarchy. Every man the least conversant in\r\nRoman story, knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge\r\nin the absolute power of a single man, under the formidable title of\r\nDictator, as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who\r\naspired to the tyranny, and the seditions of whole classes of the\r\ncommunity whose conduct threatened the existence of all government, as\r\nagainst the invasions of external enemies who menaced the conquest and\r\ndestruction of Rome.\r\n\r\nThere can be no need, however, to multiply arguments or examples on\r\nthis head. A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the\r\ngovernment. A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad\r\nexecution; and a government ill executed, whatever it may be in theory,\r\nmust be, in practice, a bad government.\r\n\r\nTaking it for granted, therefore, that all men of sense will agree in\r\nthe necessity of an energetic Executive, it will only remain to\r\ninquire, what are the ingredients which constitute this energy? How far\r\ncan they be combined with those other ingredients which constitute\r\nsafety in the republican sense? And how far does this combination\r\ncharacterize the plan which has been reported by the convention?\r\n\r\nThe ingredients which constitute energy in the Executive are, first,\r\nunity; secondly, duration; thirdly, an adequate provision for its\r\nsupport; fourthly, competent powers.\r\n\r\nThe ingredients which constitute safety in the repub lican sense are,\r\nfirst, a due dependence on the people, secondly, a due responsibility.\r\n\r\nThose politicians and statesmen who have been the most celebrated for\r\nthe soundness of their principles and for the justice of their views,\r\nhave declared in favor of a single Executive and a numerous\r\nlegislature. They have with great propriety, considered energy as the\r\nmost necessary qualification of the former, and have regarded this as\r\nmost applicable to power in a single hand, while they have, with equal\r\npropriety, considered the latter as best adapted to deliberation and\r\nwisdom, and best calculated to conciliate the confidence of the people\r\nand to secure their privileges and interests.\r\n\r\nThat unity is conducive to energy will not be disputed. Decision,\r\nactivity, secrecy, and despatch will generally characterize the\r\nproceedings of one man in a much more eminent degree than the\r\nproceedings of any greater number; and in proportion as the number is\r\nincreased, these qualities will be diminished.\r\n\r\nThis unity may be destroyed in two ways: either by vesting the power in\r\ntwo or more magistrates of equal dignity and authority; or by vesting\r\nit ostensibly in one man, subject, in whole or in part, to the control\r\nand co-operation of others, in the capacity of counsellors to him. Of\r\nthe first, the two Consuls of Rome may serve as an example; of the\r\nlast, we shall find examples in the constitutions of several of the\r\nStates. New York and New Jersey, if I recollect right, are the only\r\nStates which have intrusted the executive authority wholly to single\r\nmen.[1] Both these methods of destroying the unity of the Executive\r\nhave their partisans; but the votaries of an executive council are the\r\nmost numerous. They are both liable, if not to equal, to similar\r\nobjections, and may in most lights be examined in conjunction.\r\n\r\nThe experience of other nations will afford little instruction on this\r\nhead. As far, however, as it teaches any thing, it teaches us not to be\r\nenamoured of plurality in the Executive. We have seen that the\r\nAchaeans, on an experiment of two Praetors, were induced to abolish\r\none. The Roman history records many instances of mischiefs to the\r\nrepublic from the dissensions between the Consuls, and between the\r\nmilitary Tribunes, who were at times substituted for the Consuls. But\r\nit gives us no specimens of any peculiar advantages derived to the\r\nstate from the circumstance of the plurality of those magistrates. That\r\nthe dissensions between them were not more frequent or more fatal, is a\r\nmatter of astonishment, until we advert to the singular position in\r\nwhich the republic was almost continually placed, and to the prudent\r\npolicy pointed out by the circumstances of the state, and pursued by\r\nthe Consuls, of making a division of the government between them. The\r\npatricians engaged in a perpetual struggle with the plebeians for the\r\npreservation of their ancient authorities and dignities; the Consuls,\r\nwho were generally chosen out of the former body, were commonly united\r\nby the personal interest they had in the defense of the privileges of\r\ntheir order. In addition to this motive of union, after the arms of the\r\nrepublic had considerably expanded the bounds of its empire, it became\r\nan established custom with the Consuls to divide the administration\r\nbetween themselves by lot one of them remaining at Rome to govern the\r\ncity and its environs, the other taking the command in the more distant\r\nprovinces. This expedient must, no doubt, have had great influence in\r\npreventing those collisions and rivalships which might otherwise have\r\nembroiled the peace of the republic.\r\n\r\nBut quitting the dim light of historical research, attaching ourselves\r\npurely to the dictates of reason and good sense, we shall discover much\r\ngreater cause to reject than to approve the idea of plurality in the\r\nExecutive, under any modification whatever.\r\n\r\nWherever two or more persons are engaged in any common enterprise or\r\npursuit, there is always danger of difference of opinion. If it be a\r\npublic trust or office, in which they are clothed with equal dignity\r\nand authority, there is peculiar danger of personal emulation and even\r\nanimosity. From either, and especially from all these causes, the most\r\nbitter dissensions are apt to spring. Whenever these happen, they\r\nlessen the respectability, weaken the authority, and distract the plans\r\nand operation of those whom they divide. If they should unfortunately\r\nassail the supreme executive magistracy of a country, consisting of a\r\nplurality of persons, they might impede or frustrate the most important\r\nmeasures of the government, in the most critical emergencies of the\r\nstate. And what is still worse, they might split the community into the\r\nmost violent and irreconcilable factions, adhering differently to the\r\ndifferent individuals who composed the magistracy.\r\n\r\nMen often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency in\r\nplanning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they\r\ndislike. But if they have been consulted, and have happened to\r\ndisapprove, opposition then becomes, in their estimation, an\r\nindispensable duty of self-love. They seem to think themselves bound in\r\nhonor, and by all the motives of personal infallibility, to defeat the\r\nsuccess of what has been resolved upon contrary to their sentiments.\r\nMen of upright, benevolent tempers have too many opportunities of\r\nremarking, with horror, to what desperate lengths this disposition is\r\nsometimes carried, and how often the great interests of society are\r\nsacrificed to the vanity, to the conceit, and to the obstinacy of\r\nindividuals, who have credit enough to make their passions and their\r\ncaprices interesting to mankind. Perhaps the question now before the\r\npublic may, in its consequences, afford melancholy proofs of the\r\neffects of this despicable frailty, or rather detestable vice, in the\r\nhuman character.\r\n\r\nUpon the principles of a free government, inconveniences from the\r\nsource just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the formation\r\nof the legislature; but it is unnecessary, and therefore unwise, to\r\nintroduce them into the constitution of the Executive. It is here too\r\nthat they may be most pernicious. In the legislature, promptitude of\r\ndecision is oftener an evil than a benefit. The differences of opinion,\r\nand the jarrings of parties in that department of the government,\r\nthough they may sometimes obstruct salutary plans, yet often promote\r\ndeliberation and circumspection, and serve to check excesses in the\r\nmajority. When a resolution too is once taken, the opposition must be\r\nat an end. That resolution is a law, and resistance to it punishable.\r\nBut no favorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages\r\nof dissension in the executive department. Here, they are pure and\r\nunmixed. There is no point at which they cease to operate. They serve\r\nto embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure to which\r\nthey relate, from the first step to the final conclusion of it. They\r\nconstantly counteract those qualities in the Executive which are the\r\nmost necessary ingredients in its composition, vigor and expedition,\r\nand this without anycounterbalancing good. In the conduct of war, in\r\nwhich the energy of the Executive is the bulwark of the national\r\nsecurity, every thing would be to be apprehended from its plurality.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that these observations apply with principal\r\nweight to the first case supposed that is, to a plurality of\r\nmagistrates of equal dignity and authority a scheme, the advocates for\r\nwhich are not likely to form a numerous sect; but they apply, though\r\nnot with equal, yet with considerable weight to the project of a\r\ncouncil, whose concurrence is made constitutionally necessary to the\r\noperations of the ostensible Executive. An artful cabal in that council\r\nwould be able to distract and to enervate the whole system of\r\nadministration. If no such cabal should exist, the mere diversity of\r\nviews and opinions would alone be sufficient to tincture the exercise\r\nof the executive authority with a spirit of habitual feebleness and\r\ndilatoriness.\r\n\r\nBut one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the Executive,\r\nand which lies as much against the last as the first plan, is, that it\r\ntends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility. Responsibility is\r\nof two kinds to censure and to punishment. The first is the more\r\nimportant of the two, especially in an elective office. Man, in public\r\ntrust, will much oftener act in such a manner as to render him unworthy\r\nof being any longer trusted, than in such a manner as to make him\r\nobnoxious to legal punishment. But the multiplication of the Executive\r\nadds to the difficulty of detection in either case. It often becomes\r\nimpossible, amidst mutual accusations, to determine on whom the blame\r\nor the punishment of a pernicious measure, or series of pernicious\r\nmeasures, ought really to fall. It is shifted from one to another with\r\nso much dexterity, and under such plausible appearances, that the\r\npublic opinion is left in suspense about the real author. The\r\ncircumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or\r\nmisfortune are sometimes so complicated that, where there are a number\r\nof actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency,\r\nthough we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been\r\nmismanagement, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose\r\naccount the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable.\r\n\r\n“I was overruled by my council. The council were so divided in their\r\nopinions that it was impossible to obtain any better resolution on the\r\npoint.” These and similar pretexts are constantly at hand, whether true\r\nor false. And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur\r\nthe odium, of a strict scrunity into the secret springs of the\r\ntransaction? Should there be found a citizen zealous enough to\r\nundertake the unpromising task, if there happen to be collusion between\r\nthe parties concerned, how easy it is to clothe the circumstances with\r\nso much ambiguity, as to render it uncertain what was the precise\r\nconduct of any of those parties?\r\n\r\nIn the single instance in which the governor of this State is coupled\r\nwith a council that is, in the appointment to offices, we have seen the\r\nmischiefs of it in the view now under consideration. Scandalous\r\nappointments to important offices have been made. Some cases, indeed,\r\nhave been so flagrant that ALL PARTIES have agreed in the impropriety\r\nof the thing. When inquiry has been made, the blame has been laid by\r\nthe governor on the members of the council, who, on their part, have\r\ncharged it upon his nomination; while the people remain altogether at a\r\nloss to determine, by whose influence their interests have been\r\ncommitted to hands so unqualified and so manifestly improper. In\r\ntenderness to individuals, I forbear to descend to particulars.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from these considerations, that the plurality of the\r\nExecutive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest securities\r\nthey can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated power, first,\r\nthe restraints of public opinion, which lose their efficacy, as well on\r\naccount of the division of the censure attendant on bad measures among\r\na number, as on account of the uncertainty on whom it ought to fall;\r\nand, secondly, the opportunity of discovering with facility and\r\nclearness the misconduct of the persons they trust, in order either to\r\ntheir removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which\r\nadmit of it.\r\n\r\nIn England, the king is a perpetual magistrate; and it is a maxim which\r\nhas obtained for the sake of the pub lic peace, that he is\r\nunaccountable for his administration, and his person sacred. Nothing,\r\ntherefore, can be wiser in that kingdom, than to annex to the king a\r\nconstitutional council, who may be responsible to the nation for the\r\nadvice they give. Without this, there would be no responsibility\r\nwhatever in the executive department an idea inadmissible in a free\r\ngovernment. But even there the king is not bound by the resolutions of\r\nhis council, though they are answerable for the advice they give. He is\r\nthe absolute master of his own conduct in the exercise of his office,\r\nand may observe or disregard the counsel given to him at his sole\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nBut in a republic, where every magistrate ought to be personally\r\nresponsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the British\r\nConstitution dictates the propriety of a council, not only ceases to\r\napply, but turns against the institution. In the monarchy of Great\r\nBritain, it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited responsibility of\r\nthe chief magistrate, which serves in some degree as a hostage to the\r\nnational justice for his good behavior. In the American republic, it\r\nwould serve to destroy, or would greatly diminish, the intended and\r\nnecessary responsibility of the Chief Magistrate himself.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a council to the Executive, which has so generally obtained\r\nin the State constitutions, has been derived from that maxim of\r\nrepublican jealousy which considers power as safer in the hands of a\r\nnumber of men than of a single man. If the maxim should be admitted to\r\nbe applicable to the case, I should contend that the advantage on that\r\nside would not counterbalance the numerous disadvantages on the\r\nopposite side. But I do not think the rule at all applicable to the\r\nexecutive power. I clearly concur in opinion, in this particular, with\r\na writer whom the celebrated Junius pronounces to be “deep, solid, and\r\ningenious,” that “the executive power is more easily confined when it\r\nis ONE”;[2] that it is far more safe there should be a single object\r\nfor the jealousy and watchfulness of the people; and, in a word, that\r\nall multiplication of the Executive is rather dangerous than friendly\r\nto liberty.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will satisfy us, that the species of security\r\nsought for in the multiplication of the Executive, is nattainable.\r\nNumbers must be so great as to render combination difficult, or they\r\nare rather a source of danger than of security. The united credit and\r\ninfluence of several individuals must be more formidable to liberty,\r\nthan the credit and influence of either of them separately. When power,\r\ntherefore, is placed in the hands of so small a number of men, as to\r\nadmit of their interests and views being easily combined in a common\r\nenterprise, by an artful leader, it becomes more liable to abuse, and\r\nmore dangerous when abused, than if it be lodged in the hands of one\r\nman; who, from the very circumstance of his being alone, will be more\r\nnarrowly watched and more readily suspected, and who cannot unite so\r\ngreat a mass of influence as when he is associated with others. The\r\nDecemvirs of Rome, whose name denotes their number,[3] were more to be\r\ndreaded in their usurpation than any ONE of them would have been. No\r\nperson would think of proposing an Executive much more numerous than\r\nthat body; from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of\r\nthe council. The extreme of these numbers, is not too great for an easy\r\ncombination; and from such a combination America would have more to\r\nfear, than from the ambition of any single individual. A council to a\r\nmagistrate, who is himself responsible for what he does, are generally\r\nnothing better than a clog upon his good intentions, are often the\r\ninstruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost always a cloak to\r\nhis faults.\r\n\r\nI forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense; though it be evident\r\nthat if the council should be numerous enough to answer the principal\r\nend aimed at by the institution, the salaries of the members, who must\r\nbe drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of government, would\r\nform an item in the catalogue of public expenditures too serious to be\r\nincurred for an object of equivocal utility. I will only add that,\r\nprior to the appearance of the Constitution, I rarely met with an\r\nintelligent man from any of the States, who did not admit, as the\r\nresult of experience, that the UNITY of the executive of this State was\r\none of the best of the distinguishing features of our constitution.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] New York has no council except for the single purpose of\r\n appointing to offices; New Jersey has a council whom the governor may\r\n consult. But I think, from the terms of the constitution, their\r\n resolutions do not bind him.\r\n\r\n [2] De Lolme.\r\n\r\n [3] Ten.\r\n\r\n*There are two slightly different versions of No. 70 included here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXX.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Department Further Considered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 18, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThere is an idea, which is not without its advocates, that a vigorous\r\nExecutive is inconsistent with the genius of republican government. The\r\nenlightened well-wishers to this species of government must at least\r\nhope that the supposition is destitute of foundation; since they can\r\nnever admit its truth, without at the same time admitting the\r\ncondemnation of their own principles.

A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the\r\ngovernment. A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad\r\nexecution; and a government ill executed, whatever it may be in theory,\r\nmust be, in practice, a bad government.\r\n\r\nTaking it for granted, therefore, that all men of sense will agree in\r\nthe necessity of an energetic Executive, it will only remain to\r\ninquire, what are the ingredients which constitute this energy? How far\r\ncan they be combined with those other ingredients which constitute\r\nsafety in the republican sense? And how far does this combination\r\ncharacterize the plan which has been reported by the convention?\r\n\r\nThe ingredients which constitute energy in the Executive are, first,\r\nunity; secondly, duration; thirdly, an adequate provision for its\r\nsupport; fourthly, competent powers.\r\n\r\nThe ingredients which constitute safety in the repub lican sense are,\r\nfirst, a due dependence on the people, secondly, a due responsibility.\r\n\r\nThose politicians and statesmen who have been the most celebrated for\r\nthe soundness of their principles and for the justice of their views,\r\nhave declared in favor of a single Executive and a numerous\r\nlegislature.

Decision,\r\nactivity, secrecy, and despatch will generally characterize the\r\nproceedings of one man in a much more eminent degree than the\r\nproceedings of any greater number; and in proportion as the number is\r\nincreased, these qualities will be diminished.\r\n\r\nThis unity may be destroyed in two ways: either by vesting the power in\r\ntwo or more magistrates of equal dignity and authority; or by vesting\r\nit ostensibly in one man, subject, in whole or in part, to the control\r\nand co-operation of others, in the capacity of counsellors to him. Of\r\nthe first, the two Consuls of Rome may serve as an example; of the\r\nlast, we shall find examples in the constitutions of several of the\r\nStates. New York and New Jersey, if I recollect right, are the only\r\nStates which have intrusted the executive authority wholly to single\r\nmen.[1] Both these methods of destroying the unity of the Executive\r\nhave their partisans; but the votaries of an executive council are the\r\nmost numerous. They are both liable, if not to equal, to similar\r\nobjections, and may in most lights be examined in conjunction.\r\n\r\nThe experience of other nations will afford little instruction on this\r\nhead. As far, however, as it teaches any thing, it teaches us not to be\r\nenamoured of plurality in the Executive. We have seen that the\r\nAchaeans, on an experiment of two Praetors, were induced to abolish\r\none. The Roman history records many instances of mischiefs to the\r\nrepublic from the dissensions between the Consuls, and between the\r\nmilitary Tribunes, who were at times substituted for the Consuls.

If it be a\r\npublic trust or office, in which they are clothed with equal dignity\r\nand authority, there is peculiar danger of personal emulation and even\r\nanimosity. From either, and especially from all these causes, the most\r\nbitter dissensions are apt to spring. Whenever these happen, they\r\nlessen the respectability, weaken the authority, and distract the plans\r\nand operation of those whom they divide. If they should unfortunately\r\nassail the supreme executive magistracy of a country, consisting of a\r\nplurality of persons, they might impede or frustrate the most important\r\nmeasures of the government, in the most critical emergencies of the\r\nstate. And what is still worse, they might split the community into the\r\nmost violent and irreconcilable factions, adhering differently to the\r\ndifferent individuals who composed the magistracy.\r\n\r\nMen often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency in\r\nplanning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they\r\ndislike. But if they have been consulted, and have happened to\r\ndisapprove, opposition then becomes, in their estimation, an\r\nindispensable duty of self-love. They seem to think themselves bound in\r\nhonor, and by all the motives of personal infallibility, to defeat the\r\nsuccess of what has been resolved upon contrary to their sentiments.\r\nMen of upright, benevolent tempers have too many opportunities of\r\nremarking, with horror, to what desperate lengths this disposition is\r\nsometimes carried, and how often the great interests of society are\r\nsacrificed to the vanity, to the conceit, and to the obstinacy of\r\nindividuals, who have credit enough to make their passions and their\r\ncaprices interesting to mankind. Perhaps the question now before the\r\npublic may, in its consequences, afford melancholy proofs of the\r\neffects of this despicable frailty, or rather detestable vice, in the\r\nhuman character.\r\n\r\nUpon the principles of a free government, inconveniences from the\r\nsource just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the formation\r\nof the legislature; but it is unnecessary, and therefore unwise, to\r\nintroduce them into the constitution of the Executive. It is here too\r\nthat they may be most pernicious. In the legislature, promptitude of\r\ndecision is oftener an evil than a benefit. The differences of opinion,\r\nand the jarrings of parties in that department of the government,\r\nthough they may sometimes obstruct salutary plans, yet often promote\r\ndeliberation and circumspection, and serve to check excesses in the\r\nmajority. When a resolution too is once taken, the opposition must be\r\nat an end. That resolution is a law, and resistance to it punishable.\r\nBut no favorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages\r\nof dissension in the executive department. Here, they are pure and\r\nunmixed. There is no point at which they cease to operate. They serve\r\nto embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure to which\r\nthey relate, from the first step to the final conclusion of it. They\r\nconstantly counteract those qualities in the Executive which are the\r\nmost necessary ingredients in its composition, vigor and expedition,\r\nand this without anycounterbalancing good. In the conduct of war, in\r\nwhich the energy of the Executive is the bulwark of the national\r\nsecurity, every thing would be to be apprehended from its plurality.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that these observations apply with principal\r\nweight to the first case supposed that is, to a plurality of\r\nmagistrates of equal dignity and authority a scheme, the advocates for\r\nwhich are not likely to form a numerous sect; but they apply, though\r\nnot with equal, yet with considerable weight to the project of a\r\ncouncil, whose concurrence is made constitutionally necessary to the\r\noperations of the ostensible Executive. An artful cabal in that council\r\nwould be able to distract and to enervate the whole system of\r\nadministration. If no such cabal should exist, the mere diversity of\r\nviews and opinions would alone be sufficient to tincture the exercise\r\nof the executive authority with a spirit of habitual feebleness and\r\ndilatoriness.\r\n\r\nBut one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the Executive,\r\nand which lies as much against the last as the first plan, is, that it\r\ntends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility.\r\n\r\nResponsibility is of two kinds to censure and to punishment. The first\r\nis the more important of the two, especially in an elective office.\r\nMan, in public trust, will much oftener act in such a manner as to\r\nrender him unworthy of being any longer trusted, than in such a manner\r\nas to make him obnoxious to legal punishment. But the multiplication of\r\nthe Executive adds to the difficulty of detection in either case. It\r\noften becomes impossible, amidst mutual accusations, to determine on\r\nwhom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure, or series of\r\npernicious measures, ought really to fall. It is shifted from one to\r\nanother with so much dexterity, and under such plausible appearances,\r\nthat the public opinion is left in suspense about the real author. The\r\ncircumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or\r\nmisfortune are sometimes so complicated that, where there are a number\r\nof actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency,\r\nthough we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been\r\nmismanagement, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose\r\naccount the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable.\r\n\r\n“I was overruled by my council. The council were so divided in their\r\nopinions that it was impossible to obtain any better resolution on the\r\npoint.” These and similar pretexts are constantly at hand, whether true\r\nor false. And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur\r\nthe odium, of a strict scrunity into the secret springs of the\r\ntransaction? Should there be found a citizen zealous enough to\r\nundertake the unpromising task, if there happen to be collusion between\r\nthe parties concerned, how easy it is to clothe the circumstances with\r\nso much ambiguity, as to render it uncertain what was the precise\r\nconduct of any of those parties?\r\n\r\nIn the single instance in which the governor of this State is coupled\r\nwith a council that is, in the appointment to offices, we have seen the\r\nmischiefs of it in the view now under consideration. Scandalous\r\nappointments to important offices have been made. Some cases, indeed,\r\nhave been so flagrant that ALL PARTIES have agreed in the impropriety\r\nof the thing. When inquiry has been made, the blame has been laid by\r\nthe governor on the members of the council, who, on their part, have\r\ncharged it upon his nomination; while the people remain altogether at a\r\nloss to determine, by whose influence their interests have been\r\ncommitted to hands so unqualified and so manifestly improper. In\r\ntenderness to individuals, I forbear to descend to particulars.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from these considerations, that the plurality of the\r\nExecutive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest securities\r\nthey can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated power, first,\r\nthe restraints of public opinion, which lose their efficacy, as well on\r\naccount of the division of the censure attendant on bad measures among\r\na number, as on account of the uncertainty on whom it ought to fall;\r\nand, secondly, the opportunity of discovering with facility and\r\nclearness the misconduct of the persons they trust, in order either to\r\ntheir removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which\r\nadmit of it.\r\n\r\nIn England, the king is a perpetual magistrate; and it is a maxim which\r\nhas obtained for the sake of the pub lic peace, that he is\r\nunaccountable for his administration, and his person sacred. Nothing,\r\ntherefore, can be wiser in that kingdom, than to annex to the king a\r\nconstitutional council, who may be responsible to the nation for the\r\nadvice they give. Without this, there would be no responsibility\r\nwhatever in the executive department an idea inadmissible in a free\r\ngovernment. But even there the king is not bound by the resolutions of\r\nhis council, though they are answerable for the advice they give. He is\r\nthe absolute master of his own conduct in the exercise of his office,\r\nand may observe or disregard the counsel given to him at his sole\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nBut in a republic, where every magistrate ought to be personally\r\nresponsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the British\r\nConstitution dictates the propriety of a council, not only ceases to\r\napply, but turns against the institution. In the monarchy of Great\r\nBritain, it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited responsibility of\r\nthe chief magistrate, which serves in some degree as a hostage to the\r\nnational justice for his good behavior. In the American republic, it\r\nwould serve to destroy, or would greatly diminish, the intended and\r\nnecessary responsibility of the Chief Magistrate himself.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a council to the Executive, which has so generally obtained\r\nin the State constitutions, has been derived from that maxim of\r\nrepublican jealousy which considers power as safer in the hands of a\r\nnumber of men than of a single man. If the maxim should be admitted to\r\nbe applicable to the case, I should contend that the advantage on that\r\nside would not counterbalance the numerous disadvantages on the\r\nopposite side. But I do not think the rule at all applicable to the\r\nexecutive power. I clearly concur in opinion, in this particular, with\r\na writer whom the celebrated Junius pronounces to be “deep, solid, and\r\ningenious,” that “the executive power is more easily confined when it\r\nis ONE”;[2] that it is far more safe there should be a single object\r\nfor the jealousy and watchfulness of the people; and, in a word, that\r\nall multiplication of the Executive is rather dangerous than friendly\r\nto liberty.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will satisfy us, that the species of security\r\nsought for in the multiplication of the Executive, is nattainable.\r\nNumbers must be so great as to render combination difficult, or they\r\nare rather a source of danger than of security. The united credit and\r\ninfluence of several individuals must be more formidable to liberty,\r\nthan the credit and influence of either of them separately. When power,\r\ntherefore, is placed in the hands of so small a number of men, as to\r\nadmit of their interests and views being easily combined in a common\r\nenterprise, by an artful leader, it becomes more liable to abuse, and\r\nmore dangerous when abused, than if it be lodged in the hands of one\r\nman; who, from the very circumstance of his being alone, will be more\r\nnarrowly watched and more readily suspected, and who cannot unite so\r\ngreat a mass of influence as when he is associated with others. The\r\nDecemvirs of Rome, whose name denotes their number,[3] were more to be\r\ndreaded in their usurpation than any ONE of them would have been. No\r\nperson would think of proposing an Executive much more numerous than\r\nthat body; from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of\r\nthe council. The extreme of these numbers, is not too great for an easy\r\ncombination; and from such a combination America would have more to\r\nfear, than from the ambition of any single individual. A council to a\r\nmagistrate, who is himself responsible for what he does, are generally\r\nnothing better than a clog upon his good intentions, are often the\r\ninstruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost always a cloak to\r\nhis faults.\r\n\r\nI forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense; though it be evident\r\nthat if the council should be numerous enough to answer the principal\r\nend aimed at by the institution, the salaries of the members, who must\r\nbe drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of government, would\r\nform an item in the catalogue of public expenditures too serious to be\r\nincurred for an object of equivocal utility. I will only add that,\r\nprior to the appearance of the Constitution, I rarely met with an\r\nintelligent man from any of the States, who did not admit, as the\r\nresult of experience, that the UNITY of the executive of this State was\r\none of the best of the distinguishing features of our constitution.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] New York has no council except for the single purpose of\r\n appointing to offices; New Jersey has a council whom the governor may\r\n consult. But I think, from the terms of the constitution, their\r\n resolutions do not bind him.\r\n\r\n [2] De Lolme.\r\n\r\n [3] Ten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXI.\r\n\r\nThe Duration in Office of the Executive\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 18, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nDuration in office has been mentioned as the second requisite to the\r\nenergy of the Executive authority. This has relation to two objects: to\r\nthe personal firmness of the executive magistrate, in the employment of\r\nhis constitutional powers; and to the stability of the system of\r\nadministration which may have been adopted under his auspices. With\r\nregard to the first, it must be evident, that the longer the duration\r\nin office, the greater will be the probability of obtaining so\r\nimportant an advantage. It is a general principle of human nature, that\r\na man will be interested in whatever he possesses, in proportion to the\r\nfirmness or precariousness of the tenure by which he holds it; will be\r\nless attached to what he holds by a momentary or uncertain title, than\r\nto what he enjoys by a durable or certain title; and, of course, will\r\nbe willing to risk more for the sake of the one, than for the sake of\r\nthe other. This remark is not less applicable to a political privilege,\r\nor honor, or trust, than to any article of ordinary property. The\r\ninference from it is, that a man acting in the capacity of chief\r\nmagistrate, under a consciousness that in a very short time he MUST lay\r\ndown his office, will be apt to feel himself too little interested in\r\nit to hazard any material censure or perplexity, from the independent\r\nexertion of his powers, or from encountering the ill-humors, however\r\ntransient, which may happen to prevail, either in a considerable part\r\nof the society itself, or even in a predominant faction in the\r\nlegislative body. If the case should only be, that he MIGHT lay it\r\ndown, unless continued by a new choice, and if he should be desirous of\r\nbeing continued, his wishes, conspiring with his fears, would tend\r\nstill more powerfully to corrupt his integrity, or debase his\r\nfortitude. In either case, feebleness and irresolution must be the\r\ncharacteristics of the station.\r\n\r\nThere are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of\r\nthe Executive to a prevailing current, either in the community or in\r\nthe legislature, as its best recommendation. But such men entertain\r\nvery crude notions, as well of the purposes for which government was\r\ninstituted, as of the true means by which the public happiness may be\r\npromoted. The republican principle demands that the deliberate sense of\r\nthe community should govern the conduct of those to whom they intrust\r\nthe management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified\r\ncomplaisance to every sudden breeze of passion, or to every transient\r\nimpulse which the people may receive from the arts of men, who flatter\r\ntheir prejudices to betray their interests. It is a just observation,\r\nthat the people commonly INTEND the PUBLIC GOOD. This often applies to\r\ntheir very errors. But their good sense would despise the adulator who\r\nshould pretend that they always REASON RIGHT about the MEANS of\r\npromoting it. They know from experience that they sometimes err; and\r\nthe wonder is that they so seldom err as they do, beset, as they\r\ncontinually are, by the wiles of parasites and sycophants, by the\r\nsnares of the ambitious, the avaricious, the desperate, by the\r\nartifices of men who possess their confidence more than they deserve\r\nit, and of those who seek to possess rather than to deserve it. When\r\noccasions present themselves, in which the interests of the people are\r\nat variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of the persons whom\r\nthey have appointed to be the guardians of those interests, to\r\nwithstand the temporary delusion, in order to give them time and\r\nopportunity for more cool and sedate reflection. Instances might be\r\ncited in which a conduct of this kind has saved the people from very\r\nfatal consequences of their own mistakes, and has procured lasting\r\nmonuments of their gratitude to the men who had courage and magnanimity\r\nenough to serve them at the peril of their displeasure.\r\n\r\nBut however inclined we might be to insist upon an unbounded\r\ncomplaisance in the Executive to the inclinations of the people, we can\r\nwith no propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors of the\r\nlegislature. The latter may sometimes stand in opposition to the\r\nformer, and at other times the people may be entirely neutral. In\r\neither supposition, it is certainly desirable that the Executive should\r\nbe in a situation to dare to act his own opinion with vigor and\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nThe same rule which teaches the propriety of a partition between the\r\nvarious branches of power, teaches us likewise that this partition\r\nought to be so contrived as to render the one independent of the other.\r\nTo what purpose separate the executive or the judiciary from the\r\nlegislative, if both the executive and the judiciary are so constituted\r\nas to be at the absolute devotion of the legislative? Such a separation\r\nmust be merely nominal, and incapable of producing the ends for which\r\nit was established. It is one thing to be subordinate to the laws, and\r\nanother to be dependent on the legislative body. The first comports\r\nwith, the last violates, the fundamental principles of good government;\r\nand, whatever may be the forms of the Constitution, unites all power in\r\nthe same hands. The tendency of the legislative authority to absorb\r\nevery other, has been fully displayed and illustrated by examples in\r\nsome preceding numbers. In governments purely republican, this tendency\r\nis almost irresistible. The representatives of the people, in a popular\r\nassembly, seem sometimes to fancy that they are the people themselves,\r\nand betray strong symptoms of impatience and disgust at the least sign\r\nof opposition from any other quarter; as if the exercise of its rights,\r\nby either the executive or judiciary, were a breach of their privilege\r\nand an outrage to their dignity. They often appear disposed to exert an\r\nimperious control over the other departments; and as they commonly have\r\nthe people on their side, they always act with such momentum as to make\r\nit very difficult for the other members of the government to maintain\r\nthe balance of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in office\r\ncan affect the independence of the Executive on the legislature, unless\r\nthe one were possessed of the power of appointing or displacing the\r\nother. One answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle\r\nalready remarked that is, from the slender interest a man is apt to\r\ntake in a short-lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords\r\nhim to expose himself, on account of it, to any considerable\r\ninconvenience or hazard. Another answer, perhaps more obvious, though\r\nnot more conclusive, will result from the consideration of the\r\ninfluence of the legislative body over the people; which might be\r\nemployed to prevent the re-election of a man who, by an upright\r\nresistance to any sinister project of that body, should have made\r\nhimself obnoxious to its resentment.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked also, whether a duration of four years would answer the\r\nend proposed; and if it would not, whether a less period, which would\r\nat least be recommended by greater security against ambitious designs,\r\nwould not, for that reason, be preferable to a longer period, which\r\nwas, at the same time, too short for the purpose of inspiring the\r\ndesired firmness and independence of the magistrate.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be affirmed, that a duration of four years, or any other\r\nlimited duration, would completely answer the end proposed; but it\r\nwould contribute towards it in a degree which would have a material\r\ninfluence upon the spirit and character of the government. Between the\r\ncommencement and termination of such a period, there would always be a\r\nconsiderable interval, in which the prospect of annihilation would be\r\nsufficiently remote, not to have an improper effect upon the conduct of\r\na man indued with a tolerable portion of fortitude; and in which he\r\nmight reasonably promise himself, that there would be time enough\r\nbefore it arrived, to make the community sensible of the propriety of\r\nthe measures he might incline to pursue. Though it be probable that, as\r\nhe approached the moment when the public were, by a new election, to\r\nsignify their sense of his conduct, his confidence, and with it his\r\nfirmness, would decline; yet both the one and the other would derive\r\nsupport from the opportunities which his previous continuance in the\r\nstation had afforded him, of establishing himself in the esteem and\r\ngood-will of his constituents. He might, then, hazard with safety, in\r\nproportion to the proofs he had given of his wisdom and integrity, and\r\nto the title he had acquired to the respect and attachment of his\r\nfellow-citizens. As, on the one hand, a duration of four years will\r\ncontribute to the firmness of the Executive in a sufficient degree to\r\nrender it a very valuable ingredient in the composition; so, on the\r\nother, it is not enough to justify any alarm for the public liberty. If\r\na British House of Commons, from the most feeble beginnings, FROM THE\r\nMERE POWER OF ASSENTING OR DISAGREEING TO THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW TAX,\r\nhave, by rapid strides, reduced the prerogatives of the crown and the\r\nprivileges of the nobility within the limits they conceived to be\r\ncompatible with the principles of a free government, while they raised\r\nthemselves to the rank and consequence of a coequal branch of the\r\nlegislature; if they have been able, in one instance, to abolish both\r\nthe royalty and the aristocracy, and to overturn all the ancient\r\nestablishments, as well in the Church as State; if they have been able,\r\non a recent occasion, to make the monarch tremble at the prospect of an\r\ninnovation[1] attempted by them, what would be to be feared from an\r\nelective magistrate of four years’ duration, with the confined\r\nauthorities of a President of the United States? What, but that he\r\nmight be unequal to the task which the Constitution assigns him? I\r\nshall only add, that if his duration be such as to leave a doubt of his\r\nfirmness, that doubt is inconsistent with a jealousy of his\r\nencroachments.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] This was the case with respect to Mr. Fox’s India bill, which was\r\n carried in the House of Commons, and rejected in the House of Lords,\r\n to the entire satisfaction, as it is said, of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXII.\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued, and Re-Eligibility of the Executive\r\nConsidered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, March 21, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe administration of government, in its largest sense, comprehends all\r\nthe operations of the body politic, whether legislative, executive, or\r\njudiciary; but in its most usual, and perhaps its most precise\r\nsignification. It is limited to executive details, and falls peculiarly\r\nwithin the province of the executive department. The actual conduct of\r\nforeign negotiations, the preparatory plans of finance, the application\r\nand disbursement of the public moneys in conformity to the general\r\nappropriations of the legislature, the arrangement of the army and\r\nnavy, the directions of the operations of war, these, and other matters\r\nof a like nature, constitute what seems to be most properly understood\r\nby the administration of government. The persons, therefore, to whose\r\nimmediate management these different matters are committed, ought to be\r\nconsidered as the assistants or deputies of the chief magistrate, and\r\non this account, they ought to derive their offices from his\r\nappointment, at least from his nomination, and ought to be subject to\r\nhis superintendence. This view of the subject will at once suggest to\r\nus the intimate connection between the duration of the executive\r\nmagistrate in office and the stability of the system of administration.\r\nTo reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often\r\nconsidered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own\r\ncapacity and desert; and in addition to this propensity, where the\r\nalteration has been the result of public choice, the person substituted\r\nis warranted in supposing that the dismission of his predecessor has\r\nproceeded from a dislike to his measures; and that the less he\r\nresembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his\r\nconstituents. These considerations, and the influence of personal\r\nconfidences and attachments, would be likely to induce every new\r\nPresident to promote a change of men to fill the subordinate stations;\r\nand these causes together could not fail to occasion a disgraceful and\r\nruinous mutability in the administration of the government.\r\n\r\nWith a positive duration of considerable extent, I connect the\r\ncircumstance of re-eligibility. The first is necessary to give to the\r\nofficer himself the inclination and the resolution to act his part\r\nwell, and to the community time and leisure to observe the tendency of\r\nhis measures, and thence to form an experimental estimate of their\r\nmerits. The last is necessary to enable the people, when they see\r\nreason to approve of his conduct, to continue him in his station, in\r\norder to prolong the utility of his talents and virtues, and to secure\r\nto the government the advantage of permanency in a wise system of\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nNothing appears more plausible at first sight, nor more ill-founded\r\nupon close inspection, than a scheme which in relation to the present\r\npoint has had some respectable advocates, I mean that of continuing the\r\nchief magistrate in office for a certain time, and then excluding him\r\nfrom it, either for a limited period or forever after. This exclusion,\r\nwhether temporary or perpetual, would have nearly the same effects, and\r\nthese effects would be for the most part rather pernicious than\r\nsalutary.\r\n\r\nOne ill effect of the exclusion would be a diminution of the\r\ninducements to good behavior. There are few men who would not feel much\r\nless zeal in the discharge of a duty when they were conscious that the\r\nadvantages of the station with which it was connected must be\r\nrelinquished at a determinate period, than when they were permitted to\r\nentertain a hope of OBTAINING, by MERITING, a continuance of them. This\r\nposition will not be disputed so long as it is admitted that the desire\r\nof reward is one of the strongest incentives of human conduct; or that\r\nthe best security for the fidelity of mankind is to make their\r\ninterests coincide with their duty. Even the love of fame, the ruling\r\npassion of the noblest minds, which would prompt a man to plan and\r\nundertake extensive and arduous enterprises for the public benefit,\r\nrequiring considerable time to mature and perfect them, if he could\r\nflatter himself with the prospect of being allowed to finish what he\r\nhad begun, would, on the contrary, deter him from the undertaking, when\r\nhe foresaw that he must quit the scene before he could accomplish the\r\nwork, and must commit that, together with his own reputation, to hands\r\nwhich might be unequal or unfriendly to the task. The most to be\r\nexpected from the generality of men, in such a situation, is the\r\nnegative merit of not doing harm, instead of the positive merit of\r\ndoing good.\r\n\r\nAnother ill effect of the exclusion would be the temptation to sordid\r\nviews, to peculation, and, in some instances, to usurpation. An\r\navaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking forward to\r\na time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed,\r\nwould feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by such a man, to make\r\nthe best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it lasted, and might\r\nnot scruple to have recourse to the most corrupt expedients to make the\r\nharvest as abundant as it was transitory; though the same man,\r\nprobably, with a different prospect before him, might content himself\r\nwith the regular perquisites of his situation, and might even be\r\nunwilling to risk the consequences of an abuse of his opportunities.\r\nHis avarice might be a guard upon his avarice. Add to this that the\r\nsame man might be vain or ambitious, as well as avaricious. And if he\r\ncould expect to prolong his honors by his good conduct, he might\r\nhesitate to sacrifice his appetite for them to his appetite for gain.\r\nBut with the prospect before him of approaching an inevitable\r\nannihilation, his avarice would be likely to get the victory over his\r\ncaution, his vanity, or his ambition.\r\n\r\nAn ambitious man, too, when he found himself seated on the summit of\r\nhis country’s honors, when he looked forward to the time at which he\r\nmust descend from the exalted eminence for ever, and reflected that no\r\nexertion of merit on his part could save him from the unwelcome\r\nreverse; such a man, in such a situation, would be much more violently\r\ntempted to embrace a favorable conjuncture for attempting the\r\nprolongation of his power, at every personal hazard, than if he had the\r\nprobability of answering the same end by doing his duty.\r\n\r\nWould it promote the peace of the community, or the stability of the\r\ngovernment to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to be\r\nraised to the seat of the supreme magistracy, wandering among the\r\npeople like discontented ghosts, and sighing for a place which they\r\nwere destined never more to possess?\r\n\r\nA third ill effect of the exclusion would be, the depriving the\r\ncommunity of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief\r\nmagistrate in the exercise of his office. That experience is the parent\r\nof wisdom, is an adage the truth of which is recognized by the wisest\r\nas well as the simplest of mankind. What more desirable or more\r\nessential than this quality in the governors of nations? Where more\r\ndesirable or more essential than in the first magistrate of a nation?\r\nCan it be wise to put this desirable and essential quality under the\r\nban of the Constitution, and to declare that the moment it is acquired,\r\nits possessor shall be compelled to abandon the station in which it was\r\nacquired, and to which it is adapted? This, nevertheless, is the\r\nprecise import of all those regulations which exclude men from serving\r\ntheir country, by the choice of their fellowcitizens, after they have\r\nby a course of service fitted themselves for doing it with a greater\r\ndegree of utility.\r\n\r\nA fourth ill effect of the exclusion would be the banishing men from\r\nstations in which, in certain emergencies of the state, their presence\r\nmight be of the greatest moment to the public interest or safety. There\r\nis no nation which has not, at one period or another, experienced an\r\nabsolute necessity of the services of particular men in particular\r\nsituations; perhaps it would not be too strong to say, to the\r\npreservation of its political existence. How unwise, therefore, must be\r\nevery such self-denying ordinance as serves to prohibit a nation from\r\nmaking use of its own citizens in the manner best suited to its\r\nexigencies and circumstances! Without supposing the personal\r\nessentiality of the man, it is evident that a change of the chief\r\nmagistrate, at the breaking out of a war, or at any similar crisis, for\r\nanother, even of equal merit, would at all times be detrimental to the\r\ncommunity, inasmuch as it would substitute inexperience to experience,\r\nand would tend to unhinge and set afloat the already settled train of\r\nthe administration.\r\n\r\nA fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be, that it would operate as\r\na constitutional interdiction of stability in the administration. By\r\nNECESSITATING a change of men, in the first office of the nation, it\r\nwould necessitate a mutability of measures. It is not generally to be\r\nexpected, that men will vary and measures remain uniform. The contrary\r\nis the usual course of things. And we need not be apprehensive that\r\nthere will be too much stability, while there is even the option of\r\nchanging; nor need we desire to prohibit the people from continuing\r\ntheir confidence where they think it may be safely placed, and where,\r\nby constancy on their part, they may obviate the fatal inconveniences\r\nof fluctuating councils and a variable policy.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the disadvantages which would flow from the principle\r\nof exclusion. They apply most forcibly to the scheme of a perpetual\r\nexclusion; but when we consider that even a partial exclusion would\r\nalways render the readmission of the person a remote and precarious\r\nobject, the observations which have been made will apply nearly as\r\nfully to one case as to the other.\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages promised to counterbalance these disadvantages?\r\nThey are represented to be: 1st, greater independence in the\r\nmagistrate; 2d, greater security to the people. Unless the exclusion be\r\nperpetual, there will be no pretense to infer the first advantage. But\r\neven in that case, may he have no object beyond his present station, to\r\nwhich he may sacrifice his independence? May he have no connections, no\r\nfriends, for whom he may sacrifice it? May he not be less willing by a\r\nfirm conduct, to make personal enemies, when he acts under the\r\nimpression that a time is fast approaching, on the arrival of which he\r\nnot only MAY, but MUST, be exposed to their resentments, upon an equal,\r\nperhaps upon an inferior, footing? It is not an easy point to determine\r\nwhether his independence would be most promoted or impaired by such an\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nAs to the second supposed advantage, there is still greater reason to\r\nentertain doubts concerning it. If the exclusion were to be perpetual,\r\na man of irregular ambition, of whom alone there could be reason in any\r\ncase to entertain apprehension, would, with infinite reluctance, yield\r\nto the necessity of taking his leave forever of a post in which his\r\npassion for power and pre-eminence had acquired the force of habit. And\r\nif he had been fortunate or adroit enough to conciliate the good-will\r\nof the people, he might induce them to consider as a very odious and\r\nunjustifiable restraint upon themselves, a provision which was\r\ncalculated to debar them of the right of giving a fresh proof of their\r\nattachment to a favorite. There may be conceived circumstances in which\r\nthis disgust of the people, seconding the thwarted ambition of such a\r\nfavorite, might occasion greater danger to liberty, than could ever\r\nreasonably be dreaded from the possibility of a perpetuation in office,\r\nby the voluntary suffrages of the community, exercising a\r\nconstitutional privilege.\r\n\r\nThere is an excess of refinement in the idea of disabling the people to\r\ncontinue in office men who had entitled themselves, in their opinion,\r\nto approbation and confidence; the advantages of which are at best\r\nspeculative and equivocal, and are overbalanced by disadvantages far\r\nmore certain and decisive.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Provision For The Support of the Executive, and the Veto Power\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, March 21, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe third ingredient towards constituting the vigor of the executive\r\nauthority, is an adequate provision for its support. It is evident\r\nthat, without proper attention to this article, the separation of the\r\nexecutive from the legislative department would be merely nominal and\r\nnugatory. The legislature, with a discretionary power over the salary\r\nand emoluments of the Chief Magistrate, could render him as obsequious\r\nto their will as they might think proper to make him. They might, in\r\nmost cases, either reduce him by famine, or tempt him by largesses, to\r\nsurrender at discretion his judgment to their inclinations. These\r\nexpressions, taken in all the latitude of the terms, would no doubt\r\nconvey more than is intended. There are men who could neither be\r\ndistressed nor won into a sacrifice of their duty; but this stern\r\nvirtue is the growth of few soils; and in the main it will be found\r\nthat a power over a man’s support is a power over his will. If it were\r\nnecessary to confirm so plain a truth by facts, examples would not be\r\nwanting, even in this country, of the intimidation or seduction of the\r\nExecutive by the terrors or allurements of the pecuniary arrangements\r\nof the legislative body.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy, therefore, to commend too highly the judicious\r\nattention which has been paid to this subject in the proposed\r\nConstitution. It is there provided that “The President of the United\r\nStates shall, at stated times, receive for his services a compensation\r\nWHICH SHALL NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED DURING THE PERIOD FOR\r\nWHICH HE SHALL HAVE BEEN ELECTED; and he SHALL NOT RECEIVE WITHIN THAT\r\nPERIOD ANY OTHER EMOLUMENT from the United States, or any of them.” It\r\nis impossible to imagine any provision which would have been more\r\neligible than this. The legislature, on the appointment of a President,\r\nis once for all to declare what shall be the compensation for his\r\nservices during the time for which he shall have been elected. This\r\ndone, they will have no power to alter it, either by increase or\r\ndiminution, till a new period of service by a new election commences.\r\nThey can neither weaken his fortitude by operating on his necessities,\r\nnor corrupt his integrity by appealing to his avarice. Neither the\r\nUnion, nor any of its members, will be at liberty to give, nor will he\r\nbe at liberty to receive, any other emolument than that which may have\r\nbeen determined by the first act. He can, of course, have no pecuniary\r\ninducement to renounce or desert the independence intended for him by\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe last of the requisites to energy, which have been enumerated, are\r\ncompetent powers. Let us proceed to consider those which are proposed\r\nto be vested in the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that offers itself to our observation, is the qualified\r\nnegative of the President upon the acts or resolutions of the two\r\nhouses of the legislature; or, in other words, his power of returning\r\nall bills with objections, to have the effect of preventing their\r\nbecoming laws, unless they should afterwards be ratified by two thirds\r\nof each of the component members of the legislative body.\r\n\r\nThe propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the\r\nrights, and to absorb the powers, of the other departments, has been\r\nalready suggested and repeated; the insufficiency of a mere parchment\r\ndelineation of the boundaries of each, has also been remarked upon; and\r\nthe necessity of furnishing each with constitutional arms for its own\r\ndefense, has been inferred and proved. From these clear and indubitable\r\nprinciples results the propriety of a negative, either absolute or\r\nqualified, in the Executive, upon the acts of the legislative branches.\r\nWithout the one or the other, the former would be absolutely unable to\r\ndefend himself against the depredations of the latter. He might\r\ngradually be stripped of his authorities by successive resolutions, or\r\nannihilated by a single vote. And in the one mode or the other, the\r\nlegislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended in\r\nthe same hands. If even no propensity had ever discovered itself in the\r\nlegislative body to invade the rights of the Executive, the rules of\r\njust reasoning and theoretic propriety would of themselves teach us,\r\nthat the one ought not to be left to the mercy of the other, but ought\r\nto possess a constitutional and effectual power of selfdefense.\r\n\r\nBut the power in question has a further use. It not only serves as a\r\nshield to the Executive, but it furnishes an additional security\r\nagainst the enaction of improper laws. It establishes a salutary check\r\nupon the legislative body, calculated to guard the community against\r\nthe effects of faction, precipitancy, or of any impulse unfriendly to\r\nthe public good, which may happen to influence a majority of that body.\r\n\r\nThe propriety of a negative has, upon some occasions, been combated by\r\nan observation, that it was not to be presumed a single man would\r\npossess more virtue and wisdom than a number of men; and that unless\r\nthis presumption should be entertained, it would be improper to give\r\nthe executive magistrate any species of control over the legislative\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nBut this observation, when examined, will appear rather specious than\r\nsolid. The propriety of the thing does not turn upon the supposition of\r\nsuperior wisdom or virtue in the Executive, but upon the supposition\r\nthat the legislature will not be infallible; that the love of power may\r\nsometimes betray it into a disposition to encroach upon the rights of\r\nother members of the government; that a spirit of faction may sometimes\r\npervert its deliberations; that impressions of the moment may sometimes\r\nhurry it into measures which itself, on maturer reflexion, would\r\ncondemn. The primary inducement to conferring the power in question\r\nupon the Executive is, to enable him to defend himself; the secondary\r\none is to increase the chances in favor of the community against the\r\npassing of bad laws, through haste, inadvertence, or design. The\r\noftener the measure is brought under examination, the greater the\r\ndiversity in the situations of those who are to examine it, the less\r\nmust be the danger of those errors which flow from want of due\r\ndeliberation, or of those missteps which proceed from the contagion of\r\nsome common passion or interest. It is far less probable, that culpable\r\nviews of any kind should infect all the parts of the government at the\r\nsame moment and in relation to the same object, than that they should\r\nby turns govern and mislead every one of them.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws includes\r\nthat of preventing good ones; and may be used to the one purpose as\r\nwell as to the other. But this objection will have little weight with\r\nthose who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that inconstancy and\r\nmutability in the laws, which form the greatest blemish in the\r\ncharacter and genius of our governments. They will consider every\r\ninstitution calculated to restrain the excess of law-making, and to\r\nkeep things in the same state in which they happen to be at any given\r\nperiod, as much more likely to do good than harm; because it is\r\nfavorable to greater stability in the system of legislation. The injury\r\nwhich may possibly be done by defeating a few good laws, will be amply\r\ncompensated by the advantage of preventing a number of bad ones.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. The superior weight and influence of the legislative\r\nbody in a free government, and the hazard to the Executive in a trial\r\nof strength with that body, afford a satisfactory security that the\r\nnegative would generally be employed with great caution; and there\r\nwould oftener be room for a charge of timidity than of rashness in the\r\nexercise of it. A king of Great Britain, with all his train of\r\nsovereign attributes, and with all the influence he draws from a\r\nthousand sources, would, at this day, hesitate to put a negative upon\r\nthe joint resolutions of the two houses of Parliament. He would not\r\nfail to exert the utmost resources of that influence to strangle a\r\nmeasure disagreeable to him, in its progress to the throne, to avoid\r\nbeing reduced to the dilemma of permitting it to take effect, or of\r\nrisking the displeasure of the nation by an opposition to the sense of\r\nthe legislative body. Nor is it probable, that he would ultimately\r\nventure to exert his prerogatives, but in a case of manifest propriety,\r\nor extreme necessity. All well-informed men in that kingdom will accede\r\nto the justness of this remark. A very considerable period has elapsed\r\nsince the negative of the crown has been exercised.\r\n\r\nIf a magistrate so powerful and so well fortified as a British monarch,\r\nwould have scruples about the exercise of the power under\r\nconsideration, how much greater caution may be reasonably expected in a\r\nPresident of the United States, clothed for the short period of four\r\nyears with the executive authority of a government wholly and purely\r\nrepublican?\r\n\r\nIt is evident that there would be greater danger of his not using his\r\npower when necessary, than of his using it too often, or too much. An\r\nargument, indeed, against its expediency, has been drawn from this very\r\nsource. It has been represented, on this account, as a power odious in\r\nappearance, useless in practice. But it will not follow, that because\r\nit might be rarely exercised, it would never be exercised. In the case\r\nfor which it is chiefly designed, that of an immediate attack upon the\r\nconstitutional rights of the Executive, or in a case in which the\r\npublic good was evidently and palpably sacrificed, a man of tolerable\r\nfirmness would avail himself of his constitutional means of defense,\r\nand would listen to the admonitions of duty and responsibility. In the\r\nformer supposition, his fortitude would be stimulated by his immediate\r\ninterest in the power of his office; in the latter, by the probability\r\nof the sanction of his constituents, who, though they would naturally\r\nincline to the legislative body in a doubtful case, would hardly suffer\r\ntheir partiality to delude them in a very plain case. I speak now with\r\nan eye to a magistrate possessing only a common share of firmness.\r\nThere are men who, under any circumstances, will have the courage to do\r\ntheir duty at every hazard.\r\n\r\nBut the convention have pursued a mean in this business, which will\r\nboth facilitate the exercise of the power vested in this respect in the\r\nexecutive magistrate, and make its efficacy to depend on the sense of a\r\nconsiderable part of the legislative body. Instead of an absolute\r\nnegative, it is proposed to give the Executive the qualified negative\r\nalready described. This is a power which would be much more readily\r\nexercised than the other. A man who might be afraid to defeat a law by\r\nhis single VETO, might not scruple to return it for reconsideration;\r\nsubject to being finally rejected only in the event of more than one\r\nthird of each house concurring in the sufficiency of his objections. He\r\nwould be encouraged by the reflection, that if his opposition should\r\nprevail, it would embark in it a very respectable proportion of the\r\nlegislative body, whose influence would be united with his in\r\nsupporting the propriety of his conduct in the public opinion. A direct\r\nand categorical negative has something in the appearance of it more\r\nharsh, and more apt to irritate, than the mere suggestion of\r\nargumentative objections to be approved or disapproved by those to whom\r\nthey are addressed. In proportion as it would be less apt to offend, it\r\nwould be more apt to be exercised; and for this very reason, it may in\r\npractice be found more effectual. It is to be hoped that it will not\r\noften happen that improper views will govern so large a proportion as\r\ntwo thirds of both branches of the legislature at the same time; and\r\nthis, too, in spite of the counterposing weight of the Executive. It is\r\nat any rate far less probable that this should be the case, than that\r\nsuch views should taint the resolutions and conduct of a bare majority.\r\nA power of this nature in the Executive, will often have a silent and\r\nunperceived, though forcible, operation. When men, engaged in\r\nunjustifiable pursuits, are aware that obstructions may come from a\r\nquarter which they cannot control, they will often be restrained by the\r\nbare apprehension of opposition, from doing what they would with\r\neagerness rush into, if no such external impediments were to be feared.\r\n\r\nThis qualified negative, as has been elsewhere remarked, is in this\r\nState vested in a council, consisting of the governor, with the\r\nchancellor and judges of the Supreme Court, or any two of them. It has\r\nbeen freely employed upon a variety of occasions, and frequently with\r\nsuccess. And its utility has become so apparent, that persons who, in\r\ncompiling the Constitution, were violent opposers of it, have from\r\nexperience become its declared admirers.[1]\r\n\r\nI have in another place remarked, that the convention, in the formation\r\nof this part of their plan, had departed from the model of the\r\nconstitution of this State, in favor of that of Massachusetts. Two\r\nstrong reasons may be imagined for this preference. One is that the\r\njudges, who are to be the interpreters of the law, might receive an\r\nimproper bias, from having given a previous opinion in their\r\nrevisionary capacities; the other is that by being often associated\r\nwith the Executive, they might be induced to embark too far in the\r\npolitical views of that magistrate, and thus a dangerous combination\r\nmight by degrees be cemented between the executive and judiciary\r\ndepartments. It is impossible to keep the judges too distinct from\r\nevery other avocation than that of expounding the laws. It is\r\npeculiarly dangerous to place them in a situation to be either\r\ncorrupted or influenced by the Executive.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] Mr. Abraham Yates, a warm opponent of the plan of the convention\r\n is of this number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Command of the Military and Naval Forces, and the Pardoning Power\r\nof the Executive\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 25, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States is to be “commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several\r\nStates WHEN CALLED INTO THE ACTUAL SERVICE of the United States.” The\r\npropriety of this provision is so evident in itself, and it is, at the\r\nsame time, so consonant to the precedents of the State constitutions in\r\ngeneral, that little need be said to explain or enforce it. Even those\r\nof them which have, in other respects, coupled the chief magistrate\r\nwith a council, have for the most part concentrated the military\r\nauthority in him alone. Of all the cares or concerns of government, the\r\ndirection of war most peculiarly demands those qualities which\r\ndistinguish the exercise of power by a single hand. The direction of\r\nwar implies the direction of the common strength; and the power of\r\ndirecting and employing the common strength, forms a usual and\r\nessential part in the definition of the executive authority.\r\n\r\n“The President may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal\r\nofficer in each of the executive departments, upon any subject relating\r\nto the duties of their respective officers.” This I consider as a mere\r\nredundancy in the plan, as the right for which it provides would result\r\nof itself from the office.\r\n\r\nHe is also to be authorized to grant “reprieves and pardons for\r\noffenses against the United States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT.”\r\nHumanity and good policy conspire to dictate, that the benign\r\nprerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible fettered or\r\nembarrassed. The criminal code of every country partakes so much of\r\nnecessary severity, that without an easy access to exceptions in favor\r\nof unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary\r\nand cruel. As the sense of responsibility is always strongest, in\r\nproportion as it is undivided, it may be inferred that a single man\r\nwould be most ready to attend to the force of those motives which might\r\nplead for a mitigation of the rigor of the law, and least apt to yield\r\nto considerations which were calculated to shelter a fit object of its\r\nvengeance. The reflection that the fate of a fellow-creature depended\r\non his sole fiat, would naturally inspire scrupulousness and caution;\r\nthe dread of being accused of weakness or connivance, would beget equal\r\ncircumspection, though of a different kind. On the other hand, as men\r\ngenerally derive confidence from their numbers, they might often\r\nencourage each other in an act of obduracy, and might be less sensible\r\nto the apprehension of suspicion or censure for an injudicious or\r\naffected clemency. On these accounts, one man appears to be a more\r\neligible dispenser of the mercy of government, than a body of men.\r\n\r\nThe expediency of vesting the power of pardoning in the President has,\r\nif I mistake not, been only contested in relation to the crime of\r\ntreason. This, it has been urged, ought to have depended upon the\r\nassent of one, or both, of the branches of the legislative body. I\r\nshall not deny that there are strong reasons to be assigned for\r\nrequiring in this particular the concurrence of that body, or of a part\r\nof it. As treason is a crime levelled at the immediate being of the\r\nsociety, when the laws have once ascertained the guilt of the offender,\r\nthere seems a fitness in referring the expediency of an act of mercy\r\ntowards him to the judgment of the legislature. And this ought the\r\nrather to be the case, as the supposition of the connivance of the\r\nChief Magistrate ought not to be entirely excluded. But there are also\r\nstrong objections to such a plan. It is not to be doubted, that a\r\nsingle man of prudence and good sense is better fitted, in delicate\r\nconjunctures, to balance the motives which may plead for and against\r\nthe remission of the punishment, than any numerous body whatever. It\r\ndeserves particular attention, that treason will often be connected\r\nwith seditions which embrace a large proportion of the community; as\r\nlately happened in Massachusetts. In every such case, we might expect\r\nto see the representation of the people tainted with the same spirit\r\nwhich had given birth to the offense. And when parties were pretty\r\nequally matched, the secret sympathy of the friends and favorers of the\r\ncondemned person, availing itself of the good-nature and weakness of\r\nothers, might frequently bestow impunity where the terror of an example\r\nwas necessary. On the other hand, when the sedition had proceeded from\r\ncauses which had inflamed the resentments of the major party, they\r\nmight often be found obstinate and inexorable, when policy demanded a\r\nconduct of forbearance and clemency. But the principal argument for\r\nreposing the power of pardoning in this case to the Chief Magistrate is\r\nthis: in seasons of insurrection or rebellion, there are often critical\r\nmoments, when a welltimed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels\r\nmay restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth; and which, if\r\nsuffered to pass unimproved, it may never be possible afterwards to\r\nrecall. The dilatory process of convening the legislature, or one of\r\nits branches, for the purpose of obtaining its sanction to the measure,\r\nwould frequently be the occasion of letting slip the golden\r\nopportunity. The loss of a week, a day, an hour, may sometimes be\r\nfatal. If it should be observed, that a discretionary power, with a\r\nview to such contingencies, might be occasionally conferred upon the\r\nPresident, it may be answered in the first place, that it is\r\nquestionable, whether, in a limited Constitution, that power could be\r\ndelegated by law; and in the second place, that it would generally be\r\nimpolitic beforehand to take any step which might hold out the prospect\r\nof impunity. A proceeding of this kind, out of the usual course, would\r\nbe likely to be construed into an argument of timidity or of weakness,\r\nand would have a tendency to embolden guilt.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXV.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty-Making Power of the Executive\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe President is to have power, “by and with the advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators\r\npresent concur.”\r\n\r\nThough this provision has been assailed, on different grounds, with no\r\nsmall degree of vehemence, I scruple not to declare my firm persuasion,\r\nthat it is one of the best digested and most unexceptionable parts of\r\nthe plan. One ground of objection is the trite topic of the\r\nintermixture of powers; some contending that the President ought alone\r\nto possess the power of making treaties; others, that it ought to have\r\nbeen exclusively deposited in the Senate. Another source of objection\r\nis derived from the small number of persons by whom a treaty may be\r\nmade. Of those who espouse this objection, a part are of opinion that\r\nthe House of Representatives ought to have been associated in the\r\nbusiness, while another part seem to think that nothing more was\r\nnecessary than to have substituted two thirds of ALL the members of the\r\nSenate, to two thirds of the members PRESENT. As I flatter myself the\r\nobservations made in a preceding number upon this part of the plan must\r\nhave sufficed to place it, to a discerning eye, in a very favorable\r\nlight, I shall here content myself with offering only some\r\nsupplementary remarks, principally with a view to the objections which\r\nhave been just stated.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the intermixture of powers, I shall rely upon the\r\nexplanations already given in other places, of the true sense of the\r\nrule upon which that objection is founded; and shall take it for\r\ngranted, as an inference from them, that the union of the Executive\r\nwith the Senate, in the article of treaties, is no infringement of that\r\nrule. I venture to add, that the particular nature of the power of\r\nmaking treaties indicates a peculiar propriety in that union. Though\r\nseveral writers on the subject of government place that power in the\r\nclass of executive authorities, yet this is evidently an arbitrary\r\ndisposition; for if we attend carefully to its operation, it will be\r\nfound to partake more of the legislative than of the executive\r\ncharacter, though it does not seem strictly to fall within the\r\ndefinition of either of them. The essence of the legislative authority\r\nis to enact laws, or, in other words, to prescribe rules for the\r\nregulation of the society; while the execution of the laws, and the\r\nemployment of the common strength, either for this purpose or for the\r\ncommon defense, seem to comprise all the functions of the executive\r\nmagistrate. The power of making treaties is, plainly, neither the one\r\nnor the other. It relates neither to the execution of the subsisting\r\nlaws, nor to the enaction of new ones; and still less to an exertion of\r\nthe common strength. Its objects are CONTRACTS with foreign nations,\r\nwhich have the force of law, but derive it from the obligations of good\r\nfaith. They are not rules prescribed by the sovereign to the subject,\r\nbut agreements between sovereign and sovereign. The power in question\r\nseems therefore to form a distinct department, and to belong, properly,\r\nneither to the legislative nor to the executive. The qualities\r\nelsewhere detailed as indispensable in the management of foreign\r\nnegotiations, point out the Executive as the most fit agent in those\r\ntransactions; while the vast importance of the trust, and the operation\r\nof treaties as laws, plead strongly for the participation of the whole\r\nor a portion of the legislative body in the office of making them.\r\n\r\nHowever proper or safe it may be in governments where the executive\r\nmagistrate is an hereditary monarch, to commit to him the entire power\r\nof making treaties, it would be utterly unsafe and improper to intrust\r\nthat power to an elective magistrate of four years’ duration. It has\r\nbeen remarked, upon another occasion, and the remark is unquestionably\r\njust, that an hereditary monarch, though often the oppressor of his\r\npeople, has personally too much stake in the government to be in any\r\nmaterial danger of being corrupted by foreign powers. But a man raised\r\nfrom the station of a private citizen to the rank of chief magistrate,\r\npossessed of a moderate or slender fortune, and looking forward to a\r\nperiod not very remote when he may probably be obliged to return to the\r\nstation from which he was taken, might sometimes be under temptations\r\nto sacrifice his duty to his interest, which it would require\r\nsuperlative virtue to withstand. An avaricious man might be tempted to\r\nbetray the interests of the state to the acquisition of wealth. An\r\nambitious man might make his own aggrandizement, by the aid of a\r\nforeign power, the price of his treachery to his constituents. The\r\nhistory of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human\r\nvirtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests of so\r\ndelicate and momentous a kind, as those which concern its intercourse\r\nwith the rest of the world, to the sole disposal of a magistrate\r\ncreated and circumstanced as would be a President of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo have intrusted the power of making treaties to the Senate alone,\r\nwould have been to relinquish the benefits of the constitutional agency\r\nof the President in the conduct of foreign negotiations. It is true\r\nthat the Senate would, in that case, have the option of employing him\r\nin this capacity, but they would also have the option of letting it\r\nalone, and pique or cabal might induce the latter rather than the\r\nformer. Besides this, the ministerial servant of the Senate could not\r\nbe expected to enjoy the confidence and respect of foreign powers in\r\nthe same degree with the constitutional representatives of the nation,\r\nand, of course, would not be able to act with an equal degree of weight\r\nor efficacy. While the Union would, from this cause, lose a\r\nconsiderable advantage in the management of its external concerns, the\r\npeople would lose the additional security which would result from the\r\nco-operation of the Executive. Though it would be imprudent to confide\r\nin him solely so important a trust, yet it cannot be doubted that his\r\nparticipation would materially add to the safety of the society. It\r\nmust indeed be clear to a demonstration that the joint possession of\r\nthe power in question, by the President and Senate, would afford a\r\ngreater prospect of security, than the separate possession of it by\r\neither of them. And whoever has maturely weighed the circumstances\r\nwhich must concur in the appointment of a President, will be satisfied\r\nthat the office will always bid fair to be filled by men of such\r\ncharacters as to render their concurrence in the formation of treaties\r\npeculiarly desirable, as well on the score of wisdom, as on that of\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\nThe remarks made in a former number, which have been alluded to in\r\nanother part of this paper, will apply with conclusive force against\r\nthe admission of the House of Representatives to a share in the\r\nformation of treaties. The fluctuating and, taking its future increase\r\ninto the account, the multitudinous composition of that body, forbid us\r\nto expect in it those qualities which are essential to the proper\r\nexecution of such a trust. Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of\r\nforeign politics; a steady and systematic adherence to the same views;\r\na nice and uniform sensibility to national character; decision,\r\nSECRECY, and despatch, are incompatible with the genius of a body so\r\nvariable and so numerous. The very complication of the business, by\r\nintroducing a necessity of the concurrence of so many different bodies,\r\nwould of itself afford a solid objection. The greater frequency of the\r\ncalls upon the House of Representatives, and the greater length of time\r\nwhich it would often be necessary to keep them together when convened,\r\nto obtain their sanction in the progressive stages of a treaty, would\r\nbe a source of so great inconvenience and expense as alone ought to\r\ncondemn the project.\r\n\r\nThe only objection which remains to be canvassed, is that which would\r\nsubstitute the proportion of two thirds of all the members composing\r\nthe senatorial body, to that of two thirds of the members PRESENT. It\r\nhas been shown, under the second head of our inquiries, that all\r\nprovisions which require more than the majority of any body to its\r\nresolutions, have a direct tendency to embarrass the operations of the\r\ngovernment, and an indirect one to subject the sense of the majority to\r\nthat of the minority. This consideration seems sufficient to determine\r\nour opinion, that the convention have gone as far in the endeavor to\r\nsecure the advantage of numbers in the formation of treaties as could\r\nhave been reconciled either with the activity of the public councils or\r\nwith a reasonable regard to the major sense of the community. If two\r\nthirds of the whole number of members had been required, it would, in\r\nmany cases, from the non-attendance of a part, amount in practice to a\r\nnecessity of unanimity. And the history of every political\r\nestablishment in which this principle has prevailed, is a history of\r\nimpotence, perplexity, and disorder. Proofs of this position might be\r\nadduced from the examples of the Roman Tribuneship, the Polish Diet,\r\nand the States-General of the Netherlands, did not an example at home\r\nrender foreign precedents unnecessary.\r\n\r\nTo require a fixed proportion of the whole body would not, in all\r\nprobability, contribute to the advantages of a numerous agency, better\r\nthen merely to require a proportion of the attending members. The\r\nformer, by making a determinate number at all times requisite to a\r\nresolution, diminishes the motives to punctual attendance. The latter,\r\nby making the capacity of the body to depend on a PROPORTION which may\r\nbe varied by the absence or presence of a single member, has the\r\ncontrary effect. And as, by promoting punctuality, it tends to keep the\r\nbody complete, there is great likelihood that its resolutions would\r\ngenerally be dictated by as great a number in this case as in the\r\nother; while there would be much fewer occasions of delay. It ought not\r\nto be forgotten that, under the existing Confederation, two members\r\nMAY, and usually DO, represent a State; whence it happens that\r\nCongress, who now are solely invested with ALL THE POWERS of the Union,\r\nrarely consist of a greater number of persons than would compose the\r\nintended Senate. If we add to this, that as the members vote by States,\r\nand that where there is only a single member present from a State, his\r\nvote is lost, it will justify a supposition that the active voices in\r\nthe Senate, where the members are to vote individually, would rarely\r\nfall short in number of the active voices in the existing Congress.\r\nWhen, in addition to these considerations, we take into view the\r\nco-operation of the President, we shall not hesitate to infer that the\r\npeople of America would have greater security against an improper use\r\nof the power of making treaties, under the new Constitution, than they\r\nnow enjoy under the Confederation. And when we proceed still one step\r\nfurther, and look forward to the probable augmentation of the Senate,\r\nby the erection of new States, we shall not only perceive ample ground\r\nof confidence in the sufficiency of the members to whose agency that\r\npower will be intrusted, but we shall probably be led to conclude that\r\na body more numerous than the Senate would be likely to become, would\r\nbe very little fit for the proper discharge of the trust.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXVI.\r\n\r\nThe Appointing Power of the Executive\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, April 1, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe President is “to NOMINATE, and, by and with the advice and consent\r\nof the Senate, to appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and\r\nconsuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the\r\nUnited States whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in the\r\nConstitution. But the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such\r\ninferior officers as they think proper, in the President alone, or in\r\nthe courts of law, or in the heads of departments. The President shall\r\nhave power to fill up ALL VACANCIES which may happen DURING THE RECESS\r\nOF THE SENATE, by granting commissions which shall EXPIRE at the end of\r\ntheir next session.”\r\n\r\nIt has been observed in a former paper, that “the true test of a good\r\ngovernment is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good\r\nadministration.” If the justness of this observation be admitted, the\r\nmode of appointing the officers of the United States contained in the\r\nforegoing clauses, must, when examined, be allowed to be entitled to\r\nparticular commendation. It is not easy to conceive a plan better\r\ncalculated than this to promote a judicious choice of men for filling\r\nthe offices of the Union; and it will not need proof, that on this\r\npoint must essentially depend the character of its administration.\r\n\r\nIt will be agreed on all hands, that the power of appointment, in\r\nordinary cases, ought to be modified in one of three ways. It ought\r\neither to be vested in a single man, or in a SELECT assembly of a\r\nmoderate number; or in a single man, with the concurrence of such an\r\nassembly. The exercise of it by the people at large will be readily\r\nadmitted to be impracticable; as waiving every other consideration, it\r\nwould leave them little time to do anything else. When, therefore,\r\nmention is made in the subsequent reasonings of an assembly or body of\r\nmen, what is said must be understood to relate to a select body or\r\nassembly, of the description already given. The people collectively,\r\nfrom their number and from their dispersed situation, cannot be\r\nregulated in their movements by that systematic spirit of cabal and\r\nintrigue, which will be urged as the chief objections to reposing the\r\npower in question in a body of men.\r\n\r\nThose who have themselves reflected upon the subject, or who have\r\nattended to the observations made in other parts of these papers, in\r\nrelation to the appointment of the President, will, I presume, agree to\r\nthe position, that there would always be great probability of having\r\nthe place supplied by a man of abilities, at least respectable.\r\nPremising this, I proceed to lay it down as a rule, that one man of\r\ndiscernment is better fitted to analyze and estimate the peculiar\r\nqualities adapted to particular offices, than a body of men of equal or\r\nperhaps even of superior discernment.\r\n\r\nThe sole and undivided responsibility of one man will naturally beget a\r\nlivelier sense of duty and a more exact regard to reputation. He will,\r\non this account, feel himself under stronger obligations, and more\r\ninterested to investigate with care the qualities requisite to the\r\nstations to be filled, and to prefer with impartiality the persons who\r\nmay have the fairest pretensions to them. He will have FEWER personal\r\nattachments to gratify, than a body of men who may each be supposed to\r\nhave an equal number; and will be so much the less liable to be misled\r\nby the sentiments of friendship and of affection. A single\r\nwell-directed man, by a single understanding, cannot be distracted and\r\nwarped by that diversity of views, feelings, and interests, which\r\nfrequently distract and warp the resolutions of a collective body.\r\nThere is nothing so apt to agitate the passions of mankind as personal\r\nconsiderations whether they relate to ourselves or to others, who are\r\nto be the objects of our choice or preference. Hence, in every exercise\r\nof the power of appointing to offices, by an assembly of men, we must\r\nexpect to see a full display of all the private and party likings and\r\ndislikes, partialities and antipathies, attachments and animosities,\r\nwhich are felt by those who compose the assembly. The choice which may\r\nat any time happen to be made under such circumstances, will of course\r\nbe the result either of a victory gained by one party over the other,\r\nor of a compromise between the parties. In either case, the intrinsic\r\nmerit of the candidate will be too often out of sight. In the first,\r\nthe qualifications best adapted to uniting the suffrages of the party,\r\nwill be more considered than those which fit the person for the\r\nstation. In the last, the coalition will commonly turn upon some\r\ninterested equivalent: “Give us the man we wish for this office, and\r\nyou shall have the one you wish for that.” This will be the usual\r\ncondition of the bargain. And it will rarely happen that the\r\nadvancement of the public service will be the primary object either of\r\nparty victories or of party negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the principles here advanced seems to have been felt by\r\nthe most intelligent of those who have found fault with the provision\r\nmade, in this respect, by the convention. They contend that the\r\nPresident ought solely to have been authorized to make the appointments\r\nunder the federal government. But it is easy to show, that every\r\nadvantage to be expected from such an arrangement would, in substance,\r\nbe derived from the power of NOMINATION, which is proposed to be\r\nconferred upon him; while several disadvantages which might attend the\r\nabsolute power of appointment in the hands of that officer would be\r\navoided. In the act of nomination, his judgment alone would be\r\nexercised; and as it would be his sole duty to point out the man who,\r\nwith the approbation of the Senate, should fill an office, his\r\nresponsibility would be as complete as if he were to make the final\r\nappointment. There can, in this view, be no difference others, who are\r\nto be the objects of our choice or preference. Hence, in every exercise\r\nof the power of appointing to offices, by an assembly of men, we must\r\nexpect to see a full display of all the private and party likings and\r\ndislikes, partialities and antipathies, attachments and animosities,\r\nwhich are felt by those who compose the assembly.

There can, in this view, be no difference between\r\nnominating and appointing. The same motives which would influence a\r\nproper discharge of his duty in one case, would exist in the other. And\r\nas no man could be appointed but on his previous nomination, every man\r\nwho might be appointed would be, in fact, his choice.\r\n\r\nBut might not his nomination be overruled? I grant it might, yet this\r\ncould only be to make place for another nomination by himself. The\r\nperson ultimately appointed must be the object of his preference,\r\nthough perhaps not in the first degree. It is also not very probable\r\nthat his nomination would often be overruled. The Senate could not be\r\ntempted, by the preference they might feel to another, to reject the\r\none proposed; because they could not assure themselves, that the person\r\nthey might wish would be brought forward by a second or by any\r\nsubsequent nomination. They could not even be certain, that a future\r\nnomination would present a candidate in any degree more acceptable to\r\nthem; and as their dissent might cast a kind of stigma upon the\r\nindividual rejected, and might have the appearance of a reflection upon\r\nthe judgment of the chief magistrate, it is not likely that their\r\nsanction would often be refused, where there were not special and\r\nstrong reasons for the refusal.\r\n\r\nTo what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate? I answer,\r\nthat the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful, though,\r\nin general, a silent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a\r\nspirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to\r\nprevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from\r\nfamily connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to\r\npopularity. In addition to this, it would be an efficacious source of\r\nstability in the administration.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be comprehended, that a man who had himself the sole\r\ndisposition of offices, would be governed much more by his private\r\ninclinations and interests, than when he was bound to submit the\r\npropriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a\r\ndifferent and independent body, and that body an entire branch of the\r\nlegislature. The possibility of rejection would be a strong motive to\r\ncare in proposing. The danger to his own reputation, and, in the case\r\nof an elective magistrate, to his political existence, from betraying a\r\nspirit of favoritism, or an unbecoming pursuit of popularity, to the\r\nobservation of a body whose opinion would have great weight in forming\r\nthat of the public, could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one\r\nand to the other. He would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward,\r\nfor the most distinguished or lucrative stations, candidates who had no\r\nother merit than that of coming from the same State to which he\r\nparticularly belonged, or of being in some way or other personally\r\nallied to him, or of possessing the necessary insignificance and\r\npliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure.\r\n\r\nTo this reasoning it has been objected that the President, by the\r\ninfluence of the power of nomination, may secure the complaisance of\r\nthe Senate to his views. This supposition of universal venalty in human\r\nnature is little less an error in political reasoning, than the\r\nsupposition of universal rectitude. The institution of delegated power\r\nimplies, that there is a portion of virtue and honor among mankind,\r\nwhich may be a reasonable foundation of confidence; and experience\r\njustifies the theory. It has been found to exist in the most corrupt\r\nperiods of the most corrupt governments. The venalty of the British\r\nHouse of Commons has been long a topic of accusation against that body,\r\nin the country to which they belong as well as in this; and it cannot\r\nbe doubted that the charge is, to a considerable extent, well founded.\r\nBut it is as little to be doubted, that there is always a large\r\nproportion of the body, which consists of independent and\r\npublic-spirited men, who have an influential weight in the councils of\r\nthe nation. Hence it is (the present reign not excepted) that the sense\r\nof that body is often seen to control the inclinations of the monarch,\r\nboth with regard to men and to measures. Though it might therefore be\r\nallowable to suppose that the Executive might occasionally influence\r\nsome individuals in the Senate, yet the supposition, that he could in\r\ngeneral purchase the integrity of the whole body, would be forced and\r\nimprobable. A man disposed to view human nature as it is, without\r\neither flattering its virtues or exaggerating its vices, will see\r\nsufficient ground of confidence in the probity of the Senate, to rest\r\nsatisfied, not only that it will be impracticable to the Executive to\r\ncorrupt or seduce a majority of its members, but that the necessity of\r\nits co-operation, in the business of appointments, will be a\r\nconsiderable and salutary restraint upon the conduct of that\r\nmagistrate. Nor is the integrity of the Senate the only reliance. The\r\nConstitution has provided some important guards against the danger of\r\nexecutive influence upon the legislative body: it declares that “No\r\nsenator or representative shall during the time FOR WHICH HE WAS\r\nELECTED, be appointed to any civil office under the United States,\r\nwhich shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have\r\nbeen increased, during such time; and no person, holding any office\r\nunder the United States, shall be a member of either house during his\r\ncontinuance in office.”\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXVII.\r\n\r\nThe Appointing Power Continued and Other Powers of the Executive\r\nConsidered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, April 4, 1788.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the\r\nco-operation of the Senate, in the business of appointments, that it\r\nwould contribute to the stability of the administration. The consent of\r\nthat body would be necessary to displace as well as to appoint. A\r\nchange of the Chief Magistrate, therefore, would not occasion so\r\nviolent or so general a revolution in the officers of the government as\r\nmight be expected, if he were the sole disposer of offices. Where a man\r\nin any station had given satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it, a\r\nnew President would be restrained from attempting a change in favor of\r\na person more agreeable to him, by the apprehension that a\r\ndiscountenance of the Senate might frustrate the attempt, and bring\r\nsome degree of discredit upon himself. Those who can best estimate the\r\nvalue of a steady administration, will be most disposed to prize a\r\nprovision which connects the official existence of public men with the\r\napprobation or disapprobation of that body which, from the greater\r\npermanency of its own composition, will in all probability be less\r\nsubject to inconstancy than any other member of the government.\r\n\r\nTo this union of the Senate with the President, in the article of\r\nappointments, it has in some cases been suggested that it would serve\r\nto give the President an undue influence over the Senate, and in others\r\nthat it would have an opposite tendency, a strong proof that neither\r\nsuggestion is true.\r\n\r\nTo state the first in its proper form, is to refute it. It amounts to\r\nthis: the President would have an improper INFLUENCE OVER the Senate,\r\nbecause the Senate would have the power of RESTRAINING him. This is an\r\nabsurdity in terms. It cannot admit of a doubt that the entire power of\r\nappointment would enable him much more effectually to establish a\r\ndangerous empire over that body, than a mere power of nomination\r\nsubject to their control.\r\n\r\nLet us take a view of the converse of the proposition: “the Senate\r\nwould influence the Executive.” As I have had occasion to remark in\r\nseveral other instances, the indistinctness of the objection forbids a\r\nprecise answer. In what manner is this influence to be exerted? In\r\nrelation to what objects? The power of influencing a person, in the\r\nsense in which it is here used, must imply a power of conferring a\r\nbenefit upon him. How could the Senate confer a benefit upon the\r\nPresident by the manner of employing their right of negative upon his\r\nnominations? If it be said they might sometimes gratify him by an\r\nacquiescence in a favorite choice, when public motives might dictate a\r\ndifferent conduct, I answer, that the instances in which the President\r\ncould be personally interested in the result, would be too few to admit\r\nof his being materially affected by the compliances of the Senate. The\r\nPOWER which can ORIGINATE the disposition of honors and emoluments, is\r\nmore likely to attract than to be attracted by the POWER which can\r\nmerely obstruct their course. If by influencing the President be meant\r\nRESTRAINING him, this is precisely what must have been intended. And it\r\nhas been shown that the restraint would be salutary, at the same time\r\nthat it would not be such as to destroy a single advantage to be looked\r\nfor from the uncontrolled agency of that Magistrate. The right of\r\nnomination would produce all the good of that of appointment, and would\r\nin a great measure avoid its evils. Upon a comparison of the plan for\r\nthe appointment of the officers of the proposed government with that\r\nwhich is established by the constitution of this State, a decided\r\npreference must be given to the former. In that plan the power of\r\nnomination is unequivocally vested in the Executive. And as there would\r\nbe a necessity for submitting each nomination to the judgment of an\r\nentire branch of the legislature, the circumstances attending an\r\nappointment, from the mode of conducting it, would naturally become\r\nmatters of notoriety; and the public would be at no loss to determine\r\nwhat part had been performed by the different actors. The blame of a\r\nbad nomination would fall upon the President singly and absolutely. The\r\ncensure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at the door of the\r\nSenate; aggravated by the consideration of their having counteracted\r\nthe good intentions of the Executive. If an ill appointment should be\r\nmade, the Executive for nominating, and the Senate for approving, would\r\nparticipate, though in different degrees, in the opprobrium and\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nThe reverse of all this characterizes the manner of appointment in this\r\nState. The council of appointment consists of from three to five\r\npersons, of whom the governor is always one. This small body, shut up\r\nin a private apartment, impenetrable to the public eye, proceed to the\r\nexecution of the trust committed to them. It is known that the governor\r\nclaims the right of nomination, upon the strength of some ambiguous\r\nexpressions in the constitution; but it is not known to what extent, or\r\nin what manner he exercises it; nor upon what occasions he is\r\ncontradicted or opposed. The censure of a bad appointment, on account\r\nof the uncertainty of its author, and for want of a determinate object,\r\nhas neither poignancy nor duration. And while an unbounded field for\r\ncabal and intrigue lies open, all idea of responsibility is lost. The\r\nmost that the public can know, is that the governor claims the right of\r\nnomination; that TWO out of the inconsiderable number of FOUR men can\r\ntoo often be managed without much difficulty; that if some of the\r\nmembers of a particular council should happen to be of an uncomplying\r\ncharacter, it is frequently not impossible to get rid of their\r\nopposition by regulating the times of meeting in such a manner as to\r\nrender their attendance inconvenient; and that from whatever cause it\r\nmay proceed, a great number of very improper appointments are from time\r\nto time made. Whether a governor of this State avails himself of the\r\nascendant he must necessarily have, in this delicate and important part\r\nof the administration, to prefer to offices men who are best qualified\r\nfor them, or whether he prostitutes that advantage to the advancement\r\nof persons whose chief merit is their implicit devotion to his will,\r\nand to the support of a despicable and dangerous system of personal\r\ninfluence, are questions which, unfortunately for the community, can\r\nonly be the subjects of speculation and conjecture.\r\n\r\nEvery mere council of appointment, however constituted, will be a\r\nconclave, in which cabal and intrigue will have their full scope. Their\r\nnumber, without an unwarrantable increase of expense, cannot be large\r\nenough to preclude a facility of combination. And as each member will\r\nhave his friends and connections to provide for, the desire of mutual\r\ngratification will beget a scandalous bartering of votes and bargaining\r\nfor places. The private attachments of one man might easily be\r\nsatisfied; but to satisfy the private attachments of a dozen, or of\r\ntwenty men, would occasion a monopoly of all the principal employments\r\nof the government in a few families, and would lead more directly to an\r\naristocracy or an oligarchy than any measure that could be contrived.\r\nIf, to avoid an accumulation of offices, there was to be a frequent\r\nchange in the persons who were to compose the council, this would\r\ninvolve the mischiefs of a mutable administration in their full extent.\r\nSuch a council would also be more liable to executive influence than\r\nthe Senate, because they would be fewer in number, and would act less\r\nimmediately under the public inspection. Such a council, in fine, as a\r\nsubstitute for the plan of the convention, would be productive of an\r\nincrease of expense, a multiplication of the evils which spring from\r\nfavoritism and intrigue in the distribution of public honors, a\r\ndecrease of stability in the administration of the government, and a\r\ndiminution of the security against an undue influence of the Executive.\r\nAnd yet such a council has been warmly contended for as an essential\r\namendment in the proposed Constitution.\r\n\r\nI could not with propriety conclude my observations on the subject of\r\nappointments without taking notice of a scheme for which there have\r\nappeared some, though but few advocates; I mean that of uniting the\r\nHouse of Representatives in the power of making them. I shall, however,\r\ndo little more than mention it, as I cannot imagine that it is likely\r\nto gain the countenance of any considerable part of the community. A\r\nbody so fluctuating and at the same time so numerous, can never be\r\ndeemed proper for the exercise of that power. Its unfitness will appear\r\nmanifest to all, when it is recollected that in half a century it may\r\nconsist of three or four hundred persons. All the advantages of the\r\nstability, both of the Executive and of the Senate, would be defeated\r\nby this union, and infinite delays and embarrassments would be\r\noccasioned. The example of most of the States in their local\r\nconstitutions encourages us to reprobate the idea.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining powers of the Executive are comprehended in giving\r\ninformation to Congress of the state of the Union; in recommending to\r\ntheir consideration such measures as he shall judge expedient; in\r\nconvening them, or either branch, upon extraordinary occasions; in\r\nadjourning them when they cannot themselves agree upon the time of\r\nadjournment; in receiving ambassadors and other public ministers; in\r\nfaithfully executing the laws; and in commissioning all the officers of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nExcept some cavils about the power of convening EITHER house of the\r\nlegislature, and that of receiving ambassadors, no objection has been\r\nmade to this class of authorities; nor could they possibly admit of\r\nany. It required, indeed, an insatiable avidity for censure to invent\r\nexceptions to the parts which have been excepted to. In regard to the\r\npower of convening either house of the legislature, I shall barely\r\nremark, that in respect to the Senate at least, we can readily discover\r\na good reason for it. AS this body has a concurrent power with the\r\nExecutive in the article of treaties, it might often be necessary to\r\ncall it together with a view to this object, when it would be\r\nunnecessary and improper to convene the House of Representatives. As to\r\nthe reception of ambassadors, what I have said in a former paper will\r\nfurnish a sufficient answer.\r\n\r\nWe have now completed a survey of the structure and powers of the\r\nexecutive department, which, I have endeavored to show, combines, as\r\nfar as republican principles will admit, all the requisites to energy.\r\nThe remaining inquiry is: Does it also combine the requisites to\r\nsafety, in a republican sense, a due dependence on the people, a due\r\nresponsibility? The answer to this question has been anticipated in the\r\ninvestigation of its other characteristics, and is satisfactorily\r\ndeducible from these circumstances; from the election of the President\r\nonce in four years by persons immediately chosen by the people for that\r\npurpose; and from his being at all times liable to impeachment, trial,\r\ndismission from office, incapacity to serve in any other, and to\r\nforfeiture of life and estate by subsequent prosecution in the common\r\ncourse of law. But these precautions, great as they are, are not the\r\nonly ones which the plan of the convention has provided in favor of the\r\npublic security. In the only instances in which the abuse of the\r\nexecutive authority was materially to be feared, the Chief Magistrate\r\nof the United States would, by that plan, be subjected to the control\r\nof a branch of the legislative body. What more could be desired by an\r\nenlightened and reasonable people?\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Department\r\n\r\nFrom McLEAN’S Edition, New York.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nWe proceed now to an examination of the judiciary department of the\r\nproposed government.\r\n\r\nIn unfolding the defects of the existing Confederation, the utility and\r\nnecessity of a federal judicature have been clearly pointed out. It is\r\nthe less necessary to recapitulate the considerations there urged, as\r\nthe propriety of the institution in the abstract is not disputed; the\r\nonly questions which have been raised being relative to the manner of\r\nconstituting it, and to its extent. To these points, therefore, our\r\nobservations shall be confined.\r\n\r\nThe manner of constituting it seems to embrace these several objects:\r\n1st. The mode of appointing the judges. 2d. The tenure by which they\r\nare to hold their places. 3d. The partition of the judiciary authority\r\nbetween different courts, and their relations to each other.\r\n\r\nFirst. As to the mode of appointing the judges; this is the same with\r\nthat of appointing the officers of the Union in general, and has been\r\nso fully discussed in the two last numbers, that nothing can be said\r\nhere which would not be useless repetition.\r\n\r\nSecond. As to the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places;\r\nthis chiefly concerns their duration in office; the provisions for\r\ntheir support; the precautions for their responsibility.\r\n\r\nAccording to the plan of the convention, all judges who may be\r\nappointed by the United States are to hold their offices DURING GOOD\r\nBEHAVIOR; which is conformable to the most approved of the State\r\nconstitutions and among the rest, to that of this State. Its propriety\r\nhaving been drawn into question by the adversaries of that plan, is no\r\nlight symptom of the rage for objection, which disorders their\r\nimaginations and judgments. The standard of good behavior for the\r\ncontinuance in office of the judicial magistracy, is certainly one of\r\nthe most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of\r\ngovernment. In a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the despotism\r\nof the prince; in a republic it is a no less excellent barrier to the\r\nencroachments and oppressions of the representative body. And it is the\r\nbest expedient which can be devised in any government, to secure a\r\nsteady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws.\r\n\r\nWhoever attentively considers the different departments of power must\r\nperceive, that, in a government in which they are separated from each\r\nother, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be\r\nthe least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution;\r\nbecause it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The\r\nExecutive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the\r\ncommunity. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes\r\nthe rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be\r\nregulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either\r\nthe sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the\r\nwealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It\r\nmay truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment;\r\nand must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for\r\nthe efficacy of its judgments.\r\n\r\nThis simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences.\r\nIt proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the\r\nweakest of the three departments of power;[1] that it can never attack\r\nwith success either of the other two; and that all possible care is\r\nrequisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks. It\r\nequally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then\r\nproceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people\r\ncan never be endangered from that quarter; I mean so long as the\r\njudiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the\r\nExecutive. For I agree, that “there is no liberty, if the power of\r\njudging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.”[2]\r\nAnd it proves, in the last place, that as liberty can have nothing to\r\nfear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from\r\nits union with either of the other departments; that as all the effects\r\nof such a union must ensue from a dependence of the former on the\r\nlatter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation; that as,\r\nfrom the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual\r\njeopardy of being overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate\r\nbranches; and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness\r\nand independence as permanency in office, this quality may therefore be\r\njustly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution,\r\nand, in a great measure, as the citadel of the public justice and the\r\npublic security.\r\n\r\nThe complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly\r\nessential in a limited Constitution. By a limited Constitution, I\r\nunderstand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the\r\nlegislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no\r\nbills of attainder, no ex-post-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of\r\nthis kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the\r\nmedium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts\r\ncontrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. Without this,\r\nall the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nSome perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce\r\nlegislative acts void, because contrary to the Constitution, has arisen\r\nfrom an imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the\r\njudiciary to the legislative power. It is urged that the authority\r\nwhich can declare the acts of another void, must necessarily be\r\nsuperior to the one whose acts may be declared void. As this doctrine\r\nis of great importance in all the American constitutions, a brief\r\ndiscussion of the ground on which it rests cannot be unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThere is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that\r\nevery act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the\r\ncommission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act,\r\ntherefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this,\r\nwould be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that\r\nthe servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people\r\nare superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of\r\npowers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what\r\nthey forbid.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that the legislative body are themselves the\r\nconstitutional judges of their own powers, and that the construction\r\nthey put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may be\r\nanswered, that this cannot be the natural presumption, where it is not\r\nto be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution. It\r\nis not otherwise to be supposed, that the Constitution could intend to\r\nenable the representatives of the people to substitute their WILL to\r\nthat of their constituents. It is far more rational to suppose, that\r\nthe courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people\r\nand the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter\r\nwithin the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of\r\nthe laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A\r\nconstitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a\r\nfundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning,\r\nas well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the\r\nlegislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable\r\nvariance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and\r\nvalidity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the\r\nConstitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the\r\npeople to the intention of their agents.\r\n\r\nNor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the\r\njudicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of\r\nthe people is superior to both; and that where the will of the\r\nlegislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of\r\nthe people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be\r\ngoverned by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate\r\ntheir decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are\r\nnot fundamental.\r\n\r\nThis exercise of judicial discretion, in determining between two\r\ncontradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar instance. It not\r\nuncommonly happens, that there are two statutes existing at one time,\r\nclashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them\r\ncontaining any repealing clause or expression. In such a case, it is\r\nthe province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and\r\noperation. So far as they can, by any fair construction, be reconciled\r\nto each other, reason and law conspire to dictate that this should be\r\ndone; where this is impracticable, it becomes a matter of necessity to\r\ngive effect to one, in exclusion of the other. The rule which has\r\nobtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is, that\r\nthe last in order of time shall be preferred to the first. But this is\r\na mere rule of construction, not derived from any positive law, but\r\nfrom the nature and reason of the thing. It is a rule not enjoined upon\r\nthe courts by legislative provision, but adopted by themselves, as\r\nconsonant to truth and propriety, for the direction of their conduct as\r\ninterpreters of the law. They thought it reasonable, that between the\r\ninterfering acts of an EQUAL authority, that which was the last\r\nindication of its will should have the preference.\r\n\r\nBut in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate\r\nauthority, of an original and derivative power, the nature and reason\r\nof the thing indicate the converse of that rule as proper to be\r\nfollowed. They teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to be\r\npreferred to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate\r\nauthority; and that accordingly, whenever a particular statute\r\ncontravenes the Constitution, it will be the duty of the judicial\r\ntribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former.\r\n\r\nIt can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a\r\nrepugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional\r\nintentions of the legislature. This might as well happen in the case of\r\ntwo contradictory statutes; or it might as well happen in every\r\nadjudication upon any single statute. The courts must declare the sense\r\nof the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of\r\nJUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their\r\npleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if it prove\r\nany thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from\r\nthat body.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of\r\na limited Constitution against legislative encroachments, this\r\nconsideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure of\r\njudicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much as this to that\r\nindependent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the\r\nfaithful performance of so arduous a duty.\r\n\r\nThis independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the\r\nConstitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those\r\nill humors, which the arts of designing men, or the influence of\r\nparticular conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people\r\nthemselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better\r\ninformation, and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the\r\nmeantime, to occasion dangerous innovations in the government, and\r\nserious oppressions of the minor party in the community. Though I trust\r\nthe friends of the proposed Constitution will never concur with its\r\nenemies[3] in questioning that fundamental principle of republican\r\ngovernment, which admits the right of the people to alter or abolish\r\nthe established Constitution, whenever they find it inconsistent with\r\ntheir happiness, yet it is not to be inferred from this principle, that\r\nthe representatives of the people, whenever a momentary inclination\r\nhappens to lay hold of a majority of their constituents, incompatible\r\nwith the provisions in the existing Constitution, would, on that\r\naccount, be justifiable in a violation of those provisions; or that the\r\ncourts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in\r\nthis shape, than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the\r\nrepresentative body. Until the people have, by some solemn and\r\nauthoritative act, annulled or changed the established form, it is\r\nbinding upon themselves collectively, as well as individually; and no\r\npresumption, or even knowledge, of their sentiments, can warrant their\r\nrepresentatives in a departure from it, prior to such an act. But it is\r\neasy to see, that it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude in\r\nthe judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the Constitution,\r\nwhere legislative invasions of it had been instigated by the major\r\nvoice of the community.\r\n\r\nBut it is not with a view to infractions of the Constitution only, that\r\nthe independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against\r\nthe effects of occasional ill humors in the society. These sometimes\r\nextend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of\r\nparticular classes of citizens, by unjust and partial laws. Here also\r\nthe firmness of the judicial magistracy is of vast importance in\r\nmitigating the severity and confining the operation of such laws. It\r\nnot only serves to moderate the immediate mischiefs of those which may\r\nhave been passed, but it operates as a check upon the legislative body\r\nin passing them; who, perceiving that obstacles to the success of\r\niniquitous intention are to be expected from the scruples of the\r\ncourts, are in a manner compelled, by the very motives of the injustice\r\nthey meditate, to qualify their attempts. This is a circumstance\r\ncalculated to have more influence upon the character of our\r\ngovernments, than but few may be aware of. The benefits of the\r\nintegrity and moderation of the judiciary have already been felt in\r\nmore States than one; and though they may have displeased those whose\r\nsinister expectations they may have disappointed, they must have\r\ncommanded the esteem and applause of all the virtuous and\r\ndisinterested. Considerate men, of every description, ought to prize\r\nwhatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the courts: as no\r\nman can be sure that he may not be to-morrow the victim of a spirit of\r\ninjustice, by which he may be a gainer to-day. And every man must now\r\nfeel, that the inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the\r\nfoundations of public and private confidence, and to introduce in its\r\nstead universal distrust and distress.\r\n\r\nThat inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the\r\nConstitution, and of individuals, which we perceive to be indispensable\r\nin the courts of justice, can certainly not be expected from judges who\r\nhold their offices by a temporary commission. Periodical appointments,\r\nhowever regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other,\r\nbe fatal to their necessary independence. If the power of making them\r\nwas committed either to the Executive or legislature, there would be\r\ndanger of an improper complaisance to the branch which possessed it; if\r\nto both, there would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeasure of\r\neither; if to the people, or to persons chosen by them for the special\r\npurpose, there would be too great a disposition to consult popularity,\r\nto justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted but the\r\nConstitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nThere is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency of the\r\njudicial offices, which is deducible from the nature of the\r\nqualifications they require. It has been frequently remarked, with\r\ngreat propriety, that a voluminous code of laws is one of the\r\ninconveniences necessarily connected with the advantages of a free\r\ngovernment. To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is\r\nindispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and\r\nprecedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every\r\nparticular case that comes before them; and it will readily be\r\nconceived from the variety of controversies which grow out of the folly\r\nand wickedness of mankind, that the records of those precedents must\r\nunavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk, and must demand long and\r\nlaborious study to acquire a competent knowledge of them. Hence it is,\r\nthat there can be but few men in the society who will have sufficient\r\nskill in the laws to qualify them for the stations of judges. And\r\nmaking the proper deductions for the ordinary depravity of human\r\nnature, the number must be still smaller of those who unite the\r\nrequisite integrity with the requisite knowledge. These considerations\r\napprise us, that the government can have no great option between fit\r\ncharacter; and that a temporary duration in office, which would\r\nnaturally discourage such characters from quitting a lucrative line of\r\npractice to accept a seat on the bench, would have a tendency to throw\r\nthe administration of justice into hands less able, and less well\r\nqualified, to conduct it with utility and dignity. In the present\r\ncircumstances of this country, and in those in which it is likely to be\r\nfor a long time to come, the disadvantages on this score would be\r\ngreater than they may at first sight appear; but it must be confessed,\r\nthat they are far inferior to those which present themselves under the\r\nother aspects of the subject.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, there can be no room to doubt that the convention acted\r\nwisely in copying from the models of those constitutions which have\r\nestablished GOOD BEHAVIOR as the tenure of their judicial offices, in\r\npoint of duration; and that so far from being blamable on this account,\r\ntheir plan would have been inexcusably defective, if it had wanted this\r\nimportant feature of good government. The experience of Great Britain\r\naffords an illustrious comment on the excellence of the institution.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] The celebrated Montesquieu, speaking of them, says: “Of the three\r\n powers above mentioned, the judiciary is next to nothing.” _Spirit of\r\n Laws_. vol. i., page 186.\r\n\r\n [2] _Idem_, page 181.\r\n\r\n [3] _Vide Protest of the Minority of the Convention of Pennsylvania_,\r\n Martin’s Speech, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXIX.\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Continued\r\n\r\nFrom MCLEAN’s Edition, New York.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nNext to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the\r\nindependence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support.\r\nThe remark made in relation to the President is equally applicable\r\nhere. In the general course of human nature, A POWER OVER A MAN’s\r\nSUBSISTENCE AMOUNTS TO A POWER OVER HIS WILL. And we can never hope to\r\nsee realized in practice, the complete separation of the judicial from\r\nthe legislative power, in any system which leaves the former dependent\r\nfor pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the latter. The\r\nenlightened friends to good government in every State, have seen cause\r\nto lament the want of precise and explicit precautions in the State\r\nconstitutions on this head. Some of these indeed have declared that\r\nPERMANENT[1] salaries should be established for the judges; but the\r\nexperiment has in some instances shown that such expressions are not\r\nsufficiently definite to preclude legislative evasions. Something still\r\nmore positive and unequivocal has been evinced to be requisite. The\r\nplan of the convention accordingly has provided that the judges of the\r\nUnited States “shall at STATED TIMES receive for their services a\r\ncompensation which shall not be DIMINISHED during their continuance in\r\noffice.”\r\n\r\nThis, all circumstances considered, is the most eligible provision that\r\ncould have been devised. It will readily be understood that the\r\nfluctuations in the value of money and in the state of society rendered\r\na fixed rate of compensation in the Constitution inadmissible. What\r\nmight be extravagant to-day, might in half a century become penurious\r\nand inadequate. It was therefore necessary to leave it to the\r\ndiscretion of the legislature to vary its provisions in conformity to\r\nthe variations in circumstances, yet under such restrictions as to put\r\nit out of the power of that body to change the condition of the\r\nindividual for the worse. A man may then be sure of the ground upon\r\nwhich he stands, and can never be deterred from his duty by the\r\napprehension of being placed in a less eligible situation. The clause\r\nwhich has been quoted combines both advantages. The salaries of\r\njudicial officers may from time to time be altered, as occasion shall\r\nrequire, yet so as never to lessen the allowance with which any\r\nparticular judge comes into office, in respect to him. It will be\r\nobserved that a difference has been made by the convention between the\r\ncompensation of the President and of the judges, That of the former can\r\nneither be increased nor diminished; that of the latter can only not be\r\ndiminished. This probably arose from the difference in the duration of\r\nthe respective offices. As the President is to be elected for no more\r\nthan four years, it can rarely happen that an adequate salary, fixed at\r\nthe commencement of that period, will not continue to be such to its\r\nend. But with regard to the judges, who, if they behave properly, will\r\nbe secured in their places for life, it may well happen, especially in\r\nthe early stages of the government, that a stipend, which would be very\r\nsufficient at their first appointment, would become too small in the\r\nprogress of their service.\r\n\r\nThis provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of\r\nprudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together\r\nwith the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better\r\nprospect of their independence than is discoverable in the\r\nconstitutions of any of the States in regard to their own judges.\r\n\r\nThe precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the article\r\nrespecting impeachments. They are liable to be impeached for malconduct\r\nby the House of Representatives, and tried by the Senate; and, if\r\nconvicted, may be dismissed from office, and disqualified for holding\r\nany other. This is the only provision on the point which is consistent\r\nwith the necessary independence of the judicial character, and is the\r\nonly one which we find in our own Constitution in respect to our own\r\njudges.\r\n\r\nThe want of a provision for removing the judges on account of inability\r\nhas been a subject of complaint. But all considerate men will be\r\nsensible that such a provision would either not be practiced upon or\r\nwould be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any good\r\npurpose. The mensuration of the faculties of the mind has, I believe,\r\nno place in the catalogue of known arts. An attempt to fix the boundary\r\nbetween the regions of ability and inability, would much oftener give\r\nscope to personal and party attachments and enmities than advance the\r\ninterests of justice or the public good. The result, except in the case\r\nof insanity, must for the most part be arbitrary; and insanity, without\r\nany formal or express provision, may be safely pronounced to be a\r\nvirtual disqualification.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of New York, to avoid investigations that must forever\r\nbe vague and dangerous, has taken a particular age as the criterion of\r\ninability. No man can be a judge beyond sixty. I believe there are few\r\nat present who do not disapprove of this provision. There is no\r\nstation, in relation to which it is less proper than to that of a\r\njudge. The deliberating and comparing faculties generally preserve\r\ntheir strength much beyond that period in men who survive it; and when,\r\nin addition to this circumstance, we consider how few there are who\r\noutlive the season of intellectual vigor, and how improbable it is that\r\nany considerable portion of the bench, whether more or less numerous,\r\nshould be in such a situation at the same time, we shall be ready to\r\nconclude that limitations of this sort have little to recommend them.\r\nIn a republic, where fortunes are not affluent, and pensions not\r\nexpedient, the dismission of men from stations in which they have\r\nserved their country long and usefully, on which they depend for\r\nsubsistence, and from which it will be too late to resort to any other\r\noccupation for a livelihood, ought to have some better apology to\r\nhumanity than is to be found in the imaginary danger of a superannuated\r\nbench.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] _Vide Constitution of Massachusetts_, chapter 2, section 1,\r\n article 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXX.\r\n\r\nThe Powers of the Judiciary\r\n\r\nFrom McLEAN’s Edition, New York.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTo judge with accuracy of the proper extent of the federal judicature,\r\nit will be necessary to consider, in the first place, what are its\r\nproper objects.\r\n\r\nIt seems scarcely to admit of controversy, that the judicary authority\r\nof the Union ought to extend to these several descriptions of cases:\r\n1st, to all those which arise out of the laws of the United States,\r\npassed in pursuance of their just and constitutional powers of\r\nlegislation; 2d, to all those which concern the execution of the\r\nprovisions expressly contained in the articles of Union; 3d, to all\r\nthose in which the United States are a party; 4th, to all those which\r\ninvolve the PEACE of the CONFEDERACY, whether they relate to the\r\nintercourse between the United States and foreign nations, or to that\r\nbetween the States themselves; 5th, to all those which originate on the\r\nhigh seas, and are of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction; and, lastly,\r\nto all those in which the State tribunals cannot be supposed to be\r\nimpartial and unbiased.\r\n\r\nThe first point depends upon this obvious consideration, that there\r\nought always to be a constitutional method of giving efficacy to\r\nconstitutional provisions. What, for instance, would avail restrictions\r\non the authority of the State legislatures, without some constitutional\r\nmode of enforcing the observance of them? The States, by the plan of\r\nthe convention, are prohibited from doing a variety of things, some of\r\nwhich are incompatible with the interests of the Union, and others with\r\nthe principles of good government. The imposition of duties on imported\r\narticles, and the emission of paper money, are specimens of each kind.\r\nNo man of sense will believe, that such prohibitions would be\r\nscrupulously regarded, without some effectual power in the government\r\nto restrain or correct the infractions of them. This power must either\r\nbe a direct negative on the State laws, or an authority in the federal\r\ncourts to overrule such as might be in manifest contravention of the\r\narticles of Union. There is no third course that I can imagine. The\r\nlatter appears to have been thought by the convention preferable to the\r\nformer, and, I presume, will be most agreeable to the States.\r\n\r\nAs to the second point, it is impossible, by any argument or comment,\r\nto make it clearer than it is in itself. If there are such things as\r\npolitical axioms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government\r\nbeing coextensive with its legislative, may be ranked among the number.\r\nThe mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national\r\nlaws, decides the question. Thirteen independent courts of final\r\njurisdiction over the same causes, arising upon the same laws, is a\r\nhydra in government, from which nothing but contradiction and confusion\r\ncan proceed.\r\n\r\nStill less need be said in regard to the third point. Controversies\r\nbetween the nation and its members or citizens, can only be properly\r\nreferred to the national tribunals. Any other plan would be contrary to\r\nreason, to precedent, and to decorum.\r\n\r\nThe fourth point rests on this plain proposition, that the peace of the\r\nWHOLE ought not to be left at the disposal of a PART. The Union will\r\nundoubtedly be answerable to foreign powers for the conduct of its\r\nmembers. And the responsibility for an injury ought ever to be\r\naccompanied with the faculty of preventing it. As the denial or\r\nperversion of justice by the sentences of courts, as well as in any\r\nother manner, is with reason classed among the just causes of war, it\r\nwill follow that the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all\r\ncauses in which the citizens of other countries are concerned. This is\r\nnot less essential to the preservation of the public faith, than to the\r\nsecurity of the public tranquillity. A distinction may perhaps be\r\nimagined between cases arising upon treaties and the laws of nations\r\nand those which may stand merely on the footing of the municipal law.\r\nThe former kind may be supposed proper for the federal jurisdiction,\r\nthe latter for that of the States. But it is at least problematical,\r\nwhether an unjust sentence against a foreigner, where the subject of\r\ncontroversy was wholly relative to the lex loci, would not, if\r\nunredressed, be an aggression upon his sovereign, as well as one which\r\nviolated the stipulations of a treaty or the general law of nations.\r\nAnd a still greater objection to the distinction would result from the\r\nimmense difficulty, if not impossibility, of a practical discrimination\r\nbetween the cases of one complexion and those of the other. So great a\r\nproportion of the cases in which foreigners are parties, involve\r\nnational questions, that it is by far most safe and most expedient to\r\nrefer all those in which they are concerned to the national tribunals.\r\n\r\nThe power of determining causes between two States, between one State\r\nand the citizens of another, and between the citizens of different\r\nStates, is perhaps not less essential to the peace of the Union than\r\nthat which has been just examined. History gives us a horrid picture of\r\nthe dissensions and private wars which distracted and desolated Germany\r\nprior to the institution of the Imperial Chamber by Maximilian, towards\r\nthe close of the fifteenth century; and informs us, at the same time,\r\nof the vast influence of that institution in appeasing the disorders\r\nand establishing the tranquillity of the empire. This was a court\r\ninvested with authority to decide finally all differences among the\r\nmembers of the Germanic body.\r\n\r\nA method of terminating territorial disputes between the States, under\r\nthe authority of the federal head, was not unattended to, even in the\r\nimperfect system by which they have been hitherto held together. But\r\nthere are many other sources, besides interfering claims of boundary,\r\nfrom which bickerings and animosities may spring up among the members\r\nof the Union. To some of these we have been witnesses in the course of\r\nour past experience. It will readily be conjectured that I allude to\r\nthe fraudulent laws which have been passed in too many of the States.\r\nAnd though the proposed Constitution establishes particular guards\r\nagainst the repetition of those instances which have heretofore made\r\ntheir appearance, yet it is warrantable to apprehend that the spirit\r\nwhich produced them will assume new shapes, that could not be foreseen\r\nnor specifically provided against. Whatever practices may have a\r\ntendency to disturb the harmony between the States, are proper objects\r\nof federal superintendence and control.\r\n\r\nIt may be esteemed the basis of the Union, that “the citizens of each\r\nState shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of\r\ncitizens of the several States.” And if it be a just principle that\r\nevery government OUGHT TO POSSESS THE MEANS OF EXECUTING ITS OWN\r\nPROVISIONS BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY, it will follow, that in order to the\r\ninviolable maintenance of that equality of privileges and immunities to\r\nwhich the citizens of the Union will be entitled, the national\r\njudiciary ought to preside in all cases in which one State or its\r\ncitizens are opposed to another State or its citizens. To secure the\r\nfull effect of so fundamental a provision against all evasion and\r\nsubterfuge, it is necessary that its construction should be committed\r\nto that tribunal which, having no local attachments, will be likely to\r\nbe impartial between the different States and their citizens, and\r\nwhich, owing its official existence to the Union, will never be likely\r\nto feel any bias inauspicious to the principles on which it is founded.\r\n\r\nThe fifth point will demand little animadversion. The most bigoted\r\nidolizers of State authority have not thus far shown a disposition to\r\ndeny the national judiciary the cognizances of maritime causes. These\r\nso generally depend on the laws of nations, and so commonly affect the\r\nrights of foreigners, that they fall within the considerations which\r\nare relative to the public peace. The most important part of them are,\r\nby the present Confederation, submitted to federal jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe reasonableness of the agency of the national courts in cases in\r\nwhich the State tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial, speaks\r\nfor itself. No man ought certainly to be a judge in his own cause, or\r\nin any cause in respect to which he has the least interest or bias.\r\nThis principle has no inconsiderable weight in designating the federal\r\ncourts as the proper tribunals for the determination of controversies\r\nbetween different States and their citizens. And it ought to have the\r\nsame operation in regard to some cases between citizens of the same\r\nState. Claims to land under grants of different States, founded upon\r\nadverse pretensions of boundary, are of this description. The courts of\r\nneither of the granting States could be expected to be unbiased. The\r\nlaws may have even prejudged the question, and tied the courts down to\r\ndecisions in favor of the grants of the State to which they belonged.\r\nAnd even where this had not been done, it would be natural that the\r\njudges, as men, should feel a strong predilection to the claims of\r\ntheir own government.\r\n\r\nHaving thus laid down and discussed the principles which ought to\r\nregulate the constitution of the federal judiciary, we will proceed to\r\ntest, by these principles, the particular powers of which, according to\r\nthe plan of the convention, it is to be composed. It is to comprehend\r\n“all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws\r\nof the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under\r\ntheir authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public\r\nministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime\r\njurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a\r\nparty; to controversies between two or more States; between a State and\r\ncitizens of another State; between citizens of different States;\r\nbetween citizens of the same State claiming lands and grants of\r\ndifferent States; and between a State or the citizens thereof and\r\nforeign states, citizens, and subjects.” This constitutes the entire\r\nmass of the judicial authority of the Union. Let us now review it in\r\ndetail. It is, then, to extend:\r\n\r\nFirst. To all cases in law and equity, ARISING UNDER THE CONSTITUTION\r\nand THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. This corresponds with the two first\r\nclasses of causes, which have been enumerated, as proper for the\r\njurisdiction of the United States. It has been asked, what is meant by\r\n“cases arising under the Constitution,” in contradiction from those\r\n“arising under the laws of the United States”? The difference has been\r\nalready explained. All the restrictions upon the authority of the State\r\nlegislatures furnish examples of it. They are not, for instance, to\r\nemit paper money; but the interdiction results from the Constitution,\r\nand will have no connection with any law of the United States. Should\r\npaper money, notwithstanding, be emited, the controversies concerning\r\nit would be cases arising under the Constitution and not the laws of\r\nthe United States, in the ordinary signification of the terms. This may\r\nserve as a sample of the whole.\r\n\r\nIt has also been asked, what need of the word “equity What equitable\r\ncauses can grow out of the Constitution and laws of the United States?\r\nThere is hardly a subject of litigation between individuals, which may\r\nnot involve those ingredients of FRAUD, ACCIDENT, TRUST, or HARDSHIP,\r\nwhich would render the matter an object of equitable rather than of\r\nlegal jurisdiction, as the distinction is known and established in\r\nseveral of the States. It is the peculiar province, for instance, of a\r\ncourt of equity to relieve against what are called hard bargains: these\r\nare contracts in which, though there may have been no direct fraud or\r\ndeceit, sufficient to invalidate them in a court of law, yet there may\r\nhave been some undue and unconscionable advantage taken of the\r\nnecessities or misfortunes of one of the parties, which a court of\r\nequity would not tolerate. In such cases, where foreigners were\r\nconcerned on either side, it would be impossible for the federal\r\njudicatories to do justice without an equitable as well as a legal\r\njurisdiction. Agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants of\r\ndifferent States, may afford another example of the necessity of an\r\nequitable jurisdiction in the federal courts. This reasoning may not be\r\nso palpable in those States where the formal and technical distinction\r\nbetween LAW and EQUITY is not maintained, as in this State, where it is\r\nexemplified by every day’s practice.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary authority of the Union is to extend:\r\n\r\nSecond. To treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority\r\nof the United States, and to all cases affecting ambassadors, other\r\npublic ministers, and consuls. These belong to the fourth class of the\r\nenumerated cases, as they have an evident connection with the\r\npreservation of the national peace.\r\n\r\nThird. To cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. These form,\r\naltogether, the fifth of the enumerated classes of causes proper for\r\nthe cognizance of the national courts.\r\n\r\nFourth. To controversies to which the United States shall be a party.\r\nThese constitute the third of those classes.\r\n\r\nFifth. To controversies between two or more States; between a State and\r\ncitizens of another State; between citizens of different States. These\r\nbelong to the fourth of those classes, and partake, in some measure, of\r\nthe nature of the last.\r\n\r\nSixth. To cases between the citizens of the same State, CLAIMING LANDS\r\nUNDER GRANTS OF DIFFERENT STATES. These fall within the last class, and\r\nARE THE ONLY INSTANCES IN WHICH THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION DIRECTLY\r\nCONTEMPLATES THE COGNIZANCE OF DISPUTES BETWEEN THE CITIZENS OF THE\r\nSAME STATE.\r\n\r\nSeventh. To cases between a State and the citizens thereof, and foreign\r\nStates, citizens, or subjects. These have been already explained to\r\nbelong to the fourth of the enumerated classes, and have been shown to\r\nbe, in a peculiar manner, the proper subjects of the national\r\njudicature.\r\n\r\nFrom this review of the particular powers of the federal judiciary, as\r\nmarked out in the Constitution, it appears that they are all\r\nconformable to the principles which ought to have governed the\r\nstructure of that department, and which were necessary to the\r\nperfection of the system. If some partial inconviences should appear to\r\nbe connected with the incorporation of any of them into the plan, it\r\nought to be recollected that the national legislature will have ample\r\nauthority to make such EXCEPTIONS, and to prescribe such regulations as\r\nwill be calculated to obviate or remove these inconveniences. The\r\npossibility of particular mischiefs can never be viewed, by a\r\nwellinformed mind, as a solid objection to a general principle, which\r\nis calculated to avoid general mischiefs and to obtain general\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXXI.\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Continued, and the Distribution of the Judicial Authority\r\n\r\nFrom McLEAN’s Edition, New York.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the partition of the judiciary authority between\r\ndifferent courts, and their relations to each other, “The judicial\r\npower of the United States is” (by the plan of the convention) “to be\r\nvested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the\r\nCongress may, from time to time, ordain and establish.”[1]\r\n\r\nThat there ought to be one court of supreme and final jurisdiction, is\r\na proposition which is not likely to be contested. The reasons for it\r\nhave been assigned in another place, and are too obvious to need\r\nrepetition. The only question that seems to have been raised concerning\r\nit, is, whether it ought to be a distinct body or a branch of the\r\nlegislature. The same contradiction is observable in regard to this\r\nmatter which has been remarked in several other cases. The very men who\r\nobject to the Senate as a court of impeachments, on the ground of an\r\nimproper intermixture of powers, advocate, by implication at least, the\r\npropriety of vesting the ultimate decision of all causes, in the whole\r\nor in a part of the legislative body.\r\n\r\nThe arguments, or rather suggestions, upon which this charge is\r\nfounded, are to this effect: “The authority of the proposed Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, which is to be a separate and independent\r\nbody, will be superior to that of the legislature. The power of\r\nconstruing the laws according to the SPIRIT of the Constitution, will\r\nenable that court to mould them into whatever shape it may think\r\nproper; especially as its decisions will not be in any manner subject\r\nto the revision or correction of the legislative body. This is as\r\nunprecedented as it is dangerous. In Britain, the judical power, in the\r\nlast resort, resides in the House of Lords, which is a branch of the\r\nlegislature; and this part of the British government has been imitated\r\nin the State constitutions in general. The Parliament of Great Britain,\r\nand the legislatures of the several States, can at any time rectify, by\r\nlaw, the exceptionable decisions of their respective courts. But the\r\nerrors and usurpations of the Supreme Court of the United States will\r\nbe uncontrollable and remediless.” This, upon examination, will be\r\nfound to be made up altogether of false reasoning upon misconceived\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there is not a syllable in the plan under\r\nconsideration which DIRECTLY empowers the national courts to construe\r\nthe laws according to the spirit of the Constitution, or which gives\r\nthem any greater latitude in this respect than may be claimed by the\r\ncourts of every State. I admit, however, that the Constitution ought to\r\nbe the standard of construction for the laws, and that wherever there\r\nis an evident opposition, the laws ought to give place to the\r\nConstitution. But this doctrine is not deducible from any circumstance\r\npeculiar to the plan of the convention, but from the general theory of\r\na limited Constitution; and as far as it is true, is equally applicable\r\nto most, if not to all the State governments. There can be no\r\nobjection, therefore, on this account, to the federal judicature which\r\nwill not lie against the local judicatures in general, and which will\r\nnot serve to condemn every constitution that attempts to set bounds to\r\nlegislative discretion.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to consist in the\r\nparticular organization of the Supreme Court; in its being composed of\r\na distinct body of magistrates, instead of being one of the branches of\r\nthe legislature, as in the government of Great Britain and that of the\r\nState. To insist upon this point, the authors of the objection must\r\nrenounce the meaning they have labored to annex to the celebrated\r\nmaxim, requiring a separation of the departments of power. It shall,\r\nnevertheless, be conceded to them, agreeably to the interpretation\r\ngiven to that maxim in the course of these papers, that it is not\r\nviolated by vesting the ultimate power of judging in a PART of the\r\nlegislative body. But though this be not an absolute violation of that\r\nexcellent rule, yet it verges so nearly upon it, as on this account\r\nalone to be less eligible than the mode preferred by the convention.\r\nFrom a body which had even a partial agency in passing bad laws, we\r\ncould rarely expect a disposition to temper and moderate them in the\r\napplication. The same spirit which had operated in making them, would\r\nbe too apt in interpreting them; still less could it be expected that\r\nmen who had infringed the Constitution in the character of legislators,\r\nwould be disposed to repair the breach in the character of judges. Nor\r\nis this all. Every reason which recommends the tenure of good behavior\r\nfor judicial offices, militates against placing the judiciary power, in\r\nthe last resort, in a body composed of men chosen for a limited period.\r\nThere is an absurdity in referring the determination of causes, in the\r\nfirst instance, to judges of permanent standing; in the last, to those\r\nof a temporary and mutable constitution. And there is a still greater\r\nabsurdity in subjecting the decisions of men, selected for their\r\nknowledge of the laws, acquired by long and laborious study, to the\r\nrevision and control of men who, for want of the same advantage, cannot\r\nbut be deficient in that knowledge. The members of the legislature will\r\nrarely be chosen with a view to those qualifications which fit men for\r\nthe stations of judges; and as, on this account, there will be great\r\nreason to apprehend all the ill consequences of defective information,\r\nso, on account of the natural propensity of such bodies to party\r\ndivisions, there will be no less reason to fear that the pestilential\r\nbreath of faction may poison the fountains of justice. The habit of\r\nbeing continually marshalled on opposite sides will be too apt to\r\nstifle the voice both of law and of equity.\r\n\r\nThese considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those States who\r\nhave committed the judicial power, in the last resort, not to a part of\r\nthe legislature, but to distinct and independent bodies of men.\r\nContrary to the supposition of those who have represented the plan of\r\nthe convention, in this respect, as novel and unprecedented, it is but\r\na copy of the constitutions of New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, and Georgia; and the preference which has been given to those\r\nmodels is highly to be commended.\r\n\r\nIt is not true, in the second place, that the Parliament of Great\r\nBritain, or the legislatures of the particular States, can rectify the\r\nexceptionable decisions of their respective courts, in any other sense\r\nthan might be done by a future legislature of the United States. The\r\ntheory, neither of the British, nor the State constitutions, authorizes\r\nthe revisal of a judicial sentence by a legislative act. Nor is there\r\nany thing in the proposed Constitution, more than in either of them, by\r\nwhich it is forbidden. In the former, as well as in the latter, the\r\nimpropriety of the thing, on the general principles of law and reason,\r\nis the sole obstacle. A legislature, without exceeding its province,\r\ncannot reverse a determination once made in a particular case; though\r\nit may prescribe a new rule for future cases. This is the principle,\r\nand it applies in all its consequences, exactly in the same manner and\r\nextent, to the State governments, as to the national government now\r\nunder consideration. Not the least difference can be pointed out in any\r\nview of the subject.\r\n\r\nIt may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger of\r\njudiciary encroachments on the legislative authority, which has been\r\nupon many occasions reiterated, is in reality a phantom. Particular\r\nmisconstructions and contraventions of the will of the legislature may\r\nnow and then happen; but they can never be so extensive as to amount to\r\nan inconvenience, or in any sensible degree to affect the order of the\r\npolitical system. This may be inferred with certainty, from the general\r\nnature of the judicial power, from the objects to which it relates,\r\nfrom the manner in which it is exercised, from its comparative\r\nweakness, and from its total incapacity to support its usurpations by\r\nforce. And the inference is greatly fortified by the consideration of\r\nthe important constitutional check which the power of instituting\r\nimpeachments in one part of the legislative body, and of determining\r\nupon them in the other, would give to that body upon the members of the\r\njudicial department. This is alone a complete security. There never can\r\nbe danger that the judges, by a series of deliberate usurpations on the\r\nauthority of the legislature, would hazard the united resentment of the\r\nbody intrusted with it, while this body was possessed of the means of\r\npunishing their presumption, by degrading them from their stations.\r\nWhile this ought to remove all apprehensions on the subject, it\r\naffords, at the same time, a cogent argument for constituting the\r\nSenate a court for the trial of impeachments.\r\n\r\nHaving now examined, and, I trust, removed the objections to the\r\ndistinct and independent organization of the Supreme Court, I proceed\r\nto consider the propriety of the power of constituting inferior\r\ncourts,[2] and the relations which will subsist between these and the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nThe power of constituting inferior courts is evidently calculated to\r\nobviate the necessity of having recourse to the Supreme Court in every\r\ncase of federal cognizance. It is intended to enable the national\r\ngovernment to institute or AUTHORUZE, in each State or district of the\r\nUnited States, a tribunal competent to the determination of matters of\r\nnational jurisdiction within its limits.\r\n\r\nBut why, it is asked, might not the same purpose have been accomplished\r\nby the instrumentality of the State courts? This admits of different\r\nanswers. Though the fitness and competency of those courts should be\r\nallowed in the utmost latitude, yet the substance of the power in\r\nquestion may still be regarded as a necessary part of the plan, if it\r\nwere only to empower the national legislature to commit to them the\r\ncognizance of causes arising out of the national Constitution. To\r\nconfer the power of determining such causes upon the existing courts of\r\nthe several States, would perhaps be as much “to constitute tribunals,”\r\nas to create new courts with the like power. But ought not a more\r\ndirect and explicit provision to have been made in favor of the State\r\ncourts? There are, in my opinion, substantial reasons against such a\r\nprovision: the most discerning cannot foresee how far the prevalency of\r\na local spirit may be found to disqualify the local tribunals for the\r\njurisdiction of national causes; whilst every man may discover, that\r\ncourts constituted like those of some of the States would be improper\r\nchannels of the judicial authority of the Union. State judges, holding\r\ntheir offices during pleasure, or from year to year, will be too little\r\nindependent to be relied upon for an inflexible execution of the\r\nnational laws. And if there was a necessity for confiding the original\r\ncognizance of causes arising under those laws to them there would be a\r\ncorrespondent necessity for leaving the door of appeal as wide as\r\npossible. In proportion to the grounds of confidence in, or distrust\r\nof, the subordinate tribunals, ought to be the facility or difficulty\r\nof appeals. And well satisfied as I am of the propriety of the\r\nappellate jurisdiction, in the several classes of causes to which it is\r\nextended by the plan of the convention. I should consider every thing\r\ncalculated to give, in practice, an UNRESTRAINED COURSE to appeals, as\r\na source of public and private inconvenience.\r\n\r\nI am not sure, but that it will be found highly expedient and useful,\r\nto divide the United States into four or five or half a dozen\r\ndistricts; and to institute a federal court in each district, in lieu\r\nof one in every State. The judges of these courts, with the aid of the\r\nState judges, may hold circuits for the trial of causes in the several\r\nparts of the respective districts. Justice through them may be\r\nadministered with ease and despatch; and appeals may be safely\r\ncircumscribed within a narrow compass. This plan appears to me at\r\npresent the most eligible of any that could be adopted; and in order to\r\nit, it is necessary that the power of constituting inferior courts\r\nshould exist in the full extent in which it is to be found in the\r\nproposed Constitution.\r\n\r\nThese reasons seem sufficient to satisfy a candid mind, that the want\r\nof such a power would have been a great defect in the plan. Let us now\r\nexamine in what manner the judicial authority is to be distributed\r\nbetween the supreme and the inferior courts of the Union. The Supreme\r\nCourt is to be invested with original jurisdiction, only “in cases\r\naffecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and those\r\nin which A STATE shall be a party.” Public ministers of every class are\r\nthe immediate representatives of their sovereigns. All questions in\r\nwhich they are concerned are so directly connected with the public\r\npeace, that, as well for the preservation of this, as out of respect to\r\nthe sovereignties they represent, it is both expedient and proper that\r\nsuch questions should be submitted in the first instance to the highest\r\njudicatory of the nation. Though consuls have not in strictness a\r\ndiplomatic character, yet as they are the public agents of the nations\r\nto which they belong, the same observation is in a great measure\r\napplicable to them. In cases in which a State might happen to be a\r\nparty, it would ill suit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior\r\ntribunal. Though it may rather be a digression from the immediate\r\nsubject of this paper, I shall take occasion to mention here a\r\nsupposition which has excited some alarm upon very mistaken grounds. It\r\nhas been suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one\r\nState to the citizens of another, would enable them to prosecute that\r\nState in the federal courts for the amount of those securities; a\r\nsuggestion which the following considerations prove to be without\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nIt is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the\r\nsuit of an individual WITHOUT ITS CONSENT. This is the general sense,\r\nand the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the\r\nattributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every\r\nState in the Union. Unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this\r\nimmunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the States,\r\nand the danger intimated must be merely ideal. The circumstances which\r\nare necessary to produce an alienation of State sovereignty were\r\ndiscussed in considering the article of taxation, and need not be\r\nrepeated here. A recurrence to the principles there established will\r\nsatisfy us, that there is no color to pretend that the State\r\ngovernments would, by the adoption of that plan, be divested of the\r\nprivilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every\r\nconstraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith. The\r\ncontracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the\r\nconscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive\r\nforce. They confer no right of action, independent of the sovereign\r\nwill. To what purpose would it be to authorize suits against States for\r\nthe debts they owe? How could recoveries be enforced? It is evident, it\r\ncould not be done without waging war against the contracting State; and\r\nto ascribe to the federal courts, by mere implication, and in\r\ndestruction of a pre-existing right of the State governments, a power\r\nwhich would involve such a consequence, would be altogether forced and\r\nunwarrantable.\r\n\r\nLet us resume the train of our observations. We have seen that the\r\noriginal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court would be confined to two\r\nclasses of causes, and those of a nature rarely to occur. In all other\r\ncases of federal cognizance, the original jurisdiction would appertain\r\nto the inferior tribunals; and the Supreme Court would have nothing\r\nmore than an appellate jurisdiction, “with such EXCEPTIONS and under\r\nsuch REGULATIONS as the Congress shall make.”\r\n\r\nThe propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely called\r\nin question in regard to matters of law; but the clamors have been loud\r\nagainst it as applied to matters of fact. Some well-intentioned men in\r\nthis State, deriving their notions from the language and forms which\r\nobtain in our courts, have been induced to consider it as an implied\r\nsupersedure of the trial by jury, in favor of the civil-law mode of\r\ntrial, which prevails in our courts of admiralty, probate, and\r\nchancery. A technical sense has been affixed to the term “appellate,”\r\nwhich, in our law parlance, is commonly used in reference to appeals in\r\nthe course of the civil law. But if I am not misinformed, the same\r\nmeaning would not be given to it in any part of New England. There an\r\nappeal from one jury to another, is familiar both in language and\r\npractice, and is even a matter of course, until there have been two\r\nverdicts on one side. The word “appellate,” therefore, will not be\r\nunderstood in the same sense in New England as in New York, which shows\r\nthe impropriety of a technical interpretation derived from the\r\njurisprudence of any particular State. The expression, taken in the\r\nabstract, denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to review\r\nthe proceedings of another, either as to the law or fact, or both. The\r\nmode of doing it may depend on ancient custom or legislative provision\r\n(in a new government it must depend on the latter), and may be with or\r\nwithout the aid of a jury, as may be judged advisable. If, therefore,\r\nthe re-examination of a fact once determined by a jury, should in any\r\ncase be admitted under the proposed Constitution, it may be so\r\nregulated as to be done by a second jury, either by remanding the cause\r\nto the court below for a second trial of the fact, or by directing an\r\nissue immediately out of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nBut it does not follow that the re-examination of a fact once\r\nascertained by a jury, will be permitted in the Supreme Court. Why may\r\nnot it be said, with the strictest propriety, when a writ of error is\r\nbrought from an inferior to a superior court of law in this State, that\r\nthe latter has jurisdiction of the fact as well as the law? It is true\r\nit cannot institute a new inquiry concerning the fact, but it takes\r\ncognizance of it as it appears upon the record, and pronounces the law\r\narising upon it.[3] This is jurisdiction of both fact and law; nor is\r\nit even possible to separate them. Though the common-law courts of this\r\nState ascertain disputed facts by a jury, yet they unquestionably have\r\njurisdiction of both fact and law; and accordingly when the former is\r\nagreed in the pleadings, they have no recourse to a jury, but proceed\r\nat once to judgment. I contend, therefore, on this ground, that the\r\nexpressions, “appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact,” do not\r\nnecessarily imply a re-examination in the Supreme Court of facts\r\ndecided by juries in the inferior courts.\r\n\r\nThe following train of ideas may well be imagined to have influenced\r\nthe convention, in relation to this particular provision. The appellate\r\njurisdiction of the Supreme Court (it may have been argued) will extend\r\nto causes determinable in different modes, some in the course of the\r\nCOMMON LAW, others in the course of the CIVIL LAW. In the former, the\r\nrevision of the law only will be, generally speaking, the proper\r\nprovince of the Supreme Court; in the latter, the re-examination of the\r\nfact is agreeable to usage, and in some cases, of which prize causes\r\nare an example, might be essential to the preservation of the public\r\npeace. It is therefore necessary that the appellate jurisdiction\r\nshould, in certain cases, extend in the broadest sense to matters of\r\nfact. It will not answer to make an express exception of cases which\r\nshall have been originally tried by a jury, because in the courts of\r\nsome of the States ALL CAUSES are tried in this mode;[4] and such an\r\nexception would preclude the revision of matters of fact, as well where\r\nit might be proper, as where it might be improper. To avoid all\r\ninconveniencies, it will be safest to declare generally, that the\r\nSupreme Court shall possess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and\r\nFACT, and that this jurisdiction shall be subject to such EXCEPTIONS\r\nand regulations as the national legislature may prescribe. This will\r\nenable the government to modify it in such a manner as will best answer\r\nthe ends of public justice and security.\r\n\r\nThis view of the matter, at any rate, puts it out of all doubt that the\r\nsupposed ABOLITION of the trial by jury, by the operation of this\r\nprovision, is fallacious and untrue. The legislature of the United\r\nStates would certainly have full power to provide, that in appeals to\r\nthe Supreme Court there should be no re-examination of facts where they\r\nhad been tried in the original causes by juries. This would certainly\r\nbe an authorized exception; but if, for the reason already intimated,\r\nit should be thought too extensive, it might be qualified with a\r\nlimitation to such causes only as are determinable at common law in\r\nthat mode of trial.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the observations hitherto made on the authority of the\r\njudicial department is this: that it has been carefully restricted to\r\nthose causes which are manifestly proper for the cognizance of the\r\nnational judicature; that in the partition of this authority a very\r\nsmall portion of original jurisdiction has been preserved to the\r\nSupreme Court, and the rest consigned to the subordinate tribunals;\r\nthat the Supreme Court will possess an appellate jurisdiction, both as\r\nto law and fact, in all the cases referred to them, both subject to any\r\nEXCEPTIONS and REGULATIONS which may be thought advisable; that this\r\nappellate jurisdiction does, in no case, ABOLISH the trial by jury; and\r\nthat an ordinary degree of prudence and integrity in the national\r\ncouncils will insure us solid advantages from the establishment of the\r\nproposed judiciary, without exposing us to any of the inconveniences\r\nwhich have been predicted from that source.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] Article 3, sec. 1.\r\n\r\n [2] This power has been absurdly represented as intended to abolish\r\n all the county courts in the several States, which are commonly called\r\n inferior courts. But the expressions of the Constitution are, to\r\n constitute “tribunals INFERIOR TO THE SUPREME COURT”; and the evident\r\n design of the provision is to enable the institution of local courts,\r\n subordinate to the Supreme, either in States or larger districts. It\r\n is ridiculous to imagine that county courts were in contemplation.\r\n\r\n [3] This word is composed of JUS and DICTIO, juris dictio or a\r\n speaking and pronouncing of the law.\r\n\r\n [4] I hold that the States will have concurrent jurisdiction with the\r\n subordinate federal judicatories, in many cases of federal cognizance,\r\n as will be explained in my next paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXXII.\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Continued\r\n\r\nFrom McLEAN’s Edition, New York.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may\r\ndistinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy\r\nand nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow\r\nfrom the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or\r\npartial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties. ’T is time\r\nonly that can mature and perfect so compound a system, can liquidate\r\nthe meaning of all the parts, and can adjust them to each other in a\r\nharmonious and consistent WHOLE.\r\n\r\nSuch questions, accordingly, have arisen upon the plan proposed by the\r\nconvention, and particularly concerning the judiciary department. The\r\nprincipal of these respect the situation of the State courts in regard\r\nto those causes which are to be submitted to federal jurisdiction. Is\r\nthis to be exclusive, or are those courts to possess a concurrent\r\njurisdiction? If the latter, in what relation will they stand to the\r\nnational tribunals? These are inquiries which we meet with in the\r\nmouths of men of sense, and which are certainly entitled to attention.\r\n\r\nThe principles established in a former paper[1] teach us that the\r\nStates will retain all PRE-EXISTING authorities which may not be\r\nexclusively delegated to the federal head; and that this exclusive\r\ndelegation can only exist in one of three cases: where an exclusive\r\nauthority is, in express terms, granted to the Union; or where a\r\nparticular authority is granted to the Union, and the exercise of a\r\nlike authority is prohibited to the States; or where an authority is\r\ngranted to the Union, with which a similar authority in the States\r\nwould be utterly incompatible. Though these principles may not apply\r\nwith the same force to the judiciary as to the legislative power, yet I\r\nam inclined to think that they are, in the main, just with respect to\r\nthe former, as well as the latter. And under this impression, I shall\r\nlay it down as a rule, that the State courts will RETAIN the\r\njurisdiction they now have, unless it appears to be taken away in one\r\nof the enumerated modes.\r\n\r\nThe only thing in the proposed Constitution, which wears the appearance\r\nof confining the causes of federal cognizance to the federal courts, is\r\ncontained in this passage: “The JUDICIAL POWER of the United States\r\nSHALL BE VESTED in one Supreme Court, and in SUCH inferior courts as\r\nthe Congress shall from time to time ordain and establish.” This might\r\neither be construed to signify, that the supreme and subordinate courts\r\nof the Union should alone have the power of deciding those causes to\r\nwhich their authority is to extend; or simply to denote, that the\r\norgans of the national judiciary should be one Supreme Court, and as\r\nmany subordinate courts as Congress should think proper to appoint; or\r\nin other words, that the United States should exercise the judicial\r\npower with which they are to be invested, through one supreme tribunal,\r\nand a certain number of inferior ones, to be instituted by them. The\r\nfirst excludes, the last admits, the concurrent jurisdiction of the\r\nState tribunals; and as the first would amount to an alienation of\r\nState power by implication, the last appears to me the most natural and\r\nthe most defensible construction.\r\n\r\nBut this doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction is only clearly applicable\r\nto those descriptions of causes of which the State courts have previous\r\ncognizance. It is not equally evident in relation to cases which may\r\ngrow out of, and be PECULIAR to, the Constitution to be established;\r\nfor not to allow the State courts a right of jurisdiction in such\r\ncases, can hardly be considered as the abridgment of a pre-existing\r\nauthority. I mean not therefore to contend that the United States, in\r\nthe course of legislation upon the objects intrusted to their\r\ndirection, may not commit the decision of causes arising upon a\r\nparticular regulation to the federal courts solely, if such a measure\r\nshould be deemed expedient; but I hold that the State courts will be\r\ndivested of no part of their primitive jurisdiction, further than may\r\nrelate to an appeal; and I am even of opinion that in every case in\r\nwhich they were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the\r\nnational legislature, they will of course take cognizance of the causes\r\nto which those acts may give birth. This I infer from the nature of\r\njudiciary power, and from the general genius of the system. The\r\njudiciary power of every government looks beyond its own local or\r\nmunicipal laws, and in civil cases lays hold of all subjects of\r\nlitigation between parties within its jurisdiction, though the causes\r\nof dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the\r\nglobe. Those of Japan, not less than of New York, may furnish the\r\nobjects of legal discussion to our courts. When in addition to this we\r\nconsider the State governments and the national governments, as they\r\ntruly are, in the light of kindred systems, and as parts of ONE WHOLE,\r\nthe inference seems to be conclusive, that the State courts would have\r\na concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under the laws of the\r\nUnion, where it was not expressly prohibited.\r\n\r\nHere another question occurs: What relation would subsist between the\r\nnational and State courts in these instances of concurrent\r\njurisdiction? I answer, that an appeal would certainly lie from the\r\nlatter, to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Constitution in\r\ndirect terms gives an appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in\r\nall the enumerated cases of federal cognizance in which it is not to\r\nhave an original one, without a single expression to confine its\r\noperation to the inferior federal courts. The objects of appeal, not\r\nthe tribunals from which it is to be made, are alone contemplated. From\r\nthis circumstance, and from the reason of the thing, it ought to be\r\nconstrued to extend to the State tribunals. Either this must be the\r\ncase, or the local courts must be excluded from a concurrent\r\njurisdiction in matters of national concern, else the judiciary\r\nauthority of the Union may be eluded at the pleasure of every plaintiff\r\nor prosecutor. Neither of these consequences ought, without evident\r\nnecessity, to be involved; the latter would be entirely inadmissible,\r\nas it would defeat some of the most important and avowed purposes of\r\nthe proposed government, and would essentially embarrass its measures.\r\nNor do I perceive any foundation for such a supposition. Agreeably to\r\nthe remark already made, the national and State systems are to be\r\nregarded as ONE WHOLE. The courts of the latter will of course be\r\nnatural auxiliaries to the execution of the laws of the Union, and an\r\nappeal from them will as naturally lie to that tribunal which is\r\ndestined to unite and assimilate the principles of national justice and\r\nthe rules of national decisions. The evident aim of the plan of the\r\nconvention is, that all the causes of the specified classes shall, for\r\nweighty public reasons, receive their original or final determination\r\nin the courts of the Union. To confine, therefore, the general\r\nexpressions giving appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, to\r\nappeals from the subordinate federal courts, instead of allowing their\r\nextension to the State courts, would be to abridge the latitude of the\r\nterms, in subversion of the intent, contrary to every sound rule of\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nBut could an appeal be made to lie from the State courts to the\r\nsubordinate federal judicatories? This is another of the questions\r\nwhich have been raised, and of greater difficulty than the former. The\r\nfollowing considerations countenance the affirmative. The plan of the\r\nconvention, in the first place, authorizes the national legislature “to\r\nconstitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court.”[2] It declares, in\r\nthe next place, that “the JUDICIAL POWER of the United States SHALL BE\r\nVESTED in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as Congress\r\nshall ordain and establish”; and it then proceeds to enumerate the\r\ncases to which this judicial power shall extend. It afterwards divides\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Supreme Court into original and appellate, but\r\ngives no definition of that of the subordinate courts. The only\r\noutlines described for them, are that they shall be “inferior to the\r\nSupreme Court,” and that they shall not exceed the specified limits of\r\nthe federal judiciary. Whether their authority shall be original or\r\nappellate, or both, is not declared. All this seems to be left to the\r\ndiscretion of the legislature. And this being the case, I perceive at\r\npresent no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from the State\r\ncourts to the subordinate national tribunals; and many advantages\r\nattending the power of doing it may be imagined. It would diminish the\r\nmotives to the multiplication of federal courts, and would admit of\r\narrangements calculated to contract the appellate jurisdiction of the\r\nSupreme Court. The State tribunals may then be left with a more entire\r\ncharge of federal causes; and appeals, in most cases in which they may\r\nbe deemed proper, instead of being carried to the Supreme Court, may be\r\nmade to lie from the State courts to district courts of the Union.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] No. 32.\r\n\r\n [2] Section 8, Article 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Continued in Relation to Trial by Jury\r\n\r\nFrom MCLEAN’s Edition, New York.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nThe objection to the plan of the convention, which has met with most\r\nsuccess in this State, and perhaps in several of the other States, is\r\nTHAT RELATIVE TO THE WANT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION for the trial\r\nby jury in civil cases. The disingenuous form in which this objection\r\nis usually stated has been repeatedly adverted to and exposed, but\r\ncontinues to be pursued in all the conversations and writings of the\r\nopponents of the plan. The mere silence of the Constitution in regard\r\nto CIVIL CAUSES, is represented as an abolition of the trial by jury,\r\nand the declamations to which it has afforded a pretext are artfully\r\ncalculated to induce a persuasion that this pretended abolition is\r\ncomplete and universal, extending not only to every species of civil,\r\nbut even to CRIMINAL CAUSES. To argue with respect to the latter would,\r\nhowever, be as vain and fruitless as to attempt the serious proof of\r\nthe EXISTENCE of MATTER, or to demonstrate any of those propositions\r\nwhich, by their own internal evidence, force conviction, when expressed\r\nin language adapted to convey their meaning.\r\n\r\nWith regard to civil causes, subtleties almost too contemptible for\r\nrefutation have been employed to countenance the surmise that a thing\r\nwhich is only NOT PROVIDED FOR, is entirely ABOLISHED. Every man of\r\ndiscernment must at once perceive the wide difference between SILENCE\r\nand ABOLITION. But as the inventors of this fallacy have attempted to\r\nsupport it by certain LEGAL MAXIMS of interpretation, which they have\r\nperverted from their true meaning, it may not be wholly useless to\r\nexplore the ground they have taken.\r\n\r\nThe maxims on which they rely are of this nature: “A specification of\r\nparticulars is an exclusion of generals”; or, “The expression of one\r\nthing is the exclusion of another.” Hence, say they, as the\r\nConstitution has established the trial by jury in criminal cases, and\r\nis silent in respect to civil, this silence is an implied prohibition\r\nof trial by jury in regard to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe rules of legal interpretation are rules of COMMONSENSE, adopted by\r\nthe courts in the construction of the laws. The true test, therefore,\r\nof a just application of them is its conformity to the source from\r\nwhich they are derived. This being the case, let me ask if it is\r\nconsistent with common-sense to suppose that a provision obliging the\r\nlegislative power to commit the trial of criminal causes to juries, is\r\na privation of its right to authorize or permit that mode of trial in\r\nother cases? Is it natural to suppose, that a command to do one thing\r\nis a prohibition to the doing of another, which there was a previous\r\npower to do, and which is not incompatible with the thing commanded to\r\nbe done? If such a supposition would be unnatural and unreasonable, it\r\ncannot be rational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury\r\nin certain cases is an interdiction of it in others.\r\n\r\nA power to constitute courts is a power to prescribe the mode of trial;\r\nand consequently, if nothing was said in the Constitution on the\r\nsubject of juries, the legislature would be at liberty either to adopt\r\nthat institution or to let it alone. This discretion, in regard to\r\ncriminal causes, is abridged by the express injunction of trial by jury\r\nin all such cases; but it is, of course, left at large in relation to\r\ncivil causes, there being a total silence on this head. The\r\nspecification of an obligation to try all criminal causes in a\r\nparticular mode, excludes indeed the obligation or necessity of\r\nemploying the same mode in civil causes, but does not abridge THE POWER\r\nof the legislature to exercise that mode if it should be thought\r\nproper. The pretense, therefore, that the national legislature would\r\nnot be at full liberty to submit all the civil causes of federal\r\ncognizance to the determination of juries, is a pretense destitute of\r\nall just foundation.\r\n\r\nFrom these observations this conclusion results: that the trial by jury\r\nin civil cases would not be abolished; and that the use attempted to be\r\nmade of the maxims which have been quoted, is contrary to reason and\r\ncommon-sense, and therefore not admissible. Even if these maxims had a\r\nprecise technical sense, corresponding with the idea of those who\r\nemploy them upon the present occasion, which, however, is not the case,\r\nthey would still be inapplicable to a constitution of government. In\r\nrelation to such a subject, the natural and obvious sense of its\r\nprovisions, apart from any technical rules, is the true criterion of\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nHaving now seen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the use made\r\nof them, let us endeavor to ascertain their proper use and true\r\nmeaning. This will be best done by examples. The plan of the convention\r\ndeclares that the power of Congress, or, in other words, of the\r\nNATIONAL LEGISLATURE, shall extend to certain enumerated cases. This\r\nspecification of particulars evidently excludes all pretension to a\r\ngeneral legislative authority, because an affirmative grant of special\r\npowers would be absurd, as well as useless, if a general authority was\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the judicial authority of the federal judicatures is\r\ndeclared by the Constitution to comprehend certain cases particularly\r\nspecified. The expression of those cases marks the precise limits,\r\nbeyond which the federal courts cannot extend their jurisdiction,\r\nbecause the objects of their cognizance being enumerated, the\r\nspecification would be nugatory if it did not exclude all ideas of more\r\nextensive authority.\r\n\r\nThese examples are sufficient to elucidate the maxims which have been\r\nmentioned, and to designate the manner in which they should be used.\r\nBut that there may be no misapprehensions upon this subject, I shall\r\nadd one case more, to demonstrate the proper use of these maxims, and\r\nthe abuse which has been made of them.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that by the laws of this State a married woman was\r\nincapable of conveying her estate, and that the legislature,\r\nconsidering this as an evil, should enact that she might dispose of her\r\nproperty by deed executed in the presence of a magistrate. In such a\r\ncase there can be no doubt but the specification would amount to an\r\nexclusion of any other mode of conveyance, because the woman having no\r\nprevious power to alienate her property, the specification determines\r\nthe particular mode which she is, for that purpose, to avail herself\r\nof. But let us further suppose that in a subsequent part of the same\r\nact it should be declared that no woman should dispose of any estate of\r\na determinate value without the consent of three of her nearest\r\nrelations, signified by their signing the deed; could it be inferred\r\nfrom this regulation that a married woman might not procure the\r\napprobation of her relations to a deed for conveying property of\r\ninferior value? The position is too absurd to merit a refutation, and\r\nyet this is precisely the position which those must establish who\r\ncontend that the trial by juries in civil cases is abolished, because\r\nit is expressly provided for in cases of a criminal nature.\r\n\r\nFrom these observations it must appear unquestionably true, that trial\r\nby jury is in no case abolished by the proposed Constitution, and it is\r\nequally true, that in those controversies between individuals in which\r\nthe great body of the people are likely to be interested, that\r\ninstitution will remain precisely in the same situation in which it is\r\nplaced by the State constitutions, and will be in no degree altered or\r\ninfluenced by the adoption of the plan under consideration. The\r\nfoundation of this assertion is, that the national judiciary will have\r\nno cognizance of them, and of course they will remain determinable as\r\nheretofore by the State courts only, and in the manner which the State\r\nconstitutions and laws prescribe. All land causes, except where claims\r\nunder the grants of different States come into question, and all other\r\ncontroversies between the citizens of the same State, unless where they\r\ndepend upon positive violations of the articles of union, by acts of\r\nthe State legislatures, will belong exclusively to the jurisdiction of\r\nthe State tribunals. Add to this, that admiralty causes, and almost all\r\nthose which are of equity jurisdiction, are determinable under our own\r\ngovernment without the intervention of a jury, and the inference from\r\nthe whole will be, that this institution, as it exists with us at\r\npresent, cannot possibly be affected to any great extent by the\r\nproposed alteration in our system of government.\r\n\r\nThe friends and adversaries of the plan of the convention, if they\r\nagree in nothing else, concur at least in the value they set upon the\r\ntrial by jury; or if there is any difference between them it consists\r\nin this: the former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty; the\r\nlatter represent it as the very palladium of free government. For my\r\nown part, the more the operation of the institution has fallen under my\r\nobservation, the more reason I have discovered for holding it in high\r\nestimation; and it would be altogether superfluous to examine to what\r\nextent it deserves to be esteemed useful or essential in a\r\nrepresentative republic, or how much more merit it may be entitled to,\r\nas a defense against the oppressions of an hereditary monarch, than as\r\na barrier to the tyranny of popular magistrates in a popular\r\ngovernment. Discussions of this kind would be more curious than\r\nbeneficial, as all are satisfied of the utility of the institution, and\r\nof its friendly aspect to liberty. But I must acknowledge that I cannot\r\nreadily discern the inseparable connection between the existence of\r\nliberty, and the trial by jury in civil cases. Arbitrary impeachments,\r\narbitrary methods of prosecuting pretended offenses, and arbitrary\r\npunishments upon arbitrary convictions, have ever appeared to me to be\r\nthe great engines of judicial despotism; and these have all relation to\r\ncriminal proceedings. The trial by jury in criminal cases, aided by the\r\nhabeas-corpus act, seems therefore to be alone concerned in the\r\nquestion. And both of these are provided for, in the most ample manner,\r\nin the plan of the convention.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, that trial by jury is a safeguard against an\r\noppressive exercise of the power of taxation. This observation deserves\r\nto be canvassed.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that it can have no influence upon the legislature, in\r\nregard to the AMOUNT of taxes to be laid, to the OBJECTS upon which\r\nthey are to be imposed, or to the RULE by which they are to be\r\napportioned. If it can have any influence, therefore, it must be upon\r\nthe mode of collection, and the conduct of the officers intrusted with\r\nthe execution of the revenue laws.\r\n\r\nAs to the mode of collection in this State, under our own Constitution,\r\nthe trial by jury is in most cases out of use. The taxes are usually\r\nlevied by the more summary proceeding of distress and sale, as in cases\r\nof rent. And it is acknowledged on all hands, that this is essential to\r\nthe efficacy of the revenue laws. The dilatory course of a trial at law\r\nto recover the taxes imposed on individuals, would neither suit the\r\nexigencies of the public nor promote the convenience of the citizens.\r\nIt would often occasion an accumulation of costs, more burdensome than\r\nthe original sum of the tax to be levied.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue, the provision in\r\nfavor of trial by jury in criminal cases, will afford the security\r\naimed at. Wilful abuses of a public authority, to the oppression of the\r\nsubject, and every species of official extortion, are offenses against\r\nthe government, for which the persons who commit them may be indicted\r\nand punished according to the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of the trial by jury in civil cases appears to depend on\r\ncircumstances foreign to the preservation of liberty. The strongest\r\nargument in its favor is, that it is a security against corruption. As\r\nthere is always more time and better opportunity to tamper with a\r\nstanding body of magistrates than with a jury summoned for the\r\noccasion, there is room to suppose that a corrupt influence would more\r\neasily find its way to the former than to the latter. The force of this\r\nconsideration is, however, diminished by others. The sheriff, who is\r\nthe summoner of ordinary juries, and the clerks of courts, who have the\r\nnomination of special juries, are themselves standing officers, and,\r\nacting individually, may be supposed more accessible to the touch of\r\ncorruption than the judges, who are a collective body. It is not\r\ndifficult to see, that it would be in the power of those officers to\r\nselect jurors who would serve the purpose of the party as well as a\r\ncorrupted bench. In the next place, it may fairly be supposed, that\r\nthere would be less difficulty in gaining some of the jurors\r\npromiscuously taken from the public mass, than in gaining men who had\r\nbeen chosen by the government for their probity and good character. But\r\nmaking every deduction for these considerations, the trial by jury must\r\nstill be a valuable check upon corruption. It greatly multiplies the\r\nimpediments to its success. As matters now stand, it would be necessary\r\nto corrupt both court and jury; for where the jury have gone evidently\r\nwrong, the court will generally grant a new trial, and it would be in\r\nmost cases of little use to practice upon the jury, unless the court\r\ncould be likewise gained. Here then is a double security; and it will\r\nreadily be perceived that this complicated agency tends to preserve the\r\npurity of both institutions. By increasing the obstacles to success, it\r\ndiscourages attempts to seduce the integrity of either. The temptations\r\nto prostitution which the judges might have to surmount, must certainly\r\nbe much fewer, while the co-operation of a jury is necessary, than they\r\nmight be, if they had themselves the exclusive determination of all\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, therefore, the doubts I have expressed, as to the\r\nessentiality of trial by jury in civil cases to liberty, I admit that\r\nit is in most cases, under proper regulations, an excellent method of\r\ndetermining questions of property; and that on this account alone it\r\nwould be entitled to a constitutional provision in its favor if it were\r\npossible to fix the limits within which it ought to be comprehended.\r\nThere is, however, in all cases, great difficulty in this; and men not\r\nblinded by enthusiasm must be sensible that in a federal government,\r\nwhich is a composition of societies whose ideas and institutions in\r\nrelation to the matter materially vary from each other, that difficulty\r\nmust be not a little augmented. For my own part, at every new view I\r\ntake of the subject, I become more convinced of the reality of the\r\nobstacles which, we are authoritatively informed, prevented the\r\ninsertion of a provision on this head in the plan of the convention.\r\n\r\nThe great difference between the limits of the jury trial in different\r\nStates is not generally understood; and as it must have considerable\r\ninfluence on the sentence we ought to pass upon the omission complained\r\nof in regard to this point, an explanation of it is necessary. In this\r\nState, our judicial establishments resemble, more nearly than in any\r\nother, those of Great Britain. We have courts of common law, courts of\r\nprobates (analogous in certain matters to the spiritual courts in\r\nEngland), a court of admiralty and a court of chancery. In the courts\r\nof common law only, the trial by jury prevails, and this with some\r\nexceptions. In all the others a single judge presides, and proceeds in\r\ngeneral either according to the course of the canon or civil law,\r\nwithout the aid of a jury.[1] In New Jersey, there is a court of\r\nchancery which proceeds like ours, but neither courts of admiralty nor\r\nof probates, in the sense in which these last are established with us.\r\nIn that State the courts of common law have the cognizance of those\r\ncauses which with us are determinable in the courts of admiralty and of\r\nprobates, and of course the jury trial is more extensive in New Jersey\r\nthan in New York. In Pennsylvania, this is perhaps still more the case,\r\nfor there is no court of chancery in that State, and its common-law\r\ncourts have equity jurisdiction. It has a court of admiralty, but none\r\nof probates, at least on the plan of ours. Delaware has in these\r\nrespects imitated Pennsylvania. Maryland approaches more nearly to New\r\nYork, as does also Virginia, except that the latter has a plurality of\r\nchancellors. North Carolina bears most affinity to Pennsylvania; South\r\nCarolina to Virginia. I believe, however, that in some of those States\r\nwhich have distinct courts of admiralty, the causes depending in them\r\nare triable by juries. In Georgia there are none but common-law courts,\r\nand an appeal of course lies from the verdict of one jury to another,\r\nwhich is called a special jury, and for which a particular mode of\r\nappointment is marked out. In Connecticut, they have no distinct courts\r\neither of chancery or of admiralty, and their courts of probates have\r\nno jurisdiction of causes. Their common-law courts have admiralty and,\r\nto a certain extent, equity jurisdiction. In cases of importance, their\r\nGeneral Assembly is the only court of chancery. In Connecticut,\r\ntherefore, the trial by jury extends in PRACTICE further than in any\r\nother State yet mentioned. Rhode Island is, I believe, in this\r\nparticular, pretty much in the situation of Connecticut. Massachusetts\r\nand New Hampshire, in regard to the blending of law, equity, and\r\nadmiralty jurisdictions, are in a similar predicament. In the four\r\nEastern States, the trial by jury not only stands upon a broader\r\nfoundation than in the other States, but it is attended with a\r\npeculiarity unknown, in its full extent, to any of them. There is an\r\nappeal OF COURSE from one jury to another, till there have been two\r\nverdicts out of three on one side.\r\n\r\nFrom this sketch it appears that there is a material diversity, as well\r\nin the modification as in the extent of the institution of trial by\r\njury in civil cases, in the several States; and from this fact these\r\nobvious reflections flow: first, that no general rule could have been\r\nfixed upon by the convention which would have corresponded with the\r\ncircumstances of all the States; and secondly, that more or at least as\r\nmuch might have been hazarded by taking the system of any one State for\r\na standard, as by omitting a provision altogether and leaving the\r\nmatter, as has been done, to legislative regulation.\r\n\r\nThe propositions which have been made for supplying the omission have\r\nrather served to illustrate than to obviate the difficulty of the\r\nthing. The minority of Pennsylvania have proposed this mode of\r\nexpression for the purpose “Trial by jury shall be as heretofore” and\r\nthis I maintain would be senseless and nugatory. The United States, in\r\ntheir united or collective capacity, are the OBJECT to which all\r\ngeneral provisions in the Constitution must necessarily be construed to\r\nrefer. Now it is evident that though trial by jury, with various\r\nlimitations, is known in each State individually, yet in the United\r\nStates, AS SUCH, it is at this time altogether unknown, because the\r\npresent federal government has no judiciary power whatever; and\r\nconsequently there is no proper antecedent or previous establishment to\r\nwhich the term HERETOFORE could relate. It would therefore be destitute\r\nof a precise meaning, and inoperative from its uncertainty.\r\n\r\nAs, on the one hand, the form of the provision would not fulfil the\r\nintent of its proposers, so, on the other, if I apprehend that intent\r\nrightly, it would be in itself inexpedient. I presume it to be, that\r\ncauses in the federal courts should be tried by jury, if, in the State\r\nwhere the courts sat, that mode of trial would obtain in a similar case\r\nin the State courts; that is to say, admiralty causes should be tried\r\nin Connecticut by a jury, in New York without one. The capricious\r\noperation of so dissimilar a method of trial in the same cases, under\r\nthe same government, is of itself sufficient to indispose every\r\nwellregulated judgment towards it. Whether the cause should be tried\r\nwith or without a jury, would depend, in a great number of cases, on\r\nthe accidental situation of the court and parties.\r\n\r\nBut this is not, in my estimation, the greatest objection. I feel a\r\ndeep and deliberate conviction that there are many cases in which the\r\ntrial by jury is an ineligible one. I think it so particularly in cases\r\nwhich concern the public peace with foreign nations that is, in most\r\ncases where the question turns wholly on the laws of nations. Of this\r\nnature, among others, are all prize causes. Juries cannot be supposed\r\ncompetent to investigations that require a thorough knowledge of the\r\nlaws and usages of nations; and they will sometimes be under the\r\ninfluence of impressions which will not suffer them to pay sufficient\r\nregard to those considerations of public policy which ought to guide\r\ntheir inquiries. There would of course be always danger that the rights\r\nof other nations might be infringed by their decisions, so as to afford\r\noccasions of reprisal and war. Though the proper province of juries be\r\nto determine matters of fact, yet in most cases legal consequences are\r\ncomplicated with fact in such a manner as to render a separation\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nIt will add great weight to this remark, in relation to prize causes,\r\nto mention that the method of determining them has been thought worthy\r\nof particular regulation in various treaties between different powers\r\nof Europe, and that, pursuant to such treaties, they are determinable\r\nin Great Britain, in the last resort, before the king himself, in his\r\nprivy council, where the fact, as well as the law, undergoes a\r\nre-examination. This alone demonstrates the impolicy of inserting a\r\nfundamental provision in the Constitution which would make the State\r\nsystems a standard for the national government in the article under\r\nconsideration, and the danger of encumbering the government with any\r\nconstitutional provisions the propriety of which is not indisputable.\r\n\r\nMy convictions are equally strong that great advantages result from the\r\nseparation of the equity from the law jurisdiction, and that the causes\r\nwhich belong to the former would be improperly committed to juries. The\r\ngreat and primary use of a court of equity is to give relief IN\r\nEXTRAORDINARY CASES, which are EXCEPTIONS[2] to general rules. To unite\r\nthe jurisdiction of such cases with the ordinary jurisdiction, must\r\nhave a tendency to unsettle the general rules, and to subject every\r\ncase that arises to a SPECIAL determination; while a separation of the\r\none from the other has the contrary effect of rendering one a sentinel\r\nover the other, and of keeping each within the expedient limits.\r\nBesides this, the circumstances that constitute cases proper for courts\r\nof equity are in many instances so nice and intricate, that they are\r\nincompatible with the genius of trials by jury. They require often such\r\nlong, deliberate, and critical investigation as would be impracticable\r\nto men called from their occupations, and obliged to decide before they\r\nwere permitted to return to them. The simplicity and expedition which\r\nform the distinguishing characters of this mode of trial require that\r\nthe matter to be decided should be reduced to some single and obvious\r\npoint; while the litigations usual in chancery frequently comprehend a\r\nlong train of minute and independent particulars.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the separation of the equity from the legal\r\njurisdiction is peculiar to the English system of jurisprudence: which\r\nis the model that has been followed in several of the States. But it is\r\nequally true that the trial by jury has been unknown in every case in\r\nwhich they have been united. And the separation is essential to the\r\npreservation of that institution in its pristine purity. The nature of\r\na court of equity will readily permit the extension of its jurisdiction\r\nto matters of law; but it is not a little to be suspected, that the\r\nattempt to extend the jurisdiction of the courts of law to matters of\r\nequity will not only be unproductive of the advantages which may be\r\nderived from courts of chancery, on the plan upon which they are\r\nestablished in this State, but will tend gradually to change the nature\r\nof the courts of law, and to undermine the trial by jury, by\r\nintroducing questions too complicated for a decision in that mode.\r\n\r\nThese appeared to be conclusive reasons against incorporating the\r\nsystems of all the States, in the formation of the national judiciary,\r\naccording to what may be conjectured to have been the attempt of the\r\nPennsylvania minority. Let us now examine how far the proposition of\r\nMassachusetts is calculated to remedy the supposed defect.\r\n\r\nIt is in this form: “In civil actions between citizens of different\r\nStates, every issue of fact, arising in ACTIONS AT COMMON LAW, may be\r\ntried by a jury if the parties, or either of them request it.”\r\n\r\nThis, at best, is a proposition confined to one description of causes;\r\nand the inference is fair, either that the Massachusetts convention\r\nconsidered that as the only class of federal causes, in which the trial\r\nby jury would be proper; or that if desirous of a more extensive\r\nprovision, they found it impracticable to devise one which would\r\nproperly answer the end. If the first, the omission of a regulation\r\nrespecting so partial an object can never be considered as a material\r\nimperfection in the system. If the last, it affords a strong\r\ncorroboration of the extreme difficulty of the thing.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all: if we advert to the observations already made\r\nrespecting the courts that subsist in the several States of the Union,\r\nand the different powers exercised by them, it will appear that there\r\nare no expressions more vague and indeterminate than those which have\r\nbeen employed to characterize THAT species of causes which it is\r\nintended shall be entitled to a trial by jury. In this State, the\r\nboundaries between actions at common law and actions of equitable\r\njurisdiction, are ascertained in conformity to the rules which prevail\r\nin England upon that subject. In many of the other States the\r\nboundaries are less precise. In some of them every cause is to be tried\r\nin a court of common law, and upon that foundation every action may be\r\nconsidered as an action at common law, to be determined by a jury, if\r\nthe parties, or either of them, choose it. Hence the same irregularity\r\nand confusion would be introduced by a compliance with this\r\nproposition, that I have already noticed as resulting from the\r\nregulation proposed by the Pennsylvania minority. In one State a cause\r\nwould receive its determination from a jury, if the parties, or either\r\nof them, requested it; but in another State, a cause exactly similar to\r\nthe other, must be decided without the intervention of a jury, because\r\nthe State judicatories varied as to common-law jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, therefore, that the Massachusetts proposition, upon this\r\nsubject cannot operate as a general regulation, until some uniform\r\nplan, with respect to the limits of common-law and equitable\r\njurisdictions, shall be adopted by the different States. To devise a\r\nplan of that kind is a task arduous in itself, and which it would\r\nrequire much time and reflection to mature. It would be extremely\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to suggest any general regulation that\r\nwould be acceptable to all the States in the Union, or that would\r\nperfectly quadrate with the several State institutions.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, Why could not a reference have been made to the\r\nconstitution of this State, taking that, which is allowed by me to be a\r\ngood one, as a standard for the United States? I answer that it is not\r\nvery probable the other States would entertain the same opinion of our\r\ninstitutions as we do ourselves. It is natural to suppose that they are\r\nhitherto more attached to their own, and that each would struggle for\r\nthe preference. If the plan of taking one State as a model for the\r\nwhole had been thought of in the convention, it is to be presumed that\r\nthe adoption of it in that body would have been rendered difficult by\r\nthe predilection of each representation in favor of its own government;\r\nand it must be uncertain which of the States would have been taken as\r\nthe model. It has been shown that many of them would be improper ones.\r\nAnd I leave it to conjecture, whether, under all circumstances, it is\r\nmost likely that New York, or some other State, would have been\r\npreferred. But admit that a judicious selection could have been\r\neffected in the convention, still there would have been great danger of\r\njealousy and disgust in the other States, at the partiality which had\r\nbeen shown to the institutions of one. The enemies of the plan would\r\nhave been furnished with a fine pretext for raising a host of local\r\nprejudices against it, which perhaps might have hazarded, in no\r\ninconsiderable degree, its final establishment.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the embarrassments of a definition of the cases which the\r\ntrial by jury ought to embrace, it is sometimes suggested by men of\r\nenthusiastic tempers, that a provision might have been inserted for\r\nestablishing it in all cases whatsoever. For this I believe, no\r\nprecedent is to be found in any member of the Union; and the\r\nconsiderations which have been stated in discussing the proposition of\r\nthe minority of Pennsylvania, must satisfy every sober mind that the\r\nestablishment of the trial by jury in ALL cases would have been an\r\nunpardonable error in the plan.\r\n\r\nIn short, the more it is considered the more arduous will appear the\r\ntask of fashioning a provision in such a form as not to express too\r\nlittle to answer the purpose, or too much to be advisable; or which\r\nmight not have opened other sources of opposition to the great and\r\nessential object of introducing a firm national government.\r\n\r\nI cannot but persuade myself, on the other hand, that the different\r\nlights in which the subject has been placed in the course of these\r\nobservations, will go far towards removing in candid minds the\r\napprehensions they may have entertained on the point. They have tended\r\nto show that the security of liberty is materially concerned only in\r\nthe trial by jury in criminal cases, which is provided for in the most\r\nample manner in the plan of the convention; that even in far the\r\ngreatest proportion of civil cases, and those in which the great body\r\nof the community is interested, that mode of trial will remain in its\r\nfull force, as established in the State constitutions, untouched and\r\nunaffected by the plan of the convention; that it is in no case\r\nabolished[3] by that plan; and that there are great if not\r\ninsurmountable difficulties in the way of making any precise and proper\r\nprovision for it in a Constitution for the United States.\r\n\r\nThe best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for a\r\nconstitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases, and\r\nwill be the most ready to admit that the changes which are continually\r\nhappening in the affairs of society may render a different mode of\r\ndetermining questions of property preferable in many cases in which\r\nthat mode of trial now prevails. For my part, I acknowledge myself to\r\nbe convinced that even in this State it might be advantageously\r\nextended to some cases to which it does not at present apply, and might\r\nas advantageously be abridged in others. It is conceded by all\r\nreasonable men that it ought not to obtain in all cases. The examples\r\nof innovations which contract its ancient limits, as well in these\r\nStates as in Great Britain, afford a strong presumption that its former\r\nextent has been found inconvenient, and give room to suppose that\r\nfuture experience may discover the propriety and utility of other\r\nexceptions. I suspect it to be impossible in the nature of the thing to\r\nfix the salutary point at which the operation of the institution ought\r\nto stop, and this is with me a strong argument for leaving the matter\r\nto the discretion of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThis is now clearly understood to be the case in Great Britain, and it\r\nis equally so in the State of Connecticut; and yet it may be safely\r\naffirmed that more numerous encroachments have been made upon the trial\r\nby jury in this State since the Revolution, though provided for by a\r\npositive article of our constitution, than has happened in the same\r\ntime either in Connecticut or Great Britain. It may be added that these\r\nencroachments have generally originated with the men who endeavor to\r\npersuade the people they are the warmest defenders of popular liberty,\r\nbut who have rarely suffered constitutional obstacles to arrest them in\r\na favorite career. The truth is that the general GENIUS of a government\r\nis all that can be substantially relied upon for permanent effects.\r\nParticular provisions, though not altogether useless, have far less\r\nvirtue and efficacy than are commonly ascribed to them; and the want of\r\nthem will never be, with men of sound discernment, a decisive objection\r\nto any plan which exhibits the leading characters of a good government.\r\n\r\nIt certainly sounds not a little harsh and extraordinary to affirm that\r\nthere is no security for liberty in a Constitution which expressly\r\nestablishes the trial by jury in criminal cases, because it does not do\r\nit in civil also; while it is a notorious fact that Connecticut, which\r\nhas been always regarded as the most popular State in the Union, can\r\nboast of no constitutional provision for either.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] It has been erroneously insinuated, with regard to the court of\r\n chancery, that this court generally tries disputed facts by a jury.\r\n The truth is, that references to a jury in that court rarely happen,\r\n and are in no case necessary but where the validity of a devise of\r\n land comes into question.\r\n\r\n [2] It is true that the principles by which that relief is governed\r\n are now reduced to a regular system; but it is not the less true that\r\n they are in the main applicable to SPECIAL circumstances, which form\r\n exceptions to general rules.\r\n\r\n [3] _Vide_ No. 81, in which the supposition of its being abolished by\r\n the appellate jurisdiction in matters of fact being vested in the\r\n Supreme Court, is examined and refuted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXXIV.\r\n\r\nCertain General and Miscellaneous Objections to the Constitution\r\nConsidered and Answered\r\n\r\nFrom McLEAN’s Edition, New York.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIn the course of the foregoing review of the Constitution, I have taken\r\nnotice of, and endeavored to answer most of the objections which have\r\nappeared against it. There, however, remain a few which either did not\r\nfall naturally under any particular head or were forgotten in their\r\nproper places. These shall now be discussed; but as the subject has\r\nbeen drawn into great length, I shall so far consult brevity as to\r\ncomprise all my observations on these miscellaneous points in a single\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nThe most considerable of the remaining objections is that the plan of\r\nthe convention contains no bill of rights. Among other answers given to\r\nthis, it has been upon different occasions remarked that the\r\nconstitutions of several of the States are in a similar predicament. I\r\nadd that New York is of the number. And yet the opposers of the new\r\nsystem, in this State, who profess an unlimited admiration for its\r\nconstitution, are among the most intemperate partisans of a bill of\r\nrights. To justify their zeal in this matter, they allege two things:\r\none is that, though the constitution of New York has no bill of rights\r\nprefixed to it, yet it contains, in the body of it, various provisions\r\nin favor of particular privileges and rights, which, in substance\r\namount to the same thing; the other is, that the Constitution adopts,\r\nin their full extent, the common and statute law of Great Britain, by\r\nwhich many other rights, not expressed in it, are equally secured.\r\n\r\nTo the first I answer, that the Constitution proposed by the convention\r\ncontains, as well as the constitution of this State, a number of such\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nIndependent of those which relate to the structure of the government,\r\nwe find the following: Article 1, section 3, clause 7 “Judgment in\r\ncases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from\r\noffice, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor,\r\ntrust, or profit under the United States; but the party convicted\r\nshall, nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment, trial,\r\njudgment, and punishment according to law.” Section 9, of the same\r\narticle, clause 2 “The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not\r\nbe suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public\r\nsafety may require it.” Clause 3 “No bill of attainder or ex-post-facto\r\nlaw shall be passed.” Clause 7 “No title of nobility shall be granted\r\nby the United States; and no person holding any office of profit or\r\ntrust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of\r\nany present, emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever, from any\r\nking, prince, or foreign state.” Article 3, section 2, clause 3 “The\r\ntrial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury;\r\nand such trial shall be held in the State where the said crimes shall\r\nhave been committed; but when not committed within any State, the trial\r\nshall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have\r\ndirected.” Section 3, of the same article “Treason against the United\r\nStates shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering\r\nto their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be\r\nconvicted of treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the\r\nsame overt act, or on confession in open court.” And clause 3, of the\r\nsame section “The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment\r\nof treason; but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood,\r\nor forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted.”\r\n\r\nIt may well be a question, whether these are not, upon the whole, of\r\nequal importance with any which are to be found in the constitution of\r\nthis State. The establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, the\r\nprohibition of ex-post-facto laws, and of TITLES OF NOBILITY, TO WHICH\r\nWE HAVE NO CORRESPONDING PROVISION IN OUR CONSTITUTION, are perhaps\r\ngreater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains.\r\nThe creation of crimes after the commission of the fact, or, in other\r\nwords, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when they\r\nwere done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary\r\nimprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable\r\ninstruments of tyranny. The observations of the judicious\r\nBlackstone,[1] in reference to the latter, are well worthy of recital:\r\n“To bereave a man of life, Usays he,e or by violence to confiscate his\r\nestate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an\r\nact of despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny\r\nthroughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly\r\nhurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is\r\na less public, a less striking, and therefore A MORE DANGEROUS ENGINE\r\nof arbitrary government.” And as a remedy for this fatal evil he is\r\neverywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas-corpus\r\nact, which in one place he calls “the BULWARK of the British\r\nConstitution.”[2]\r\n\r\nNothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of\r\ntitles of nobility. This may truly be denominated the corner-stone of\r\nrepublican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can\r\nnever be serious danger that the government will be any other than that\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nTo the second that is, to the pretended establishment of the common and\r\nstate law by the Constitution, I answer, that they are expressly made\r\nsubject “to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall\r\nfrom time to time make concerning the same.” They are therefore at any\r\nmoment liable to repeal by the ordinary legislative power, and of\r\ncourse have no constitutional sanction. The only use of the declaration\r\nwas to recognize the ancient law and to remove doubts which might have\r\nbeen occasioned by the Revolution. This consequently can be considered\r\nas no part of a declaration of rights, which under our constitutions\r\nmust be intended as limitations of the power of the government itself.\r\n\r\nIt has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights are, in\r\ntheir origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects,\r\nabridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of\r\nrights not surrendered to the prince. Such was MAGNA CHARTA, obtained\r\nby the barons, sword in hand, from King John. Such were the subsequent\r\nconfirmations of that charter by succeeding princes. Such was the\r\nPETITION OF RIGHT assented to by Charles I., in the beginning of his\r\nreign. Such, also, was the Declaration of Right presented by the Lords\r\nand Commons to the Prince of Orange in 1688, and afterwards thrown into\r\nthe form of an act of parliament called the Bill of Rights. It is\r\nevident, therefore, that, according to their primitive signification,\r\nthey have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the\r\npower of the people, and executed by their immediate representatives\r\nand servants. Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing; and as\r\nthey retain every thing they have no need of particular reservations.\r\n“WE, THE PEOPLE of the United States, to secure the blessings of\r\nliberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ORDAIN and ESTABLISH this\r\nConstitution for the United States of America.” Here is a better\r\nrecognition of popular rights, than volumes of those aphorisms which\r\nmake the principal figure in several of our State bills of rights, and\r\nwhich would sound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a\r\nconstitution of government.\r\n\r\nBut a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far less\r\napplicable to a Constitution like that under consideration, which is\r\nmerely intended to regulate the general political interests of the\r\nnation, than to a constitution which has the regulation of every\r\nspecies of personal and private concerns. If, therefore, the loud\r\nclamors against the plan of the convention, on this score, are well\r\nfounded, no epithets of reprobation will be too strong for the\r\nconstitution of this State. But the truth is, that both of them contain\r\nall which, in relation to their objects, is reasonably to be desired.\r\n\r\nI go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and to the\r\nextent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the\r\nproposed Constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain\r\nvarious exceptions to powers not granted; and, on this very account,\r\nwould afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted. For\r\nwhy declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to\r\ndo? Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press\r\nshall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions\r\nmay be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a\r\nregulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men\r\ndisposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power. They\r\nmight urge with a semblance of reason, that the Constitution ought not\r\nto be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an\r\nauthority which was not given, and that the provision against\r\nrestraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear implication, that\r\na power to prescribe proper regulations concerning it was intended to\r\nbe vested in the national government. This may serve as a specimen of\r\nthe numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of\r\nconstructive powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills\r\nof rights.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the liberty of the press, as much as has been said, I\r\ncannot forbear adding a remark or two: in the first place, I observe,\r\nthat there is not a syllable concerning it in the constitution of this\r\nState; in the next, I contend, that whatever has been said about it in\r\nthat of any other State, amounts to nothing. What signifies a\r\ndeclaration, that “the liberty of the press shall be inviolably\r\npreserved”? What is the liberty of the press? Who can give it any\r\ndefinition which would not leave the utmost latitude for evasion? I\r\nhold it to be impracticable; and from this I infer, that its security,\r\nwhatever fine declarations may be inserted in any constitution\r\nrespecting it, must altogether depend on public opinion, and on the\r\ngeneral spirit of the people and of the government.[3] And here, after\r\nall, as is intimated upon another occasion, must we seek for the only\r\nsolid basis of all our rights.\r\n\r\nThere remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the point.\r\nThe truth is, after all the declamations we have heard, that the\r\nConstitution is itself, in every rational sense, and to every useful\r\npurpose, A BILL OF RIGHTS. The several bills of rights in Great Britain\r\nform its Constitution, and conversely the constitution of each State is\r\nits bill of rights. And the proposed Constitution, if adopted, will be\r\nthe bill of rights of the Union. Is it one object of a bill of rights\r\nto declare and specify the political privileges of the citizens in the\r\nstructure and administration of the government? This is done in the\r\nmost ample and precise manner in the plan of the convention;\r\ncomprehending various precautions for the public security, which are\r\nnot to be found in any of the State constitutions. Is another object of\r\na bill of rights to define certain immunities and modes of proceeding,\r\nwhich are relative to personal and private concerns? This we have seen\r\nhas also been attended to, in a variety of cases, in the same plan.\r\nAdverting therefore to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights, it\r\nis absurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the\r\nconvention. It may be said that it does not go far enough, though it\r\nwill not be easy to make this appear; but it can with no propriety be\r\ncontended that there is no such thing. It certainly must be immaterial\r\nwhat mode is observed as to the order of declaring the rights of the\r\ncitizens, if they are to be found in any part of the instrument which\r\nestablishes the government. And hence it must be apparent, that much of\r\nwhat has been said on this subject rests merely on verbal and nominal\r\ndistinctions, entirely foreign from the substance of the thing.\r\n\r\nAnother objection which has been made, and which, from the frequency of\r\nits repetition, it is to be presumed is relied on, is of this nature:\r\n“It is improper,” say the objectors, “to confer such large powers, as\r\nare proposed, upon the national government, because the seat of that\r\ngovernment must of necessity be too remote from many of the States to\r\nadmit of a proper knowledge on the part of the constituent, of the\r\nconduct of the representative body.” This argument, if it proves any\r\nthing, proves that there ought to be no general government whatever.\r\nFor the powers which, it seems to be agreed on all hands, ought to be\r\nvested in the Union, cannot be safely intrusted to a body which is not\r\nunder every requisite control. But there are satisfactory reasons to\r\nshow that the objection is in reality not well founded. There is in\r\nmost of the arguments which relate to distance a palpable illusion of\r\nthe imagination. What are the sources of information by which the\r\npeople in Montgomery County must regulate their judgment of the conduct\r\nof their representatives in the State legislature? Of personal\r\nobservation they can have no benefit. This is confined to the citizens\r\non the spot. They must therefore depend on the information of\r\nintelligent men, in whom they confide; and how must these men obtain\r\ntheir information? Evidently from the complexion of public measures,\r\nfrom the public prints, from correspondences with their\r\nrepresentatives, and with other persons who reside at the place of\r\ntheir deliberations. This does not apply to Montgomery County only, but\r\nto all the counties at any considerable distance from the seat of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIt is equally evident that the same sources of information would be\r\nopen to the people in relation to the conduct of their representatives\r\nin the general government, and the impediments to a prompt\r\ncommunication which distance may be supposed to create, will be\r\noverbalanced by the effects of the vigilance of the State governments.\r\nThe executive and legislative bodies of each State will be so many\r\nsentinels over the persons employed in every department of the national\r\nadministration; and as it will be in their power to adopt and pursue a\r\nregular and effectual system of intelligence, they can never be at a\r\nloss to know the behavior of those who represent their constituents in\r\nthe national councils, and can readily communicate the same knowledge\r\nto the people. Their disposition to apprise the community of whatever\r\nmay prejudice its interests from another quarter, may be relied upon,\r\nif it were only from the rivalship of power. And we may conclude with\r\nthe fullest assurance that the people, through that channel, will be\r\nbetter informed of the conduct of their national representatives, than\r\nthey can be by any means they now possess of that of their State\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIt ought also to be remembered that the citizens who inhabit the\r\ncountry at and near the seat of government will, in all questions that\r\naffect the general liberty and prosperity, have the same interest with\r\nthose who are at a distance, and that they will stand ready to sound\r\nthe alarm when necessary, and to point out the actors in any pernicious\r\nproject. The public papers will be expeditious messengers of\r\nintelligence to the most remote inhabitants of the Union.\r\n\r\nAmong the many curious objections which have appeared against the\r\nproposed Constitution, the most extraordinary and the least colorable\r\nis derived from the want of some provision respecting the debts due TO\r\nthe United States. This has been represented as a tacit relinquishment\r\nof those debts, and as a wicked contrivance to screen public\r\ndefaulters. The newspapers have teemed with the most inflammatory\r\nrailings on this head; yet there is nothing clearer than that the\r\nsuggestion is entirely void of foundation, the offspring of extreme\r\nignorance or extreme dishonesty. In addition to the remarks I have made\r\nupon the subject in another place, I shall only observe that as it is a\r\nplain dictate of common-sense, so it is also an established doctrine of\r\npolitical law, that “STATES NEITHER LOSE ANY OF THEIR RIGHTS, NOR ARE\r\nDISCHARGED FROM ANY OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS, BY A CHANGE IN THE FORM OF\r\nTHEIR CIVIL GOVERNMENT.”[4]\r\n\r\nThe last objection of any consequence, which I at present recollect,\r\nturns upon the article of expense. If it were even true, that the\r\nadoption of the proposed government would occasion a considerable\r\nincrease of expense, it would be an objection that ought to have no\r\nweight against the plan.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the citizens of America are with reason convinced,\r\nthat Union is the basis of their political happiness. Men of sense of\r\nall parties now, with few exceptions, agree that it cannot be preserved\r\nunder the present system, nor without radical alterations; that new and\r\nextensive powers ought to be granted to the national head, and that\r\nthese require a different organization of the federal government a\r\nsingle body being an unsafe depositary of such ample authorities. In\r\nconceding all this, the question of expense must be given up; for it is\r\nimpossible, with any degree of safety, to narrow the foundation upon\r\nwhich the system is to stand. The two branches of the legislature are,\r\nin the first instance, to consist of only sixty-five persons, which is\r\nthe same number of which Congress, under the existing Confederation,\r\nmay be composed. It is true that this number is intended to be\r\nincreased; but this is to keep pace with the progress of the population\r\nand resources of the country. It is evident that a less number would,\r\neven in the first instance, have been unsafe, and that a continuance of\r\nthe present number would, in a more advanced stage of population, be a\r\nvery inadequate representation of the people.\r\n\r\nWhence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to spring? One source\r\nindicated, is the multiplication of offices under the new government.\r\nLet us examine this a little.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the principal departments of the administration\r\nunder the present government, are the same which will be required under\r\nthe new. There are now a Secretary of War, a Secretary of Foreign\r\nAffairs, a Secretary for Domestic Affairs, a Board of Treasury,\r\nconsisting of three persons, a Treasurer, assistants, clerks, etc.\r\nThese officers are indispensable under any system, and will suffice\r\nunder the new as well as the old. As to ambassadors and other ministers\r\nand agents in foreign countries, the proposed Constitution can make no\r\nother difference than to render their characters, where they reside,\r\nmore respectable, and their services more useful. As to persons to be\r\nemployed in the collection of the revenues, it is unquestionably true\r\nthat these will form a very considerable addition to the number of\r\nfederal officers; but it will not follow that this will occasion an\r\nincrease of public expense. It will be in most cases nothing more than\r\nan exchange of State for national officers. In the collection of all\r\nduties, for instance, the persons employed will be wholly of the latter\r\ndescription. The States individually will stand in no need of any for\r\nthis purpose. What difference can it make in point of expense to pay\r\nofficers of the customs appointed by the State or by the United States?\r\nThere is no good reason to suppose that either the number or the\r\nsalaries of the latter will be greater than those of the former.\r\n\r\nWhere then are we to seek for those additional articles of expense\r\nwhich are to swell the account to the enormous size that has been\r\nrepresented to us? The chief item which occurs to me respects the\r\nsupport of the judges of the United States. I do not add the President,\r\nbecause there is now a president of Congress, whose expenses may not be\r\nfar, if any thing, short of those which will be incurred on account of\r\nthe President of the United States. The support of the judges will\r\nclearly be an extra expense, but to what extent will depend on the\r\nparticular plan which may be adopted in regard to this matter. But upon\r\nno reasonable plan can it amount to a sum which will be an object of\r\nmaterial consequence.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense that\r\nmay attend the establishment of the proposed government. The first\r\nthing which presents itself is that a great part of the business which\r\nnow keeps Congress sitting through the year will be transacted by the\r\nPresident. Even the management of foreign negotiations will naturally\r\ndevolve upon him, according to general principles concerted with the\r\nSenate, and subject to their final concurrence. Hence it is evident\r\nthat a portion of the year will suffice for the session of both the\r\nSenate and the House of Representatives; we may suppose about a fourth\r\nfor the latter and a third, or perhaps half, for the former. The extra\r\nbusiness of treaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to\r\nthe Senate. From this circumstance we may infer that, until the House\r\nof Representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present\r\nnumber, there will be a considerable saving of expense from the\r\ndifference between the constant session of the present and the\r\ntemporary session of the future Congress.\r\n\r\nBut there is another circumstance of great importance in the view of\r\neconomy. The business of the United States has hitherto occupied the\r\nState legislatures, as well as Congress. The latter has made\r\nrequisitions which the former have had to provide for. Hence it has\r\nhappened that the sessions of the State legislatures have been\r\nprotracted greatly beyond what was necessary for the execution of the\r\nmere local business of the States. More than half their time has been\r\nfrequently employed in matters which related to the United States. Now\r\nthe members who compose the legislatures of the several States amount\r\nto two thousand and upwards, which number has hitherto performed what\r\nunder the new system will be done in the first instance by sixty-five\r\npersons, and probably at no future period by above a fourth or fifth of\r\nthat number. The Congress under the proposed government will do all the\r\nbusiness of the United States themselves, without the intervention of\r\nthe State legislatures, who thenceforth will have only to attend to the\r\naffairs of their particular States, and will not have to sit in any\r\nproportion as long as they have heretofore done. This difference in the\r\ntime of the sessions of the State legislatures will be clear gain, and\r\nwill alone form an article of saving, which may be regarded as an\r\nequivalent for any additional objects of expense that may be occasioned\r\nby the adoption of the new system.\r\n\r\nThe result from these observations is that the sources of additional\r\nexpense from the establishment of the proposed Constitution are much\r\nfewer than may have been imagined; that they are counterbalanced by\r\nconsiderable objects of saving; and that while it is questionable on\r\nwhich side the scale will preponderate, it is certain that a government\r\nless expensive would be incompetent to the purposes of the Union.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] _Vide_ Blackstone’s _Commentaries_, vol. 1., p. 136.\r\n\r\n [2] _Vide_ Blackstone’s _Commentaries_, vol. iv., p. 438.\r\n\r\n [3] To show that there is a power in the Constitution by which the\r\n liberty of the press may be affected, recourse has been had to the\r\n power of taxation. It is said that duties may be laid upon the\r\n publications so high as to amount to a prohibition. I know not by what\r\n logic it could be maintained, that the declarations in the State\r\n constitutions, in favor of the freedom of the press, would be a\r\n constitutional impediment to the imposition of duties upon\r\n publications by the State legislatures. It cannot certainly be\r\n pretended that any degree of duties, however low, would be an\r\n abridgment of the liberty of the press. We know that newspapers are\r\n taxed in Great Britain, and yet it is notorious that the press nowhere\r\n enjoys greater liberty than in that country. And if duties of any kind\r\n may be laid without a violation of that liberty, it is evident that\r\n the extent must depend on legislative discretion, respecting the\r\n liberty of the press, will give it no greater security than it will\r\n have without them. The same invasions of it may be effected under the\r\n State constitutions which contain those declarations through the means\r\n of taxation, as under the proposed Constitution, which has nothing of\r\n the kind. It would be quite as significant to declare that government\r\n ought to be free, that taxes ought not to be excessive, etc., as that\r\n the liberty of the press ought not to be restrained.\r\n\r\n [4] _Vide_ Rutherford’s Institutes, Vol. 2, Book II, Chapter X,\r\n Sections XIV and XV. _Vide_ also Grotius, Book II, Chapter IX,\r\n Sections VIII and IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALIST.\r\nNo. LXXXV.\r\n\r\nConcluding Remarks\r\n\r\nFrom MCLEAN’s Edition, New York.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nAccording to the formal division of the subject of these papers,\r\nannounced in my first number, there would appear still to remain for\r\ndiscussion two points: “the analogy of the proposed government to your\r\nown State constitution,” and “the additional security which its\r\nadoption will afford to republican government, to liberty, and to\r\nproperty.” But these heads have been so fully anticipated and exhausted\r\nin the progress of the work, that it would now scarcely be possible to\r\ndo any thing more than repeat, in a more dilated form, what has been\r\nheretofore said, which the advanced stage of the question, and the time\r\nalready spent upon it, conspire to forbid.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that the resemblance of the plan of the convention to\r\nthe act which organizes the government of this State holds, not less\r\nwith regard to many of the supposed defects, than to the real\r\nexcellences of the former. Among the pretended defects are the\r\nre-eligibility of the Executive, the want of a council, the omission of\r\na formal bill of rights, the omission of a provision respecting the\r\nliberty of the press. These and several others which have been noted in\r\nthe course of our inquiries are as much chargeable on the existing\r\nconstitution of this State, as on the one proposed for the Union; and a\r\nman must have slender pretensions to consistency, who can rail at the\r\nlatter for imperfections which he finds no difficulty in excusing in\r\nthe former. Nor indeed can there be a better proof of the insincerity\r\nand affectation of some of the zealous adversaries of the plan of the\r\nconvention among us, who profess to be the devoted admirers of the\r\ngovernment under which they live, than the fury with which they have\r\nattacked that plan, for matters in regard to which our own constitution\r\nis equally or perhaps more vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe additional securities to republican government, to liberty and to\r\nproperty, to be derived from the adoption of the plan under\r\nconsideration, consist chiefly in the restraints which the preservation\r\nof the Union will impose on local factions and insurrections, and on\r\nthe ambition of powerful individuals in single States, who may acquire\r\ncredit and influence enough, from leaders and favorites, to become the\r\ndespots of the people; in the diminution of the opportunities to\r\nforeign intrigue, which the dissolution of the Confederacy would invite\r\nand facilitate; in the prevention of extensive military establishments,\r\nwhich could not fail to grow out of wars between the States in a\r\ndisunited situation; in the express guaranty of a republican form of\r\ngovernment to each; in the absolute and universal exclusion of titles\r\nof nobility; and in the precautions against the repetition of those\r\npractices on the part of the State governments which have undermined\r\nthe foundations of property and credit, have planted mutual distrust in\r\nthe breasts of all classes of citizens, and have occasioned an almost\r\nuniversal prostration of morals.\r\n\r\nThus have I, fellow-citizens, executed the task I had assigned to\r\nmyself; with what success, your conduct must determine. I trust at\r\nleast you will admit that I have not failed in the assurance I gave you\r\nrespecting the spirit with which my endeavors should be conducted. I\r\nhave addressed myself purely to your judgments, and have studiously\r\navoided those asperities which are too apt to disgrace political\r\ndisputants of all parties, and which have been not a little provoked by\r\nthe language and conduct of the opponents of the Constitution. The\r\ncharge of a conspiracy against the liberties of the people, which has\r\nbeen indiscriminately brought against the advocates of the plan, has\r\nsomething in it too wanton and too malignant, not to excite the\r\nindignation of every man who feels in his own bosom a refutation of the\r\ncalumny. The perpetual changes which have been rung upon the wealthy,\r\nthe well-born, and the great, have been such as to inspire the disgust\r\nof all sensible men. And the unwarrantable concealments and\r\nmisrepresentations which have been in various ways practiced to keep\r\nthe truth from the public eye, have been of a nature to demand the\r\nreprobation of all honest men. It is not impossible that these\r\ncircumstances may have occasionally betrayed me into intemperances of\r\nexpression which I did not intend; it is certain that I have frequently\r\nfelt a struggle between sensibility and moderation; and if the former\r\nhas in some instances prevailed, it must be my excuse that it has been\r\nneither often nor much.\r\n\r\nLet us now pause and ask ourselves whether, in the course of these\r\npapers, the proposed Constitution has not been satisfactorily\r\nvindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it; and whether it has not\r\nbeen shown to be worthy of the public approbation, and necessary to the\r\npublic safety and prosperity. Every man is bound to answer these\r\nquestions to himself, according to the best of his conscience and\r\nunderstanding, and to act agreeably to the genuine and sober dictates\r\nof his judgment. This is a duty from which nothing can give him a\r\ndispensation. ’T is one that he is called upon, nay, constrained by all\r\nthe obligations that form the bands of society, to discharge sincerely\r\nand honestly. No partial motive, no particular interest, no pride of\r\nopinion, no temporary passion or prejudice, will justify to himself, to\r\nhis country, or to his posterity, an improper election of the part he\r\nis to act. Let him beware of an obstinate adherence to party; let him\r\nreflect that the object upon which he is to decide is not a particular\r\ninterest of the community, but the very existence of the nation; and\r\nlet him remember that a majority of America has already given its\r\nsanction to the plan which he is to approve or reject.\r\n\r\nI shall not dissemble that I feel an entire confidence in the arguments\r\nwhich recommend the proposed system to your adoption, and that I am\r\nunable to discern any real force in those by which it has been opposed.\r\nI am persuaded that it is the best which our political situation,\r\nhabits, and opinions will admit, and superior to any the revolution has\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nConcessions on the part of the friends of the plan, that it has not a\r\nclaim to absolute perfection, have afforded matter of no small triumph\r\nto its enemies. “Why,” say they, “should we adopt an imperfect thing?\r\nWhy not amend it and make it perfect before it is irrevocably\r\nestablished?” This may be plausible enough, but it is only plausible.\r\nIn the first place I remark, that the extent of these concessions has\r\nbeen greatly exaggerated. They have been stated as amounting to an\r\nadmission that the plan is radically defective, and that without\r\nmaterial alterations the rights and the interests of the community\r\ncannot be safely confided to it. This, as far as I have understood the\r\nmeaning of those who make the concessions, is an entire perversion of\r\ntheir sense. No advocate of the measure can be found, who will not\r\ndeclare as his sentiment, that the system, though it may not be perfect\r\nin every part, is, upon the whole, a good one; is the best that the\r\npresent views and circumstances of the country will permit; and is such\r\nan one as promises every species of security which a reasonable people\r\ncan desire.\r\n\r\nI answer in the next place, that I should esteem it the extreme of\r\nimprudence to prolong the precarious state of our national affairs, and\r\nto expose the Union to the jeopardy of successive experiments, in the\r\nchimerical pursuit of a perfect plan. I never expect to see a perfect\r\nwork from imperfect man. The result of the deliberations of all\r\ncollective bodies must necessarily be a compound, as well of the errors\r\nand prejudices, as of the good sense and wisdom, of the individuals of\r\nwhom they are composed. The compacts which are to embrace thirteen\r\ndistinct States in a common bond of amity and union, must as\r\nnecessarily be a compromise of as many dissimilar interests and\r\ninclinations. How can perfection spring from such materials?\r\n\r\nThe reasons assigned in an excellent little pamphlet lately published\r\nin this city[1] are unanswerable to show the utter improbability of\r\nassembling a new convention, under circumstances in any degree so\r\nfavorable to a happy issue, as those in which the late convention met,\r\ndeliberated, and concluded. I will not repeat the arguments there used,\r\nas I presume the production itself has had an extensive circulation. It\r\nis certainly well worthy the perusal of every friend to his country.\r\nThere is, however, one point of light in which the subject of\r\namendments still remains to be considered, and in which it has not yet\r\nbeen exhibited to public view. I cannot resolve to conclude without\r\nfirst taking a survey of it in this aspect.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me susceptible of absolute demonstration, that it will be\r\nfar more easy to obtain subsequent than previous amendments to the\r\nConstitution. The moment an alteration is made in the present plan, it\r\nbecomes, to the purpose of adoption, a new one, and must undergo a new\r\ndecision of each State. To its complete establishment throughout the\r\nUnion, it will therefore require the concurrence of thirteen States.\r\nIf, on the contrary, the Constitution proposed should once be ratified\r\nby all the States as it stands, alterations in it may at any time be\r\neffected by nine States. Here, then, the chances are as thirteen to\r\nnine[2] in favor of subsequent amendment, rather than of the original\r\nadoption of an entire system.\r\n\r\nThis is not all. Every Constitution for the United States must\r\ninevitably consist of a great variety of particulars, in which thirteen\r\nindependent States are to be accommodated in their interests or\r\nopinions of interest. We may of course expect to see, in any body of\r\nmen charged with its original formation, very different combinations of\r\nthe parts upon different points. Many of those who form a majority on\r\none question, may become the minority on a second, and an association\r\ndissimilar to either may constitute the majority on a third. Hence the\r\nnecessity of moulding and arranging all the particulars which are to\r\ncompose the whole, in such a manner as to satisfy all the parties to\r\nthe compact; and hence, also, an immense multiplication of difficulties\r\nand casualties in obtaining the collective assent to a final act. The\r\ndegree of that multiplication must evidently be in a ratio to the\r\nnumber of particulars and the number of parties.\r\n\r\nBut every amendment to the Constitution, if once established, would be\r\na single proposition, and might be brought forward singly. There would\r\nthen be no necessity for management or compromise, in relation to any\r\nother point no giving nor taking. The will of the requisite number\r\nwould at once bring the matter to a decisive issue. And consequently,\r\nwhenever nine, or rather ten States, were united in the desire of a\r\nparticular amendment, that amendment must infallibly take place. There\r\ncan, therefore, be no comparison between the facility of affecting an\r\namendment, and that of establishing in the first instance a complete\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the probability of subsequent amendments, it has been\r\nurged that the persons delegated to the administration of the national\r\ngovernment will always be disinclined to yield up any portion of the\r\nauthority of which they were once possessed. For my own part I\r\nacknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments which may, upon\r\nmature consideration, be thought useful, will be applicable to the\r\norganization of the government, not to the mass of its powers; and on\r\nthis account alone, I think there is no weight in the observation just\r\nstated. I also think there is little weight in it on another account.\r\nThe intrinsic difficulty of governing thirteen States at any rate,\r\nindependent of calculations upon an ordinary degree of public spirit\r\nand integrity, will, in my opinion constantly impose on the national\r\nrulers the necessity of a spirit of accommodation to the reasonable\r\nexpectations of their constituents. But there is yet a further\r\nconsideration, which proves beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the\r\nobservation is futile. It is this that the national rulers, whenever\r\nnine States concur, will have no option upon the subject. By the fifth\r\narticle of the plan, the Congress will be obliged “on the application\r\nof the legislatures of two thirds of the States, which at present\r\namount to nine, to call a convention for proposing amendments, which\r\nshall be valid, to all intents and purposes, as part of the\r\nConstitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the\r\nStates, or by conventions in three fourths thereof.” The words of this\r\narticle are peremptory. The Congress “shall call a convention.” Nothing\r\nin this particular is left to the discretion of that body. And of\r\nconsequence, all the declamation about the disinclination to a change\r\nvanishes in air. Nor however difficult it may be supposed to unite two\r\nthirds or three fourths of the State legislatures, in amendments which\r\nmay affect local interests, can there be any room to apprehend any such\r\ndifficulty in a union on points which are merely relative to the\r\ngeneral liberty or security of the people. We may safely rely on the\r\ndisposition of the State legislatures to erect barriers against the\r\nencroachments of the national authority.\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing argument is a fallacy, certain it is that I am myself\r\ndeceived by it, for it is, in my conception, one of those rare\r\ninstances in which a political truth can be brought to the test of a\r\nmathematical demonstration. Those who see the matter in the same light\r\nwith me, however zealous they may be for amendments, must agree in the\r\npropriety of a previous adoption, as the most direct road to their own\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThe zeal for attempts to amend, prior to the establishment of the\r\nConstitution, must abate in every man who is ready to accede to the\r\ntruth of the following observations of a writer equally solid and\r\ningenious: “To balance a large state or society Usays hee, whether\r\nmonarchical or republican, on general laws, is a work of so great\r\ndifficulty, that no human genius, however comprehensive, is able, by\r\nthe mere dint of reason and reflection, to effect it. The judgments of\r\nmany must unite in the work; experience must guide their labor; time\r\nmust bring it to perfection, and the feeling of inconveniences must\r\ncorrect the mistakes which they INEVITABLY fall into in their first\r\ntrials and experiments.”[3] These judicious reflections contain a\r\nlesson of moderation to all the sincere lovers of the Union, and ought\r\nto put them upon their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a\r\nperpetual alienation of the States from each other, and perhaps the\r\nmilitary despotism of a victorious demagogue, in the pursuit of what\r\nthey are not likely to obtain, but from time and experience. It may be\r\nin me a defect of political fortitude, but I acknowledge that I cannot\r\nentertain an equal tranquillity with those who affect to treat the\r\ndangers of a longer continuance in our present situation as imaginary.\r\nA nation, without a national government, is, in my view, an awful\r\nspectacle. The establishment of a Constitution, in time of profound\r\npeace, by the voluntary consent of a whole people, is a prodigy, to the\r\ncompletion of which I look forward with trembling anxiety. I can\r\nreconcile it to no rules of prudence to let go the hold we now have, in\r\nso arduous an enterprise, upon seven out of the thirteen States, and\r\nafter having passed over so considerable a part of the ground, to\r\nrecommence the course. I dread the more the consequences of new\r\nattempts, because I know that powerful individuals, in this and in\r\nother States, are enemies to a general national government in every\r\npossible shape.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n [1] Entitled “An Address to the People of the State of New York.”\r\n\r\n [2] It may rather be said TEN, for though two thirds may set on foot\r\n the measure, three fourths must ratify.\r\n\r\n [3] Hume’s _Essays_, vol. i., page 128: “The Rise of Arts and\r\n Sciences.”",
