(By Sir Walter Scott)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes thought, and very often said, that political writing,\r\nafter its special day is done, becomes more dead than any other kind\r\nof literature, or even journalism. I do not know whether my own\r\njudgment is perverted by the fact of a special devotion to the\r\nbusiness, but it certainly seems to me that both the thought and the\r\nsaying are mistakes. Indeed, a rough-and-ready refutation of them is\r\nsupplied by the fact that, in no few cases, political pieces have\r\nentered into the generally admitted stock of the best literary things.\r\nIf they are little read, can we honestly say that other things in the\r\nsame rank are read much more? And is there not the further plea, by no\r\nmeans contradictory, nor even merely alternative, that the best\r\nexamples of them are, as a rule, merged in huge collected 'Works,' or,\r\nin the case of authors who have not attained to that dignity, simply\r\ninaccessible to the general? At any rate my publishers have consented\r\nto let me try the experiment of gathering certain famous things of the\r\nsort in this volume, and the public must decide.\r\n\r\nI do not begin very early, partly because examples of the Elizabethan\r\npolitical pamphlet, or what supplied its place, will be given in\r\nanother volume of the series exclusively devoted to the pamphlet\r\nliterature of the reigns of Eliza and our James, partly for a still\r\nbetter reason presently to be explained. On the other hand, though\r\nanother special volume is devoted to Defoe, the immortal _Shortest Way\r\nwith the Dissenters_ is separated from the rest of his work, and given\r\nhere. Most of the contents, however, represent authors not otherwise\r\nrepresented in the series, and though very well known indeed by name,\r\nless read than quoted. The suitableness of the political pamphlet,\r\nboth by size and self-containedness, for such a volume as this, needs\r\nno justification except that which it, like everything else, must\r\nreceive, by being put to the proof of reading.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in showing, with at least sufficient critical\r\nexactness, why it is not possible or not desirable to select examples\r\nfrom very early periods even of strictly modern history. The causes\r\nare in part the same as those which delayed the production of really\r\ncapital political verse (which has been treated in another volume),\r\nbut they are not wholly the same. The Martin Marprelate pamphlets are\r\nstrictly political; so are many things earlier, later, and\r\ncontemporary with them, by hands known and unknown, great and small,\r\nskilled and unskilled; so are some even in the work of so great a man\r\nas Bacon. But very many things were wanting to secure the conditions\r\nnecessary to the perfect pamphlet. There was not the political\r\nfreedom; there was not the public; there was not the immediate object;\r\nthere was not, last and most of all, the style. Political utterances\r\nunder a more or less despotic, or, as the modern euphemism goes,\r\n'personal' government, were almost necessarily those of a retained\r\nadvocate, who expected his immediate reward, on the one hand; or of a\r\nrebel, who stood to make his account with office if he succeeded, or\r\nwith savage punishment if he failed, on the other. A distant prospect\r\nof impeachment, of the loss of ears, hands, or life if the tide turns,\r\nis a stimulant to violence rather than to vigour. I do not think,\r\nhowever, that this is the most important factor in the problem.\r\nParliamentary government, with a limited franchise of tolerably\r\nintelligent voters, a party system, and newspapers comparatively\r\nundeveloped, may not suit an ideally perfect _politeia_, but it is\r\nthe very hotbed in which to nourish the pamphlet. There is also a\r\nstyle, as there is a time, for all things; and no style could be so\r\nwell suited for the pamphlet as the balanced, measured, pointed, and\r\npolished style which Dryden and Tillotson and Temple brought in during\r\nthe third quarter of the seventeenth century, and which did not go out\r\nof fashion till the second quarter of the nineteenth. We have indeed\r\nseen pamphlets proper exercising considerable influence in quite\r\nrecent times; but in no instance that I can remember has this been due\r\nto any literary merits, and I doubt whether even the bare fact will be\r\nsoon or often renewed in our days. The written word--the written word\r\nof condensed, strengthened, spirited literature--has lost much, if not\r\nall, of its force with an enormously increased electorate, and a\r\nbewildering multiplicity of print and speech of all kinds.\r\n\r\nWhatever justice these reasonings may have or may lack, the facts\r\nspeak for themselves, as facts intelligently regarded have a habit of\r\ndoing. The first pamphlets proper of great literary merit and great\r\npolitical influence are those of Halifax in the first movement of real\r\nparty struggle during the reign of Charles the Second; the last which\r\nunite the same requisites are those of Scott on the eve of the first\r\nReform Bill. The leaflet and circular war of the anti-Corn Law League\r\nmust be ruled out as much as Mr. Gladstone's _Bulgarian Horrors_.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us a period of almost exactly a hundred and fifty years,\r\nduring which the kind, whether in good or bad examples, was of\r\nconstant influence; while its best instances enriched literature with\r\npermanent masterpieces in little. I do not think that any moderately\r\ninstructed person will find much difficulty in comprehending the\r\nspecimens here given. I am sure that no moderately intelligent one\r\nwill fail, with a very little trouble, to take delight in them. I do\r\nnot know whether an artful generaliser could get anything out of the\r\ncircumstances in which the best of them grew; I should say myself that\r\nnothing more than the system of government, the conditions of the\r\nelectorate and the legislature, and the existence from time to time of\r\na superheated state in political feeling, can or need be collected. In\r\nsome respects, to my own taste, the first of these examples is also\r\nthe best. To Halifax full justice has never been done, for we have had\r\nno capable historian of the late seventeenth century but Macaulay, and\r\nHalifax's defect of fervour as a Jacobite was more than made up to\r\nMacaulay by his defect of fervour as a Williamite. As for the moderns,\r\nI have myself more than once failed to induce editors of 'series' to\r\ngive Halifax a place. Yet Macaulay himself has been fairer to the\r\ngreat Trimmer than to most persons with whom he was not in full\r\nsympathy. The weakness of Halifax's position is indeed obvious. When\r\nyou run first to one side of the boat and then to the other, you have\r\nten chances of sinking to one of trimming her. To hold fast to one\r\nparty only, and to keep that from extremes, is the only secret, and it\r\nis no great disgrace to Halifax, that in the very infancy of the party\r\nand parliamentary system, he did not perceive it. But this hardly\r\ninterferes at all with the excellence of his pamphlets. The polished\r\nstyle, the admirable sense, the subdued and yet ever present wit, the\r\navoidance of excessive cleverness (the one thing that the average\r\nBriton will not stand), the constant eye on the object, are\r\nunmistakable. They are nearly as forcible as Dryden's political and\r\ncontroversial prefaces, which are pamphlets themselves in their way,\r\nand they excel them in knowledge of affairs, in urbanity, in\r\nadaptation to the special purpose. In all these points they resemble\r\nmore than anything else the pamphlets of Paul Louis Courier, and\r\nthere can be no higher praise than this.\r\n\r\nNo age in English history was more fertile in pamphlets than the\r\nreigns of William and of Anne. Some men of real distinction\r\noccasionally contributed to them, and others (such as Ferguson and\r\nMaynwaring) obtained such literary notoriety as they possess by their\r\nmeans. The total volume of the kind produced during the quarter of a\r\ncentury between the Revolution and the accession of George the First\r\nwould probably fill a considerable library. But the examples which\r\nreally deserve exhumation are very few, and I doubt whether any can\r\npretend to vie with the masterpieces of Defoe and Swift. Both these\r\ngreat writers were accomplished practitioners in the art, and the\r\ncharacteristics of both lent themselves with peculiar yet strangely\r\ndifferent readiness to the work. They addressed, indeed, different\r\nsections of what was even then the electorate. Defoe's unpolished\r\nrealism and his exact adaptation of tone, thought, taste, and fancy to\r\nthe measure of the common Englishman were what chiefly gave him a\r\nhearing. Swift aimed and flew higher, but also did not miss the lower\r\nmark. No one has ever doubted that Johnson's depreciation of _The\r\nConduct of the Allies_ was half special perversity (for he was always\r\nunjust to Swift), half mere humorous paradox. For there was much more\r\nof this in the doctor's utterances than his admirers, either in his\r\nown day or since, have always recognised, or have sometimes been\r\nqualified by Providence to recognise. As for the _Drapier's Letters_ I\r\ncan never myself admire them enough, and they seem to me to have been\r\non the whole under-rather than over-valued by posterity.\r\n\r\nThe 'Great Walpolian Battle' and the attacks on Bute and other\r\nfavourite ministers were very fertile in the pamphlet, but already\r\nthere were certain signs of alteration in its character. Pulteney and\r\nWalpole's other adversaries had already glimmerings of the newspaper\r\nproper, that is to say, of the continual dropping fire rather than the\r\nsingle heavy broadside; to adopt a better metaphor still, of a\r\nregimental and professional soldiery rather than of single volunteer\r\nchampions. The _Letters of Junius_, which for some time past have been\r\ngradually dropping from their former somewhat undue pride of place\r\n(gained and kept as much by the factitious mystery of their origin as\r\nby anything else) to a station more justly warranted, are no doubt\r\nthemselves pamphlets of a kind; but they are separated from pamphlets\r\nproper not less by their contents than by their form and continuity.\r\nThe real difference is this, that the pamphlet, though often if not\r\nalways personal enough, should always and generally does affect at\r\nleast to discuss a general question of principle or policy, whereas\r\nJunius is always personal first, and very generally last also. On the\r\nother hand, Burke, whether his productions be called Speeches or\r\nLetters, Thoughts or Reflections, is always a pamphleteer in heart and\r\nsoul, in form and matter. If the resemblance of his pamphlets to\r\nspeeches gives the force and fire, it is certain that the resemblance\r\nof his speeches to pamphlets accounts for that 'dinner-bell' effect of\r\nhis which has puzzled some people and shocked others. Burke always\r\nargued the point, if he only argued one side of it, and it is the\r\nspecial as it is the saving grace of the pamphlet that it must, or at\r\nleast should, be an argument, and not merely an invective or an\r\ninnuendo, a sermon or a lampoon.\r\n\r\nSydney Smith belonged both to the old school and the new. He was both\r\npamphleteer and journalist; but he kept the form and even to some\r\nextent the style of his pamphlets and his articles well apart. I may\r\nseem likely to have some difficulty in admitting the claim of Cobbett\r\nafter disallowing that of Junius under the definition just given, but\r\nI have no very great fear of being unable to making it good. Much as\r\nCobbett disliked persons, and crotchety as he was in his dislikes,\r\nthey were always dislikes of principle in the bottom. The singular\r\nTory-Radicalism which Cobbett exhibited, and which has made some rank\r\nhim unduly low, was no doubt partly due to accidents of birth and\r\neducation, and to narrowness of intellectual form. But boroughmongering\r\nafter all was a Whig rather than a Tory institution, and Cobbett's\r\nhatred of it, as well as that desire for the maintenance of a kind of\r\nmanufacturing yeomanry (not wholly different from the later ideal of\r\nMr. William Morris,) which was his other guiding principle throughout,\r\nwas by no means alien from pure Toryism. His work in relation to Reform,\r\nmoreover, is unmistakable--as unmistakable as is that of Sydney Smith,\r\nwho precedes him here, with regard to Catholic Emancipation. I should\r\nhave voted and written against both these things had I lived then; but\r\nthis does not make me enjoy Cobbett or Sydney any the less.\r\n\r\nAs for the latest example I have selected, it is a crucial one. The\r\n_Letters of Malachi Malagrowther_ come from a man who is not often\r\nrated high as a political thinker, even by those who sympathise with\r\nhis political views. But here as elsewhere the politician, no less\r\nthan the poet, the critic, the historian, bears the penalty of the\r\npre-eminent greatness of the novelist. Nothing is more uncritical than\r\nto regard Scott as a mere sentimentalist in politics, and I cannot\r\nthink that any competent judge can do so after reading _Malagrowther_,\r\neven after reading Scott's own Diary and letters on the subject. As he\r\nthere explains, he was not greatly carried, as a rule, to interest\r\nhimself in the details of politics. As both Lockhart and he admit, he\r\nmight not have been so interested even at this juncture had it not\r\nbeen for the chagrin at his own misfortunes, which, nobly and\r\nstoically repressed as it was, required some issue. But his general\r\nprinciple on this occasion was clear; it can be thoroughly apprehended\r\nand appreciated even by an Englishman of Englishmen. It was thoroughly\r\njustified by the event, and, I may perhaps be permitted to observe,\r\nran exactly contrary to a sentiment rather widely adopted of late. No\r\nman, whether in public writings or private conduct, could be more set\r\nthan Scott was against a spurious Scotch particularism. He even earned\r\nfrom silly Scots maledictions for the chivalrous justice he dealt to\r\nEngland in _The Lord of the Isles_, and the common-sense justice he\r\ndealt to her in the mouth of Bailie Jarvie. But he was not more\r\nstaunch for the political Union than he was for the preservation of\r\nminor institutions, manners, and character; and the proposed\r\ninterference with Scotch banking seemed to him to be one of the things\r\ntending to make good Scotchmen, as he bluntly told Croker, 'damned\r\nmischievous Englishmen.' Therefore he arose and spoke, and though he\r\naverted the immediate attempt, yet the prophecies which he uttered\r\nwere amply fulfilled in other ways after the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the principles on which I have selected the pieces\r\nthat follow (some minor reasons for the particular choices being given\r\nin the special introductions):--That they should be pamphlets proper\r\n(_Malachi_ appeared first in a newspaper, but that was a sign of the\r\ntime chiefly, and the numbers of Cobbett's _Register_ were practically\r\nindependent pieces); that they should deal with special subjects of\r\nburning political, and not merely personal, interest; and that they\r\nshould either directly or in the long-run have exercised an actual\r\ndetermining influence on the course of politics and history. This last\r\npoint is undoubted in the case of the examples from Halifax, Swift,\r\nBurke (who more than any one man pointed and steeled the resistance\r\nof England to Jacobin tyranny), and Scott; it was less immediate, but\r\nscarcely more dubious in those of Defoe, Cobbett, and Sydney Smith.\r\nAnd so in all humility I make my bow as introducer once more to the\r\nEnglish public of these Seven Masters of English political writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--'LETTER TO A DISSENTER'\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE SAVILE, MARQUESS OF HALIFAX\r\n\r\n\r\n(_There is no doubt that Halifax's work deserves to rank first in a\r\ncollection of political pamphlets. He signed none; it was indeed\r\nalmost impossible for a prominent person in the State then safely or\r\ndecently to do so, and different attributions were made at the time of\r\nsome of them, as of the _Character of a Trimmer_ to Coventry, and of\r\nthis _Letter_ (this 'masterly little tract,' as Macaulay justly calls\r\nit) to Temple. But shortly after his death all were published as his\r\nunchallenged, and there never has been any doubt of their authorship\r\nin the minds of good judges. Four of them are so good that extrinsic\r\nreasons have to be brought in for preferring one to the other. The\r\n_Character of a Trimmer_ is rather too long for my scheme; the _Anatomy\r\nof an Equivalent_ is too technical, and requires too much illustration\r\nand exegesis; the _Cautions for Choice of Members of Parliament_,\r\nthough practically valuable to the present day, is a little too\r\ngeneral. The _Letter to a Dissenter_ escapes all these objections. It\r\nis brief, it is thoroughly to the point, it is comprehensible almost\r\nwithout note or comment to any one who remembers the broad fact that\r\nby his Declaration of Indulgence James the Second attempted to detach,\r\nand almost succeeded in detaching, the Dissenters from their common\r\ncause with the Church in opposing his enfranchisement of the Roman\r\nCatholics, and his preferment of them to great offices. As for its\r\nauthor, his most eminent acts are written in the pages of the\r\nuniversally read historian above quoted. But he was in reality more of\r\na Tory than it suited Macaulay to represent him, though he gloried in\r\nthe name of Trimmer, and certainly showed what is called in modern\r\npolitical slang a 'crossbench mind' not only during the madness of the\r\nPopish plot, during the greater madness of James's assaults on the\r\nChurch, the Constitution, and private rights, but also (after the\r\nRevolution) towards William of Orange. Born about 1630 he died in\r\nApril 1695, leaving the fame, unjustified by any samples in those\r\nunreported days, of the greatest orator of his time, a reputation as a\r\nwit which was partly inherited by his grandson, Chesterfield, and the\r\nsmall volume of _Miscellanies_, on which we here draw. The pamphlet\r\nitself appeared in April 1687._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO A DISSENTER, UPON OCCASION OF HIS MAJESTY'S LATE GRACIOUS\r\nDECLARATION OF INDULGENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nSir--Since addresses are in fashion, give me leave to make one to you.\r\nThis is neither the effect of fear, interest, or resentment; therefore\r\nyou may be sure it is sincere: and for that reason it may expect to be\r\nkindly received. Whether it will have power enough to convince,\r\ndependeth upon the reasons of which you are to judge; and upon your\r\npreparation of mind, to be persuaded by truth, whenever it appeareth\r\nto you. It ought not to be the less welcome for coming from a friendly\r\nhand, one whose kindness to you is not lessened by difference of\r\nopinion, and who will not let his thoughts for the public be so tied\r\nor confined to this or that sub-division of Protestants as to stifle\r\nthe charity, which besides all other arguments, is at this time become\r\nnecessary to preserve us.\r\n\r\nI am neither surprised nor provoked, to see that in the condition you\r\nwere put into by the laws, and the ill circumstances you lay under, by\r\nhaving the Exclusion and Rebellion laid to your charge, you were\r\ndesirous to make yourselves less uneasy and obnoxious to authority.\r\nMen who are sore, run to the nearest remedy with too much haste to\r\nconsider all the consequences: grains of allowance are to be given,\r\nwhere nature giveth such strong influences. When to men under\r\nsufferings it offereth ease, the present pain will hardly allow time\r\nto examine the remedies; and the strongest reason can hardly gain a\r\nfair audience from our mind, whilst so possessed, till the smart is a\r\nlittle allayed.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether the warmth that naturally belongeth to new\r\nfriendships, may not make it a harder task for me to persuade you. It\r\nis like telling lovers, in the beginning of their joys, that they will\r\nin a little time have an end. Such an unwelcome style doth not easily\r\nfind credit. But I will suppose you are not so far gone in your new\r\npassion, but that you will hear still; and therefore I am also under\r\nthe less discouragement, when I offer to your consideration two\r\nthings. The _first_ is, the cause you have to suspect your new\r\nfriends. The _second_, the duty incumbent upon you, in Christianity\r\nand prudence, not to hazard the public safety, neither by desire of\r\nease nor of revenge.\r\n\r\nTo the _first_. Consider that notwithstanding the smooth language\r\nwhich is now put on to engage you, these new friends did not make you\r\ntheir choice, but their refuge. They have ever made their first\r\ncourtships to the Church of England, and when they were rejected\r\nthere, they made their application to you in the second place. The\r\ninstances of this might be given in all times. I do not repeat them,\r\nbecause whatsoever is unnecessary must be tedious; the truth of this\r\nassertion being so plain as not to admit a dispute. You cannot\r\ntherefore reasonably flatter yourselves that there is any inclination\r\nto you. They never pretended to allow you any quarter, but to usher in\r\nliberty for themselves under that shelter. I refer you to Mr.\r\nColeman's Letters, and to the Journals of Parliament, where you may be\r\nconvinced, if you can be so mistaken as to doubt; nay, at this very\r\nhour they can hardly forbear, in the height of their courtship, to let\r\nfall hard words of you. So little is nature to be restrained; it will\r\nstart out sometimes, disdaining to submit to the usurpation of art and\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThis alliance, between liberty and infallibility, is bringing together\r\nthe two most contrary things that are in the world. The Church of Rome\r\ndoth not only dislike the allowing liberty, but by its principles it\r\ncannot do it. Wine is not more expressly forbid to the Mahometans,\r\nthan giving heretics liberty to the Papists. They are no more able to\r\nmake good their vows to you, than men married before, and their wife\r\nalive, can confirm their contract with another. The continuance of\r\ntheir kindness would be a habit of sin, of which they are to repent;\r\nand their absolution is to be had upon no other terms than their\r\npromise to destroy you. You are therefore to be hugged now, only that\r\nyou may be the better squeezed at another time. There must be\r\nsomething extraordinary when the Church of Rome setteth up bills, and\r\noffereth plaisters, for tender consciences. By all that hath hitherto\r\nappeared, her skill in chirurgery lieth chiefly in a quick hand to cut\r\noff limbs; but she is the worst at healing of any that ever pretended\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nTo come so quick from another extreme is such an unnatural motion that\r\nyou ought to be upon your guard. The other day you were Sons of\r\nBelial; now you are Angels of Light. This is a violent change, and it\r\nwill be fit for you to pause upon it before you believe it. If your\r\nfeatures are not altered, neither is their opinion of you, whatever\r\nmay be pretended. Do you believe less than you did that there is\r\nidolatry in the Church of Rome? Sure you do not. See, then, how they\r\ntreat, both in words and writing, those who entertain that opinion.\r\nConclude from hence, how inconsistent their favour is with this single\r\narticle, except they give you a dispensation for this too, and not by\r\na _non obstante_, secure you that they will not think the worse of\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThink a little how dangerous it is to build upon a foundation of\r\nparadoxes. Popery now is the only friend to liberty, and the known\r\nenemy to persecution. The men of Taunton and Tiverton are above all\r\nother eminent for Loyalty. The Quakers, from being declared by the\r\nPapists not to be Christians, are now made favourites, and taken into\r\ntheir particular protection; they are on a sudden grown the most\r\naccomplished men of the kingdom in good breeding, and give thanks with\r\nthe best grace in double-refined language. So that I should not\r\nwonder, though a man of that persuasion, in spite of his hat, should\r\nbe Master of the Ceremonies. Not to say harsher words, these are such\r\nvery new things, that it is impossible not to suspend our belief, till\r\nby a little more experience, we may be informed whether they are\r\nrealities or apparitions. We have been under shameful mistakes, if\r\nthese opinions are true; but for the present we are apt to be\r\nincredulous, except that we could be convinced that the priest's words\r\nin this case too are able to make such a sudden and effectual change;\r\nand that their power is not limited to the Sacrament, but that it\r\nextendeth to alter the nature of all other things, as often as they\r\nare so disposed.\r\n\r\nLet me now speak of the instruments of your friendship, and then leave\r\nyou to judge whether they do not afford matter of suspicion. No\r\nsharpness is to be mingled, where healing only is intended; so nothing\r\nwill be said to expose particular men, how strong soever the\r\ntemptation may be, or how clear the proofs to make it out. A word or\r\ntwo in general, for your better caution, shall suffice. Suppose then,\r\nfor argument's sake, that the mediators of this new alliance should\r\nbe such as have been formerly employed in treaties of the same kind,\r\nand there detected to have acted by order, and to have been empowered\r\nto give encouragements and rewards. Would not this be an argument to\r\nsuspect them?\r\n\r\nIf they should plainly be under engagements to one side, their\r\narguments to the other ought to be received accordingly. Their fair\r\npretences are to be looked upon as a part of their commission, which\r\nmay not improbably give them a dispensation in the case of truth, when\r\nit may bring a prejudice upon the service of those by whom they are\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nIf there should be men, who having formerly had means and authority to\r\npersuade by secular arguments, have, in pursuance of that power,\r\nsprinkled money among the Dissenting ministers; and if those very men\r\nshould now have the same authority, practise the same methods, and\r\ndisburse where they cannot otherwise persuade; it seemeth to me to be\r\nrather an evidence than a presumption of the deceit.\r\n\r\nIf there should be ministers amongst you, who by having fallen under\r\ntemptations of this kind, are in some sort engaged to continue their\r\nfrailty, by the awe they are in lest it should be exposed; the\r\npersuasions of these unfortunate men must sure have the less force,\r\nand their arguments, though never so specious, are to be suspected,\r\nwhen they come from men who have mortgaged themselves to severe\r\ncreditors, that expect a rigorous observance of the contract, let it\r\nbe never so unwarrantable. If these, or any others, should at this\r\ntime preach up anger and vengeance against the Church of England; may\r\nit not without injustice be suspected that a thing so plainly out of\r\nseason springeth rather from corruption than mistake; and that those\r\nwho act this choleric part, do not believe themselves, but only pursue\r\nhigher directions, and endeavour to make good that part of their\r\ncontract, which obligeth them, upon a forfeiture, to make use of their\r\nenflaming eloquence? They might apprehend their wages would be\r\nretrenched if they should be moderate: and therefore, whilst violence\r\nis their interest, those who have not the same arguments have no\r\nreason to follow such a partial example.\r\n\r\nIf there should be men, who by the load of their crimes against the\r\nGovernment, have been bowed down to comply with it against their\r\nconscience; who by incurring the want of a pardon, have drawn upon\r\nthemselves a necessity of an entire resignation, such men are to be\r\nlamented, but not to be believed. Nay, they themselves, when they have\r\ndischarged their unwelcome talk, will be inwardly glad that their\r\nforced endeavours do not succeed, and are pleased when men resist\r\ntheir insinuations; which are far from being voluntary or sincere, but\r\nare squeezed out of them by the weight of their being so obnoxious.\r\n\r\nIf, in the height of this great dearness, by comparing things, it\r\nshould happen that at this instant there is much a surer friendship\r\nwith those who are so far from allowing liberty that they allow no\r\nliving to a Protestant under them--let the scene lie in what part of\r\nthe world it will, the argument will come home, and sure it will\r\nafford sufficient ground to suspect. Apparent contradictions must\r\nstrike us; neither nature nor reason can digest them. Self-flattery,\r\nand the desire to deceive ourselves, to gratify present appetite, with\r\nall their power, which is great, cannot get the better of such broad\r\nconviction, as some things carry along with them. Will you call these\r\nvain and empty suspicions? Have you been at all times so void of fears\r\nand jealousies, as to justify your being so unreasonably valiant in\r\nhaving none upon this occasion? Such an extraordinary courage at this\r\nunseasonable time, to say no more, is too dangerous a virtue to be\r\ncommended.\r\n\r\nIf then, for these and a thousand other reasons, there is cause to\r\nsuspect, sure your new friends are not to dictate to you, or advise\r\nyou. For instance: the Addresses that fly abroad every week, and\r\nmurder us with _another to the same_; the first draughts are made by\r\nthose who are not very proper to be secretaries to the Protestant\r\nReligion: and it is your part only to write them out fairer again.\r\n\r\nStrange! that you, who have been formerly so much against _set\r\nforms_, should now be content the priests should indite for you. The\r\nnature of thanks is an unavoidable consequence of being pleased or\r\nobliged; they grow in the heart, and from thence show themselves\r\neither in looks, speech, writing, or action. No man was ever thankful\r\nbecause he was bid to be so, but because he had, or thought he had\r\nsome reason for it. If then there is cause in this case to pay such\r\nextravagant acknowledgments, they will flow naturally, without taking\r\nsuch pains to procure them; and it is unkindly done to tire all the\r\nPost-horses with carrying circular letters, to solicit that which\r\nwould be done without any trouble or constraint. If it is really in\r\nitself such a favour, what needeth so much pressing men to be\r\nthankful, and with such eager circumstances, that where persuasions\r\ncannot delude, threatenings are employed to fright them into a\r\ncompliance? Thanks must be voluntary, not only unconstrained but\r\nunsolicited, else they are either trifles or snares, that either\r\nsignify nothing or a great deal more than is intended by those that\r\ngive them. If an inference should be made, that whosoever thanketh the\r\nKing for his Declaration, is by that engaged to justify it in point of\r\nlaw; it is a greater stride than I presume all those care to make who\r\nare persuaded to address. It shall be supposed that all the thankers\r\nwill be repealers of the Test, whenever a Parliament shall meet; such\r\nan expectation is better prevented before than disappointed\r\nafterwards; and the surest way to avoid the lying under such a scandal\r\nis not to do anything that may give a colour to the mistake. These\r\nbespoken thanks are little less improper than love-letters that were\r\nsolicited by the lady to whom they are to be directed: so that,\r\nbesides the little ground there is to give them, the manner of getting\r\nthem doth extremely lessen their value. It might be wished that you\r\nwould have suppressed your impatience, and have been content, for the\r\nsake of religion, to enjoy it within yourselves, without the liberty\r\nof a public exercise, till a Parliament had allowed it; but since that\r\ncould not be, and that the articles of some amongst you have made use\r\nof the well-meant zeal of the generality to draw them into this\r\nmistake, I am so far from blaming you with that sharpness, which\r\nperhaps the matter in strictness would bear, that I am ready to err on\r\nthe side of the more gentle construction.\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference between enjoying quietly the advantages of\r\nan act irregularly done by others, and the going about to support it\r\nagainst the laws in being. The law is so sacred that no trespass\r\nagainst it is to be defended; yet frailties may in some measure be\r\nexcused when they cannot be justified. The desire of enjoying liberty,\r\nfrom which men have been so long restrained, may be a temptation that\r\ntheir reason is not at all times able to resist. If in such a case\r\nsome objections are leapt over, indifferent men will be more inclined\r\nto lament the occasion than to fall too hard upon the fault, whilst it\r\nis covered with the apology of a good intention. But where, to rescue\r\nyourselves from the severity of one law, you give a blow to all the\r\nlaws, by which your religion and liberty are to be protected; and\r\ninstead of silently receiving the benefit of this indulgence, you set\r\nup for advocates to support it, you become voluntary aggressors, and\r\nlook like counsel retained by the prerogative against your old friend\r\nMagna Charta, who hath done nothing to deserve her falling thus under\r\nyour displeasure.\r\n\r\nIf the case then should be, that the price expected from you for this\r\nliberty is giving up your right in the laws, sure you will think twice\r\nbefore you go any further in such a losing bargain. After giving\r\nthanks for the breach of one law, you lose the right of complaining of\r\nthe breach of all the rest; you will not very well know how to defend\r\nyourselves when you are pressed; and having given up the question when\r\nit was for your advantage, you cannot recall it when it shall be to\r\nyour prejudice. If you will set up at one time a power to help you,\r\nwhich at another time, by parity of reason, shall be made use of to\r\ndestroy you, you will neither be pitied nor relieved against a\r\nmischief which you draw upon yourselves by being so unreasonably\r\nthankful. It is like calling in auxiliaries to help, who are strong\r\nenough to subdue you. In such a case your complaints will come too\r\nlate to be heard, and your sufferings will raise mirth instead of\r\ncompassion.\r\n\r\nIf you think, for your excuse, to expound your thanks, so as to\r\nrestrain them to this particular case; others, for their ends, will\r\nextend them further: and in these differing interpretations, that\r\nwhich is backed by authority will be the most likely to prevail;\r\nespecially when, by the advantage you have given them, they have in\r\ntruth the better of the argument, and that the inferences from your\r\nown concessions are very strong and express against you. This is so\r\nfar from being a groundless supposition, that there was a late\r\ninstance of it in the last session of Parliament, in the House of\r\nLords, where the first thanks, though things of course, were\r\ninterpreted to be the approbation of the King's whole speech, and a\r\nrestraint from the further examination of any part of it, though never\r\nso much disliked; and it was with difficulty obtained, not to be\r\nexcluded from the liberty of objecting to this mighty prerogative of\r\ndispensing, merely by this innocent and usual piece of good manners,\r\nby which no such thing could possibly be intended.\r\n\r\nThis showeth that some bounds are to be put to your good breeding, and\r\nthat the Constitution of England is too valuable a thing to be\r\nventured upon a compliment. Now that you have for some time enjoyed\r\nthe benefit of the end, it is time for you to look into the danger of\r\nthe means. The same reason that made you desirous to get liberty must\r\nmake you solicitous to preserve it, so that the next thought will\r\nnaturally be, not to engage yourself beyond retreat; and to agree so\r\nfar with the principles of all religion, as not to rely upon a\r\ndeath-bed repentance.\r\n\r\nThere are certain periods of time, which being once past, make all\r\ncautions ineffectual, and all remedies desperate. Our understandings\r\nare apt to be hurried on by the first heats, which, if not restrained\r\nin time, do not give us leave to look back till it is too late.\r\nConsider this in the case of your anger against the Church of England,\r\nand take warning by their mistake in the same kind, when after the\r\nlate King's Restoration they preserved so long the bitter taste of\r\nyour rough usage to them in other times, that it made them forget\r\ntheir interest and sacrifice it to their revenge.\r\n\r\nEither you will blame this proceeding in them, and for that reason not\r\nfollow it; or, if you allow it, you have no reason to be offended with\r\nthem; so that you must either dismiss your anger or lose your excuse;\r\nexcept you should argue more partially than will be supposed of men of\r\nyour morality and understanding.\r\n\r\nIf you had now to do with those rigid prelates who made it a matter of\r\nconscience to give you the least indulgence, but kept you at an\r\nuncharitable distance, and even to your most reasonable scruples\r\ncontinued stiff and inexorable, the argument might be fairer on your\r\nside; but since the common danger has so laid open that mistake, that\r\nall the former haughtiness towards you is for ever extinguished, and\r\nthat it hath turned the spirit of persecution into a spirit of peace,\r\ncharity, and condescension; shall this happy change only affect the\r\nChurch of England? And are you so in love with separation as not to be\r\nmoved by this example? It ought to be followed, were there no other\r\nreason than that it is virtue; but when, besides that, it is become\r\nnecessary to your preservation, it is impossible to fail the having\r\nits effect upon you.\r\n\r\nIf it should be said that the Church of England is never humble but\r\nwhen she is out of power, and therefore loseth the right of being\r\nbelieved when she pretendeth to it: the answer is, _first_, It would\r\nbe an uncharitable objection, and very much mistimed; an unseasonable\r\ntriumph, not only ungenerous but unsafe: so that in these respects it\r\ncannot be urged without scandal, even though it could be said with\r\ntruth. _Secondly_, This is not so in fact, and the argument must fall,\r\nbeing built upon a false foundation; for whatever may be told you at\r\nthis very hour, and in the heat and glare of your perfect sunshine,\r\nthe Church of England can in a moment bring clouds again, and turn\r\nthe royal thunder upon your heads, blow you off the stage with a\r\nbreath, if she would give but a smile or a kind word; the least\r\nglimpse of her compliance would throw you back into the state of\r\nsuffering, and draw upon you all the arrears of severity which have\r\naccrued during the time of this kindness to you; and yet the Church of\r\nEngland, with all her faults, will not allow herself to be rescued by\r\nsuch unjustifiable means, but chooseth to bear the weight of power\r\nrather than lie under the burden of being criminal.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that she is unprovoked: books and letters come out\r\nevery day to call for answers, yet she will not be stirred. From the\r\nsupposed authors and the style, one would swear they were undertakers,\r\nand had made a contract to fall out with the Church of England. There\r\nare lashes in every address, challenges to draw the pen in every\r\npamphlet. In short, the fairest occasions in the world given to\r\nquarrel; but she wisely distinguisheth between the body of Dissenters,\r\nwhom she will suppose to act, as they do, with no ill intent, and\r\nthese small skirmishers, picked and sent out to piqueer, and to begin\r\na fray amongst the Protestants for the entertainment as well as the\r\nadvantage of the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\nThis conduct is so good, that it will be scandalous not to applaud it.\r\nIt is not equal dealing to blame our adversaries for doing ill, and\r\nnot commend them when they do well.\r\n\r\nTo hate them because they are persecuted, and not to be reconciled to\r\nthem when they are ready to suffer rather than receive all the\r\nadvantages that can be gained by a criminal compliance, is a principle\r\nno sort of Christians can own, since it would give an objection to\r\nthem never to be answered.\r\n\r\nThink a little who they were that promoted your former persecutions,\r\nand then consider how it will look to be angry with the instruments,\r\nand at the same time to make a league with the authors of your\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\nHave you enough considered what will be expected from you? Are you\r\nready to stand in every borough by virtue of a _congé d'élire_, and\r\ninstead of election be satisfied if you are returned?\r\n\r\nWill you, in parliament, justify the dispensing power, with all its\r\nconsequences, and repeal the test, by which you will make way for the\r\nrepeal of all the laws that were made to preserve your religion, and\r\nto enact others that shall destroy it?\r\n\r\nAre you disposed to change the liberty of debate into the merit of\r\nobedience; and to be made instruments to repeal or enact laws, when\r\nthe Roman Consistory are Lords of the Articles?\r\n\r\nAre you so linked to your new friends as to reject any indulgence a\r\nparliament shall offer you, if it shall not be so comprehensive as to\r\ninclude the Papists in it?\r\n\r\nConsider that the implied conditions of your new treaty are no less\r\nthan that you are to do everything you are desired, without examining;\r\nand that for this pretended liberty of conscience, your real freedom\r\nis to be sacrificed; your former faults hang like chains still about\r\nyou, you are let loose only upon bail; the first act of non-compliance\r\nsendeth you to gaol again.\r\n\r\nYou may see that the Papists themselves do not rely upon the legality\r\nof this power which you are to justify, since the being so very\r\nearnest to get it established by a law, and the doing such very hard\r\nthings in order, as they think, to obtain it, is a clear evidence that\r\nthey do not think that the single power of the Crown is in this case a\r\ngood foundation; especially when this is done under a prince so very\r\ntender of the rights of sovereignty that he would think it a\r\ndiminution to his prerogative, where he conceiveth it strong enough to\r\ngo alone, to call in the legislative help to strengthen and support\r\nit.\r\n\r\nYou have formerly blamed the Church of England, and not without\r\nreason, for going so far as they did in their compliance; and yet so\r\nsoon as they stopped, you see they are not only deserted, but\r\nprosecuted. Conclude, then, from this example, that you must either\r\nbreak off your friendship or resolve to have no bounds in it. If they\r\ndo succeed in their design, they will leave you first: if they do, you\r\nmust either leave them, when it will be too late for your safety, or\r\nelse, after the squeaziness of starting at a surplice, you must be\r\nforced to swallow Transubstantiation.\r\n\r\nRemember that the other day those of the Church of England were\r\nTrimmers for enduring you; and now, by a sudden turn, you are become\r\nthe favourites. Do not deceive yourselves; it is not the nature of\r\nlasting plants thus to shoot up in a night; you may look gay and green\r\nfor a little time, but you want a root to give you a continuance. It\r\nis not so long since, as to be forgotten, that the maxim was, It is\r\nimpossible for a Dissenter not to be a REBEL. Consider at this time in\r\nFrance, even the new converts are so far from being employed that they\r\nare disarmed; their sudden change maketh them still to be distrusted,\r\nnotwithstanding that they are reconciled; what are you to expect then\r\nfrom your dear friends, to whom, whenever they shall think fit to\r\nthrow you off again, you have in other times given such arguments for\r\ntheir excuse?\r\n\r\nBesides all this you act very unskilfully against your visible\r\ninterest, if you throw away the advantages of which you can hardly\r\nfail in the next probable Revolution. Things tend naturally to what\r\nyou would have, if you would let them alone, and not by an\r\nunseasonable activity lose the influences of your good star, which\r\npromiseth you everything that is prosperous.\r\n\r\nThe Church of England, convinced of its error in being severe to you;\r\nthe Parliament, whenever it meeteth sure to be gentle to you; the next\r\nheir, bred in the country which you have so often quoted for a pattern\r\nof indulgence; a general agreement of all thinking men, that we must\r\nno more cut ourselves off from the Protestants abroad, but rather\r\nenlarge the foundations upon which we are to build our defences\r\nagainst the common enemy; so that in truth, all things seem to\r\nconspire to give you ease and satisfaction, if by too much haste to\r\nanticipate your good fortune you do not destroy it.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants have but one article of human strength to oppose the\r\npower which is now against them, and that is not to lose the advantage\r\nof their numbers by being so unwary as to let themselves be divided.\r\n\r\nWe all agree in our duty to our prince; our objections to his belief\r\ndo not hinder us from seeing his virtues; and our not complying with\r\nhis religion hath no effect upon our allegiance. We are not to be\r\nlaughed out of our passive obedience, and the doctrine of\r\nnon-resistance, though even those who perhaps owe the best part of\r\ntheir security to that principle are apt to make a jest of it.\r\n\r\nSo that if we give no advantage by the fatal mistake of misapplying\r\nour anger, by the natural course of things this danger will pass away\r\nlike a shower of hail; fair weather will succeed, as lowering as the\r\nsky now looketh, and all this by a plain and easy receipt. Let us be\r\nstill, quiet, and undivided, firm at the same time to our religion,\r\nour loyalty, and our laws; and so long as we continue this method it\r\nis next to impossible that the odds of two hundred to one should lose\r\nthe bet; except the Church of Rome, which hath been so long barren of\r\nmiracles, should now, in her declining age, be brought to bed of one\r\nthat would outdo the best she can brag of in her legend.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the short question will be, Whether you will join with\r\nthose who must in the end run the same fate with you? If Protestants\r\nof all sorts, in their behaviour to one another, have been to blame,\r\nthey are upon more equal terms, and, for that very reason, it is\r\nfitter for them now to be reconciled. Our disunion is not only a\r\nreproach, but a danger to us. Those who believe in modern miracles\r\nhave more right, or at least more excuse, to neglect all secular\r\ncaution; but for us, it is as justifiable to have no religion as\r\nwilfully to throw away the human means of preserving it.--I am, Dear\r\nSir, your most affectionate humble Servant, T.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--'THE SHORTEST WAY WITH THE DISSENTERS'\r\n\r\nBY DANIEL DEFOE\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Defoe wrote an enormous number of pamphlets; for great part of his\r\nlife he might almost have been described as a pamphleteer pure and\r\nsimple. In the vast lists of publications which his biographers and\r\nbibliographers have compiled, partly by industry and partly by\r\nimagination, by far the larger number of entries is of the pamphlet\r\nkind. Indeed, as most people know, Defoe did not take to the\r\ncomposition of the fiction which has made his name famous till very\r\nlate in life. Born in the year 1661, he began pamphleteering when he\r\nwas scarcely of age, and continued in that way (with occasional\r\nexcursions into work larger in scale, but not very different in style\r\nor matter) for nearly forty years before the publication of _Robinson\r\nCrusoe_. His two most famous and most effective pamphlets were the\r\nso-called _Legion Letter_ and _The Shortest Way with the Dissenters_\r\n(given here), to which may perhaps be added the _Reasons against War\r\nwith France_. All these, with many others, appeared within the\r\ncompass of the years 1700-1702. The three together touched upon the\r\nthree most burning questions of the late seventeenth and early\r\neighteenth centuries--parliamentary factiousness, an aggressive policy\r\nabroad, and toleration at home. Little or no annotation is required\r\nfor their comprehension, but the reader may amuse himself if he likes\r\nby meditating whether the _Shortest Way_ is irony or not. My own\r\nopinion is that it is not; being a simple statement of the actual\r\nviews of the other side. The anecdotic history of the piece--how it\r\nwas taken for serious by both sides, was prosecuted by Government, the\r\nauthor proclaimed, and a reward offered for his detection; how, the\r\nprinter and publisher being arrested, Defoe surrendered, was tried,\r\npleaded guilty, was fined, pilloried, and imprisoned--may be read in\r\nthe biographies. His imprisonment lasted till August 1704, when Harley\r\nlet him out, and he entered upon a course of rather mysterious service\r\nas a Government free-lance, which was continued under various\r\nministries, and has not on the whole brought him credit with\r\nposterity. For many years, his remarkable _Review_, a political\r\njournal which he conducted single-handed, served as his chief organ;\r\nbut he never gave up writing pamphlets till his death in 1731, though\r\nhe never approached either the merit or the effect of that here\r\ngiven._)\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Roger L'Estrange tells us a story in his collection of fables, of\r\nthe cock and the horses. The cock was gotten to roost in the stable\r\namong the horses, and there being no racks or other conveniences for\r\nhim, it seems he was forced to roost upon the ground. The horses\r\njostling about for room, and putting the cock in danger of his life,\r\nhe gives them this grave advice, 'Pray, gentlefolks, let us stand\r\nstill, for fear we should tread upon one another.'\r\n\r\nThere are some people in the world, who now they are unperched, and\r\nreduced to an equality with other people, and under strong and very\r\njust apprehensions of being further treated as they deserve, begin,\r\nwith Æsop's cock, to preach up peace and union, and the Christian\r\nduties of moderation, forgetting that, when they had the power in\r\ntheir hands, these graces were strangers in their gates.\r\n\r\nIt is now near fourteen years that the glory and peace of the purest\r\nand most flourishing Church in the world has been eclipsed, buffeted,\r\nand disturbed by a sort of men whom God in His providence has suffered\r\nto insult over her and bring her down. These have been the days of her\r\nhumiliation and tribulation. She has borne with invincible patience\r\nthe reproach of the wicked, and God has at last heard her prayers, and\r\ndelivered her from the oppression of the stranger.\r\n\r\nAnd now they find their day is over, their power gone, and the throne\r\nof this nation possessed by a royal, English, true, and ever-constant\r\nmember of, and friend to, the Church of England. Now they find that\r\nthey are in danger of the Church of England's just resentments; now\r\nthey cry out peace, union, forbearance, and charity, as if the Church\r\nhad not too long harboured her enemies under her wing, and nourished\r\nthe viperous brood till they hiss and fly in the face of the mother\r\nthat cherished them.\r\n\r\nNo, gentlemen, the time of mercy is past, your day of grace is over;\r\nyou should have practised peace, and moderation, and charity, if you\r\nexpected any yourselves.\r\n\r\nWe have heard none of this lesson for fourteen years past. We have\r\nbeen huffed and bullied with your Act of Toleration; you have told us\r\nthat you are the Church established by law, as well as others; have\r\nset up your canting synagogues at our church doors, and the Church and\r\nmembers have been loaded with reproaches, with oaths, associations,\r\nabjurations, and what not. Where has been the mercy, the forbearance,\r\nthe charity, you have shown to tender consciences of the Church of\r\nEngland, that could not take oaths as fast as you made them; that\r\nhaving sworn allegiance to their lawful and rightful King, could not\r\ndispense with that oath, their King being still alive, and swear to\r\nyour new hodge-podge of a Dutch Government? These have been turned out\r\nof their livings, and they and their families left to starve; their\r\nestates double taxed to carry on a war they had no hand in, and you\r\ngot nothing by. What account can you give of the multitudes you have\r\nforced to comply, against their consciences, with your new sophistical\r\npolitics, who, like new converts in France, sin because they cannot\r\nstarve? And now the tables are turned upon you; you must not be\r\npersecuted; it is not a Christian spirit.\r\n\r\nYou have butchered one king, deposed another king, and made a mock\r\nking of a third, and yet you could have the face to expect to be\r\nemployed and trusted by the fourth. Anybody that did not know the\r\ntemper of your party would stand amazed at the impudence, as well as\r\nfolly, to think of it.\r\n\r\nYour management of your Dutch monarch, whom you reduced to a mere King\r\nof Clouts, is enough to give any future princes such an idea of your\r\nprinciples as to warn them sufficiently from coming into your\r\nclutches; and God be thanked the Queen is out of your hands, knows\r\nyou, and will have a care of you.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but the supreme authority of a nation has in itself\r\na power, and a right to that power, to execute the laws upon any part\r\nof that nation it governs. The execution of the known laws of the\r\nland, and that with a weak and gentle hand neither, was all this\r\nfanatical party of this land have ever called persecution; this they\r\nhave magnified to a height, that the sufferings of the Huguenots in\r\nFrance were not to be compared with. Now, to execute the known laws\r\nof a nation upon those who transgress them, after voluntarily\r\nconsenting to the making those laws, can never be called persecution,\r\nbut justice. But justice is always violence to the party offending,\r\nfor every man is innocent in his own eyes. The first execution of the\r\nlaws against Dissenters in England was in the days of King James the\r\nFirst; and what did it amount to truly? The worst they suffered was at\r\ntheir own request: to let them go to New England and erect a new\r\ncolony, and give them great privileges, grants, and suitable powers,\r\nkeep them under protection, and defend them against all invaders, and\r\nreceive no taxes or revenue from them. This was the cruelty of the\r\nChurch of England. Fatal leniency! It was the ruin of that excellent\r\nprince, King Charles the First. Had King James sent all the Puritans\r\nin England away to the West Indies, we had been a national, unmixed\r\nChurch; the Church of England had been kept undivided and entire.\r\n\r\nTo requite the lenity of the father they take up arms against the son;\r\nconquer, pursue, take, imprison, and at last put to death the anointed\r\nof God, and destroy the very being and nature of government, setting\r\nup a sordid impostor, who had neither title to govern nor\r\nunderstanding to manage, but supplied that want with power, bloody and\r\ndesperate counsels, and craft without conscience.\r\n\r\nHad not King James the First withheld the full execution of the laws,\r\nhad he given them strict justice, he had cleared the nation of them,\r\nand the consequences had been plain: his son had never been murdered\r\nby them nor the monarchy overwhelmed. It was too much mercy shown them\r\nwas the ruin of his posterity and the ruin of the nation's peace. One\r\nwould think the Dissenters should not have the face to believe that we\r\nare to be wheedled and canted into peace and toleration when they know\r\nthat they have once requited us with a civil war, and once with an\r\nintolerable and unrighteous persecution for our former civility.\r\n\r\nNay, to encourage us to be easy with them, it is apparent that they\r\nnever had the upper hand of the Church, but they treated her with all\r\nthe severity, with all the reproach and contempt that was possible.\r\nWhat peace and what mercy did they show the loyal gentry of the Church\r\nof England in the time of their triumphant Commonwealth? How did they\r\nput all the gentry of England to ransom, whether they were actually in\r\narms for the King or not, making people compound for their estates and\r\nstarve their families? How did they treat the clergy of the Church of\r\nEngland, sequestered the ministers, devoured the patrimony of the\r\nChurch, and divided the spoil by sharing the Church lands among their\r\nsoldiers, and turning her clergy out to starve? Just such measure as\r\nthey have meted should be measured them again.\r\n\r\nCharity and love is the known doctrine of the Church of England, and\r\nit is plain she has put it in practice towards the Dissenters, even\r\nbeyond what they ought, till she has been wanting to herself, and in\r\neffect unkind to her sons, particularly in the too much lenity of King\r\nJames the First, mentioned before. Had he so rooted the Puritans from\r\nthe face of the land, which he had an opportunity early to have done,\r\nthey had not had the power to vex the Church as since they have done.\r\n\r\nIn the days of King Charles the Second how did the Church reward their\r\nbloody doings with lenity and mercy, except the barbarous regicides of\r\nthe pretended court of justice? Not a soul suffered for all the blood\r\nin an unnatural war. King Charles came in all mercy and love,\r\ncherished them, preferred them, employed them, withheld the rigour of\r\nthe law, and oftentimes, even against the advice of his Parliament,\r\ngave them liberty of conscience; and how did they requite him with the\r\nvillanous contrivance to depose and murder him and his successor at\r\nthe Rye Plot?\r\n\r\nKing James, as if mercy was the inherent quality of the family, began\r\nhis reign with unusual favour to them. Nor could their joining with\r\nthe Duke of Monmouth against him move him to do himself justice upon\r\nthem; but that mistaken prince thought to win them by gentleness and\r\nlove, proclaimed an universal liberty to them, and rather\r\ndiscountenanced the Church of England than them. How they requited him\r\nall the world knows.\r\n\r\nThe late reign is too fresh in the memory of all the world to need a\r\ncomment; how, under pretence of joining with the Church in redressing\r\nsome grievances, they pushed things to that extremity, in conjunction\r\nwith some mistaken gentlemen, as to depose the late King, as if the\r\ngrievance of the nation could not have been redressed but by the\r\nabsolute ruin of the prince. Here is an instance of their temper,\r\ntheir peace, and charity. To what height they carried themselves\r\nduring the reign of a king of their own; how they crept into all\r\nplaces of trust and profit; how they insinuated into the favour of the\r\nKing, and were at first preferred to the highest places in the nation;\r\nhow they engrossed the ministry, and above all, how pitifully they\r\nmanaged, is too plain to need any remarks.\r\n\r\nBut particularly their mercy and charity, the spirit of union, they\r\ntell us so much of, has been remarkable in Scotland. If any man would\r\nsee the spirit of a Dissenter, let him look into Scotland. There they\r\nmade entire conquest of the Church, trampled down the sacred orders,\r\nand suppressed the Episcopal government with an absolute, and, as they\r\nsuppose, irretrievable victory, though it is possible they may find\r\nthemselves mistaken. Now it would be a very proper question to ask\r\ntheir impudent advocate, the Observator, pray how much mercy and\r\nfavour did the members of the Episcopal Church find in Scotland from\r\nthe Scotch Presbyterian Government? and I shall undertake for the\r\nChurch of England that the Dissenters shall still receive as much\r\nhere, though they deserve but little.\r\n\r\nIn a small treatise of the sufferings of the Episcopal clergy in\r\nScotland, it will appear what usage they met with; how they not only\r\nlost their livings, but in several places were plundered and abused in\r\ntheir persons; the ministers that could not conform turned out with\r\nnumerous families and no maintenance, and hardly charity enough left\r\nto relieve them with a bit of bread. And the cruelties of the parties\r\nare innumerable, and not to be attempted in this short piece.\r\n\r\nAnd now to prevent the distant cloud which they perceived to hang over\r\ntheir heads from England, with a true Presbyterian policy they put in\r\nfor a union of nations, that England might unite their Church with the\r\nKirk of Scotland, and their Presbyterian members sit in our House of\r\nCommons, and their Assembly of Scotch canting long-cloaks in our\r\nConvocation. What might have been if our fanatic Whiggish statesmen\r\ncontinued, God only knows; but we hope we are out of fear of that now.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged by some of the faction--and they began to bully us with\r\nit--that if we won't unite with them they will not settle the crown\r\nwith us again, but when Her Majesty dies, will choose a king for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIf they won't, we must make them, and it is not the first time we have\r\nlet them know that we are able. The crowns of these kingdoms have not\r\nso far disowned the right of succession but they may retrieve it\r\nagain; and if Scotland thinks to come off from a successive to an\r\nelective state of government, England has not promised not to assist\r\nthe right heir and put them into possession without any regard to\r\ntheir ridiculous settlements.\r\n\r\nThese are the gentlemen, these their ways of treating the Church, both\r\nat home and abroad. Now let us examine the reasons they pretend to\r\ngive why we should be favourable to them, why we should continue and\r\ntolerate them among us.\r\n\r\nFirst, they are very numerous, they say; they are a great part of the\r\nnation, and we cannot suppress them.\r\n\r\nTo this may be answered:--\r\n\r\n1. They are not so numerous as the Protestants in France, and yet the\r\nFrench King effectually cleared the nation of them at once, and we\r\ndon't find he misses them at home. But I am not of the opinion they\r\nare so numerous as is pretended; their party is more numerous than\r\ntheir persons, and those mistaken people of the Church who are misled\r\nand deluded by their wheedling artifices to join with them, make\r\ntheir party the greater; but these will open their eyes when the\r\nGovernment shall set heartily about the work, and come off from them,\r\nas some animals, which they say always desert a house when it is\r\nlikely to fall.\r\n\r\n2. The more numerous the more dangerous, and therefore the more need\r\nto suppress them; and God has suffered us to bear them as goads in our\r\nsides for not utterly extinguishing them long ago.\r\n\r\n3. If we are to allow them only because we cannot suppress them, then\r\nit ought to be tried whether we can or not; and I am of opinion it is\r\neasy to be done, and could prescribe ways and means, if it were\r\nproper; but I doubt not the Government will find effectual methods for\r\nthe rooting the contagion from the face of this land.\r\n\r\nAnother argument they use, which is this, that it is a time of war,\r\nand we have need to unite against the common enemy.\r\n\r\nWe answer, this common enemy had been no enemy if they had not made\r\nhim so. He was quiet, in peace, and no way disturbed or encroached\r\nupon us, and we know no reason we had to quarrel with him.\r\n\r\nBut further, we make no question but we are able to deal with this\r\ncommon enemy without their help; but why must we unite with them\r\nbecause of the enemy? Will they go over to the enemy if we do not\r\nprevent it by a union with them? We are very well contented they\r\nshould, and make no question we shall be ready to deal with them and\r\nthe common enemy too, and better without them than with them.\r\n\r\nBesides, if we have a common enemy, there is the more need to be\r\nsecure against our private enemies. If there is one common enemy, we\r\nhave the less need to have an enemy in our bowels.\r\n\r\nIt was a great argument some people used against suppressing the old\r\nmoney, that it was a time of war, and it was too great a risk for the\r\nnation to run; if we should not master it, we should be undone. And\r\nyet the sequel proved the hazard was not so great but it might be\r\nmastered, and the success was answerable. The suppressing the\r\nDissenters is not a harder work nor a work of less necessity to the\r\npublic. We can never enjoy a settled, uninterrupted union and\r\ntranquillity in this nation till the spirit of Whiggism, faction, and\r\nschism is melted down like the old money.\r\n\r\nTo talk of the difficulty is to frighten ourselves with chimeras and\r\nnotions of a powerful party, which are indeed a party without power.\r\nDifficulties often appear greater at a distance than when they are\r\nsearched into with judgment and distinguished from the vapours and\r\nshadows that attend them.\r\n\r\nWe are not to be frightened with it; this age is wiser than that by\r\nall our own experience and theirs too. King Charles the First had\r\nearly suppressed this party if he had taken more deliberate measures.\r\nIn short, it is not worth arguing to talk of their arms. Their\r\nMonmouths, and Shaftesburys, and Argyles are gone; their Dutch\r\nsanctuary is at an end; Heaven has made way for their destruction, and\r\nif we do not close with the Divine occasion we are to blame ourselves,\r\nand may remember that we had once an opportunity to serve the Church\r\nof England by extirpating her implacable enemies, and having let slip\r\nthe minute that Heaven presented, may experimentally complain, _Post\r\nest occasio calva_.\r\n\r\nHere are some popular objections in the way:--\r\n\r\nAs first, the Queen has promised them to continue them in their\r\ntolerated liberty, and has told us she will be a religious observer of\r\nher word.\r\n\r\nWhat Her Majesty will do we cannot help; but what, as head of the\r\nChurch, she ought to do, is another case. Her Majesty has promised to\r\nprotect and defend the Church of England, and if she cannot\r\neffectually do that without the destruction of the Dissenters, she\r\nmust of course dispense with one promise to comply with another. But\r\nto answer this cavil more effectually: Her Majesty did never promise\r\nto maintain the toleration to the destruction of the Church; but it is\r\nupon supposition that it may be compatible with the well-being and\r\nsafety of the Church, which she had declared she would take especial\r\ncare of. Now if these two interests clash, it is plain Her Majesty's\r\nintentions are to uphold, protect, defend, and establish the Church,\r\nand this we conceive is impossible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be said that the Church is in no immediate danger from\r\nthe Dissenters, and therefore it is time enough. But this is a weak\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nFor first, if a danger be real, the distance of it is no argument\r\nagainst, but rather a spur to quicken us to prevention, lest it be too\r\nlate hereafter.\r\n\r\nAnd secondly, here is the opportunity, and the only one perhaps that\r\never the Church had, to secure herself and destroy her enemies.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the nation have now an opportunity; the time is\r\ncome which all good men have wished for, that the gentlemen of England\r\nmay serve the Church of England. Now they are protected and encouraged\r\nby a Church of England Queen.\r\n\r\nWhat will you do for your sister in the day that she shall be spoken\r\nfor?\r\n\r\nIf ever you will establish the best Christian Church in the world; if\r\never you will suppress the spirit of enthusiasm; if ever you will free\r\nthe nation from the viperous brood that have so long sucked the blood\r\nof their mother; if ever you will leave your posterity free from\r\nfaction and rebellion, this is the time. This is the time to pull up\r\nthis heretical weed of sedition that has so long disturbed the peace\r\nof our Church and poisoned the good corn.\r\n\r\nBut, says another hot and cold objector, this is renewing fire and\r\nfaggot, reviving the act _De Heretico Comburendo_; this will be\r\ncruelty in its nature, and barbarous to all the world.\r\n\r\nI answer, it is cruelty to kill a snake or a toad in cold blood, but\r\nthe poison of their nature makes it a charity to our neighbours to\r\ndestroy those creatures, not for any personal injury received, but for\r\nprevention; not for the evil they have done, but the evil they may do.\r\n\r\nSerpents, toads, vipers, etc., are noxious to the body, and poison the\r\nsensitive life; these poison the soul, corrupt our posterity, ensnare\r\nour children, destroy the vitals of our happiness, our future\r\nfelicity, and contaminate the whole mass.\r\n\r\nShall any law be given to such wild creatures? Some beasts are for\r\nsport, and the huntsmen give them advantages of ground; but some are\r\nknocked on the head by all possible ways of violence and surprise.\r\n\r\nI do not prescribe fire and faggot, but, as Scipio said of Carthage,\r\n_Delenda est Carthago_. They are to be rooted out of this nation, if\r\never we will live in peace, serve God, or enjoy our own. As for the\r\nmanner, I leave it to those hands who have a right to execute God's\r\njustice on the nation's and the Church's enemies.\r\n\r\nBut if we must be frighted from this justice under the specious\r\npretences and odious sense of cruelty, nothing will be effected: it\r\nwill be more barbarous to our own children and dear posterity when\r\nthey shall reproach their fathers, as we do ours, and tell us, 'You\r\nhad an opportunity to root out this cursed race from the world under\r\nthe favour and protection of a true English queen; and out of your\r\nfoolish pity you spared them, because, forsooth, you would not be\r\ncruel; and now our Church is suppressed and persecuted, our religion\r\ntrampled under foot, our estates plundered, our persons imprisoned and\r\ndragged to jails, gibbets, and scaffolds: your sparing this Amalekite\r\nrace is our destruction, your mercy to them proves cruelty to your\r\npoor posterity.'\r\n\r\nHow just will such reflections be when our posterity shall fall under\r\nthe merciless clutches of this uncharitable generation, when our\r\nChurch shall be swallowed up in schism, faction, enthusiasm, and\r\nconfusion; when our Government shall be devolved upon foreigners, and\r\nour monarchy dwindled into a republic.\r\n\r\nIt would be more rational for us, if we must spare this generation, to\r\nsummon our own to a general massacre, and as we have brought them into\r\nthe world free, send them out so, and not betray them to destruction\r\nby our supine negligence, and then cry, 'It is mercy.'\r\n\r\nMoses was a merciful, meek man, and yet with what fury did he run\r\nthrough the camp, and cut the throats of three and thirty thousand of\r\nhis dear Israelites that were fallen into idolatry. What was the\r\nreason? It was mercy to the rest to make these examples, to prevent\r\nthe destruction of the whole army.\r\n\r\nHow many millions of future souls we save from infection and delusion\r\nif the present race of poisoned spirits were purged from the face of\r\nthe land!\r\n\r\nIt is vain to trifle in this matter, the light, foolish handling of\r\nthem by mulcts, fines, etc.,--it is their glory and their advantage.\r\nIf the gallows instead of the Counter, and the galleys instead of the\r\nfines, were the reward of going to a conventicle, to preach or hear,\r\nthere would not be so many sufferers. The spirit of martyrdom is over;\r\nthey that will go to church to be chosen sheriffs and mayors would go\r\nto forty churches rather than be hanged.\r\n\r\nIf one severe law were made and punctually executed, that whoever was\r\nfound at a conventicle should be banished the nation and the preacher\r\nbe hanged, we should soon see an end of the tale. They would all come\r\nto church, and one age would make us all one again.\r\n\r\nTo talk of five shillings a month for not coming to the sacrament, and\r\none shilling per week for not coming to church, this is such a way of\r\nconverting people as never was known; this is selling them a liberty\r\nto transgress for so much money. If it be not a crime, why don't we\r\ngive them full license? And if it be, no price ought to compound for\r\nthe committing it, for that is selling a liberty to people to sin\r\nagainst God and the Government.\r\n\r\nIf it be a crime of the highest consequence both against the peace and\r\nwelfare of the nation, the glory of God, the good of the Church, and\r\nthe happiness of the soul, let us rank it among capital offences, and\r\nlet it receive a punishment in proportion to it.\r\n\r\nWe hang men for trifles, and banish them for things not worth naming;\r\nbut an offence against God and the Church, against the welfare of the\r\nworld and the dignity of religion, shall be bought off for five\r\nshillings! This is such a shame to a Christian Government that it is\r\nwith regret I transmit it to posterity.\r\n\r\nIf men sin against God, affront His ordinances, rebel against His\r\nChurch, and disobey the precepts of their superiors, let them suffer\r\nas such capital crimes deserve. So will religion flourish, and this\r\ndivided nation be once again united.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the title of barbarous and cruel will soon be taken off from\r\nthis law too. I am not supposing that all the Dissenters in England\r\nshould be hanged or banished, but, as in cases of rebellions and\r\ninsurrections, if a few of the ringleaders suffer, the multitude are\r\ndismissed; so, a few obstinate people being made examples, there is no\r\ndoubt but the severity of the law would find a stop in the compliance\r\nof the multitude.\r\n\r\nTo make the reasonableness of this matter out of question, and more\r\nunanswerably plain, let us examine for what it is that this nation is\r\ndivided into parties and factions, and let us see how they can justify\r\na separation, or we of the Church of England can justify our bearing\r\nthe insults and inconveniences of the party.\r\n\r\nOne of their leading pastors, and a man of as much learning as most\r\namong them, in his answer to a pamphlet, entitled 'An Inquiry into the\r\nOccasional Conformity,' has these words, p. 27, 'Do the religion of\r\nthe Church and the meeting-houses make two religions? Wherein do they\r\ndiffer? The substance of the same religion is common to them both; and\r\nthe modes and accidents are the things in which only they differ.' P.\r\n28: 'Thirty-nine articles are given us for the summary of our\r\nreligion; thirty-six contain the substance of it, wherein we agree;\r\nthree the additional appendices, about which we have some\r\ndifferences.'\r\n\r\nNow, if, as by their own acknowledgment, the Church of England is a\r\ntrue Church, and the difference between them is only in a few modes\r\nand accidents, why should we expect that they will suffer galleys,\r\ncorporeal punishment, and banishment for these trifles? There is no\r\nquestion but they will be wiser; even their own principles will not\r\nbear them out in it; they will certainly comply with the laws and with\r\nreason; and though at the first severity they may seem hard, the next\r\nage will feel nothing of it; the contagion will be rooted out; the\r\ndisease being cured, there will be no need of the operation; but if\r\nthey should venture to transgress and fall into the pit, all the world\r\nmust condemn their obstinacy, as being without ground from their own\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nThus the pretence of cruelty will be taken off, and the party actually\r\nsuppressed, and the disquiets they have so often brought upon the\r\nnation prevented.\r\n\r\nTheir numbers and their wealth make them haughty, and that is so far\r\nfrom being an argument to persuade us to forbear them, that it is a\r\nwarning to us, without any delay, to reconcile them to the unity of\r\nthe Church or remove them from us.\r\n\r\nAt present, Heaven be praised, they are not so formidable as they have\r\nbeen, and it is our own fault if ever we suffer them to be so.\r\nProvidence and the Church of England seem to join in this particular,\r\nthat now the destroyers of the nation's peace may be overturned, and\r\nto this end the present opportunity seems to be put into our hands.\r\n\r\nTo this end her present Majesty seems reserved to enjoy the crown,\r\nthat the ecclesiastic as well as civil rights of the nation may be\r\nrestored by her hand. To this end the face of affairs have received\r\nsuch a turn in the process of a few months as never has been before;\r\nthe leading men of the nation, the universal cry of the people, the\r\nunanimous request of the clergy, agree in this, that the deliverance\r\nof our Church is at hand. For this end has Providence given us such a\r\nParliament, such a Convocation, such a gentry, and such a Queen as we\r\nnever had before. And what may be the consequences of a neglect of\r\nsuch opportunities? The succession of the crown has but a dark\r\nprospect; another Dutch turn may make the hopes of it ridiculous and\r\nthe practice impossible. Be the house of our future princes never so\r\nwell inclined, they will be foreigners, and many years will be spent\r\nin suiting the genius of strangers to this crown and the interests of\r\nthe nation; and how many ages it may be before the English throne be\r\nfilled with so much zeal and candour, so much tenderness and hearty\r\naffection to the Church as we see it now covered with, who can\r\nimagine?\r\n\r\nIt is high time, then, for the friends of the Church of England to\r\nthink of building up and establishing her in such a manner that she\r\nmay be no more invaded by foreigners nor divided by factions, schisms,\r\nand error.\r\n\r\nIf this could be done by gentle and easy methods, I should be glad;\r\nbut the wound is corroded, the vitals begin to mortify, and nothing\r\nbut amputation of members can complete the cure; all the ways of\r\ntenderness and compassion, all persuasive arguments, have been made\r\nuse of in vain.\r\n\r\nThe humour of the Dissenters has so increased among the people that\r\nthey hold the Church in defiance, and the house of God is an\r\nabomination among them; nay, they have brought up their posterity in\r\nsuch prepossessed aversions to our holy religion that the ignorant mob\r\nthink we are all idolaters and worshippers of Baal, and account it a\r\nsin to come within the walls of our churches.\r\n\r\nThe primitive Christians were not more shy of a heathen temple or of\r\nmeat offered to idols, nor the Jews of swine's flesh, than some of our\r\nDissenters are of the Church, and the divine service selemnised\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nThis obstinacy must be rooted out with the profession of it; while the\r\ngeneration are less at liberty daily to affront God Almighty and\r\ndishonour His holy worship, we are wanting in our duty to God and our\r\nmother, the Church of England.\r\n\r\nHow can we answer it to God, to the Church, and to our posterity, to\r\nleave them entangled with fanaticism, error, and obstinacy in the\r\nbowels of the nation; to leave them an enemy in their streets, that in\r\ntime may involve them in the same crimes, and endanger the utter\r\nextirpation of religion in the nation?\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference betwixt this and being subjected to the power\r\nof the Church of Rome, from whence we have reformed? If one be an\r\nextreme on one hand, and one on another, it is equally destructive to\r\nthe truth to have errors settled among us, let them be of what nature\r\nthey will.\r\n\r\nBoth are enemies of our Church and of our peace; and why should it not\r\nbe as criminal to admit an enthusiast as a Jesuit? Why should the\r\nPapist with his seven sacraments be worse than the Quaker with no\r\nsacraments at all? Why should religious houses be more intolerable\r\nthan meeting-houses? Alas, the Church of England! What with Popery on\r\none hand, and schismatics on the other, how has she been crucified\r\nbetween two thieves!\r\n\r\nNow let us crucify the thieves. Let her foundations be established\r\nupon the destruction of her enemies. The doors of mercy being always\r\nopen to the returning part of the deluded people, let the obstinate be\r\nruled with the rod of iron.\r\n\r\nLet all true sons of so holy and oppressed a mother, exasperated by\r\nher afflictions, harden their hearts against those who have oppressed\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd may God Almighty put it into the hearts of all the friends of\r\ntruth to lift up a standard against pride and Antichrist, that the\r\nposterity of the sons of error may be rooted out from the face of this\r\nland for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--THE 'DRAPIER'S LETTERS'\r\n\r\n(NOS. I AND 2)\r\n\r\nBY JONATHAN SWIFT\r\n\r\n\r\n(_The two pamphlets entitled _The Conduct of the Allies_ and _The\r\nPublic Spirit of the Whigs_--which are sometimes considered the\r\ncapital examples of the political efforts of Swift's magnificent\r\ngenius--were the very Jachin and Boaz of the Tory administration in\r\nthe last years of Anne, and the effect of them has been admitted by\r\nsuch a violent Whig and such a good critic as Jeffrey. They seemed,\r\nhowever, not wholly suitable for insertion here; first, because of\r\ntheir length (for one would have occupied nearly a third, the other\r\nnearly a fourth of this volume), and secondly, because the greater\r\npart of each does really, to some extent, underlie the charge brought\r\nagainst political pamphlets generally, and, being occupied with a\r\ngreat number of personal and particular matters, requires either much\r\nintimacy with the period or elaborate and probably tedious comparison\r\nand elucidation, to make it intelligible. No such drawback attaches\r\nto the almost more famous _Drapier's Letters_, of which I give the\r\nfirst and second. They were written at the very zenith of their\r\nauthor's marvellous powers, and at the time when his _sæva indignatio_\r\nwas heated seven times hotter than usual by the conviction that his\r\nlast hope of English promotion was gone. Their circumstances are\r\nsimple and well known. Wood had received a patent to coin copper money\r\nfor Ireland to the amount of £108,000. Most commentators seem to think\r\nthat he would have done this honestly enough; to me the simple fact\r\nthat on the revocation of his patent a pension of £3000 a year was\r\ngiven to him in compensation is proof enough of the contrary. It is\r\nimpossible to imagine any honest profit on a transaction of such a\r\nnature to such an amount which could rise to the capital value of such\r\na pension. That Swift was instigated to take up his pen against the\r\ntransaction by private griefs against the Ministry is extremely\r\nprobable; that the thing was not a job less so. As before, I must\r\nrefer to biographers for the details of the matter; the text is what\r\ninterests us here. I shall only remind the reader that Swift was\r\nfifty-seven when the 'Drapier' wrote, that _Gulliver_ appeared about\r\nthree years later, and that Swift himself expired--lunatic and\r\nmiserable beyond utterance--on the 19th October 1745, twenty-one years\r\nafter all Dublin and half England had rung with the boldness and the\r\ntriumph of the 'Drapier.'_)\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTO THE TRADESMEN, SHOP-KEEPERS, FARMERS, AND COMMON-PEOPLE IN GENERAL,\r\nOF THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND; CONCERNING THE BRASS HALF-PENCE COINED BY\r\nMR. WOOD.\r\n\r\nBrethren, Friends, Countrymen, and Fellow Subjects--What I intend now\r\nto say to you, is, next to your duty to God, and the care of your\r\nsalvation, of the greatest concern to yourselves, and your children;\r\nyour bread and clothing, and every common necessary of life entirely\r\ndepend upon it. Therefore I do most earnestly exhort you as men, as\r\nChristians, as parents, and as lovers of your country, to read this\r\npaper with the utmost attention, or get it read to you by others;\r\nwhich that you may do at the less expence, I have ordered the printer\r\nto sell it at the lowest rate.\r\n\r\nIt is a great fault among you, that when a person writes with no other\r\nintention than to do you good you will not be at the pains to read his\r\nadvices: one copy of this paper may serve a dozen of you, which will\r\nbe less than a farthing a-piece. It is your folly that you have no\r\ncommon or general interest in your view, not even the wisest among\r\nyou, neither do you know or enquire, or care who are your friends or\r\nwho are your enemies.\r\n\r\nAbout four years ago, a little book was written, to advise all people\r\nto wear the manufactures of this our own dear country: it had no other\r\ndesign, said nothing against the king or Parliament, or any man, yet\r\nthe poor printer was prosecuted two years, with the utmost violence,\r\nand even some weavers themselves, for whose sake it was written, being\r\nupon the jury, found him guilty. This would be enough to discourage\r\nany man from endeavouring to do you good, when you will either neglect\r\nhim or fly in his face for his pains, and when he must expect only\r\ndanger to himself and loss of money, perhaps to his ruin.\r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot but warn you once more of the manifest destruction\r\nbefore your eyes, if you do not behave yourselves as you ought.\r\n\r\nI will therefore first tell you the plain story of the fact; and then\r\nI will lay before you how you ought to act in common prudence, and\r\naccording to the laws of your country.\r\n\r\nThe fact is thus, It having been many years since copper half-pence or\r\nfarthings were last coined in this kingdom, they have been for some\r\ntime very scarce, and many counterfeits passed about under the name of\r\nraps. Several applications were made to England, that we might have\r\nliberty to coin new ones, as in former times we did; but they did not\r\nsucceed. At last one Mr. Wood a mean ordinary man, a hard-ware dealer,\r\nprocured a patent under his Majesty's Broad Seal to coin fourscore and\r\nten thousand pounds in copper for this kingdom, which patent however\r\ndid not oblige any one here to take them, unless they pleased. Now you\r\nmust know, that the half-pence and farthings in England pass for very\r\nlittle more than they are worth. And if you should beat them to\r\npieces, and sell them to the brazier, you would not lose above a penny\r\nin a shilling. But Mr. Wood made his half-pence of such base metal,\r\nand so much smaller than the English ones, that the brazier would not\r\ngive you above a penny of good money for a shilling of his; so that\r\nthis sum of fourscore and ten thousand pounds in good gold and silver,\r\nmust be given for trash that will not be worth above eight or nine\r\nthousand pounds real value. But this is not the worst, for Mr. Wood,\r\nwhen he pleases, may by stealth send over another and another\r\nfourscore and ten thousand pounds, and buy all our goods for eleven\r\nparts in twelve, under the value. For example, if a hatter sells a\r\ndozen of hats for five shillings a-piece, which amounts to three\r\npounds, and receives the payment in Mr. Wood's coin, he really\r\nreceives only the value of five shillings.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will wonder how such an ordinary fellow as this Mr. Wood\r\ncould have so much interest as to get his Majesty's Broad Seal for so\r\ngreat a sum of bad money to be sent to this poor country, and that\r\nall the nobility and gentry here could not obtain the same favour, and\r\nlet us make our own half-pence, as we used to do. Now I will make that\r\nmatter very plain. We are at a great distance from the king's court,\r\nand have nobody there to solicit for us, although a great number of\r\nlords and squires, whose estates are here, and are our countrymen,\r\nspend all their lives and fortunes there. But this same Mr. Wood was\r\nable to attend constantly for his own interest; he is an Englishman\r\nand had great friends, and it seems knew very well where to give money\r\nto those that would speak to others that could speak to the king and\r\ncould tell a fair story. And his majesty, and perhaps the great lord\r\nor lords who advised him, might think it was for our country's good;\r\nand so, as the lawyers express it, the king was deceived in his grant,\r\nwhich often happens in all reigns. And I am sure if his majesty knew\r\nthat such a patent, if it should take effect according to the desire\r\nof Mr. Wood, would utterly ruin this kingdom, which hath given such\r\ngreat proofs of its loyalty, he would immediately recall it, and\r\nperhaps show his displeasure to somebody or other: but a word to the\r\nwise is enough. Most of you must have heard, with what anger our\r\nhonourable House of Commons receiv'd an account of this Wood's patent.\r\nThere were several fine speeches made upon it, and plain proofs that\r\nit was all a wicked cheat from the bottom to the top, and several\r\nsmart votes were printed, which that same Wood had the assurance to\r\nanswer likewise in print, and in so confident a way, as if he were a\r\nbetter man than our whole Parliament put together.\r\n\r\nThis Wood, as soon as his patent was passed, or soon after, sends over\r\na great many barrels of those half-pence, to Cork and other seaport\r\ntowns, and to get them off, offered an hundred pounds in his coin for\r\nseventy or eighty in silver: but the collectors of the king's customs\r\nvery honestly refused to take them, and so did almost everybody else.\r\nAnd since the Parliament hath condemned them, and desired the king\r\nthat they might be stopped, all the kingdom do abominate them.\r\n\r\nBut Wood is still working under hand to force his half-pence upon us,\r\nand if he can by help of his friends in England prevail so far as to\r\nget an order that the commissioners and collectors of the king's money\r\nshall receive them, and that the army is to be paid with them, then he\r\nthinks his work shall be done. And this is the difficulty you will be\r\nunder in such a case: for the common soldier when he goes to the\r\nmarket or ale-house will offer this money, and if it be refused,\r\nperhaps he will swagger and hector, and threaten to beat the butcher\r\nor ale-wife, or take the goods by force, and throw them the bad\r\nhalf-pence. In this and the like cases the shop-keeper, or victualler,\r\nor any other tradesman, has no more to do than to demand ten times\r\nthe price of his goods if it is to be paid in Wood's money; for\r\nexample, twenty pence of that money for a quart of ale, and so in all\r\nthings else, and not part with his goods till he gets the money.\r\n\r\nFor suppose you go to an ale-house with that base money, and the\r\nlandlord gives you a quart for four of these half-pence, what must the\r\nvictualler do? His brewer will not be paid in that coin, or if the\r\nbrewer should be such a fool, the farmers will not take it from them\r\nfor their bere, because they are bound by their leases to pay their\r\nrents in good and lawful money of England, which this is not, nor of\r\nIreland neither, and the Squire their landlord will never be so\r\nbewitched to take such trash for his land; so that it must certainly\r\nstop somewhere or other, and where-ever it stops it is the same thing,\r\nand we are all undone.\r\n\r\nThe common weight of these half-pence is between four and five to an\r\nounce; suppose five, then three shillings and fourpence will weigh a\r\npound, and consequently twenty shillings will weigh six pounds butter\r\nweight. Now there are many hundred farmers who pay two hundred pound a\r\nyear rent. Therefore when one of these farmers comes with his half\r\nyear's rent, which is one hundred pound, it will be at least six\r\nhundred pound weight, which is three horses load.\r\n\r\nIf a squire has a mind to come to town to buy clothes and wine and\r\nspices for himself and family, or perhaps to pass the winter here, he\r\nmust bring with him five or six horses loaden with sacks as the\r\nfarmers bring their corn; and when his lady comes in her coach to our\r\nshops, it must be followed by a car loaded with Mr. Wood's money. And\r\nI hope we shall have the grace to take it for no more than it is\r\nworth.\r\n\r\nThey say Squire Conolly has sixteen thousand pounds a year; now if he\r\nsends for his rent to town, as it is likely he does, he must have two\r\nhundred and fifty horses to bring up his half-year's rent, and two or\r\nthree great cellars in his house for stowage. But what the bankers\r\nwill do I cannot tell. For I am assured that some great bankers keep\r\nby them forty thousand pounds in ready cash, to answer all payments,\r\nwhich sum, in Mr. Wood's money, would require twelve hundred horses to\r\ncarry it.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I am already resolved what to do; I have a pretty\r\ngood shop of Irish stuffs and silks, and instead of taking Mr. Wood's\r\nbad copper, I intend to truck with my neighbours the butchers, and\r\nbakers, and brewers, and the rest, goods for goods, and the little\r\ngold and silver I have I will keep by me like my heart's blood till\r\nbetter times, or till I am just ready to starve, and then I will buy\r\nMr. Wood's money, as my father did the brass money in K. James's time,\r\nwho could buy ten pound of it with a guinea, and I hope to get as\r\nmuch for a pistole, and so purchase bread from those who will be such\r\nfools as to sell it me.\r\n\r\nThese half-pence, if they once pass, will soon be counterfeit, because\r\nit may be cheaply done, the stuff is so base. The Dutch likewise will\r\nprobably do the same thing, and send them over to us to pay for our\r\ngoods; and Mr. Wood will never be at rest but coin on: so that in some\r\nyears we shall have at least five times fourscore and ten thousand\r\npounds of this lumber. Now the current money of this kingdom is not\r\nreckoned to be above four hundred thousand pounds in all; and while\r\nthere is a silver sixpence left, these blood-suckers will never be\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nWhen once the kingdom is reduced to such a condition I will tell you\r\nwhat must be the end: the gentlemen of estates will all turn off their\r\ntenants for want of payment, because, as I told you before, the\r\ntenants are obliged by their leases to pay sterling, which is lawful\r\ncurrent money of England; then they will turn their own farmers, as\r\ntoo many of them do already, run all into sheep where they can,\r\nkeeping only such other cattle as are necessary; then they will be\r\ntheir own merchants, and send their wool and butter and hides and\r\nlinen beyond sea for ready money and wine and spices and silks. They\r\nwill keep only a few miserable cottiers. The farmers must rob or beg,\r\nor leave their country. The shop-keepers in this and every other town\r\nmust break and starve: for it is the landed man that maintains the\r\nmerchant, and shop-keeper, and handicraftsman.\r\n\r\nBut when the squire turns farmer and merchant himself, all the good\r\nmoney he gets from abroad he will hoard up to send for England, and\r\nkeep some poor tailor or weaver and the like in his own house, who\r\nwill be glad to get bread at any rate.\r\n\r\nI should never have done, if I were to tell you all the miseries that\r\nwe shall undergo if we be so foolish and wicked as to take this cursed\r\ncoin. It would be very hard if all Ireland should be put into one\r\nscale, and this sorry fellow Wood into the other, that Mr. Wood should\r\nweigh down this whole kingdom, by which England gets above a million\r\nof good money every year clear into their pockets, and that is more\r\nthan the English do by all the world besides.\r\n\r\nBut your great comfort is, that, as his majesty's patent does not\r\noblige you to take this money, so the laws have not given the Crown a\r\npower of forcing the subjects to take what money the king pleases: for\r\nthen, by the same reason, we might be bound to take pebble-stones or\r\ncockle-shells, or stamped leather for current coin, if ever we should\r\nhappen to live under an ill prince, who might likewise by the same\r\npower make a guinea pass for ten pounds, a shilling for twenty\r\nshillings, and so on, by which he would in a short time get all the\r\nsilver and gold of the kingdom into his own hands, and leave us\r\nnothing but brass or leather or what he pleased. Neither is anything\r\nreckoned more cruel or oppressive in the French Government than their\r\ncommon practice of calling in all their money after they have sunk it\r\nvery low, and then coining it a-new at a much higher value, which\r\nhowever is not the thousandth part so wicked as this abominable\r\nproject of Mr. Wood. For the French give their subjects silver for\r\nsilver, and gold for gold; but this fellow will not so much as give us\r\ngood brass or copper for our gold and silver, nor even a twelfth part\r\nof their worth.\r\n\r\nHaving said this much, I will now go on to tell you the judgments of\r\nsome great lawyers in this matter, whom I fee'd on purpose for your\r\nsakes, and got their opinions under their hands, that I might be sure\r\nI went upon good grounds.\r\n\r\nA famous law-book call'd the _Mirrour of Justice_, discoursing of the\r\narticles (or laws) ordained by our ancient kings, declares the law to\r\nbe as follows: It was ordained that no king of this realm should\r\nchange, impair, or amend the money or make any other money than of\r\ngold or silver without the assent of all the counties, that is, as my\r\nLord Coke says, without the assent of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis book is very ancient, and of great authority for the time in\r\nwhich it was wrote, and with that character is often quoted by that\r\ngreat lawyer my Lord Coke. By the laws of England, several metals are\r\ndivided into lawful or true metal and unlawful or false metal; the\r\nformer comprehends silver or gold, the latter all baser metals: that\r\nthe former is only to pass in payments appears by an Act of Parliament\r\nmade the twentieth year of Edward the First, called the statute\r\nconcerning the passing of pence, which I give you here as I got it\r\ntranslated into English; for some of our laws at that time were, as I\r\nam told, writ in Latin: Whoever in buying or selling presumeth to\r\nrefuse an half-penny or farthing of lawful money, bearing the stamp\r\nwhich it ought to have, let him be seized on as a contemner of the\r\nking's majesty, and cast to prison.\r\n\r\nBy this statute, no person is to be reckoned a contemner of the king's\r\nmajesty, and for that crime to be committed to prison, but he who\r\nrefuses to accept the king's coin made of lawful metal, by which, as I\r\nobserv'd before, silver and gold only are intended.\r\n\r\nThat this is the true construction of the Act, appears not only from\r\nthe plain meaning of the words, but from my Lord Coke's observation\r\nupon it. By this Act (says he) it appears that no subject can be\r\nforc'd to take in buying or selling or other payments, any money made\r\nbut of lawful metal; that is, of silver or gold.\r\n\r\nThe law of England gives the king all mines of gold and silver, but\r\nnot the mines of other metals; the reason of which prerogative or\r\npower, as it is given by my Lord Coke, is, because money can be made\r\nof gold and silver, but not of other metals.\r\n\r\nPursuant to this opinion half-pence and farthings were anciently made\r\nof silver, which is more evident from the Act of Parliament of Henry\r\nthe IVth. chap. 4, by which it is enacted as follows: Item, for the\r\ngreat scarcity that is at present within the realm of England of\r\nhalf-pence and farthings of silver, it is ordained and established\r\nthat the third part of all the money of silver plate which shall be\r\nbrought to the bullion, shall be made in half-pence and farthings.\r\nThis shows that by the words half-penny and farthing of lawful money\r\nin that statute concerning the passing of pence, is meant a small coin\r\nin half-pence and farthings of silver.\r\n\r\nThis is further manifest from the statute of the ninth year of Edward\r\nthe IIId. chap. 3, which enacts, That no sterling half-penny or\r\nfarthing be molten for to make vessel, or any other thing by the\r\ngoldsmiths, nor others, upon forfeiture of the money so molten (or\r\nmelted).\r\n\r\nBy another Act in this king's reign black money was not to be current\r\nin England, and by an Act made in the eleventh year of his reign,\r\nchap. 5, galley half-pence were not to pass: what kind of coin these\r\nwere I do not know, but I presume they were made of base metal, and\r\nthat these Acts were no new laws, but further declarations of the old\r\nlaws relating to the coin.\r\n\r\nThus the law stands in relation to coin, nor is there any example to\r\nthe contrary, except one in Davis's _Reports_, who tells us, that in\r\nthe time of Tyrone's rebellion Queen Elizabeth ordered money of mixt\r\nmetal to be coined in the Tower of London, and sent over hither for\r\npayment of the army, obliging all people to receive it, and commanding\r\nthat all silver money should be taken only as bullion, that is, for as\r\nmuch as it weighed. Davis tells us several particulars in this matter\r\ntoo long here to trouble you with, and that the Privy Council of this\r\nkingdom obliged a merchant in England to receive this mixt money for\r\ngoods transmitted hither.\r\n\r\nBut this proceeding is rejected by all the best lawyers as contrary to\r\nlaw, the Privy Council here having no such power. And, besides, it is\r\nto be considered that the Queen was then under great difficulties by a\r\nrebellion in this kingdom, assisted from Spain, and whatever is done\r\nin great exigences and dangerous times should never be an example to\r\nproceed by in seasons of peace and quietness.\r\n\r\nI will now, my dear friends, to save you the trouble, set before you,\r\nin short, what the law obliges you to do, and what it does not oblige\r\nyou to.\r\n\r\nFirst, You are oblig'd to take all money in payments which is coin'd\r\nby the king and is of the English standard or weight, provided it be\r\nof gold or silver.\r\n\r\nSecondly, You are not oblig'd to take any money which is not of gold\r\nor silver, not only the half-pence or farthings of England, or of any\r\nother country; and it is only for convenience, or ease, that you are\r\ncontent to take them, because the custom of coining silver half-pence\r\nand farthings hath long been left off, I will suppose on account of\r\ntheir being subject to be lost.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Much less are we oblig'd to take those vile half-pence of\r\nthat same Wood, by which you must lose almost eleven-pence in every\r\nshilling.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my friends, stand to it one and all, refuse this filthy\r\ntrash: it is no treason to rebel against Mr. Wood; his majesty in his\r\npatent obliges nobody to take these half-pence; our gracious prince\r\nhath no so ill advisers about him; or if he had, yet you see the laws\r\nhave not left it in the king's power, to force us to take any coin but\r\nwhat is lawful, of right standard, gold and silver; therefore you have\r\nnothing to fear.\r\n\r\nAnd let me in the next place apply myself particularly to you who are\r\nthe poor sort of tradesmen: perhaps you may think you will not be so\r\ngreat losers as the rich if these half-pence should pass, because you\r\nseldom see any silver, and your customers come to your shops or stalls\r\nwith nothing but brass, which you likewise find hard to be got; but\r\nyou may take my word, whenever this money gains footing among you, you\r\nwill be utterly undone; if you carry these half-pence to a shop for\r\ntobacco or brandy, or any other thing you want, the shop-keeper will\r\nadvance his goods accordingly, or else he must break and leave the key\r\nunder the door. Do you think I will sell you a yard of tenpenny stuff\r\nfor twenty of Mr. Wood's half-pence? No, not under two hundred at\r\nleast, neither will I be at the trouble of counting, but weigh them in\r\na lump. I will tell you one thing further, that if Mr. Wood's project\r\nshould take it will ruin even our beggars: for when I give a beggar an\r\nhalf-penny, it will quench his thirst, or go a good way to fill his\r\nbelly; but the twelfth part of a half-penny will do him no more\r\nservice than if I should give him three pins out of my sleeve.\r\n\r\nIn short those half-pence are like the accursed thing, which, as the\r\nScripture tells us, the children of Israel were forbidden to touch;\r\nthey will run about like the plague and destroy every one who lays his\r\nhands upon them. I have heard scholars talk of a man who told a king\r\nthat he had invented a way to torment people by putting them into a\r\nbull of brass with fire under it, but the prince put the projector\r\nfirst into his own brazen bull to make the experiment; this very much\r\nresembles the project of Mr. Wood; and the like of this may possibly\r\nbe Mr. Wood's fate, that the brass he contrived to torment this\r\nkingdom with, may prove his own torment, and his destruction at last.\r\n\r\n_N.B._--The author of this paper is inform'd by persons who have made\r\nit their business to be exact in their observations on the true value\r\nof these half-pence, that any person may expect to get a quart of\r\ntwopenny ale for thirty-six of them.\r\n\r\nI desire all persons may keep this paper carefully by them to refresh\r\ntheir memories whenever they shall have further notice of Mr. Wood's\r\nhalf-pence or any other the like imposture.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO MR. HARDING THE PRINTER, UPON OCCASION OF A PARAGRAPH IN\r\nHIS NEWS-PAPER OF AUGUST 1, 1724, RELATING TO MR. WOOD'S HALF-PENCE.\r\n\r\nIn your news-letter of the first instant there is a paragraph dated\r\nfrom London, July 25th, relating to Wood's half-pence; whereby it is\r\nplain, what I foretold in my letter to the shop-keepers, etc., that\r\nthis vile fellow would never be at rest, and that the danger of our\r\nruin approaches nearer, and therefore the kingdom requires new and\r\nfresh warning; however I take that paragraph to be, in a great\r\nmeasure, an imposition upon the public, at least I hope so, because I\r\nam informed that Wood is generally his own news-writer. I cannot but\r\nobserve from that paragraph that this public enemy of ours, not\r\nsatisfied to ruin us with his trash, takes every occasion to treat\r\nthis kingdom with the utmost contempt. He represents several of our\r\nmerchants and traders upon examination before a committee of a\r\ncouncil, agreeing that there was the utmost necessity of copper-money\r\nhere, before his patent, so that several gentlemen have been forced to\r\ntally with their workmen, and give them bits of cards sealed and\r\nsubscribed with their names. What then? If a physician prescribe to a\r\npatient a dram of physic, shall a rascal apothecary cram him with a\r\npound, and mix it up with poison? And is not a landlord's hand and\r\nseal to his own labourers a better security for five or ten shillings,\r\nthan Wood's brass seven times below the real value, can be to the\r\nkingdom, for an hundred and four thousand pounds?\r\n\r\nBut who are these merchants and traders of Ireland that make this\r\nreport of the utmost necessity we are under of copper money? They are\r\nonly a few betrayers of their country, confederates with Wood, from\r\nwhom they are to purchase a great quantity of his coin, perhaps at\r\nhalf value, and vend it among us to the ruin of the public and their\r\nown private advantage. Are not these excellent witnesses, upon whose\r\nintegrity the fate of a kingdom must depend, who are evidences in\r\ntheir own cause, and sharers in this work of iniquity?\r\n\r\nIf we could have deserved the liberty of coining for ourselves, as we\r\nformerly did (and why we have not is everybody's wonder as well as\r\nmine), ten thousand pounds might have been coined here in Dublin of\r\nonly one fifth below the intrinsic value, and this sum, with the stock\r\nof half-pence we then had, would have been sufficient: but Wood by his\r\nemissaries, enemies to God and this kingdom, hath taken care to buy up\r\nas many of our old half-pence as he could, and from thence the present\r\nwant of change arises; to remove which, by Mr. Wood's remedy, would\r\nbe, to cure a scratch on the finger by cutting off the arm. But\r\nsupposing there were not one farthing of change in the whole nation, I\r\nwill maintain that five and twenty thousand pounds would be a sum\r\nfully sufficient to answer all our occasions. I am no inconsiderable\r\nshop-keeper in this town, I have discoursed with several of my own and\r\nother trades, with many gentlemen both of city and country, and also\r\nwith great numbers of farmers, cottagers, and labourers, who all agree\r\nthat two shillings in change for every family would be more than\r\nnecessary in all dealings. Now by the largest computation (even before\r\nthat grievous discouragement of agriculture, which hath so much\r\nlessened our numbers) the souls in this kingdom are computed to be\r\none million and a half, which, allowing but six to a family, makes two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand families, and consequently two shillings to\r\neach family will amount only to five and twenty thousand pounds,\r\nwhereas this honest liberal hard-ware-man Wood, would impose upon us\r\nabove four times that sum.\r\n\r\nYour paragraph relates further, that Sir Isaac Newton reported an\r\nassay taken at the Tower, of Wood's metal, by which it appears that\r\nWood had in all respects performed his contract. His contract! With\r\nwhom? Was it with the Parliament or people of Ireland? Are not they to\r\nbe the purchasers? But they detest, abhor, and reject it, as corrupt,\r\nfraudulent, mingled with dirt and trash. Upon which he grows angry,\r\ngoes to law, and will impose his goods upon us by force.\r\n\r\nBut your news-letter says that an assay was made of the coin. How\r\nimpudent and insupportable is this? Wood takes care to coin a dozen or\r\ntwo half-pence of good metal, sends them to the Tower and they are\r\napproved, and these must answer all that he hath already coined or\r\nshall coin for the future. It is true, indeed, that a gentleman often\r\nsends to my shop for a pattern of stuff, I cut it fairly off, and if\r\nhe likes it he comes or sends and compares the pattern with the whole\r\npiece, and probably we come to a bargain. But if I were to buy an\r\nhundred sheep, and the grazier should bring me one single weather fat\r\nand well fleeced by way of pattern, and expect the same price round\r\nfor the whole hundred, without suffering me to see them before he was\r\npaid, or giving me good security to restore my money for those that\r\nwere lean or shorn or scabby, I would be none of his customer. I have\r\nheard of a man who had a mind to sell his house, and therefore carried\r\na piece of brick in his pocket, which he showed as a pattern to\r\nencourage purchasers: and this is directly the case in point with Mr.\r\nWood's assay.\r\n\r\nThe next part of the paragraph contains Mr. Wood's voluntary proposals\r\nfor preventing any future objections or apprehensions.\r\n\r\nHis first proposal is, that whereas he hath already coined seventeen\r\nthousand pounds, and has copper prepared to make it up forty thousand\r\npounds, he will be content to coin no more, unless the exigences of\r\ntrade require it, though his patent empowers him to coin a far greater\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nTo which if I were to answer it should be thus: Let Mr. Wood and his\r\ncrew of founders and tinkers coin on till there is not an old kettle\r\nleft in the kingdom; let them coin old leather, tobacco-pipe clay, or\r\nthe dirt in the streets, and call their trumpery by what name they\r\nplease from a guinea to a farthing, we are not under any concern to\r\nknow how he and his tribe or accomplices think fit to employ\r\nthemselves. But I hope and trust that we are all to a man fully\r\ndetermined to have nothing to do with him or his ware.\r\n\r\nThe king has given him a patent to coin half-pence, but hath not\r\nobliged us to take them, and I have already shown in my Letter to the\r\nShop-keepers, etc., that the law hath not left it in the power of the\r\nprerogative to compel the subject to take any money, beside gold and\r\nsilver of the right sterling and standard.\r\n\r\nWood further proposes, (if I understand him right, for his expressions\r\nare dubious) that he will not coin above forty thousand pounds unless\r\nthe exigences of trade require it: First, I observe that this sum of\r\nforty thousand pounds is almost double to what I proved to be\r\nsufficient for the whole kingdom, although we had not one of our old\r\nhalf-pence left. Again I ask, who is to be judge when the exigences of\r\ntrade require it? Without doubt he means himself, for as to us of this\r\npoor kingdom, who must be utterly ruined if his project should\r\nsucceed, we were never once consulted till the matter was over, and he\r\nwill judge of our exigences by his own; neither will these be ever at\r\nan end till he and his accomplices will think they have enough: and it\r\nnow appears that he will not be content with all our gold and silver,\r\nbut intends to buy up our goods and manufactures with the same coin.\r\n\r\nI shall not enter into examination of the prices for which he now\r\nproposes to sell his half-pence or what he calls his copper, by the\r\npound; I have said enough of it in my former letter, and it hath\r\nlikewise been considered by others. It is certain that, by his own\r\nfirst computation, we were to pay three shillings for what was\r\nintrinsically worth but one, although it had been of the true weight\r\nand standard for which he pretended to have contracted; but there is\r\nso great a difference both in weight and badness in several of his\r\ncoins that some of them have been nine in ten below the intrinsic\r\nvalue, and most of them six or seven.\r\n\r\nHis last proposal being of a peculiar strain and nature, deserves to\r\nbe very particularly consider'd, both on account of the matter and the\r\nstyle. It is as follows.\r\n\r\nLastly, in consideration of the direful apprehensions which prevail in\r\nIreland, that Mr. Wood will by such coinage drain them of their gold\r\nand silver, he proposes to take their manufactures in exchange, and\r\nthat no person be obliged to receive more than five-pence half-penny\r\nat one payment.\r\n\r\nFirst, observe this little impudent hard-ware-man turning into\r\nridicule the direful apprehensions of a whole kingdom, priding himself\r\nas the cause of them, and daring to prescribe what no king of England\r\never attempted, how far a whole nation shall be obliged to take his\r\nbrass coin. And he has reason to insult; for sure there was never an\r\nexample in history of a great kingdom kept in awe for above a year in\r\ndaily dread of utter destruction, not by a powerful invader at the\r\nhead of twenty thousand men, not by a plague or a famine, not by a\r\ntyrannical prince (for we never had one more gracious) or a corrupt\r\nadministration, but by one single, diminutive, insignificant,\r\nmechanic.\r\n\r\nBut to go on. To remove our direful apprehensions that he will drain\r\nus of our gold and silver by his coinage, this little arbitrary\r\nmock-monarch most graciously offers to take our manufactures in\r\nexchange. Are our Irish understandings indeed so low in his opinion?\r\nIs not this the very misery we complain of? That his cursed project\r\nwill put us under the necessity of selling our goods for what is equal\r\nto nothing. How would such a proposal sound from France or Spain, or\r\nany other country we deal with, if they should offer to deal with us\r\nonly upon this condition, that we should take their money at ten times\r\nhigher than the intrinsic value? Does Mr. Wood think, for instance,\r\nthat we will sell him a stone of wool for a parcel of his counters not\r\nworth sixpence, when we can send it to England and receive as many\r\nshillings in gold and silver? Surely there was never heard such a\r\ncompound of impudence, villainy and folly.\r\n\r\nHis proposals conclude with perfect high-treason. He promises, that\r\nno person shall be obliged to receive more than five-pence half-penny\r\nof his coin in one payment: by which it is plain that he pretends to\r\noblige every subject in this kingdom to take so much in every payment,\r\nif it be offered; whereas his patent obliges no man, nor can the\r\nprerogative by law claim such a power, as I have often observed; so\r\nthat here Mr. Wood takes upon him the entire legislature, and an\r\nabsolute dominion over the properties of the whole nation.\r\n\r\nGood God! Who are this wretch's advisers? Who are his supporters,\r\nabettors, encouragers, or sharers? Mr. Wood will oblige me to take\r\nfive-pence half-penny of his brass in every payment. And I will shoot\r\nMr. Wood and his deputies through the head, like highway-men or\r\nhouse-breakers, if they dare to force one farthing of their coin upon\r\nme in the payment of an hundred pounds. It is no loss of honour to\r\nsubmit to the lion; but who, with the figure of a man can think with\r\npatience of being devoured alive by a rat? He has laid a tax upon the\r\npeople of Ireland of seventeen shillings at least in the pound; a tax,\r\nI say, not only upon lands, but interest-money, goods, manufactures,\r\nthe hire of handicraftsmen, labourers and servants. Shop-keepers, look\r\nto yourselves. Wood will oblige and force you to take five-pence\r\nhalf-penny of his trash in every payment, and many of you receive\r\ntwenty, thirty, forty, payments in one day, or else you can hardly\r\nfind bread: and pray consider how much that will amount to in a year;\r\ntwenty times five-pence half-penny is nine shillings and two-pence,\r\nwhich is above an hundred and sixty pounds a year, whereof you will be\r\nlosers of at least one hundred and forty pounds by taking your\r\npayments in his money. If any of you be content to deal with Mr. Wood\r\non such conditions they may. But for my own particular, let his money\r\nperish with him. If the famous Mr. Hampden rather chose to go to\r\nprison than pay a few shillings to King Charles I. without authority\r\nof Parliament, I will rather choose to be hanged than have all my\r\nsubstance taxed at seventeen shillings in the pound, at the arbitrary\r\nwill and pleasure of the venerable Mr. Wood.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph concludes thus. _N.B._ (that is to say _nota bene_, or\r\nmark well) No evidence appeared from Ireland or elsewhere, to prove\r\nthe mischiefs complained of, or any abuses whatsoever committed in the\r\nexecution of the said grant.\r\n\r\nThe impudence of this remark exceeds all that went before. First, the\r\nHouse of Commons in Ireland, which represents the whole people of the\r\nkingdom; and secondly the Privy Council, addressed his majesty against\r\nthese half-pence. What could be done more to express the universal\r\nsense and opinion of the nation? If his copper were diamonds, and the\r\nkingdom were entirely against it, would not that be sufficient to\r\nreject it? Must a committee of the House of Commons, and our whole\r\nPrivy Council go over to argue pro and con with Mr. Wood? To what end\r\ndid the king give his patent for coining of half-pence in Ireland? Was\r\nit not, because it was represented to his sacred majesty, that such a\r\ncoinage would be of advantage to the good of this kingdom, and of all\r\nhis subjects here? It is to the patentee's peril if his representation\r\nbe false, and the execution of his patent be fraudulent and corrupt.\r\nIs he so wicked and foolish to think that his patent was given him to\r\nruin a million and a half of people, that he might be a gainer of\r\nthree or fourscore thousand pounds to himself? Before he was at the\r\ncharge of passing a patent, much more of raking up so much filthy\r\ndross, and stamping it with his majesty's image and superscription,\r\nshould he not first in common sense, in common equity, and common\r\nmanners, have consulted the principal party concerned; that is to say,\r\nthe people of the kingdom, the House of Lords or Commons, or the Privy\r\nCouncil? If any foreigner should ask us, whose image and\r\nsuperscription there is on Wood's coin, we should be ashamed to tell\r\nhim, it was Cæsar's. In that great want of copper half-pence, which\r\nhe alleges we were, our city set up our Cæsar's statue in excellent\r\ncopper, at an expence that is equal in value to thirty thousand\r\npounds of his coin; and we will not receive his image in worse metal.\r\n\r\nI observe many of our people putting a melancholy case on this\r\nsubject. It is true say they, we are all undone if Wood's half-pence\r\nmust pass; but what shall we do, if his majesty puts out a\r\nproclamation commanding us to take them? This has been often dinned in\r\nmy ears. But I desire my countrymen to be assured that there is\r\nnothing in it. The king never issues out a proclamation but to enjoin\r\nwhat the law permits him. He will not issue out a proclamation against\r\nlaw, or if such a thing should happen by a mistake, we are no more\r\nobliged to obey it than to run our heads into the fire. Besides, his\r\nmajesty will never command us by a proclamation, what he does not\r\noffer to command us in the patent itself. There he leaves it to our\r\ndiscretion, so that our destruction must be entirely owing to\r\nourselves. Therefore let no man be afraid of a proclamation, which\r\nwill never be granted; and if it should, yet upon this occasion, will\r\nbe of no force. The king's revenues here are near four hundred\r\nthousand pounds a year, can you think his ministers will advise him to\r\ntake them in Wood's brass, which will reduce the value to fifty\r\nthousand pounds? England gets a million sterl. by this nation, which,\r\nif this project goes on, will be almost reduc'd to nothing: and do you\r\nthink those who live in England upon Irish estates will be content to\r\ntake an eighth or a tenth part, by being paid in Wood's dross?\r\n\r\nIf Wood and his confederates were not convinced of our stupidity, they\r\nnever would have attempted so audacious an enterprise. He now sees a\r\nspirit hath been raised against him, and he only watches till it\r\nbegins to flag, he goes about watching when to devour us. He hopes we\r\nshall be weary of contending with him, and at last out of ignorance,\r\nor fear, or of being perfectly tired with opposition, we shall be\r\nforced to yield. And therefore I confess it is my chief endeavour to\r\nkeep up your spirits and resentments. If I tell you there is a\r\nprecipice under you, and that if you go forwards you will certainly\r\nbreak your necks--if I point to it before your eyes, must I be at the\r\ntrouble of repeating it every morning? Are our people's hearts waxed\r\ngross? Are their ears dull of hearing, and have they closed their\r\neyes? I fear there are some few vipers among us, who, for ten or\r\ntwenty pounds' gain, would sell their souls and their country, though\r\nat last it would end in their own ruin as well as ours. Be not like\r\nthe deaf adder, who refuses to hear the voice of the charmer, charm he\r\nnever so wisely.\r\n\r\nThough my letter be directed to you, Mr. Harding, yet I intend it for\r\nall my countrymen. I have no interest in this affair but what is\r\ncommon to the public; I can live better than many others, I have some\r\ngold and silver by me, and a shop well furnished, and shall be able\r\nto make a shift when many of my betters are starving. But I am grieved\r\nto see the coldness and indifference of many people with whom I\r\ndiscourse. Some are afraid of a proclamation, others shrug up their\r\nshoulders, and cry, what would you have us to do? Some give out, there\r\nis no danger at all. Others are comforted that it will be a common\r\ncalamity and they shall fare no worse than their neighbours. Will a\r\nman, who hears midnight-robbers at his door, get out of bed, and raise\r\nhis family for a common defence, and shall a whole kingdom lie in a\r\nlethargy, while Mr. Wood comes at the head of his confederates to rob\r\nthem of all they have, to ruin us and our posterity for ever? If an\r\nhigh-way-man meets you on the road, you give him your money to save\r\nyour life; but, God be thanked, Mr. Wood cannot touch a hair of your\r\nheads. You have all the laws of God and man on your side. When he or\r\nhis accomplices offer you his dross, it is but saying No, and you are\r\nsafe. If a madman should come to my shop with a handful of dirt raked\r\nout of the kennel, and offer it in payment for ten yards of stuff, I\r\nwould pity or laugh at him, or, if his behaviour deserved it, kick him\r\nout of my doors. And if Mr. Wood comes to demand any gold or silver,\r\nor commodities for which I have paid my gold and silver, in exchange\r\nfor his trash, can he deserve or expect better treatment?\r\n\r\nWhen the evil day is come (if it must come) let us mark and observe\r\nthose who presume to offer these half-pence in payment. Let their\r\nnames and trades, and places of abode be made public, that every one\r\nmay be aware of them, as betrayers of their country, and confederates\r\nwith Mr. Wood. Let them be watched at markets and fairs, and let the\r\nfirst honest discoverer give the word about, that Wood's half-pence\r\nhave been offered, and caution the poor innocent people not to receive\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I have been too tedious; but there would never be an end, if I\r\nattempt to say all that this melancholy subject will bear. I will\r\nconclude with humbly offering one proposal, which if it were put in\r\npractice, would blow up this destructive project at once. Let some\r\nskilful judicious pen draw up an advertisement to the following\r\npurpose:\r\n\r\n_Whereas one William Wood, hard-ware-man, now or lately sojourning in\r\nthe city of London, hath, by many misrepresentations, procured a\r\npatent for coining an hundred and forty thousand pounds in copper\r\nhalf-pence for this kingdom, which is a sum five times greater than\r\nour occasions require: And whereas it is notorious that the said Wood\r\nhath coined his half-pence of such base metal and false weight, that\r\nthey are, at least, six parts in seven below the real value: And\r\nwhereas we have reason to apprehend that the said Wood may, at any\r\ntime hereafter, clandestinely coin as many more half-pence as he\r\npleases: And whereas the said patent neither doth nor can oblige his\r\nmajesty's subjects to receive the said half-pence in any payment, but\r\nleaves it to their voluntary choice, because, by law the subject\r\ncannot be obliged to take any money except gold or silver: And\r\nwhereas, contrary to the letter and meaning of the said patent, the\r\nsaid Wood hath declared that every person shall be obliged to take\r\nfive-pence half-penny of his coin in every payment: And whereas the\r\nHouse of Commons and Privy Council have severally addressed his most\r\nsacred majesty representing the ill consequences which the said\r\ncoinage may have upon this kingdom: And lastly, whereas it is\r\nuniversally agreed, that the whole nation to a man (except Mr. Wood\r\nand his confederates) are in the utmost apprehensions of the ruinous\r\nconsequences that must follow from the said coinage. Therefore we,\r\nwhose names are underwritten, being persons of considerable estates in\r\nthis kingdom, and residers therein, do unanimously resolve and declare\r\nthat we will never receive one farthing or half-penny of the said\r\nWood's coining, and that we will direct all our tenants to refuse the\r\nsaid coin from any person whatsoever; of which, that they may not be\r\nignorant, we have sent them a copy of this advertisement, to be read\r\nto them by our stewards, receivers, etc._\r\n\r\nI could wish, that a paper of this nature might be drawn up, and\r\nsigned by two or three hundred principal gentlemen of this kingdom,\r\nand printed copies thereof sent to their several tenants; I am\r\ndeceived, if anything could sooner defeat this execrable design of\r\nWood and his accomplices. This would immediately give the alarm, and\r\nset the kingdom on their guard. This would give courage to the meanest\r\ntenant and cottager. _How long, O Lord, righteous and true_, etc.\r\n\r\nI must tell you in particular, Mr. Harding, that you are much to\r\nblame. Several hundred persons have enquired at your house for my\r\nLetter to the Shop-keepers, etc., and you had none to sell them. Pray\r\nkeep yourself provided with that letter and with this; you have got\r\nvery well by the former, but I did not then write for your sake, any\r\nmore than I do now. Pray advertise both in every news-paper, and let\r\nit not be your fault or mine if our countrymen will not take warning.\r\nI desire you likewise to sell them as cheap as you can.--I am your\r\nServant, M.B.\r\n\r\n_Aug. 4, 1724._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--'SECOND LETTER ON A REGICIDE PEACE'\r\n\r\nBY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EDMUND BURKE\r\n\r\n\r\n(_I have found the selection of a suitable sample of Burke to be my\r\nmost difficult task in this volume. All his writings, as I have\r\npointed out in the general introduction, are, after a sort, pamphlets;\r\nand this of itself was an embarrassment. It was partly complicated and\r\npartly lessened by the fact that the form of his speeches naturally\r\nexcluded them. Many of his other works--notably the _Thoughts on the\r\nPresent Discontents_, the immortal _Reflections on the French\r\nRevolution_, and the _Appeal from the New Whigs to the Old_--were much\r\ntoo long for a scheme in which I have made it a rule to give in each\r\ncase entire works or divisions of works. I at last reduced the\r\nsuitable candidates to three--the _Letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe_,\r\nthat _To a Noble Lord_, and the present number of the _Letters on a\r\nRegicide Peace_. The first went as being to some extent identical in\r\nsubject with the examples of another writer, Sydney Smith, which I had\r\nalready resolved on giving; the second as being too much in the nature\r\nof a personal apologia. With the third, which I looked on at first\r\nwith least favour, I have become increasingly well satisfied. It has\r\nnot the gorgeous rhetoric of _The Letter to a Noble Lord_, the\r\n_Reflections_, and others. It has nothing so lively as the contrast\r\nbetween France and Algiers in its immediate predecessor. It may even\r\nseem, to those who have accustomed themselves to think of Burke wholly\r\nor mainly as a gorgeous rhetorician, rather tame as a whole. But if it\r\ndoes not soar, it never droops; it is admirably proportioned,\r\nadmirably written, and admirably argued throughout, and it shows great\r\nknowledge and mastery of foreign politics--the point in which English\r\nstatesmen have always been weakest. I may add that it seems to me a\r\ntriumphant refutation of the charge--constantly brought against Burke\r\nnot merely by extreme democrats, but by the usual advocate of the\r\n_juste milieu_,--that in his later years, and especially in these very\r\nLetters, he became a mere raving Gallophobe, with no sense of\r\nproportion or circumstance. For my part, I have read scores, probably\r\nhundreds, of books--English, French, and German--on the French\r\nRevolution; I have never read one that made Burke obsolete. Let it\r\nonly be added that the author, who was born in 1730, was very near the\r\nend of his career--he died next year--when he wrote these letters,\r\nand that the peace proposals which he deprecated, and which he did not\r\na little to avert, were dictated on the one side by the sobering down\r\nof the first Revolutionary fervour under the Directory; on the other\r\nby the persistent ill-success of the Allies, and the conflicts of\r\ninterest and principle which had arisen among them._)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir--I closed my first letter with serious matter, and I hope\r\nit has employed your thoughts. The system of peace must have a\r\nreference to the system of the war. On that ground, I must therefore\r\nagain recall your mind to our original opinions, which time and events\r\nhave not taught me to vary.\r\n\r\nMy ideas and my principles led me, in this contest, to encounter\r\nFrance, not as a state, but as a faction. The vast territorial extent\r\nof that country, its immense population, its riches of production, its\r\nriches of commerce and convention--the whole aggregate mass of what,\r\nin ordinary cases, constitutes the force of a state, to me were but\r\nobjects of secondary consideration. They might be balanced; and they\r\nhave been often more than balanced. Great as these things are, they\r\nare not what make the faction formidable. It is the faction that makes\r\nthem truly dreadful. That faction is the evil spirit that possesses\r\nthe body of France; that informs it as a soul; that stamps upon its\r\nambition, and upon all its pursuits, a characteristic mark, which\r\nstrongly distinguishes them from the same general passions, and the\r\nsame general views, in other men and in other communities. It is that\r\nspirit which inspires into them a new, a pernicious, a desolating\r\nactivity. Constituted as France was ten years ago, it was not in that\r\nFrance to shake, to shatter, and to overwhelm Europe in the manner\r\nthat we behold. A sure destruction impends over those infatuated\r\nprinces, who, in the conflict with this new and unheard-of power,\r\nproceed as if they were engaged in a war that bore a resemblance to\r\ntheir former contests; or that they can make peace in the spirit of\r\ntheir former arrangements of pacification. Here the beaten path is the\r\nvery reverse of the safe road.\r\n\r\nAs to me, I was always steadily of opinion, that this disorder was not\r\nin its nature intermittent. I conceived that the contest, once begun,\r\ncould not be laid down again, to be resumed at our discretion; but\r\nthat our first struggle with this evil would also be our last. I never\r\nthought we could make peace with the system; because it was not for\r\nthe sake of an object we pursued in rivalry with each other, but with\r\nthe system itself, that we were at war. As I understood the matter, we\r\nwere at war not with its conduct, but with its existence; convinced\r\nthat its existence and its hostility were the same.\r\n\r\nThe faction is not local or territorial. It is a general evil. Where\r\nit least appears in action, it is still full of life. In its sleep it\r\nrecruits its strength, and prepares its exertion. Its spirit lies deep\r\nin the corruption of our common nature. The social order which\r\nrestrains it, feeds it. It exists in every country in Europe; and\r\namong all orders of men in every country, who look up to France as to\r\na common head. The centre is there. The circumference is the world of\r\nEurope wherever the race of Europe may be settled. Everywhere else the\r\nfaction is militant; in France it is triumphant. In France it is the\r\nbank of deposit, and the bank of circulation, of all the pernicious\r\nprinciples that are forming in every state. It will be folly scarcely\r\ndeserving of pity, and too mischievous for contempt, to think of\r\nrestraining it in any other country whilst it is predominant there.\r\nWar, instead of being the cause of its force, has suspended its\r\noperation. It has given a reprieve, at least, to the Christian world.\r\n\r\nThe true nature of a Jacobin war, in the beginning, was, by most of\r\nthe Christian powers, felt, acknowledged, and even in the most precise\r\nmanner declared. In the joint manifesto, published by the emperor and\r\nthe king of Prussia, on the 4th of August, 1792, it is expressed in\r\nthe clearest terms, and on principles which could not fail, if they\r\nhad adhered to them, of classing those monarchs with the first\r\nbenefactors of mankind. This manifesto was published, as they\r\nthemselves express it, 'to lay open to the present generation, as well\r\nas to posterity, their motives, their intentions, and the\r\n_disinterestedness_ of their personal views; taking up arms for the\r\npurpose of preserving social and political order amongst all civilised\r\nnations, and to secure to _each_ state its religion, happiness,\r\nindependence, territories, and real constitution.'--'On this ground,\r\nthey hoped that all empires and all states would be unanimous; and\r\nbecoming the firm guardians of the happiness of mankind, that they\r\ncould not fail to unite their efforts to rescue a numerous nation from\r\nits own fury, to preserve Europe from the return of barbarism, and the\r\nuniverse from the subversion and anarchy with which it was\r\nthreatened.' The whole of that noble performance ought to be read at\r\nthe first meeting of any congress which may assemble for the purpose\r\nof pacification. In that piece 'these powers expressly renounce all\r\nviews of personal aggrandisement,' and confine themselves to objects\r\nworthy of so generous, so heroic, and so perfectly wise and politic an\r\nenterprise. It was to the principles of this confederation, and to no\r\nother, that we wished our sovereign and our country to accede, as a\r\npart of the commonwealth of Europe. To these principles with some\r\ntrifling exceptions and limitations they did fully accede. And all our\r\nfriends who took office acceded to the ministry (whether wisely or\r\nnot), as I always understood the matter, on the faith and on the\r\nprinciples of that declaration.\r\n\r\nAs long as these powers flattered themselves that the menace of force\r\nwould produce the effect of force, they acted on those declarations:\r\nbut when their menaces failed of success, their efforts took a new\r\ndirection. It did not appear to them that virtue and heroism ought to\r\nbe purchased by millions of rix-dollars. It is a dreadful truth, but\r\nit is a truth that cannot be concealed; in ability, in dexterity, in\r\nthe distinctness of their views, the Jacobins are our superiors. They\r\nsaw the thing right from the very beginning. Whatever were the first\r\nmotives to the war among politicians, they saw that in its spirit, and\r\nfor its objects, it was a _civil war_; and as such they pursued it. It\r\nis a war between the partisans of the ancient, civil, moral, and\r\npolitical order of Europe, against a sect of fanatical and ambitious\r\natheists which means to change them all. It is not France extending a\r\nforeign empire over other nations; it is a sect aiming at universal\r\nempire, and beginning with the conquest of France. The leaders of that\r\nsect secured the _centre of Europe_; and that secured, they knew, that\r\nwhatever might be the event of battles and sieges, their _cause_ was\r\nvictorious. Whether its territory had a little more or a little less\r\npeeled from its surface, or whether an island or two was detached from\r\nits commerce, to them was of little moment. The conquest of France\r\nwas a glorious acquisition. That once well laid as a basis of empire,\r\nopportunities never could be wanting to regain or to replace what had\r\nbeen lost, and dreadfully to avenge themselves on the faction of their\r\nadversaries.\r\n\r\nThey saw it was a _civil war_. It was their business to persuade their\r\nadversaries that it ought to be a _foreign_ war. The Jacobins\r\neverywhere set up a cry against the new crusade; and they intrigued\r\nwith effect in the cabinet, in the field, and in every private society\r\nin Europe. Their task was not difficult. The condition of princes, and\r\nsometimes of first ministers too, is to be pitied. The creatures of\r\nthe desk, and the creatures of favour, had no relish for the\r\nprinciples of the manifestoes. They promised no governments, no\r\nregiments, no revenues from whence emoluments might arise by\r\nperquisite or by grant. In truth, the tribe of vulgar politicians are\r\nthe lowest of our species. There is no trade so vile and mechanical as\r\ngovernment in their hands. Virtue is not their habit. They are out of\r\nthemselves in any course of conduct recommended only by conscience and\r\nglory. A large, liberal, and prospective view of the interests of\r\nstates passes with them for romance; and the principles that recommend\r\nit, for the wanderings of a disordered imagination. The calculators\r\ncompute them out of their senses. The jesters and buffoons shame them\r\nout of everything grand and elevated. Littleness in object and in\r\nmeans, to them appears soundness and sobriety. They think there is\r\nnothing worth pursuit but that which they can handle; which they can\r\nmeasure with a two-foot rule; which they can tell upon ten fingers.\r\n\r\nWithout the principles of the Jacobins, perhaps without any principles\r\nat all, they played the game of that faction. There was a beaten road\r\nbefore them. The powers of Europe were armed; France had always\r\nappeared dangerous; the war was easily diverted from France as a\r\nfaction, to France as a state. The princes were easily taught to slide\r\nback into their old, habitual course of politics. They were easily led\r\nto consider the flames that were consuming France, not as a warning to\r\nprotect their own buildings (which were without any party wall, and\r\nlinked by a contignation into the edifice of France,) but as a happy\r\noccasion for pillaging the goods, and for carrying off the materials,\r\nof their neighbour's house. Their provident fears were changed into\r\navaricious hopes. They carried on their new designs without seeming to\r\nabandon the principles of their old policy. They pretended to seek, or\r\nthey flattered themselves that they sought, in the accession of new\r\nfortresses, and new territories, a _defensive_ security. But the\r\nsecurity wanted was against a kind of power which was not so truly\r\ndangerous in its fortresses nor in its territories, as in its spirit\r\nand its principles. The aimed, or pretended to aim, at _defending_\r\nthemselves against a danger from which there can be no security in any\r\n_defensive_ plan. If armies and fortresses were a defence against\r\nJacobinism, Louis the Sixteenth would this day reign a powerful\r\nmonarch over a happy people.\r\n\r\nThis error obliged them, even in their offensive operations, to adopt\r\na plan of war, against the success of which there was something little\r\nshort of mathematical demonstration. They refused to take any step\r\nwhich might strike at the heart of affairs. They seemed unwilling to\r\nwound the enemy in any vital part. They acted through the whole, as if\r\nthey really wished the conservation of the Jacobin power, as what\r\nmight be more favourable than the lawful government to the attainment\r\nof the petty objects they looked for. They always kept on the\r\ncircumference; and the wider and remoter the circle was, the more\r\neagerly they chose it as their sphere of action in this centrifugal\r\nwar. The plan they pursued, in its nature demanded great length of\r\ntime. In its execution, they, who went the nearest way to work, were\r\nobliged to cover an incredible extent of country. It left to the enemy\r\nevery means of destroying this extended line of weakness. Ill success\r\nin any part was sure to defeat the effect of the whole. This is true\r\nof Austria. It is still more true of England. On this false plan, even\r\ngood fortune, by further weakening the victor, put him but the\r\nfurther off from his object.\r\n\r\nAs long as there was any appearance of success, the spirit of\r\naggrandisement, and consequently the spirit of mutual jealousy, seized\r\nupon all the coalesced powers. Some sought an accession of territory\r\nat the expense of France, some at the expense of each other, some at\r\nthe expense of third parties; and when the vicissitude of disaster\r\ntook its turn, they found common distress a treacherous bond of faith\r\nand friendship.\r\n\r\nThe greatest skill conducting the greatest military apparatus has been\r\nemployed; but it has been worse than uselessly employed, through the\r\nfalse policy of the war. The operations of the field suffered by the\r\nerrors of the cabinet. If the same spirit continues when peace is\r\nmade, the peace will fix and perpetuate all the errors of the war;\r\nbecause it will be made upon the same false principle. What has been\r\nlost in the field, in the field may be regained. An arrangement of\r\npeace in its nature is a permanent settlement; it is the effect of\r\ncounsel and deliberation, and not of fortuitous events. If built upon\r\na basis fundamentally erroneous, it can only be retrieved by some of\r\nthose unforeseen dispensations, which the all-wise but mysterious\r\nGovernor of the world sometimes interposes, to snatch nations from\r\nruin. It would not be pious error, but mad and impious presumption,\r\nfor any one to trust in an unknown order of dispensations, in defiance\r\nof the rules of prudence, which are formed upon the known march of the\r\nordinary providence of God.\r\n\r\nIt was not of that sort of war that I was amongst the least\r\nconsiderable, but amongst the most zealous advisers; and it is not by\r\nthe sort of peace now talked of, that I wish it concluded. It would\r\nanswer no great purpose to enter into the particular errors of the\r\nwar. The whole has been but one error. It was but nominally a war of\r\nalliance. As the combined powers pursued it there was nothing to hold\r\nan alliance together. There could be no tie of _honour_, in a society\r\nfor pillage. There could be no tie of a common _interest_ where the\r\nobject did not offer such a division amongst the parties as could well\r\ngive them a warm concern in the gains of each other, or could indeed\r\nform such a body of equivalents, as might make one of them willing to\r\nabandon a separate object of his ambition for the gratification of any\r\nother member of the alliance. The partition of Poland offered an\r\nobject of spoil in which the parties _might_ agree. They were\r\ncircumjacent, and each might take a portion convenient to his own\r\nterritory. They might dispute about the value of their several shares,\r\nbut the contiguity to each of the demandants always furnished the\r\nmeans of an adjustment. Though hereafter the world will have cause to\r\nrue this iniquitous measure, and they most who were the most\r\nconcerned in it, for the moment there was wherewithal in the object to\r\npreserve peace amongst confederates in wrong. But the spoil of France\r\ndid not afford the same facilities for accommodation. What might\r\nsatisfy the house of Austria in a Flemish frontier, afforded no\r\nequivalent to tempt the cupidity of the king of Prussia. What might be\r\ndesired by Great Britain in the West Indies, must be coldly and\r\nremotely, if at all, felt as an interest at Vienna; and it would be\r\nfelt as something worse than a negative interest at Madrid. Austria,\r\nlong possessed with unwise and dangerous designs on Italy, could not\r\nbe very much in earnest about the conservation of the old patrimony of\r\nthe house of Savoy; and Sardinia, who owed to an Italian force all her\r\nmeans of shutting out France from Italy, of which she has been\r\nsupposed to hold the key, would not purchase the means of strength\r\nupon one side by yielding it on the other. She would not readily give\r\nthe possession of Novara for the hope of Savoy. No continental power\r\nwas willing to lose any of its continental objects for the increase of\r\nthe naval power of Great Britain; and Great Britain would not give up\r\nany of the objects she sought for as the means of an increase to her\r\nnaval power, to further their aggrandisement.\r\n\r\nThe moment this war came to be considered as a war merely of profit,\r\nthe actual circumstances are such that it never could become really a\r\nwar of alliance. Nor can the peace be a peace of alliance, until\r\nthings are put upon their right bottom.\r\n\r\nI do not find it denied that when a treaty is entered into for peace,\r\na demand will be made on the regicides to surrender a great part of\r\ntheir conquests on the continent. Will they, in the present state of\r\nthe war, make that surrender without an equivalent? This continental\r\ncession must of course be made in favour of that party in the alliance\r\nthat has suffered losses. That party has nothing to furnish towards an\r\nequivalent. What equivalent, for instance, has Holland to offer, who\r\nhas lost her all? What equivalent can come from the Emperor, every\r\npart of whose territories contiguous to France is already within the\r\npale of the regicide dominions? What equivalent has Sardinia to offer\r\nfor Savoy and for Nice, I may say for her whole being? What has she\r\ntaken from the faction of France? she has lost very near her all; and\r\nshe has gained nothing. What equivalent has Spain to give? Alas! she\r\nhas already paid for her own ransom the fund of equivalent, and a\r\ndreadful equivalent it is, to England and to herself. But I put Spain\r\nout of the question; she is a province of the Jacobin empire, and she\r\nmust make peace or war according to the orders she receives from the\r\ndirectory of assassins. In effect and substance, her crown is a fief\r\nof regicide.\r\n\r\nWhence then can the compensation be demanded? Undoubtedly from that\r\npower which alone has made some conquests. That power is England. Will\r\nthe allies then give away their ancient patrimony, that England may\r\nkeep islands in the West Indies? They never can protract the war in\r\ngood earnest for that object; nor can they act in concert with us, in\r\nour refusal to grant anything towards their redemption. In that case\r\nwe are thus situated. Either we must give Europe, bound hand and foot,\r\nto France; or we must quit the West Indies without any one object,\r\ngreat or small, towards indemnity and security. I repeat it, without\r\nany advantage whatever: because, supposing that our conquest could\r\ncomprise all that France ever possessed in the tropical America, it\r\nnever can amount in any fair estimation to a fair equivalent for\r\nHolland, for the Austrian Netherlands, for the lower Germany, that is,\r\nfor the whole ancient kingdom or circle of Burgundy, now under the\r\nyoke of regicide, to say nothing of almost all Italy under the same\r\nbarbarous domination. If we treat in the present situation of things,\r\nwe have nothing in our hands that can redeem Europe. Nor is the\r\nEmperor, as I have observed, more rich in the fund of equivalents.\r\n\r\nIf we look to our stock in the eastern world, our most valuable and\r\nsystematic acquisitions are made in that quarter. Is it from France\r\nthey are made? France has but one or two contemptible factories,\r\nsubsisting by the offal of the private fortunes of English individuals\r\nto support them, in any part of India. I look on the taking of the\r\nCape of Good Hope as the securing of a post of great moment. It does\r\nhonour to those who planned, and to those who executed, that\r\nenterprise: but I speak of it always as comparatively good; as good as\r\nanything can be in a scheme of war that repels us from a centre, and\r\nemploys all our forces where nothing can be finally decisive. But\r\ngiving, as I freely give, every possible credit to these eastern\r\nconquests, I ask one question,--on whom are they made? It is evident,\r\nthat if we can keep our eastern conquests we keep them not at the\r\nexpense of France, but at the expense of Holland our _ally_; of\r\nHolland, the immediate cause of the war, the nation whom we had\r\nundertaken to protect, and not of the republic which it was our\r\nbusiness to destroy. If we return the African and the Asiatic\r\nconquests, we put them into the hands of a nominal state (to that\r\nHolland is reduced) unable to retain them; and which will virtually\r\nleave them under the direction of France. If we withhold them, Holland\r\ndeclines still more as a state. She loses so much carrying trade, and\r\nthat means of keeping up the small degree of naval power she holds;\r\nfor which policy alone, and not for any commercial gain, she maintains\r\nthe Cape, or any settlement beyond it. In that case, resentment,\r\nfaction, and even necessity, will throw her more and more into the\r\npower of the new, mischievous republic. But on the probable state of\r\nHolland I shall say more, when in this correspondence I come to talk\r\nover with you the state in which any sort of Jacobin peace will leave\r\nall Europe.\r\n\r\nSo far as to the East Indies.\r\n\r\nAs to the West Indies, indeed as to either, if we look for matter of\r\nexchange in order to ransom Europe, it is easy to show that we have\r\ntaken a terribly roundabout road. I cannot conceive, even if, for the\r\nsake of holding conquests there, we should refuse to redeem Holland,\r\nand the Austrian Netherlands, and the hither Germany, that Spain,\r\nmerely as she is Spain, (and forgetting that the regicide ambassador\r\ngoverns at Madrid,) will see, with perfect satisfaction, Great Britain\r\nsole mistress of the isles. In truth it appears to me, that, when we\r\ncome to balance our account, we shall find in the proposed peace only\r\nthe pure, simple, and unendowed charms of Jacobin amity. We shall have\r\nthe satisfaction of knowing, that no blood or treasure has been spared\r\nby the allies for support of the regicide system. We shall reflect at\r\nleisure on one great truth, that it was ten times more easy totally to\r\ndestroy the system itself, than, when established, it would be to\r\nreduce its power; and that this republic, most formidable abroad, was\r\nof all things the weakest at home; that her frontier was terrible, her\r\ninterior feeble; that it was matter of choice to attack her where she\r\nis invincible, and to spare her where she was ready to dissolve by her\r\nown internal disorders. We shall reflect, that our plan was good\r\nneither for offence nor defence.\r\n\r\nIt would not be at all difficult to prove, that an army of a hundred\r\nthousand men, horse, foot, and artillery, might have been employed\r\nagainst the enemy on the very soil which he has usurped, at a far less\r\nexpense than has been squandered away upon tropical adventures. In\r\nthese adventures it was not an enemy we had to vanquish, but a\r\ncemetery to conquer. In carrying on the war in the West Indies, the\r\nhostile sword is merciful; the country in which we engage is the\r\ndreadful enemy. There the European conqueror finds a cruel defeat in\r\nthe very fruits of his success. Every advantage is but a new demand on\r\nEngland for recruits to the West Indian grave. In a West India war,\r\nthe regicides have, for their troops, a race of fierce barbarians, to\r\nwhom the poisoned air, in which our youth inhale certain death, is\r\nsalubrity and life. To them the climate is the surest and most\r\nfaithful of allies.\r\n\r\nHad we carried on the war on the side of France which looks towards\r\nthe Channel or the Atlantic, we should have attacked our enemy on his\r\nweak and unarmed side. We should not have to reckon on the loss of a\r\nman who did not fall in battle. We should have an ally in the heart\r\nof the country, who, to our hundred thousand, would at one time have\r\nadded eighty thousand men at the least, and all animated by principle,\r\nby enthusiasm, and by vengeance; motives which secured them to the\r\ncause in a very different manner from some of those allies whom we\r\nsubsidised with millions. This ally, (or rather this principal in the\r\nwar,) by the confession of the regicide himself, was more formidable\r\nto him than all his other foes united. Warring there, we should have\r\nled our arms to the capital of Wrong. Defeated, we could not fail\r\n(proper precautions taken) of a sure retreat. Stationary, and only\r\nsupporting the royalists, an impenetrable barrier, an impregnable\r\nrampart, would have been formed between the enemy and his naval power.\r\nWe are probably the only nation who have declined to act against an\r\nenemy, when it might have been done in his own country; and who having\r\nan armed, a powerful, and a long-victorious ally in that country,\r\ndeclined all effectual co-operation, and suffered him to perish for\r\nwant of support. On the plan of a war in France, every advantage that\r\nour allies might obtain would be doubled in its effect. Disasters on\r\nthe one side might have a fair chance of being compensated by\r\nvictories on the other. Had we brought the main of our force to bear\r\nupon that quarter, all the operations of the British and Imperial\r\ncrowns would have been combined. The war would have had system,\r\ncorrespondence, and a certain direction. But as the war has been\r\npursued, the operations of the two crowns have not the smallest degree\r\nof mutual bearing or relation.\r\n\r\nHad acquisitions in the West Indies been our object, on success in\r\nFrance, everything reasonable in those remote parts might be demanded\r\nwith decorum, and justice, and a sure effect. Well might we call for a\r\nrecompence in America, for those services to which Europe owed its\r\nsafety. Having abandoned this obvious policy connected with principle,\r\nwe have seen the regicide power taking the reverse course, and making\r\nreal conquests in the West Indies, to which all our dear-bought\r\nadvantages (if we could hold them) are mean and contemptible. The\r\nnoblest island within the tropics, worth all that we possess put\r\ntogether, is, by the vassal Spaniard, delivered into her hands. The\r\nisland of Hispaniola (of which we have but one poor corner, by a\r\nslippery hold) is perhaps equal to England in extent, and in fertility\r\nis far superior. The part possessed by Spain, of that great island,\r\nmade for the seat and centre of a tropical empire, was not improved,\r\nto be sure, as the French division had been, before it was\r\nsystematically destroyed by the cannibal republic; but it is not only\r\nthe far larger, but the far more salubrious and more fertile part.\r\n\r\nIt was delivered into the hands of the barbarians without, as I can\r\nfind, any public reclamation on our part, not only in contravention to\r\none of the fundamental treaties that compose the public law of Europe,\r\nbut in defiance of the fundamental colonial policy of Spain herself.\r\nThis part of the treaty of Utrecht was made for great general ends\r\nunquestionably; but whilst it provided for those general ends, it was\r\nin affirmance of that particular policy. It was not to injure, but to\r\nsave Spain by making a settlement of her estate, which prohibited her\r\nto alienate to France. It is her policy not to see the balance of West\r\nIndian power overturned by France or by Great Britain. Whilst the\r\nmonarchies subsisted, this unprincipled cession was what the influence\r\nof the elder branch of the house of Bourbon never dared to attempt on\r\nthe younger: but cannibal terror has been more powerful than family\r\ninfluence. The Bourbon monarchy of Spain is united to the republic of\r\nFrance, by what may be truly called the ties of blood.\r\n\r\nBy this measure the balance of power in the West Indies is totally\r\ndestroyed. It has followed the balance of power in Europe. It is not\r\nalone what shall be left nominally to the assassins that is theirs.\r\nTheirs is the whole empire of Spain in America. That stroke finishes\r\nall. I should be glad to see our suppliant negotiator in the act of\r\nputting his feather to the ear of the directory, to make it unclinch\r\nthe fist; and, by his tickling, to charm that rich prize out of the\r\niron gripe of robbery and ambition! It does not require much sagacity\r\nto discern that no power wholly baffled and defeated in Europe can\r\nflatter itself with conquests in the West Indies. In that state of\r\nthings it can neither keep nor hold. No! It cannot even long make war\r\nif the grand bank and deposit of its force is at all in the West\r\nIndies. But here a scene opens to my view too important to pass by,\r\nperhaps too critical to touch. Is it possible that it should not\r\npresent itself in all its relations to a mind habituated to consider\r\neither war or peace on a large scale, or as one whole?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately other ideas have prevailed. A remote, an expensive, a\r\nmurderous, and, in the end, an unproductive adventure, carried on upon\r\nideas of mercantile knight-errantry, without any of the generous\r\nwildness of Quixotism, is considered as sound, solid sense; and a war\r\nin a wholesome climate, a war at our door, a war directly on the\r\nenemy, a war in the heart of his country, a war in concert with an\r\ninternal ally, and in combination with the external, is regarded as\r\nfolly and romance.\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, I hold it impossible that these considerations should\r\nhave escaped the statesmen on both sides of the water, and on both\r\nsides of the House of Commons. How a question of peace can be\r\ndiscussed without having them in view, I cannot imagine. If you or\r\nothers see a way out of these difficulties I am happy. I see, indeed,\r\na fund from whence equivalents will be proposed. I see it. But I\r\ncannot just now touch it. It is a question of high moment. It opens\r\nanother Iliad of woes to Europe.\r\n\r\nSuch is the time proposed for making a _common political peace_, to\r\nwhich no one circumstance is propitious. As to the grand principle of\r\nthe peace, it is left, as if by common consent, wholly out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nViewing things in this light, I have frequently sunk into a degree of\r\ndespondency and dejection hardly to be described; yet out of the\r\nprofoundest depths of this despair, an impulse, which I have in vain\r\nendeavoured to resist, has urged me to raise one feeble cry against\r\nthis unfortunate coalition which is formed at home, in order to make a\r\ncoalition with France, subversive of the whole ancient order of the\r\nworld. No disaster of war, no calamity of season, could ever strike me\r\nwith half the horror which I felt from what is introduced to us by\r\nthis junction of parties, under the soothing name of peace. We are apt\r\nto speak of a low and pusillanimous spirit as the ordinary cause by\r\nwhich dubious wars terminated in humiliating treaties. It is here the\r\ndirect contrary. I am perfectly astonished at the boldness of\r\ncharacter, at the intrepidity of mind, the firmness of nerve, in those\r\nwho are able with deliberation to face the perils of Jacobin\r\nfraternity.\r\n\r\nThis fraternity is indeed so terrible in its nature, and in its\r\nmanifest consequences, that there is no way of quieting our\r\napprehensions about it, but by totally putting it out of sight, by\r\nsubstituting for it, through a sort of periphrasis, something of an\r\nambiguous quality, and describing such a connexion under the terms of\r\n'_the usual relations of peace and amity_.' By this means the proposed\r\nfraternity is hustled in the crowd of those treaties, which imply no\r\nchange in the public law of Europe, and which do not upon system\r\naffect the interior condition of nations. It is confounded with those\r\nconventions in which matters of dispute among sovereign powers are\r\ncompromised, by the taking off a duty more or less, by the surrender\r\nof a frontier town, or a disputed district, on the one side or the\r\nother; by pactions in which the pretensions of families are settled,\r\n(as by a conveyancer, making family substitutions and successions,)\r\nwithout any alterations in the laws, manners, religion, privileges,\r\nand customs, of the cities, or territories, which are the subject of\r\nsuch arrangements.\r\n\r\nAll this body of old conventions, composing the vast and voluminous\r\ncollection called the _corps diplomatique_, forms the code or statute\r\nlaw, as the methodised reasonings of the great publicists and jurists\r\nfrom the digest and jurisprudence of the Christian world. In these\r\ntreasures are to be found the _usual_ relations of peace and amity in\r\ncivilised Europe; and there the relations of ancient France were to\r\nbe found amongst the rest.\r\n\r\nThe present system in France is not the ancient France. It is not the\r\nancient France with ordinary ambition and ordinary means. It is not a\r\nnew power of an old kind. It is a new power of a new species. When\r\nsuch a questionable shape is to be admitted for the first time into\r\nthe brotherhood of Christendom, it is not a mere matter of idle\r\ncuriosity to consider how far it is in its nature alliable with the\r\nrest, or whether 'the relations of peace and amity' with this new\r\nstate are likely to be of the same nature with the _usual_ relations\r\nof the states of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution in France had the relation of France to other nations\r\nas one of its principal objects. The changes made by that Revolution\r\nwere not the better to accommodate her to the old and usual relations,\r\nbut to produce new ones. The Revolution was made, not to make France\r\nfree, but to make her formidable; not to make her a neighbour, but a\r\nmistress; not to make her more observant of laws, but to put her in a\r\ncondition to impose them. To make France truly formidable it was\r\nnecessary that France should be new modelled. They, who have not\r\nfollowed the train of the late proceedings, have been led by deceitful\r\nrepresentations (which deceit made a part in the plan) to conceive\r\nthat this totally new model of a state, in which nothing escaped a\r\nchange, was made with a view to its internal relations only.\r\n\r\nIn the Revolution of France two sorts of men were principally\r\nconcerned in giving a character and determination to its pursuits: the\r\nphilosophers and the politicians. They took different ways, but they\r\nmet in the same end. The philosophers had one predominant object,\r\nwhich they pursued with a fanatical fury, that is, the utter\r\nextirpation of religion. To that every question of empire was\r\nsubordinate. They had rather domineer in a parish of atheists, than\r\nrule over a Christian world. Their temporal ambition was wholly\r\nsubservient to their proselytising spirit, in which they were not\r\nexceeded by Mahomet himself.\r\n\r\nThey, who have made but superficial studies in the natural history of\r\nthe human mind, have been taught to look on religious opinions as the\r\nonly cause of enthusiastic zeal and sectarian propagation. But there\r\nis no doctrine whatever, on which men can warm, that is not capable of\r\nthe very same effect. The social nature of man impels him to propagate\r\nhis principles, as much as physical impulses urge him to propagate his\r\nkind. The passions give zeal and vehemence. The understanding bestows\r\ndesign and system. The whole man moves under the discipline of his\r\nopinions. Religion is among the most powerful causes of enthusiasm.\r\nWhen anything concerning it becomes an object of much meditation, it\r\ncannot be indifferent to the mind. They who do not love religion,\r\nhate it. The rebels to God perfectly abhor the author of their being.\r\nThey hate Him 'with all their heart, with all their mind, with all\r\ntheir soul, and with all their strength.' He never presents Himself to\r\ntheir thoughts but to menace and alarm them. They cannot strike the\r\nsun out of heaven, but they are able to raise a smouldering smoke that\r\nobscures Him from their own eyes. Not being able to revenge themselves\r\non God, they have a delight in vicariously defacing, degrading,\r\ntorturing, and tearing in pieces, His image in man. Let no one judge\r\nof them by what he has conceived of them, when they were not\r\nincorporated, and had no lead. They were then only passengers in a\r\ncommon vehicle. They were then carried along with the general motion\r\nof religion in the community, and, without being aware of it, partook\r\nof its influence. In that situation, at worst, their nature was left\r\nfree to counterwork their principles. They despaired of giving any\r\nvery general currency to their opinions. They considered them as a\r\nreserved privilege for the chosen few. But when the possibility of\r\ndominion, lead, and propagation, presented itself, and that the\r\nambition, which before had so often made them hypocrites, might rather\r\ngain than lose by a daring avowal of their sentiments, then the nature\r\nof this infernal spirit, which has 'evil for its good,' appeared in\r\nits full perfection. Nothing indeed but the possession of some power\r\ncan with any certainty discover what at the bottom is the true\r\ncharacter of any man. Without reading the speeches of Vergniaux,\r\nFrançias of Nantz, Isnard, and some others of that sort, it would not\r\nbe easy to conceive the passion, rancour, and malice of their tongues\r\nand hearts. They worked themselves up to a perfect phrensy against\r\nreligion and all its professors. They tore the reputation of the\r\nclergy to pieces by their infuriated declamations and invectives,\r\nbefore they lacerated their bodies by their massacres. This fanatical\r\natheism left out, we omit the principal feature in the French\r\nRevolution, and a principal consideration with regard to the effects\r\nto be expected from a peace with it.\r\n\r\nThe other sort of men were the politicians. To them, who had little or\r\nnot at all reflected on the subject, religion was in itself no object\r\nof love or hatred. They disbelieved it, and that was all. Neutral with\r\nregard to that object, they took the side which in the present state\r\nof things might best answer their purposes. They soon found that they\r\ncould not do without the philosophers; and the philosophers soon made\r\nthem sensible that the destruction of religion was to supply them with\r\nmeans of conquest first at home, and then abroad. The philosophers\r\nwere the active internal agitators, and supplied the spirit and\r\nprinciples: the second gave the practical direction. Sometimes the\r\none predominated in the composition, sometimes the other. The only\r\ndifference between them was in the necessity of concealing the general\r\ndesign for a time, and in their dealing with foreign nations; the\r\nfanatics going straight forward and openly, the politicians by the\r\nsurer mode of zigzag. In the course of events this, among other\r\ncauses, produced fierce and bloody contentions between them. But at\r\nthe bottom they thoroughly agreed in all the objects of ambition and\r\nirreligion, and substantially in all the means of promoting these\r\nends. Without question, to bring about the unexampled event of the\r\nFrench Revolution, the concurrence of a very great number of views and\r\npassions was necessary. In that stupendous work, no one principle, by\r\nwhich the human mind may have its faculties at once invigorated and\r\ndepraved, was left unemployed; but I can speak it to a certainty, and\r\nsupport it by undoubted proofs, that the ruling principle of those who\r\nacted in the Revolution as _statesmen_, had the exterior\r\naggrandisement of France as their ultimate end in the most minute part\r\nof the internal changes that were made. We, who of late years have\r\nbeen drawn from an attention to foreign affairs by the importance of\r\nour domestic discussions, cannot easily form a conception of the\r\ngeneral eagerness of the active and energetic part of the French\r\nnation, itself the most active and energetic of all nations, previous\r\nto its Revolution, upon that subject. I am convinced that the foreign\r\nspeculators in France, under the old government, were twenty to one of\r\nthe same description then or now in England; and few of that\r\ndescription there were, who did not emulously set forward the\r\nRevolution. The whole official system, particularly in the diplomatic\r\npart, the regulars, the irregulars, down to the clerks in office, (a\r\ncorps, without comparison, more numerous than the same amongst us,)\r\nco-operated in it. All the intriguers in foreign politics, all the\r\nspies, all the intelligencers, actually or late in function, all the\r\ncandidates for that sort of employment, acted solely upon that\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nOn that system of aggrandisement there was but one mind: but two\r\nviolent factions arose about the means. The first wished France,\r\ndiverted from the politics of the continent, to attend solely to her\r\nmarine, to feed it by an increase of commerce, and thereby to\r\noverpower England on her own element. They contended, that if England\r\nwere disabled, the powers on the continent would fall into their\r\nproper subordination; that it was England which deranged the whole\r\ncontinental system of Europe. The others, who were by far the more\r\nnumerous, though not the most outwardly prevalent at court, considered\r\nthis plan for France as contrary to her genius, her situation, and her\r\nnatural means. They agree as to the ultimate object, the reduction of\r\nthe British power, and, if possible, its naval power; but they\r\nconsidered an ascendency on the continent as a necessary preliminary\r\nto that undertaking. They argued, that the proceedings of England\r\nherself had proved the soundness of this policy. That her greatest and\r\nablest statesmen had not considered the support of a continental\r\nbalance against France as a deviation from the principle of her naval\r\npower, but as one of the most effectual modes of carrying it into\r\neffect. That such had been her policy ever since the Revolution,\r\nduring which period the naval strength of Great Britain had gone on\r\nincreasing in the direct ratio of her interference in the politics of\r\nthe continent. With much stronger reason ought the politics of France\r\nto take the same direction; as well for pursuing objects which her\r\nsituation would dictate to her, though England had no existence, as\r\nfor counteracting the politics of that nation; to France continental\r\npolitics are primary; they looked on them only of secondary\r\nconsideration to England, and, however necessary, but as means\r\nnecessary to an end.\r\n\r\nWhat is truly astonishing, the partisans of those two opposite systems\r\nwere at once prevalent, and at once employed, and in the very same\r\ntransactions--the one ostensibly, the other secretly, during the\r\nlatter part of the reign of Louis XV. Nor was there one court in which\r\nan ambassador resided on the part of the ministers, in which another,\r\nas a spy on him, did not also reside on the part of the king. They who\r\npursued the scheme for keeping peace on the continent, and\r\nparticularly with Austria, acting officially and publicly, the other\r\nfaction counteracting and opposing them. These private agents were\r\ncontinually going from their function to the Bastile, and from the\r\nBastile to employment, and favour again. An inextricable cabal was\r\nformed, some of persons of rank, others of subordinates. But by this\r\nmeans the corps of politicians was augmented in number, and the whole\r\nformed a body of active, adventuring, ambitious, discontented people,\r\ndespising the regular ministry, despising the courts at which they\r\nwere employed, despising the court which employed them.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Louis the Sixteenth was not the first cause of the\r\nevil by which he suffered. He came to it, as to a sort of inheritance,\r\nby the false politics of his immediate predecessor. This system of\r\ndark and perplexed intrigue had come to its perfection before he came\r\nto the throne: and even then the Revolution strongly operated in all\r\nits causes.\r\n\r\nThere was no point on which the discontented diplomatic politicians so\r\nbitterly arraigned their cabinet, as for the decay of French influence\r\nin all others. From quarrelling with the court, they began to complain\r\nof monarchy itself, as a system of government too variable for any\r\nregular plan of national aggrandisement. They observed, that in that\r\nsort of regimen too much depended on the personal character of the\r\nprince; that the vicissitudes produced by the succession of princes of\r\na different character, and even the vicissitudes produced in the same\r\nman, by the different views and inclinations belonging to youth,\r\nmanhood, and age, disturbed and distracted the policy of a country\r\nmade by nature for extensive empire, or, what was still more to their\r\ntaste, for that sort of general over-ruling influence which prepared\r\nempire or supplied the place of it. They had continually in their\r\nhands the observations of _Machiavel_ on _Livy_. They had\r\n_Montesquieu's Grandeur et Décadence des Romains_ as a manual; and\r\nthey compared, with mortification, the systematic proceedings of a\r\nRoman senate with the fluctuations of a monarchy. They observed the\r\nvery small additions of territory which all the power of France,\r\nactuated by all the ambition of France, had acquired in two centuries.\r\nThe Romans had frequently acquired more in a single year. They\r\nseverely and in every part of it criticised the reign of Louis XIV.,\r\nwhose irregular and desultory ambition had more provoked than\r\nendangered Europe. Indeed, they who will be at the pains of seriously\r\nconsidering the history of that period will see that those French\r\npoliticians had some reason. They who will not take the trouble of\r\nreviewing it through all its wars and all its negotiations, will\r\nconsult the short but judicious criticism of the Marquis de\r\nMontalembert on that subject. It may be read separately from his\r\ningenious system of fortification and military defence, on the\r\npractical merit of which I am unable to form a judgment.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic politicians of whom I speak, and who formed by far the\r\nmajority in that class, made disadvantageous comparisons even between\r\ntheir more legal and formalising monarchy, and the monarchies of other\r\nstates, as a system of power and influence. They observed that France\r\nnot only lost ground herself, but, through the languor and\r\nunsteadiness of her pursuits, and from her aiming through commerce at\r\nnaval force which she never could attain without losing more on one\r\nside than she could gain on the other, that three great powers, each\r\nof them (as military states) capable of balancing her, had grown up on\r\nthe continent. Russia and Prussia had been created almost within\r\nmemory; and Austria, though not a new power, and even curtailed in\r\nterritory, was, by the very collision in which she lost that\r\nterritory, greatly improved in her military discipline and force.\r\nDuring the reign of Maria Theresa the interior economy of the country\r\nwas made more to correspond with the support of great armies than\r\nformerly it had been. As to Prussia, a merely military power, they\r\nobserved that one war had enriched her with as considerable a conquest\r\nas France had acquired in centuries. Russia had broken the Turkish\r\npower by which Austria might be, as formerly she had been, balanced in\r\nfavour of France. They felt it with pain, that the two northern powers\r\nof Sweden and Denmark were in general under the sway of Russia; or\r\nthat, at best, France kept up a very doubtful conflict, with many\r\nfluctuations of fortune, and at an enormous expense, in Sweden. In\r\nHolland, the French party seemed, if not extinguished, at least\r\nutterly obscured, and kept under by a stadtholder, leaning for support\r\nsometimes on Great Britain, sometimes on Prussia, sometimes on both,\r\nnever on France. Even the spreading of the Bourbon family had become\r\nmerely a family accommodation; and had little effect on the national\r\npolitics. This alliance, they said, extinguished Spain by destroying\r\nall its energy, without adding anything to the real power of France in\r\nthe accession of the forces of its great rival. In Italy, the same\r\nfamily accommodation, the same national insignificance, were equally\r\nvisible. What cure for the radical weakness of the French monarchy, to\r\nwhich all the means which wit could devise, or nature and fortune\r\ncould bestow, towards universal empire, was not of force to give life,\r\nor vigour, or consistency,--but in a Republic? Out the word came; and\r\nit never went back.\r\n\r\nWhether they reasoned, right or wrong, or that there was some mixture\r\nof right and wrong in their reasoning, I am sure, that in this manner\r\nthey felt and reasoned. The different effects of a great military and\r\nambitious republic, and of a monarchy of the same description, were\r\nconstantly in their mouths. The principle was ready to operate when\r\nopportunities should offer, which few of them indeed foresaw in the\r\nextent in which they were afterwards presented; but these\r\nopportunities, in some degree or other, they all ardently wished for.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Paris in 1773, the treaty of 1756 between Austria and\r\nFrance was deplored as a national calamity; because it united France\r\nin friendship with a power at whose expense alone they could hope any\r\ncontinental aggrandisement. When the first partition of Poland was\r\nmade, in which France had no share, and which had further aggrandised\r\nevery one of the three powers of which they were most jealous, I found\r\nthem in a perfect phrensy of rage and indignation: not that they were\r\nhurt at the shocking and uncoloured violence and injustice of that\r\npartition, but at the debility, improvidence, and want of activity, in\r\ntheir government, in not preventing it as a means of aggrandisement to\r\ntheir rivals, or in not contriving, by exchanges of some kind or\r\nother, to obtain their share of advantage from that robbery.\r\n\r\nIn that or nearly in that state of things and of opinions, came the\r\nAustrian match; which promised to draw the knot, as afterwards in\r\neffect it did, still more closely between the old rival houses. This\r\nadded exceedingly to their hatred and contempt of their monarchy. It\r\nwas for this reason that the late glorious queen, who on all accounts\r\nwas formed to produce general love and admiration, and whose life was\r\nas mild and beneficent as her death was beyond example great and\r\nheroic, became so very soon and so very much the object of an\r\nimplacable rancour, never to be extinguished but in her blood. When I\r\nwrote my letter in answer to M. de Menonville, in the beginning of\r\nJanuary, 1791, I had good reason for thinking that this description of\r\nrevolutionists did not so early nor so steadily point their murderous\r\ndesigns at the martyr king as at the royal heroine. It was accident,\r\nand the momentary depression of that part of the faction, that gave to\r\nthe husband the happy priority in death.\r\n\r\nFrom this their restless desire of an over-ruling influence, they bent\r\na very great part of their designs and efforts to revive the old\r\nFrench party, which was a democratic party in Holland, and to make a\r\nrevolution there. They were happy at the troubles which the singular\r\nimprudence of Joseph the Second had stirred up in the Austrian\r\nNetherlands. They rejoiced when they saw him irritate his subjects,\r\nprofess philosophy, send away the Dutch garrisons, and dismantle his\r\nfortifications. As to Holland, they never forgave either the king or\r\nthe ministry, for suffering that object, which they justly looked on\r\nas principal in their design of reducing the power of England, to\r\nescape out of their hands. This was the true secret of the commercial\r\ntreaty, made, on their part, against all the old rules and principles\r\nof commerce, with a view of diverting the English nation, by a pursuit\r\nof immediate profit, from an attention to the progress of France in\r\nits designs upon that republic. The system of the economists, which\r\nled to the general opening of commerce, facilitated that treaty, but\r\ndid not produce it. They were in despair when they found that by the\r\nvigour of Mr. Pitt, supported in this point by Mr. Fox and the\r\nopposition, the object to which they had sacrificed their manufactures\r\nwas lost to their ambition.\r\n\r\nThis eager desire of raising France from the condition into which she\r\nhad fallen, as they conceived, from her monarchical imbecility, had\r\nbeen the main-spring of their precedent interference in that unhappy\r\nAmerican quarrel, the bad effects of which to this nation have not, as\r\nyet, fully disclosed themselves. These sentiments had been long\r\nlurking in their breasts, though their views were only discovered now\r\nand then, in heat and as by escapes; but on this occasion they\r\nexploded suddenly. They were professed with ostentation and propagated\r\nwith zeal. These sentiments were not produced, as some think, by\r\ntheir American alliance. The American alliance was produced by their\r\nrepublican principles and republican policy. This new relation\r\nundoubtedly did much. The discourses and cabals that it produced, the\r\nintercourse that it established, and, above all, the example, which\r\nmade it seem practicable to establish a republic in a great extent of\r\ncountry, finished the work, and gave to that part of the revolutionary\r\nfaction a degree of strength which required other energies than the\r\nlate king possessed, to resist, or even to restrain. It spread\r\neverywhere; but it was nowhere more prevalent than in the heart of the\r\ncourt. The palace of Versailles, by its language, seemed a forum of\r\ndemocracy. To have pointed out to most of those politicians, from\r\ntheir dispositions and movements, what has since happened, the fall of\r\ntheir own monarchy, of their own laws, of their own religion, would\r\nhave been to furnish a motive the more for pushing forward a system on\r\nwhich they considered all these things as encumbrances. Such in truth\r\nthey were. And we have seen them succeed not only in the destruction\r\nof their monarchy, but in all the objects of ambition that they\r\nproposed from that destruction. When I contemplate the scheme on which\r\nFrance is formed, and when I compare it with these systems, with which\r\nit is, and ever must be, in conflict, those things which seem as\r\ndefects in her polity are the very things which make me tremble. The\r\nstates of the Christian world have grown up to their present\r\nmagnitude in a great length of time, and by a great variety of\r\naccidents. They have been improved to what we see them with greater or\r\nless degrees of felicity and skill. Not one of them has been formed\r\nupon a regular plan or with any unity of design. As their\r\nconstitutions are not systematical, they have not been directed to any\r\n_peculiar_ end, eminently distinguished, and superseding every other.\r\nThe objects which they embrace are of the greatest possible variety,\r\nand have become in a manner infinite. In all these old countries the\r\nstate has been made to the people, and not the people conformed to the\r\nstate. Every state has pursued not only every sort of social\r\nadvantage, but it has cultivated the welfare of every individual. His\r\nwants, his wishes, even his tastes, have been consulted. This\r\ncomprehensive scheme virtually produced a degree of personal liberty\r\nin forms the most adverse to it. That liberty was found, under\r\nmonarchies styled absolute, in a degree unknown to the ancient\r\ncommonwealths. From hence the powers of all our modern states meet, in\r\nall their movements, with some obstruction. It is therefore no wonder,\r\nthat, when these states are to be considered as machines to operate\r\nfor some one great end, this dissipated and balanced force is not\r\neasily concentred, or made to bear with the whole force of the nation\r\nupon one point.\r\n\r\nThe British state is, without question, that which pursues the\r\ngreatest variety of ends, and is the least disposed to sacrifice any\r\none of them to another, or to the whole. It aims at taking in the\r\nentire circle of human desires, and securing for them their fair\r\nenjoyment. Our legislature has been ever closely connected, in its\r\nmost efficient part, with individual feeling, and individual interest.\r\nPersonal liberty, the most lively of these feelings and the most\r\nimportant of these interests, which in other European countries has\r\nrather arisen from the system of manners and the habitudes of life\r\nthan from the laws of the state, (in which it flourished more from\r\nneglect than attention,) in England has been a direct object of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nOn this principle England would be the weakest power in the whole\r\nsystem. Fortunately, however, the great riches of this kingdom,\r\narising from a variety of causes, and the disposition of the people,\r\nwhich is as great to spend as to accumulate, has easily afforded a\r\ndisposable surplus that gives a mighty momentum to the state. This\r\ndifficulty, with these advantages to overcome it, has called forth the\r\ntalents of the English financiers, who, by the surplus of industry\r\npoured out by prodigality, have outdone everything which has been\r\naccomplished in other nations. The present minister has outdone his\r\npredecessors; and, as a minister of revenue, is far above my power of\r\npraise. But still there are cases in which England feels more than\r\nseveral others (though they all feel) the perplexity of an immense\r\nbody of balanced advantages, and of individual demands, and of some\r\nirregularity in the whole mass.\r\n\r\nFrance differs essentially from all those governments, which are\r\nformed without system, which exist by habit, and which are confused\r\nwith the multitude, and with the complexity of their pursuits. What\r\nnow stands as government in France is struck out at a heat. The design\r\nis wicked, immoral, impious, oppressive; but it is spirited and\r\ndaring; it is systematic; it is simple in its principle; it has unity\r\nand consistency in perfection. In that country entirely to cut off a\r\nbranch of commerce, to extinguish a manufacture, to destroy the\r\ncirculation of money, to violate credit, to suspend the course of\r\nagriculture, even to burn a city, or to lay waste a province of their\r\nown, does not cost them a moment's anxiety. To them the will, the\r\nwish, the want, the liberty, the toil, the blood of individuals, is as\r\nnothing. Individuality is left out of their scheme of government. The\r\nstate is all in all. Everything is referred to the production of\r\nforce; afterwards, everything is trusted to the use of it. It is\r\nmilitary in its principle, in its maxims, in its spirit, and in all\r\nits movements. The state has dominion and conquest for its sole\r\nobjects; dominion over minds by proselytism, over bodies by arms.\r\n\r\nThus constituted, with an immense body of natural means which are\r\nlessened in their amount only to be increased in their effect, France\r\nhas, since the accomplishment of the Revolution, a complete unity in\r\nits direction. It has destroyed every resource of the state which\r\ndepends upon opinion and the good-will of individuals. The riches of\r\nconvention disappear. The advantages of nature in some measure remain:\r\neven these, I admit, are astonishingly lessened; the command over what\r\nremains is complete and absolute. We go about asking when assignats\r\nwill expire, and we laugh at the last price of them. But what\r\nsignifies the fate of those tickets of despotism? The despotism will\r\nfind despotic means of supply. They have found the short cut to the\r\nproductions of nature, while others, in pursuit of them, are obliged\r\nto wind through the labyrinth of a very intricate state of society.\r\nThey seize upon the fruit of the labour; they seize upon the labourer\r\nhimself. Were France but half of what it is in population, in\r\ncompactness, in applicability of its force, situated as it is, and\r\nbeing what it is, it would be too strong for most of the states of\r\nEurope, constituted as they are, and proceeding as they proceed. Would\r\nit be wise to estimate what the world of Europe, as well as the world\r\nof Asia, had to dread from Genghiz Khân, upon a contemplation of the\r\nresources of the cold and barren spot in the remotest Tartary, from\r\nwhence first issued that scourge of the human race? Ought we to judge\r\nfrom the excise and stamp duties of the rocks, or from the paper\r\ncirculation of the sands of Arabia, the power by which Mahomet and his\r\ntribes laid hold at once on the two most powerful empires of the\r\nworld; beat one of them totally to the ground, broke to pieces the\r\nother, and, in not much longer space of time than I have lived,\r\noverturned governments, laws, manners, religion, and extended an\r\nempire from the Indus to the Pyrenees?\r\n\r\nMaterial resources never have supplied, nor ever can supply, the want\r\nof unity in design, and constancy in pursuit. But unity in design, and\r\nperseverance and boldness in pursuit, have never wanted resources, and\r\nnever will. We have not considered as we ought the dreadful energy of\r\na state in which the property has nothing to do with the government.\r\nReflect, my dear Sir, reflect again and again, on a government, in\r\nwhich the property is in complete subjection, and where nothing rules\r\nbut the mind of desperate men. The condition of a commonwealth not\r\ngoverned by its property was a combination of things which the learned\r\nand ingenious speculator Harrington, who has tossed about society into\r\nall forms, never could imagine to be possible. We have seen it; the\r\nworld has felt it; and if the world will shut their eyes to this state\r\nof things, they will feel it more. The rulers there have found their\r\nresources in crimes. The discovery is dreadful; the mine exhaustless.\r\nThey have everything to gain, and they have nothing to lose. They have\r\na boundless inheritance in hope; and there is no medium for them,\r\nbetwixt the highest elevation, and death with infamy. Never can they,\r\nwho; from the miserable servitude of the desk, have been raised to\r\nempire, again submit to the bondage of a starving bureau, or the\r\nprofit of copying music, or writing plaidoyers by the sheet. It has\r\nmade me often smile in bitterness, when I have heard talk of an\r\nindemnity to such men, provided they return to their allegiance.\r\n\r\nFrom all this, what is my inference? It is, that this new system of\r\nrobbery in France cannot be rendered safe by any art; that it _must_\r\nbe destroyed, or that it will destroy all Europe; that to destroy that\r\nenemy, by some means or other, the force opposed to it should be made\r\nto bear some analogy and resemblance to the force and spirit which\r\nthat system exerts; that war ought to be made against it, in its\r\nvulnerable parts. These are my inferences. In one word, with this\r\nrepublic nothing independent can co-exist The errors of Louis XVI.\r\nwere more pardonable to prudence, than any of those of the same kind\r\ninto which the allied courts may fall. They have the benefit of his\r\ndreadful example.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Louis XVI. was a man of the best intentions that probably\r\never reigned. He was by no means deficient in talents. He had a most\r\nlaudable desire to supply by general reading, and even by the\r\nacquisition of elemental knowledge, an education in all points\r\noriginally defective; but nobody told him, (and it was no wonder he\r\nshould not himself divine it,) that the world of which he read, and\r\nthe world in which he lived, were no longer the same. Desirous of\r\ndoing everything for the best, fearful of cabal, distrusting his own\r\njudgment, he sought his ministers of all kinds upon public testimony.\r\nBut as courts are the field for caballers, the public is the theatre\r\nfor mountebanks and impostors. The cure for both those evils is in the\r\ndiscernment of the prince. But an accurate and penetrating discernment\r\nis what in a young prince could not be looked for.\r\n\r\nHis conduct in its principle was not unwise; but, like most other of\r\nhis well-meant designs, it failed in his hands. It failed partly from\r\nmere ill-fortune, to which speculators are rarely pleased to assign\r\nthat very large share to which she is justly entitled in all human\r\naffairs. The failure, perhaps, in part was owing to his suffering his\r\nsystem to be vitiated and disturbed by those intrigues, which it is,\r\nhumanly speaking, impossible wholly to prevent in courts, or indeed\r\nunder any form of government. However, with these aberrations, he gave\r\nhimself over to a succession of the statesmen of public opinion. In\r\nother things he thought that he might be a king on the terms of his\r\npredecessors. He was conscious of the purity of his heart and the\r\ngeneral good tendency of his government. He flattered himself, as most\r\nmen in his situation will, that he might consult his ease without\r\ndanger to his safety. It is not at all wonderful that both he and his\r\nministers, giving way abundantly in other respects to innovation,\r\nshould take up in policy with the tradition of their monarchy. Under\r\nhis ancestors the monarchy had subsisted, and even been strengthened,\r\nby the generation or support of republics. First, the Swiss republics\r\ngrew under the guardianship of the French monarchy. The Dutch\r\nrepublics were hatched and cherished under the same incubation.\r\nAfterwards, a republican constitution was, under the influence of\r\nFrance, established in the empire against the pretensions of its\r\nchief. Even whilst the monarchy of France, by a series of wars and\r\nnegotiations, and lastly by the treaties of Westphalia, had obtained\r\nthe establishment of the Protestants in Germany as a law of the\r\nempire, the same monarchy under Louis XIII. had force enough to\r\ndestroy the republican system of the Protestants at home.\r\n\r\nLouis XVI. was a diligent reader of history. But the very lamp of\r\nprudence blinded him. The guide of human life led him astray. A silent\r\nrevolution in the moral world preceded the political, and prepared it.\r\nIt became of more importance than ever what examples were given, and\r\nwhat measures were adopted. Their causes no longer lurked in the\r\nrecesses of cabinets, or in the private conspiracies of the factious.\r\nThey were no longer to be controlled by the force and influence of the\r\ngrandees, who formerly had been able to stir up troubles by their\r\ndiscontents, and to quiet them by their corruption. The chain of\r\nsubordination, even in cabal and sedition, was broken in its most\r\nimportant links. It was no longer the great and the populace. Other\r\ninterests were formed, other dependencies, other connexions, other\r\ncommunications. The middle classes had swelled far beyond their former\r\nproportion. Like whatever is the most effectively rich and great in\r\nsociety, these classes became the seat of all the active politics; and\r\nthe preponderating weight to decide on them. There were all the\r\nenergies by which fortune is acquired; there the consequence of their\r\nsuccess. There were all the talents which assert their pretensions,\r\nand are impatient of the place which settled society prescribes to\r\nthem. These descriptions had got between the great and the populace;\r\nand the influence on the lower classes was with them. The spirit of\r\nambition had taken possession of this class as violently as ever it\r\nhad done of any other. They felt the importance of this situation. The\r\ncorrespondence of the monied and the mercantile world, the literary\r\nintercourse of academies, but, above all, the press, of which they\r\nhad in a manner entire possession, made a kind of electric\r\ncommunication everywhere. The press in reality has made every\r\ngovernment, in its spirit, almost democratic. Without it the great,\r\nthe first movements in this Revolution could not, perhaps, have been\r\ngiven. But the spirit of ambition, now for the first time connected\r\nwith the spirit of speculation, was not to be restrained at will.\r\nThere was no longer any means of arresting a principle in its course.\r\nWhen Louis XVI., under the influence of the enemies to monarchy, meant\r\nto found but one republic, he set up two. When he meant to take away\r\nhalf the crown of his neighbour, he lost the whole of his own. Louis\r\nXVI. could not with impunity countenance a new republic: yet between\r\nhis throne and that dangerous lodgment for an enemy, which he had\r\nerected, he had the whole Atlantic for a ditch. He had for an out-work\r\nthe English nation itself, friendly to liberty, adverse to that mode\r\nof it. He was surrounded by a rampart of monarchies, most of them\r\nallied to him, and generally under his influence. Yet even thus\r\nsecured, a republic erected under his auspices, and dependent on his\r\npower, became fatal to his throne. The very money which he had lent to\r\nsupport this republic, by a good faith, which to him operated as\r\nperfidy, was punctually paid to his enemies, and became a resource in\r\nthe hands of his assassins.\r\n\r\nWith this example before their eyes, do any ministers in England, do\r\nany ministers in Austria, really flatter themselves that they can\r\nerect, not on the remote shores of the Atlantic, but in their view, in\r\ntheir vicinity, in absolute contact with one of them, not a commercial\r\nbut a martial republic--a republic not of simple husbandmen or\r\nfishermen, but of intriguers, and of warriors--a republic of a\r\ncharacter the most restless, the most enterprising, the most impious,\r\nthe most fierce and bloody, the most hypocritical and perfidious, the\r\nmost bold and daring, that ever has been seen, or indeed that can be\r\nconceived to exist, without bringing on their own certain ruin?\r\n\r\nSuch is the republic to which we are going to give a place in\r\ncivilised fellowship: the republic, which, with joint consent, we are\r\ngoing to establish in the centre of Europe, in a post that overlooks\r\nand commands every other state, and which eminently confronts and\r\nmenaces this kingdom.\r\n\r\nYou cannot fail to observe that I speak as if the allied powers were\r\nactually consenting, and not compelled by events to the establishment\r\nof this faction in France. The words have not escaped me. You will\r\nhereafter naturally expect that I should make them good. But whether\r\nin adopting this measure we are madly active, or weakly passive, or\r\npusillanimously panic struck, the effects will be the same. You may\r\ncall this faction, which has eradicated the monarchy,--expelled the\r\nproprietary, persecuted religion, and trampled upon law,--you may call\r\nthis France if you please: but of the ancient France nothing remains\r\nbut its central geography; its iron frontier; its spirit of ambition;\r\nits audacity of enterprise; its perplexing intrigue. These, and these\r\nalone, remain: and they remain heightened in their principle and\r\naugmented in their means. All the former correctives, whether of\r\nvirtue or of weakness, which existed in the old monarchy, are gone. No\r\nsingle new corrective is to be found in the whole body of the new\r\ninstitutions. How should such a thing be found there, when everything\r\nhas been chosen with care and selection to forward all those ambitious\r\ndesigns and dispositions, not to control them? The whole is a body of\r\nways and means for the supply of dominion, without one heterogeneous\r\nparticle in it.\r\n\r\nHere I suffer you to breathe, and leave to your meditation what has\r\noccurred to me on the _genius and character_ of the French Revolution.\r\nFrom having this before us, we may be better able to determine on the\r\nfirst question I proposed, that is, how far nations, called foreign,\r\nare likely to be affected with the system established within that\r\nterritory. I intended to proceed next on the question of her\r\nfacilities, from _the internal state of other nations, and\r\nparticularly of this_, for obtaining her ends: but I ought to be\r\naware that my notions are controverted.--I mean, therefore, in my next\r\nletter, to take notice of what, in that way, has been recommended to\r\nme as the most deserving of notice. In the examination of those\r\npieces, I shall have occasion to discuss some others of the topics to\r\nwhich I have called your attention. You know that the letters which I\r\nnow send to the press, as well as a part of what is to follow, have\r\nbeen in their substance long since written. A circumstance which your\r\npartiality alone could make of importance to you, but which to the\r\npublic is of no importance at all, retarded their appearance. The late\r\nevents which press upon us obliged me to make some additions; but no\r\nsubstantial change in the matter.\r\n\r\nThis discussion, my friend, will be long. But the matter is serious;\r\nand if ever the fate of the world could be truly said to depend on a\r\nparticular measure, it is upon this peace. For the present, farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--'PETER PLYMLEY'S LETTERS'\r\n\r\nBY SYDNEY SMITH\r\n\r\n(LETTERS II., VI., VII., IX.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_The pamphleteering spirit is strong in almost all Sydney Smith's\r\n'Contributions to the _Edinburgh Review_,' but the form and subjects\r\nof those contributions exclude them here. Of his two great pamphlet\r\nissues proper, _Peter Plymley's Letters_ and those _To Archdeacon\r\nSingleton_, the former are, though perhaps of less polished and\r\nperfect wit than the latter, more distinctly political, and have more\r\nof that _diable au corps_ which Voltaire considered necessary to\r\nsuccess in the arts. They have also the advantage that, while the\r\n_Letters to Archdeacon Singleton_, though not an avowed recantation,\r\nare in the nature of a palinode--always an awkward thing--_Plymley_ is\r\nfrankly and confidently, not to say wantonly, aggressive. These\r\n_Letters_, ten in number, were written just after the fall of the\r\nmainly Whig Ministry of 'All the Talents,' to which Sydney had been\r\nindebted for his preferment of Foston, and which lost its position\r\nnot least owing to its intended support of the 'Catholic' claims.\r\nThose claims were not admitted for twenty years later; and Sydney's\r\nadvocacy of them was regarded as a little too exuberant by some even\r\nof his own party. But there is no doubt that the _Letters_ had a great\r\ninfluence in laughing if not in arguing sections of the public round\r\nto the Emancipation side._)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\nDear Abraham--The Catholic not respect an oath! why not? What upon\r\nearth has kept him out of Parliament, or excluded him from all the\r\noffices whence he is excluded, but his respect for oaths? There is no\r\nlaw which prohibits a Catholic to sit in Parliament. There could be no\r\nsuch law; because it is impossible to find out what passes in the\r\ninterior of any man's mind. Suppose it were in contemplation to\r\nexclude all men from certain offices who contended for the legality of\r\ntaking tithes: the only mode of discovering that fervid love of\r\ndecimation which I know you to possess would be to tender you an oath\r\n\"against that damnable doctrine, that it is lawful for a spiritual man\r\nto take, abstract, appropriate, subduct, or lead away the tenth calf,\r\nsheep, lamb, ox, pigeon, duck,\" etc., etc., etc., and every other\r\nanimal that ever existed, which of course the lawyers would take care\r\nto enumerate. Now this oath I am sure you would rather die than take;\r\nand so the Catholic is excluded from Parliament because he will not\r\nswear that he disbelieves the leading doctrines of his religion! The\r\nCatholic asks you to abolish some oaths which oppress him; your answer\r\nis that he does not respect oaths. Then why subject him to the test of\r\noaths? The oaths keep him out of Parliament; why, then, he respects\r\nthem. Turn which way you will, either your laws are nugatory, or the\r\nCatholic is bound by religious obligations as you are; but no eel in\r\nthe well-sanded fist of a cook-maid, upon the eve of being skinned,\r\never twisted and writhed as an orthodox parson does when he is\r\ncompelled by the gripe of reason to admit anything in favour of a\r\ndissenter.\r\n\r\nI will not dispute with you whether the Pope be or be not the Scarlet\r\nLady of Babylon. I hope it is not so; because I am afraid it will\r\ninduce His Majesty's Chancellor of the Exchequer to introduce several\r\nsevere bills against popery, if that is the case; and though he will\r\nhave the decency to appoint a previous committee of inquiry as to the\r\nfact, the committee will be garbled, and the report inflammatory.\r\nLeaving this to be settled as he pleases to settle it, I wish to\r\ninform you, that, previously to the bill last passed in favour of the\r\nCatholics, at the suggestion of Mr. Pitt, and for his satisfaction,\r\nthe opinions of six of the most celebrated of the foreign Catholic\r\nuniversities were taken as to the right of the Pope to interfere in\r\nthe temporal concerns of any country. The answer cannot possibly leave\r\nthe shadow of a doubt, even in the mind of Baron Maseres; and Dr.\r\nRennel would be compelled to admit it, if three Bishops lay dead at\r\nthe very moment the question were put to him. To this answer might be\r\nadded also the solemn declaration and signature of all the Catholics\r\nin Great Britain.\r\n\r\nI should perfectly agree with you, if the Catholics admitted such a\r\ndangerous dispensing power in the hands of the Pope; but they all deny\r\nit, and laugh at it, and are ready to abjure it in the most decided\r\nmanner you can devise. They obey the Pope as the spiritual head of\r\ntheir Church; but are you really so foolish as to be imposed upon by\r\nmere names? What matters it the seven-thousandth part of a farthing\r\nwho is the spiritual head of any Church? Is not Mr. Wilberforce at the\r\nhead of the Church of Clapham? Is not Dr. Letsom at the head of the\r\nQuaker Church? Is not the General Assembly at the head of the Church\r\nof Scotland? How is the government disturbed by these many-headed\r\nChurches? or in what way is the power of the Crown augmented by this\r\nalmost nominal dignity?\r\n\r\nThe King appoints a fast-day once a year, and he makes the bishops:\r\nand if the government would take half the pains to keep the Catholics\r\nout of the arms of France that it does to widen Temple Bar, or\r\nimprove Snow Hill, the King would get into his hands the appointments\r\nof the titular Bishops of Ireland. Both Mr. C----'s sisters enjoy\r\npensions more than sufficient to place the two greatest dignitaries of\r\nthe Irish Catholic Church entirely at the disposal of the Crown.\r\nEverybody who knows Ireland knows perfectly well, that nothing would\r\nbe easier, with the expenditure of a little money, than to preserve\r\nenough of the ostensible appointment in the hands of the Pope to\r\nsatisfy the scruples of the Catholics, while the real nomination\r\nremained with the Crown. But, as I have before said, the moment the\r\nvery name of Ireland is mentioned, the English seem to bid adieu to\r\ncommon feeling, common prudence, and common sense, and to act with the\r\nbarbarity of tyrants and the fatuity of idiots.\r\n\r\nWhatever your opinion may be of the follies of the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion, remember they are the follies of four millions of human\r\nbeings, increasing rapidly in numbers, wealth, and intelligence, who,\r\nif firmly united with this country, would set at defiance the power of\r\nFrance, and if once wrested from their alliance with England, would in\r\nthree years render its existence as an independent nation absolutely\r\nimpossible. You speak of danger to the Establishment: I request to\r\nknow when the Establishment was ever so much in danger as when Hoche\r\nwas in Bantry Bay, and whether all the books of Bossuet, or the arts\r\nof the Jesuits, were half so terrible? Mr. Perceval and his parsons\r\nforget all this, in their horror lest twelve or fourteen old women may\r\nbe converted to holy water and Catholic nonsense. They never see that,\r\nwhile they are saving these venerable ladies from perdition, Ireland\r\nmay be lost, England broken down, and the Protestant Church, with all\r\nits deans, prebendaries, Percevals, and Rennels, be swept into the\r\nvortex of oblivion.\r\n\r\nDo not, I beseech you, ever mention to me again the name of Dr.\r\nDuigenan. I have been in every corner of Ireland, and have studied its\r\npresent strength and condition with no common labour. Be assured\r\nIreland does not contain at this moment less than five millions of\r\npeople. There were returned in the year 1791 to the hearth tax 701,000\r\nhouses, and there is no kind of question that there were about 50,000\r\nhouses omitted in that return. Taking, however, only the number\r\nreturned for the tax, and allowing the average of six to a house (a\r\nvery small average for a potato-fed people), this brings the\r\npopulation to 4,200,000 people in the year 1791: and it can be shown\r\nfrom the clearest evidence (and Mr. Newenham in his book shows it),\r\nthat Ireland for the last fifty years has increased in its population\r\nat the rate of 50 or 60,000 per annum; which leaves the present\r\npopulation of Ireland at about five millions, after every possible\r\ndeduction for _existing circumstances, just and necessary wars,\r\nmonstrous and unnatural rebellions_, and all other sources of human\r\ndestruction. Of this population, two out of ten are Protestants; and\r\nthe half of the Protestant population are Dissenters, and as inimical\r\nto the Church as the Catholics themselves. In this state of things\r\nthumbscrews and whipping--admirable engines of policy as they must be\r\nconsidered to be--will not ultimately avail. The Catholics will hang\r\nover you; they will watch for the moment, and compel you hereafter to\r\ngive them ten times as much, against your will, as they would now be\r\ncontented with, if it were voluntarily surrendered. Remember what\r\nhappened in the American war, when Ireland compelled you to give her\r\neverything she asked, and to renounce, in the most explicit manner,\r\nyour claim of Sovereignty over her. God Almighty grant the folly of\r\nthese present men may not bring on such another crisis of public\r\naffairs!\r\n\r\nWhat are your dangers which threaten the Establishment?--Reduce this\r\ndeclamation to a point, and let us understand what you mean. The most\r\nample allowance does not calculate that there would be more than\r\ntwenty members who were Roman Catholics in one house, and ten in the\r\nother, if the Catholic emancipation were carried into effect. Do you\r\nmean that these thirty members would bring in a bill to take away the\r\ntithes from the Protestant, and to pay them to the Catholic clergy? Do\r\nyou mean that a Catholic general would march his army into the House\r\nof Commons, and purge it of Mr. Perceval and Dr. Duigenan? or, that\r\nthe theological writers would become all of a sudden more acute or\r\nmore learned, if the present civil incapacities were removed? Do you\r\nfear for your tithes, or your doctrines, or your person, or the\r\nEnglish Constitution? Every fear, taken separately, is so glaringly\r\nabsurd, that no man has the folly or the boldness to state it. Every\r\none conceals his ignorance, or his baseness, in a stupid general\r\npanic, which, when called on, he is utterly incapable of explaining.\r\nWhatever you think of the Catholics, there they are--you cannot get\r\nrid of them; your alternative is to give them a lawful place for\r\nstating their grievances, or an unlawful one: if you do not admit them\r\nto the House of Commons, they will hold their parliament in Potatoe\r\nPlace, Dublin, and be ten times as violent and inflammatory as they\r\nwould be in Westminster. Nothing would give me such an idea of\r\nsecurity as to see twenty or thirty Catholic gentlemen in Parliament,\r\nlooked upon by all the Catholics as the fair and proper organ of their\r\nparty. I should have thought it the height of good fortune that such a\r\nwish existed on their part, and the very essence of madness and\r\nignorance to reject it. Can you murder the Catholics? Can you neglect\r\nthem? They are too numerous for both these expedients. What remains to\r\nbe done is obvious to every human being--but to that man who, instead\r\nof being a Methodist preacher, is, for the curse of us and our\r\nchildren, and for the ruin of Troy and the misery of good old Priam\r\nand his sons, become a legislator and a politician.\r\n\r\nA distinction, I perceive, is taken by one of the most feeble noblemen\r\nin Great Britain, between persecution and the deprivation of political\r\npower; whereas, there is no more distinction between these two things\r\nthan there is between him who makes the distinction and a booby. If I\r\nstrip off the relic-covered jacket of a Catholic, and give him twenty\r\nstripes ... I persecute; if I say, Everybody in the town where you\r\nlive shall be a candidate for lucrative and honourable offices, but\r\nyou, who are a Catholic ... I do not persecute! What barbarous\r\nnonsense is this! as if degradation was not as great an evil as bodily\r\npain or as severe poverty: as if I could not be as great a tyrant by\r\nsaying, You shall not enjoy--as by saying, You shall suffer. The\r\nEnglish, I believe, are as truly religious as any nation in Europe: I\r\nknow no greater blessing; but it carries with it this evil in its\r\ntrain, that any villain who will bawl out, '_The Church is in\r\ndanger!_' may get a place and a good pension; and that any\r\nadministration who will do the same thing may bring a set of men into\r\npower who, at a moment of stationary and passive piety, would be\r\nhooted by the very boys in the streets. But it is not all religion; it\r\nis, in great part, the narrow and exclusive spirit which delights to\r\nkeep the common blessings of sun and air and freedom from other human\r\nbeings. 'Your religion has always been degraded; you are in the dust,\r\nand I will take care you never rise again. I should enjoy less the\r\npossession of an earthly good by every additional person to whom it\r\nwas extended.' You may not be aware of it yourself, most reverend\r\nAbraham, but you deny their freedom to the Catholics upon the same\r\nprinciple that Sarah your wife refuses to give the receipt for a ham\r\nor a gooseberry dumpling: she values her receipts, not because they\r\nsecure to her a certain flavour, but because they remind her that her\r\nneighbours want it:--a feeling laughable in a priestess, shameful in a\r\npriest; venial when it withholds the blessings of a ham, tyrannical\r\nand execrable when it narrows the boon of religious freedom.\r\n\r\nYou spend a great deal of ink about the character of the present prime\r\nminister. Grant you all that you write--I say, I fear he will ruin\r\nIreland, and pursue a line of policy destructive to the true interest\r\nof his country: and then you tell me, he is faithful to Mrs. Perceval,\r\nand kind to the Master Percevals! These are, undoubtedly, the first\r\nqualifications to be looked to in a time of the most serious public\r\ndanger; but somehow or another (if public and private virtues must\r\nalways be incompatible), I should prefer that he destroyed the\r\ndomestic happiness of Wood or Cockell, owed for the veal of the\r\npreceding year, whipped his boys, and saved his country.\r\n\r\nThe late administration did not do right; they did not build their\r\nmeasures upon the solid basis of facts. They should have caused\r\nseveral Catholics to have been dissected after death by surgeons of\r\neither religion; and the report to have been published with\r\naccompanying plates. If the viscera, and other organs of life, had\r\nbeen found to be the same as in Protestant bodies; if the provisions\r\nof nerves, arteries, cerebrum, and cerebellum, had been the same as we\r\nare provided with, or as the Dissenters are now known to possess;\r\nthen, indeed, they might have met Mr. Perceval upon a proud eminence,\r\nand convinced the country at large of the strong probability that the\r\nCatholics are really human creatures, endowed with the feelings of\r\nmen, and entitled to all their rights. But instead of this wise and\r\nprudent measure, Lord Howick, with his usual precipitation, brings\r\nforward a bill in their favour, without offering the slightest proof\r\nto the country that they were anything more than horses and oxen. The\r\nperson who shows the lama at the corner of Piccadilly has the\r\nprecaution to write up--_Allowed by Sir Joseph Banks to be a real\r\nquadruped_, so his Lordship might have said--_Allowed by the bench of\r\nBishops to be real human creatures_.... I could write you twenty\r\nletters upon this subject; but I am tired, and so I suppose are you.\r\nOur friendship is now of forty years' standing; you know me to be a\r\ntruly religious man; but I shudder to see religion treated like a\r\ncockade, or a pint of beer, and made the instrument of a party. I love\r\nthe king, but I love the people as well as the king; and if I am sorry\r\nto see his old age molested, I am much more sorry to see four millions\r\nof Catholics baffled in their just expectations. If I love Lord\r\nGrenville, and Lord Howick, it is because they love their country; if\r\nI abhor ... it is because I know there is but one man among them who\r\nis not laughing at the enormous folly and credulity of the country,\r\nand that he is an ignorant and mischievous bigot. As for the light and\r\nfrivolous jester, of whom it is your misfortune to think so highly,\r\nlearn, my dear Abraham, that this political Killigrew, just before the\r\nbreaking-up of the last administration, was in actual treaty with them\r\nfor a place; and if they had survived twenty-four hours longer, he\r\nwould have been now declaiming against the cry of No Popery! instead\r\nof inflaming it. With this practical comment on the baseness of human\r\nnature, I bid you adieu!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.\r\n\r\nDear Abraham--What amuses me the most is to hear of the _indulgences_\r\nwhich the Catholics have received, and their exorbitance in not being\r\nsatisfied with those indulgences: now if you complain to me that a\r\nman is obtrusive and shameless in his requests, and that it is\r\nimpossible to bring him to reason, I must first of all hear the whole\r\nof your conduct towards him; for you may have taken from him so much\r\nin the first instance that, in spite of a long series of restitution,\r\na vast latitude for petition may still remain behind.\r\n\r\nThere is a village, no matter where, in which the inhabitants, on one\r\nday in the year, sit down to a dinner prepared at the common expense:\r\nby an extraordinary piece of tyranny, which Lord Hawkesbury would call\r\nthe wisdom of the village ancestors, the inhabitants of three of the\r\nstreets, about a hundred years ago, seized upon the inhabitants of the\r\nfourth street, bound them hand and foot, laid them upon their backs,\r\nand compelled them to look on while the rest were stuffing themselves\r\nwith beef and beer; the next year the inhabitants of the persecuted\r\nstreet, though they contributed an equal quota of the expense, were\r\ntreated precisely in the same manner. The tyranny grew into a custom;\r\nand, as the manner of our nature is, it was considered as the most\r\nsacred of all duties to keep these poor fellows without their annual\r\ndinner. The village was so tenacious of this practice, that nothing\r\ncould induce them to resign it; every enemy to it was looked upon as a\r\ndisbeliever in Divine Providence, and any nefarious churchwarden who\r\nwished to succeed in his election had nothing to do but to represent\r\nhis antagonist as an abolitionist, in order to frustrate his ambition,\r\nendanger his life, and throw the village into a state of the most\r\ndreadful commotion. By degrees, however, the obnoxious street grew to\r\nbe so well peopled, and its inhabitants so firmly united, that their\r\noppressors, more afraid of injustice, were more disposed to be just.\r\nAt the next dinner they are unbound, the year after allowed to sit\r\nupright, then a bit of bread and a glass of water; till at last, after\r\na long series of concessions, they are emboldened to ask, in pretty\r\nplain terms, that they may be allowed to sit down at the bottom of the\r\ntable, and to fill their bellies as well as the rest. Forthwith a\r\ngeneral cry of shame and scandal: 'Ten years ago, were you not laid\r\nupon your backs? Don't you remember what a great thing you thought it\r\nto get a piece of bread? How thankful you were for cheese parings?\r\nHave you forgotten that memorable era, when the lord of the manor\r\ninterfered to obtain for you a slice of the public pudding? And now,\r\nwith an audacity only equalled by your ingratitude, you have the\r\nimpudence to ask for knives and forks, and to request, in terms too\r\nplain to be mistaken, that you may sit down to table with the rest,\r\nand be indulged even with beef and beer: there are not more than half\r\na dozen dishes which we have reserved for ourselves; the rest has been\r\nthrown open to you in the utmost profusion; you have potatoes, and\r\ncarrots, suet dumplings, sops in the pan, and delicious toast and\r\nwater in incredible quantities. Beef, mutton, lamb, pork, and veal are\r\nours; and if you were not the most restless and dissatisfied of human\r\nbeings, you would never think of aspiring to enjoy them.'\r\n\r\nIs not this, my dainty Abraham, the very nonsense and the very insult\r\nwhich is talked to and practised upon the Catholics? You are surprised\r\nthat men who have tasted of partial justice should ask for perfect\r\njustice; that he who has been robbed of coat and cloak will not be\r\ncontented with the restitution of one of his garments. He would be a\r\nvery lazy blockhead if he were content, and I (who, though an\r\ninhabitant of the village, have preserved, thank God, some sense of\r\njustice) most earnestly counsel these half-fed claimants to persevere\r\nin their just demands, till they are admitted to a more complete share\r\nof a dinner for which they pay as much as the others; and if they see\r\na little attenuated lawyer squabbling at the head of their opponents,\r\nlet them desire him to empty his pockets, and to pull out all the\r\npieces of duck, fowl, and pudding which he has filched from the public\r\nfeast, to carry home to his wife and children.\r\n\r\nYou parade a great deal upon the vast concessions made by this country\r\nto the Irish before the Union. I deny that any voluntary concession\r\nwas ever made by England to Ireland. What did Ireland ever ask that\r\nwas granted? What did she ever demand that was not refused? How did\r\nshe get her Mutiny Bill--a limited Parliament--a repeal of Poyning's\r\nLaw--a constitution? Not by the concessions of England, but by her\r\nfears. When Ireland asked for all these things upon her knees, her\r\npetitions were rejected with Percevalism and contempt; when she\r\ndemanded them with the voice of 60,000 armed men, they were granted\r\nwith every mark of consternation and dismay. Ask of Lord Auckland the\r\nfatal consequences of trifling with such a people as the Irish. He\r\nhimself was the organ of these refusals. As secretary to the Lord\r\nLieutenant, the insolence and the tyranny of this country passed\r\nthrough his hands. Ask him if he remembers the consequences. Ask him\r\nif he has forgotten that memorable evening when he came down booted\r\nand mantled to the House of Commons, when he told the House he was\r\nabout to set off for Ireland that night, and declared before God, if\r\nhe did not carry with him a compliance with all their demands, Ireland\r\nwas for ever lost to this country. The present generation have\r\nforgotten this; but I have not forgotten it; and I know, hasty and\r\nundignified as the submission of England then was, that Lord Auckland\r\nwas right, that the delay of a single day might very probably have\r\nseparated the two peoples for ever. The terms submission and fear are\r\ngalling terms when applied from the lesser nation to the greater; but\r\nit is the plain historical truth, it is the natural consequence of\r\ninjustice, it is the predicament in which every country places itself\r\nwhich leaves such a mass of hatred and discontent by its side. No\r\nempire is powerful enough to endure it; it would exhaust the strength\r\nof China, and sink it with all its mandarins and tea-kettles to the\r\nbottom of the deep. By refusing them justice now when you are strong\r\nenough to refuse them anything more than justice, you will act over\r\nagain, with the Catholics, the same scene of mean and precipitate\r\nsubmission which disgraced you before America, and before the\r\nvolunteers of Ireland. We shall live to hear the Hampstead Protestant\r\npronouncing such extravagant panegyrics upon holy water, and paying\r\nsuch fulsome compliments to the thumbs and offals of departed saints,\r\nthat parties will change sentiments, and Lord Henry Petty and Sam\r\nWhitbread take a spell at No Popery. The wisdom of Mr. Fox was alike\r\nemployed in teaching his country justice when Ireland was weak, and\r\ndignity when Ireland was strong. We are fast pacing round the same\r\nmiserable circle of ruin and imbecility. Alas! where is our guide?\r\n\r\nYou say that Ireland is a millstone about our necks; that it would be\r\nbetter for us if Ireland were sunk at the bottom of the sea; that the\r\nIrish are a nation of irreclaimable savages and barbarians. How often\r\nhave I heard these sentiments fall from the plump and thoughtless\r\nsquire, and from the thriving English shopkeeper, who has never felt\r\nthe rod of an Orange master upon his back. Ireland a millstone about\r\nyour neck! Why is it not a stone of Ajax in your hand? I agree with\r\nyou most cordially that, governed as Ireland now is, it would be a\r\nvast accession of strength if the waves of the sea were to rise and\r\nengulf her to-morrow. At this moment, opposed as we are to all the\r\nworld, the annihilation of one of the most fertile islands on the face\r\nof the globe, containing five millions of human creatures, would be\r\none of the most solid advantages which could happen to this country. I\r\ndoubt very much, in spite of all the just abuse which has been\r\nlavished upon Bonaparte, whether there is any one of his conquered\r\ncountries the blotting out of which would be as beneficial to him as\r\nthe destruction of Ireland would be to us: of countries I speak\r\ndiffering in language from the French, little habituated to their\r\nintercourse, and inflamed with all the resentments of a recently\r\nconquered people. Why will you attribute the turbulence of our people\r\nto any cause but the right--to any cause but your own scandalous\r\noppression? If you tie your horse up to a gate, and beat him cruelly,\r\nis he vicious because he kicks you? If you have plagued and worried a\r\nmastiff dog for years, is he mad because he flies at you whenever he\r\nsees you? Hatred is an active, troublesome passion. Depend upon it,\r\nwhole nations have always some reason for their hatred. Before you\r\nrefer the turbulence of the Irish to incurable defects in their\r\ncharacter, tell me if you have treated them as friends and equals?\r\nHave you protected their commerce? Have you respected their religion?\r\nHave you been as anxious for their freedom as your own? Nothing of all\r\nthis. What then? Why you have confiscated the territorial surface of\r\nthe country twice over: you have massacred and exported her\r\ninhabitants: you have deprived four-fifths of them of every civil\r\nprivilege: you have at every period made her commerce and manufactures\r\nslavishly subordinate to your own: and yet the hatred which the Irish\r\nbear to you is the result of an original turbulence of character, and\r\nof a primitive, obdurate wildness, utterly incapable of civilisation.\r\nThe embroidered inanities and the sixth-form effusions of Mr. Canning\r\nare really not powerful enough to make me believe this; nor is there\r\nany authority on earth (always excepting the Dean of Christ Church)\r\nwhich could make it credible to me. I am sick of Mr. Canning. There is\r\nnot a 'ha'porth of bread to all this sugar and sack.' I love not the\r\ncretaceous and incredible countenance of his colleague. The only\r\nopinion in which I agree with these two gentlemen is that which they\r\nentertain of each other. I am sure that the insolence of Mr. Pitt, and\r\nthe unbalanced accounts of Melville, were far better than the perils\r\nof this new ignorance:--\r\n\r\n    Nonne fuit satiùs, tristes Amaryllidis iras\r\n    Atque superba pati fastidia? nonne Menalcan?\r\n    Quamvis ille _niger_?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the most profound peace, the secret articles of the\r\nTreaty of Tilsit, in which the destruction of Ireland is resolved\r\nupon, induce you to rob the Danes of their fleet. After the expedition\r\nsailed comes the Treaty of Tilsit, containing no article, public or\r\nprivate, alluding to Ireland. The state of the world, you tell me,\r\njustified us in doing this. Just God! do we think only of the state of\r\nthe world when there is an opportunity for robbery, for murder, and\r\nfor plunder; and do we forget the state of the world when we are\r\ncalled upon to be wise, and good, and just? Does the state of the\r\nworld never remind us that we have four millions of subjects whose\r\ninjuries we ought to atone for, and whose affections we ought to\r\nconciliate? Does the state of the world never warn us to lay aside our\r\ninfernal bigotry, and to arm every man who acknowledges a God, and can\r\ngrasp a sword? Did it never occur to this administration that they\r\nmight virtuously get hold of a force ten times greater than the force\r\nof the Danish fleet? Was there no other way of protecting Ireland but\r\nby bringing eternal shame upon Great Britain, and by making the earth\r\na den of robbers? See what the men whom you have supplanted would have\r\ndone. They would have rendered the invasion of Ireland impossible, by\r\nrestoring to the Catholics their long-lost rights: they would have\r\nacted in such a manner that the French would neither have wished for\r\ninvasion nor dared to attempt it: they would have increased the\r\npermanent strength of the country while they preserved its reputation\r\nunsullied. Nothing of this kind your friends have done, because they\r\nare solemnly pledged to do nothing of this kind; because, to tolerate\r\nall religions, and to equalise civil rights to all sects, is to oppose\r\nsome of the worst passions of our nature--to plunder and to oppress is\r\nto gratify them all. They wanted the huzzas of mobs, and they have for\r\never blasted the fame of England to obtain them. Were the fleets of\r\nHolland, France, and Spain destroyed by larceny? You resisted the\r\npower of 150 sail of the line by sheer courage, and violated every\r\nprinciple of morals from the dread of fifteen hulks, while the\r\nexpedition itself cost you three times more than the value of the\r\nlarcenous matter brought away. The French trample on the laws of God\r\nand man, not for old cordage, but for kingdoms, and always take care\r\nto be well paid for their crimes. We contrive, under the present\r\nadministration, to unite moral with intellectual deficiency, and to\r\ngrow weaker and worse by the same action. If they had any evidence of\r\nthe intended hostility of the Danes, why was it not produced? Why have\r\nthe nations of Europe been allowed to feel an indignation against this\r\ncountry beyond the reach of all subsequent information? Are these\r\ntimes, do you imagine, when we can trifle with a year of universal\r\nhatred, dally with the curses of Europe, and then regain a lost\r\ncharacter at pleasure, by the parliamentary perspirations of the\r\nForeign Secretary, or the solemn asseverations of the pecuniary Rose?\r\nBelieve me, Abraham, it is not under such ministers as these that the\r\ndexterity of honest Englishmen will ever equal the dexterity of French\r\nknaves; it is not in their presence that the serpent of Moses will\r\never swallow up the serpents of the magician.\r\n\r\nLord Hawkesbury says that nothing is to be granted to the Catholics\r\nfrom fear. What! not even justice? Why not? There are four millions of\r\ndisaffected people within twenty miles of your own coast. I fairly\r\nconfess that the dread which I have of their physical power is with me\r\na very strong motive for listening to their claims. To talk of not\r\nacting from fear is mere parliamentary cant. From what motive but\r\nfear, I should be glad to know, have all the improvements in our\r\nconstitution proceeded? I question if any justice has ever been done\r\nto large masses of mankind from any other motive. By what other\r\nmotives can the plunderers of the Baltic suppose nations to be\r\ngoverned in their intercourse _with each other_? If I say, Give this\r\npeople what they ask because it is just, do you think I should get ten\r\npeople to listen to me? Would not the lesser of the two Jenkinsons be\r\nthe first to treat me with contempt? The only true way to make the\r\nmass of mankind see the beauty of justice is by showing to them, in\r\npretty plain terms, the consequences of injustice. If any body of\r\nFrench troops land in Ireland, the whole population of that country\r\nwill rise against you to a man, and you could not possibly survive\r\nsuch an event three years. Such, from the bottom of my soul, do I\r\nbelieve to be the present state of that country; and so far does it\r\nappear to me to be impolitic and unstatesman-like to conceed anything\r\nto such a danger, that if the Catholics, in addition to their present\r\njust demands, were to petition for the perpetual removal of the said\r\nLord Hawkesbury from his Majesty's councils, I think, whatever might\r\nbe the effect upon the destinies of Europe, and however it might\r\nretard our own individual destruction, that the prayer of the petition\r\nshould be instantly complied with. Canning's crocodile tears should\r\nnot move me; the hoops of the maids of honour should not hide him. I\r\nwould tear him from the banisters of the back stairs, and plunge him\r\nin the fishy fumes of the dirtiest of all his Cinque Ports.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.\r\n\r\nDear Abraham--In the correspondence which is passing between us, you\r\nare perpetually alluding to the Foreign Secretary; and in answer to\r\nthe dangers of Ireland, which I am pressing upon your notice, you have\r\nnothing to urge but the confidence which you repose in the discretion\r\nand sound sense of this gentleman. I can only say, that I have\r\nlistened to him long and often with the greatest attention; I have\r\nused every exertion in my power to take a fair measure of him, and it\r\nappears to me impossible to hear him upon any arduous topic without\r\nperceiving that he is eminently deficient in those solid and serious\r\nqualities upon which, and upon which alone, the confidence of a great\r\ncountry can properly repose. He sweats and labours, and works for\r\nsense, and Mr. Ellis seems always to think it is coming, but it does\r\nnot come; the machine can't draw up what is not to be found in the\r\nspring; Providence has made him a light, jesting, paragraph-writing\r\nman, and that he will remain to his dying day. When he is jocular he\r\nis strong, when he is serious he is like Samson in a wig; any ordinary\r\nperson is a match for him: a song, an ironical letter, a burlesque\r\node, an attack in the newspaper upon Nicoll's eye, a smart speech of\r\ntwenty minutes, full of gross misrepresentations and clever turns,\r\nexcellent language, a spirited manner, lucky quotation, success in\r\nprovoking dull men, some half information picked up in Pall Mall in\r\nthe morning; these are your friend's natural weapons; all these things\r\nhe can do: here I allow him to be truly great; nay, I will be just,\r\nand go still further, if he would confine himself to these things, and\r\nconsider the _facete_ and the playful to be the basis of his\r\ncharacter, he would, for that species of man, be universally regarded\r\nas a person of a very good understanding; call him a legislator, a\r\nreasoner, and the conductor of the affairs of a great nation, and it\r\nseems to me as absurd as if a butterfly were to teach bees to make\r\nhoney. That he is an extraordinary writer of small poetry, and a diner\r\nout of the highest lustre, I do most readily admit. After George\r\nSelwyn, and perhaps Tickell, there has been no such man for this\r\nhalf-century. The Foreign Secretary is a gentleman, a respectable as\r\nwell as a highly agreeable man in private life; but you may as well\r\nfeed me with decayed potatoes as console me for the miseries of\r\nIreland by the resources of his _sense_ and his _discretion_. It is\r\nonly the public situation which this gentleman holds which entitles me\r\nor induces me to say so much about him. He is a fly in amber, nobody\r\ncares about the fly; the only question is, How the devil did it get\r\nthere? Nor do I attack him for the love of glory, but from the love of\r\nutility, as a burgomaster hunts a rat in a Dutch dyke for fear it\r\nshould flood a province.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the Catholic question are, I observe, extremely\r\nembarrassed in arguing when they come to the loyalty of the Irish\r\nCatholics. As for me, I shall go straight forward to my object, and\r\nstate what I have no manner of doubt, from an intimate knowledge of\r\nIreland, to be the plain truth. Of the great Roman Catholic\r\nproprietors, and of the Catholic prelates, there may be a few, and but\r\na few, who would follow the fortunes of England at all events: there\r\nis another set of men who, thoroughly detesting this country, have too\r\nmuch property and too much character to lose, not to wait for some\r\nvery favourable event before they show themselves; but the great mass\r\nof Catholic population, upon the slightest appearance of a French\r\nforce in that country, would rise upon you to a man. It is the most\r\nmistaken policy to conceal the plain truth. There is no loyalty among\r\nthe Catholics: they detest you as their worst oppressors, and they\r\nwill continue to detest you till you remove the cause of their hatred.\r\nIt is in your power in six months' time to produce a total revolution\r\nof opinions among this people; and in some future letter I will show\r\nyou that this is clearly the case. At present, see what a dreadful\r\nstate Ireland is in. The common toast among the low Irish is, the\r\nfeast of the _passover_. Some allusion to _Bonaparte_, in a play\r\nlately acted at Dublin, produced thunders of applause from the pit and\r\nthe galleries; and a politician should not be inattentive to the\r\npublic feelings expressed in theatres. Mr. Perceval thinks he has\r\ndisarmed the Irish: he has no more disarmed the Irish than he has\r\nresigned a shilling of his own public emoluments. An Irish peasant\r\nfills the barrel of his gun full of tow dipped in oil, butters up the\r\nlock, buries it in a bog, and allows the Orange bloodhound to ransack\r\nhis cottage at pleasure. Be just and kind to the Irish, and you will\r\nindeed disarm them; rescue them from the degraded servitude in which\r\nthey are held by a handful of their own countrymen, and you will add\r\nfour millions of brave and affectionate men to your strength. Nightly\r\nvisits, Protestant inspectors, licenses to possess a pistol, or a\r\nknife and fork, the odious vigour of the _evangelical_ Perceval--acts\r\nof Parliament, drawn up by some English attorney, to save you from the\r\nhatred of four millions of people--the guarding yourselves from\r\nuniversal disaffection by a police; a confidence in the little cunning\r\nof Bow Street, when you might rest your security upon the eternal\r\nbasis of the best feelings: this is the meanness and madness to which\r\nnations are reduced when they lose sight of the first elements of\r\njustice, without which a country can be no more secure than it can be\r\nhealthy without air. I sicken at such policy and such men. The fact\r\nis, the Ministers know nothing about the present state of Ireland; Mr.\r\nPerceval sees a few clergymen, Lord Castlereagh a few general\r\nofficers, who take care, of course, to report what is pleasant rather\r\nthan what is true. As for the joyous and lepid consul, he jokes upon\r\nneutral flags and frauds, jokes upon Irish rebels, jokes upon\r\nnorthern and western and southern foes, and gives himself no trouble\r\nupon any subject; nor is the mediocrity of the idolatrous deputy of\r\nthe slightest use. Dissolved in grins, he reads no memorials upon the\r\nstate of Ireland, listens to no reports, asks no questions, and is the\r\n\r\n    \"_Bourn_ from whom no traveller returns.\"\r\n\r\nThe danger of an immediate insurrection is now, I _believe_, blown\r\nover. You have so strong an army in Ireland, and the Irish are become\r\nso much more cunning from the last insurrection, that you may perhaps\r\nbe tolerably secure just at present from that evil: but are you secure\r\nfrom the efforts which the French may make to throw a body of troops\r\ninto Ireland? and do you consider that event to be difficult and\r\nimprobable? From Brest Harbour to Cape St. Vincent, you have above\r\nthree thousand miles of hostile sea coast, and twelve or fourteen\r\nharbours quite capable of containing a sufficient force for the\r\npowerful invasion of Ireland. The nearest of these harbours is not two\r\ndays' sail from the southern coast of Ireland, with a fair leading\r\nwind; and the furthest not ten. Five ships of the line, for so very\r\nshort a passage, might carry five or six thousand troops with cannon\r\nand ammunition; and Ireland presents to their attack a southern coast\r\nof more than 500 miles, abounding in deep bays, admirable harbours,\r\nand disaffected inhabitants. Your blockading ships may be forced to\r\ncome home for provisions and repairs, or they may be blown off in a\r\ngale of wind and compelled to bear away for their own coast; and you\r\nwill observe that the very same wind which locks you up in the British\r\nChannel, when you are got there, is evidently favourable for the\r\ninvasion of Ireland. And yet this is called Government, and the people\r\nhuzza Mr. Perceval for continuing to expose his country day after day\r\nto such tremendous perils as these; cursing the men who would have\r\ngiven up a question in theology to have saved us from such a risk. The\r\nBritish empire at this moment is in the state of a peach-blossom--if\r\nthe wind blows gently from one quarter, it survives; if furiously from\r\nthe other, it perishes. A stiff breeze may set in from the north, the\r\nRochefort squadron will be taken, and the Minister will be the most\r\nholy of men: if it comes from some other point, Ireland is gone; we\r\ncurse ourselves as a set of monastic madmen, and call out for the\r\nunavailing satisfaction of Mr. Perceval's head. Such a state of\r\npolitical existence is scarcely credible: it is the action of a mad\r\nyoung fool standing upon one foot, and peeping down the crater of\r\nMount Ætna, not the conduct of a wise and sober people deciding upon\r\ntheir best and dearest interests: and in the name, the much-injured\r\nname, of heaven, what is it all for that we expose ourselves to these\r\ndangers? Is it that we may sell more muslin? Is it that we may acquire\r\nmore territory? Is it that we may strengthen what we have already\r\nacquired? No; nothing of all this; but that one set of Irishmen may\r\ntorture another set of Irishmen--that Sir Phelim O'Callaghan may\r\ncontinue to whip Sir Toby M'Tackle, his next door neighbour, and\r\ncontinue to ravish his Catholic daughters; and these are the measures\r\nwhich the honest and consistent Secretary supports; and this is the\r\nSecretary whose genius in the estimation of Brother Abraham is to\r\nextinguish the genius of Bonaparte. Pompey was killed by a slave,\r\nGoliath smitten by a stripling. Pyrrhus died by the hand of a woman;\r\ntremble, thou great Gaul, from whose head an armed Minerva leaps forth\r\nin the hour of danger; tremble, thou scourge of God, a pleasant man is\r\ncome out against thee, and thou shall be laid low by a joker of jokes,\r\nand he shall talk his pleasant talk against thee, and thou shall be no\r\nmore!\r\n\r\nYou tell me, in spite of all this parade of sea-coast, Bonaparte has\r\nneither ships nor sailors: but this is a mistake. He has not ships and\r\nsailors to contest the empire of the seas with Great Britain, but\r\nthere remains quite sufficient of the navies of France, Spain,\r\nHolland, and Denmark, for these short excursions and invasions. Do you\r\nthink, too, that Bonaparte does not add to his navy every year? Do\r\nyou suppose, with all Europe at his feet, that he can find any\r\ndifficulty in obtaining timber, and that money will not procure for\r\nhim any quantity of naval stores he may want? The mere machine, the\r\nempty ship, he can build as well, and as quickly, as you can; and\r\nthough he may not find enough of practised sailors to man large\r\nfighting-fleets--it is not possible to conceive that he can want\r\nsailors for such sort of purposes as I have stated. He is at present\r\nthe despotic monarch of above twenty thousand miles of sea-coast, and\r\nyet you suppose he cannot procure sailors for the invasion of Ireland.\r\nBelieve, if you please, that such a fleet met at sea by any number of\r\nour ships at all comparable to them in point of force, would be\r\nimmediately taken, let it be so; I count nothing upon their power of\r\nresistance, only upon their power of escaping unobserved. If\r\nexperience has taught us anything, it is the impossibility of\r\nperpetual blockades. The instances are innumerable, during the course\r\nof this war, where whole fleets have sailed in and out of harbour, in\r\nspite of every vigilance used to prevent it. I shall only mention\r\nthose cases where Ireland is concerned. In December, 1796, seven ships\r\nof the line, and ten transports, reached Bantry Bay from Brest,\r\nwithout having seen an English ship in their passage. It blew a storm\r\nwhen they were off shore, and therefore England still continues to be\r\nan independent kingdom. You will observe that at the very time the\r\nFrench fleet sailed out of Brest Harbour, Admiral Colpoys was cruising\r\noff there with a powerful squadron, and still, from the particular\r\ncircumstances of the weather, found it impossible to prevent the\r\nFrench from coming out. During the time that Admiral Colpoys was\r\ncruising off Brest, Admiral Richery, with six ships of the line,\r\npassed him, and got safe into the harbour. At the very moment when the\r\nFrench squadron was lying in Bantry Bay, Lord Bridport with his fleet\r\nwas locked up by a foul wind in the Channel, and for several days\r\ncould not stir to the assistance of Ireland. Admiral Colpoys, totally\r\nunable to find the French fleet, came home. Lord Bridport, at the\r\nchange of the wind, cruised for them in vain, and they got safe back\r\nto Brest, without having seen a single one of those floating bulwarks,\r\nthe possession of which we believe will enable us with impunity to set\r\njustice and common sense at defiance. Such is the miserable and\r\nprecarious state of an anemocracy, of a people who put their trust in\r\nhurricanes, and are governed by wind. In August, 1798, three forty-gun\r\nfrigates landed 1100 men under Humbert, making the passage from\r\nRochelle to Killala without seeing any English ship. In October of the\r\nsame year, four French frigates anchored in Killala Bay with 2000\r\ntroops; and though they did not land their troops they returned to\r\nFrance in safety. In the same month, a line-of-battle ship, eight\r\nstout frigates, and a brig, all full of troops and stores, reached the\r\ncoast of Ireland, and were fortunately, in sight of land, destroyed,\r\nafter an obstinate engagement, by Sir John Warren.\r\n\r\nIf you despise the little troop which, in these numerous experiments,\r\ndid make good its landing, take with you, if you please, this _précis_\r\nof its exploits: eleven hundred men, commanded by a soldier raised\r\nfrom the ranks, put to rout a select army of 6000 men, commanded by\r\nGeneral Lake, seized their ordnance, ammunition, and stores, advanced\r\n150 miles into a country containing an armed force of 150,000 men, and\r\nat last surrendered to the Viceroy, an experienced general, gravely\r\nand cautiously advancing at the head of all his chivalry and of an\r\nimmense army to oppose him. You must excuse these details about\r\nIreland, but it appears to me to be of all other subjects the most\r\nimportant. If we conciliate Ireland, we can do nothing amiss; if we do\r\nnot, we can do nothing well. If Ireland was friendly, we might equally\r\nset at defiance the talents of Bonaparte and the blunders of his\r\nrival, Mr. Canning; we could then support the ruinous and silly bustle\r\nof our useless expeditions, and the almost incredible ignorance of our\r\ncommercial orders in council. Let the present administration give up\r\nbut this one point, and there is nothing which I would not consent to\r\ngrant them. Mr. Perceval shall have full liberty to insult the tomb\r\nof Mr. Fox, and to torment every eminent Dissenter in Great Britain;\r\nLord Camden shall have large boxes of plums; Mr. Rose receive\r\npermission to prefix to his name the appellative of virtuous; and to\r\nthe Viscount Castlereagh a round sum of ready money shall be well and\r\ntruly paid into his hand. Lastly, what remains to Mr. George Canning,\r\nbut that he ride up and down Pall Mall glorious upon a white horse,\r\nand that they cry out before him, Thus shall it be done to the\r\nstatesman who hath written 'The Needy Knife-Grinder,' and the German\r\nplay? Adieu only for the present; you shall soon hear from me again;\r\nit is a subject upon which I cannot long be silent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX.\r\n\r\nDear Abraham--No Catholic can be chief Governor or Governor of this\r\nkingdom, Chancellor or Keeper of the Great Seal, Lord High Treasurer,\r\nChief of any of the Courts of Justice, Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nPuisne Judge, Judge in the Admiralty, Master of the Rolls, Secretary\r\nof State, Keeper of the Privy Seal, Vice-Treasurer or his Deputy,\r\nTeller or Cashier of Exchequer, Auditor or General, Governor or Gustos\r\nRotulorum of Counties, Chief Governor's Secretary, Privy Councillor,\r\nKing's Counsel, Serjeant, Attorney, Solicitor-General, Master in\r\nChancery, Provost or Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin,\r\nPostmaster-General, Master and Lieutenant-General of Ordnance,\r\nCommander-in-Chief, General on the Staff, Sheriff, Sub-Sheriff, Mayor,\r\nBailiff, Recorder, Burgess, or any other officer in a City, or a\r\nCorporation. No Catholic can be guardian to a Protestant, and no\r\npriest guardian at all; no Catholic can be a gamekeeper, or have for\r\nsale, or otherwise, any arms or warlike stores; no Catholic can\r\npresent to a living, unless he choose to turn Jew in order to obtain\r\nthat privilege; the pecuniary qualification of Catholic jurors is made\r\nhigher than that of Protestants, and no relaxation of the ancient\r\nrigorous code is permitted, unless to those who shall take an oath\r\nprescribed by 13 and 14 George III. Now if this is not picking the\r\nplums out of the pudding and leaving the mere batter to the Catholics,\r\nI know not what is. If it were merely the Privy Council, it would be\r\n(I allow) nothing but a point of honour for which the mass of\r\nCatholics were contending, the honour of being chief-mourners or\r\npall-bearers to the country; but surely no man will contend that every\r\nbarrister may not speculate upon the possibility of being a Puisne\r\nJudge; and that every shopkeeper must not feel himself injured by his\r\nexclusion from borough offices.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest practical evils which the Catholics suffer in\r\nIreland is their exclusion from the offices of Sheriff and Deputy\r\nSheriff. Nobody who is unacquainted with Ireland can conceive the\r\nobstacles which this opposes to the fair administration of justice.\r\nThe formation of juries is now entirely in the hands of the\r\nProtestants; the lives, liberties, and properties of the Catholics in\r\nthe hands of the juries; and this is the arrangement for the\r\nadministration of justice in a country where religious prejudices are\r\ninflamed to the greatest degree of animosity! In this country, if a\r\nman be a foreigner, if he sell slippers, and sealing wax, and\r\nartificial flowers, we are so tender of human life that we take care\r\nhalf the number of persons who are to decide upon his fate should be\r\nmen of similar prejudices and feelings with himself: but a poor\r\nCatholic in Ireland may be tried by twelve Percevals, and destroyed\r\naccording to the manner of that gentleman in the name of the Lord, and\r\nwith all the insulting forms of justice. I do not go the length of\r\nsaying that deliberate and wilful injustice is done. I have no doubt\r\nthat the Orange Deputy Sheriff thinks it would be a most unpardonable\r\nbreach of his duty if he did not summon a Protestant panel. I can\r\neasily believe that the Protestant panel may conduct themselves very\r\nconscientiously in hanging the gentlemen of the crucifix; but I blame\r\nthe law which does not guard the Catholic against the probable tenor\r\nof those feelings which must unconsciously influence the judgments of\r\nmankind. I detest that state of society which extends unequal degrees\r\nof protection to different creeds and persuasions; and I cannot\r\ndescribe to you the contempt I feel for a man who, calling himself a\r\nstatesman, defends a system which fills the heart of every Irishman\r\nwith treason, and makes his allegiance prudence, not choice.\r\n\r\nI request to know if the vestry taxes in Ireland are a mere matter of\r\nromantic feeling which can affect only the Earl of Fingal? In a parish\r\nwhere there are four thousand Catholics and fifty Protestants, the\r\nProtestants may meet together in a vestry meeting at which no Catholic\r\nhas the right to vote, and tax all the lands in the parish 1s. 6d. per\r\nacre, or in the pound, I forget which, for the repairs of the\r\nchurch--and how has the necessity of these repairs been ascertained? A\r\nProtestant plumber has discovered that it wants new leading; a\r\nProtestant carpenter is convinced the timbers are not sound; and the\r\nglazier who hates holy water (as an accoucheur hates celibacy, because\r\nhe gets nothing by it) is employed to put in new sashes.\r\n\r\nThe grand juries in Ireland are the great scene of jobbing. They have\r\na power of making a county rate to a considerable extent for roads,\r\nbridges, and other objects of general accommodation. 'You suffer the\r\nroad to be brought through my park, and I will have the bridge\r\nconstructed in a situation where it will make a beautiful object to\r\nyour house. You do my job, and I will do yours.' These are the sweet\r\nand interesting subjects which occasionally occupy Milesian gentlemen\r\nwhile they are attendant upon this grand inquest of justice. But there\r\nis a religion, it seems, even in jobs; and it will be highly\r\ngratifying to Mr. Perceval to learn that no man in Ireland who\r\nbelieves in seven sacraments can carry a public road, or bridge, one\r\nyard out of the direction most beneficial to the public, and that\r\nnobody can cheat the public who does not expound the Scriptures in the\r\npurest and most orthodox manner. This will give pleasure to Mr.\r\nPerceval: but, from his unfairness upon these topics I appeal to the\r\njustice and the proper feelings of Mr. Huskisson. I ask him if the\r\nhuman mind can experience a more dreadful sensation than to see its\r\nown jobs refused, and the jobs of another religion perpetually\r\nsucceeding? I ask him his opinion of a jobless faith, of a creed which\r\ndooms a man through life to a lean and plunderless integrity. He knows\r\nthat human nature cannot and will not bear it; and if we were to paint\r\na political Tartarus, it would be an endless series of snug\r\nexpectations and cruel disappointments. These are a few of many\r\ndreadful inconveniences which the Catholics of all ranks suffer from\r\nthe laws by which they are at present oppressed. Besides, look at\r\nhuman nature: what is the history of all professions? Joel is to be\r\nbrought up to the bar: has Mrs. Plymley the slightest doubt of his\r\nbeing Chancellor? Do not his two shrivelled aunts live in the\r\ncertainty of seeing him in that situation, and of cutting out with\r\ntheir own hands his equity habiliments? And I could name a certain\r\nminister of the Gospel who does not, in the bottom of his heart, much\r\ndiffer from these opinions. Do you think that the fathers and mothers\r\nof the holy Catholic Church are not as absurd as Protestant papas and\r\nmammas? The probability I admit to be, in each particular case, that\r\nthe sweet little blockhead will in fact never get a brief;--but I will\r\nventure to say there is not a parent from the Giant's Causeway to\r\nBantry Bay who does not conceive that his child is the unfortunate\r\nvictim of the exclusion, and that nothing short of positive law could\r\nprevent his own dear, pre-eminent Paddy from rising to the highest\r\nhonours of the State. So with the army and parliament; in fact, few\r\nare excluded; but, in imagination, all: you keep twenty or thirty\r\nCatholics out, and you lose the affections of four millions; and, let\r\nme tell you, that recent circumstances have by no means tended to\r\ndiminish in the minds of men that hope of elevation beyond their own\r\nrank which is so congenial to our nature: from pleading for John Roe\r\nto taxing John Bull, from jesting for Mr. Pitt and writing in the\r\n_Anti-Jacobin_, to managing the affairs of Europe--these are leaps\r\nwhich seem to justify the fondest dreams of mothers and of aunts.\r\n\r\nI do not say that the disabilities to which the Catholics are exposed\r\namount to such intolerable grievances, that the strength and industry\r\nof a nation are overwhelmed by them: the increasing prosperity of\r\nIreland fully demonstrates to the contrary. But I repeat again, what I\r\nhave often stated in the course of our correspondence, that your laws\r\nagainst the Catholics are exactly in that state in which you have\r\nneither the benefits of rigour nor of liberality: every law which\r\nprevented the Catholic from gaining strength and wealth is repealed;\r\nevery law which can irritate remains; if you were determined to insult\r\nthe Catholics you should have kept them weak; if you resolved to give\r\nthem strength, you should have ceased to insult them--at present your\r\nconduct is pure, unadulterated folly.\r\n\r\nLord Hawkesbury says, 'We heard nothing about the Catholics till we\r\nbegan to mitigate the laws against them; when we relieved them in part\r\nfrom this oppression they began to be disaffected.' This is very true;\r\nbut it proves just what I have said, that you have either done too\r\nmuch or too little; and as there lives not, I hope, upon earth, so\r\ndepraved a courtier that he would load the Catholics with their\r\nancient chains, what absurdity it is, then, not to render their\r\ndispositions friendly, when you leave their arms and legs free!\r\n\r\nYou know, and many Englishmen know, what passes in China; but nobody\r\nknows or cares what passes in Ireland. At the beginning of the\r\npresent reign no Catholic could realise property, or carry on any\r\nbusiness; they were absolutely annihilated, and had no more agency in\r\nthe country than so many trees. They were like Lord Mulgrave's\r\neloquence and Lord Camden's wit; the legislative bodies did not know\r\nof their existence. For these twenty-five years last past the\r\nCatholics have been engaged in commerce; within that period the\r\ncommerce of Ireland has doubled--there are four Catholics at work for\r\none Protestant, and eight Catholics at work for one Episcopalian. Of\r\ncourse, the proportion which Catholic wealth bears to Protestant\r\nwealth is every year altering rapidly in favour of the Catholics. I\r\nhave already told you what their purchases of land were the last year:\r\nsince that period I have been at some pains to find out the actual\r\nstate of the Catholic wealth: it is impossible upon such a subject to\r\narrive at complete accuracy; but I have good reason to believe that\r\nthere are at present 2000 Catholics in Ireland possessing an income of\r\n£500 and upwards, many of these with incomes of one, two, three, and\r\nfour thousand, and some amounting to fifteen and twenty thousand per\r\nannum:--and this is the kingdom, and these the people, for whose\r\nconciliation we are to wait Heaven knows when, and Lord Hawkesbury\r\nwhy! As for me, I never think of the situation of Ireland without\r\nfeeling the same necessity for immediate interference as I should do\r\nif I saw blood flowing from a great artery. I rush towards it with\r\nthe instinctive rapidity of a man desirous of preventing death, and\r\nhave no other feeling but that in a few seconds the patient may be no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nI could not help smiling, in the times of No Popery, to witness the\r\nloyal indignation of many persons at the attempt made by the last\r\nministry to do something for the relief of Ireland. The general cry in\r\nthe country was, that they would not see their beloved Monarch used\r\nill in his old age, and that they would stand by him to the last drop\r\nof their blood. I respect good feelings, however erroneous be the\r\noccasions on which they display themselves; and therefore I saw in all\r\nthis as much to admire as to blame. It was a species of affection,\r\nhowever, which reminded me very forcibly of the attachment displayed\r\nby the servants of the Russian ambassador at the beginning of the last\r\ncentury. His Excellency happened to fall down in a kind of apoplectic\r\nfit, when he was paying a morning visit in the house of an\r\nacquaintance. The confusion was of course very great, and messengers\r\nwere despatched in every direction to find a surgeon: who, upon his\r\narrival, declared that his Excellency must be immediately blooded, and\r\nprepared himself forthwith to perform the operation: the barbarous\r\nservants of the embassy, who were there in great numbers, no sooner\r\nsaw the surgeon prepared to wound the arm of their master with a\r\nsharp, shining instrument, than they drew their swords, put themselves\r\nin an attitude of defence, and swore in pure Sclavonic, 'that they\r\nwould murder any man who attempted to do him the slightest injury: he\r\nhad been a very good master to them, and they would not desert him in\r\nhis misfortunes, or suffer his blood to be shed while he was off his\r\nguard, and incapable of defending himself.' By good fortune, the\r\nsecretary arrived about this period of the dispute, and his\r\nExcellency, relieved from superfluous blood and perilous affection,\r\nwas, after much difficulty, restored to life.\r\n\r\nThere is an argument brought forward with some appearance of\r\nplausibility in the House of Commons, which certainly merits an\r\nanswer: You know that the Catholics now vote for members of parliament\r\nin Ireland, and that they outnumber the Protestants in a very great\r\nproportion; if you allow Catholics to sit in parliament, religion will\r\nbe found to influence votes more than property, and the greater part\r\nof the 100 Irish members who are returned to parliament will be\r\nCatholics. Add to these the Catholic members who are returned in\r\nEngland, and you will have a phalanx of heretical strength which every\r\nminister will be compelled to respect, and occasionally to conciliate\r\nby concessions incompatible with the interests of the Protestant\r\nChurch. The fact is, however, that you are at this moment subjected to\r\nevery danger of this kind which you can possibly apprehend hereafter.\r\nIf the spiritual interests of the voters are more powerful than their\r\ntemporal interests, they can bind down their representatives to\r\nsupport any measures favourable to the Catholic religion, and they can\r\nchange the objects of their choice till they have found Protestant\r\nmembers (as they easily may do) perfectly obedient to their wishes. If\r\nthe superior possessions of the Protestants prevent the Catholics from\r\nuniting for a common political object, then danger you fear cannot\r\nexist: if zeal, on the contrary, gets the better of acres, then the\r\ndanger at present exists, from the right of voting already given to\r\nthe Catholics, and it will not be increased by allowing them to sit in\r\nparliament. There are, as nearly as I can recollect, thirty seats in\r\nIreland for cities and counties, where the Protestants are the most\r\nnumerous, and where the members returned must of course be\r\nProtestants. In the other seventy representations the wealth of the\r\nProtestants is opposed to the number of the Catholics; and if all the\r\nseventy members returned were of the Catholic persuasion, they must\r\nstill plot the destruction of our religion in the midst of 588\r\nProtestants. Such terrors would disgrace a cook-maid, or a toothless\r\naunt--when they fall from the lips of bearded and senatorial men, they\r\nare nauseous, antiperistaltic, and emetical.\r\n\r\nHow can you for a moment doubt of the rapid effects which would be\r\nproduced by the emancipation? In the first place, to my certain\r\nknowledge the Catholics have long since expressed to his Majesty's\r\nMinisters their perfect readiness _to vest in his Majesty, either with\r\nthe consent of the Pope, or without it if it cannot be obtained, the\r\nnomination of the Catholic prelacy_. The Catholic prelacy in Ireland\r\nconsists of twenty-six bishops and the warden of Galway, a dignitary\r\nenjoying Catholic jurisdiction. The number of Roman Catholic priests\r\nin Ireland exceeds one thousand. The expenses of his peculiar worship\r\nare, to a substantial farmer or mechanic, five shillings per annum; to\r\na labourer (where he is not entirely excused) one shilling per annum;\r\nthis includes the contribution of the whole family, and for this the\r\npriest is bound to attend them when sick, and to confess them when\r\nthey apply to him; he is also to keep his chapel in order, to\r\ncelebrate divine service, and to preach on Sundays and holydays. In\r\nthe northern district a priest gains from £30 to £50; in the other\r\nparts of Ireland from £60 to £90 per annum. The best paid Catholic\r\nbishops receive about £400 per annum; the others from £300 to £350. My\r\nplan is very simple: I would have 300 Catholic parishes at £100 per\r\nannum, 300 at £200 per annum, and 400 at £300 per annum; this, for the\r\nwhole thousand parishes, would amount to £190,000. To the prelacy I\r\nwould allot £20,000 in unequal proportions, from £1000 to £500; and I\r\nwould appropriate £40,000 more for the support of Catholic Schools,\r\nand the repairs of Catholic churches; the whole amount of which sum is\r\n£250,000, about the expense of three days of one of our genuine, good\r\nEnglish _just and necessary wars_. The clergy should all receive their\r\nsalaries at the Bank of Ireland, and I would place the whole patronage\r\nin the hands of the Crown. Now, I appeal to any human being, except\r\nSpencer Perceval, Esq., of the parish of Hampstead, what the\r\ndisaffection of a clergy would amount to, gaping after this graduated\r\nbounty of the Crown, and whether Ignatius Loyola himself, if he were a\r\nliving blockhead instead of a dead saint, could withstand the\r\ntemptation of bouncing from £100 a year at Sligo, to £300 in\r\nTipperary? This is the miserable sum of money for which the merchants\r\nand landowners and nobility of England are exposing themselves to the\r\ntremendous peril of losing Ireland. The sinecure places of the Roses\r\nand the Percevals, and the 'dear and near relations,' put up to\r\nauction at thirty years' purchase, would almost amount to the money.\r\n\r\nI admit that nothing can be more reasonable than to expect that a\r\nCatholic priest should starve to death, genteelly and pleasantly, for\r\nthe good of the Protestant religion; but is it equally reasonable to\r\nexpect that he should do so for the Protestant pews, and Protestant\r\nbrick and mortar? On an Irish Sabbath the bell of a neat parish\r\nchurch often summons to church only the parson and an occasionally\r\nconforming clerk; while, two hundred yards off, a thousand Catholics\r\nare huddled together in a miserable hovel, and pelted by all the\r\nstorms of heaven. Can anything be more distressing than to see a\r\nvenerable man pouring forth sublime truths in tattered breeches, and\r\ndepending for his food upon the little offal he gets from his\r\nparishioners? I venerate a human being who starves for his principles,\r\nlet them be what they may; but starving for anything is not at all to\r\nthe taste of the honourable flagellants: strict principles, and good\r\npay, is the motto of Mr. Perceval: the one he keeps in great measure\r\nfor the faults of his enemies, the other for himself.\r\n\r\nThere are parishes in Connaught in which a Protestant was never\r\nsettled nor even seen. In that province, in Munster, and in parts of\r\nLeinster, the entire peasantry for sixty miles are Catholics; in these\r\ntracts the churches are frequently shut for want of a congregation, or\r\nopened to an assemblage of from six to twenty persons. Of what\r\nProtestants there are in Ireland, the greatest part are gathered\r\ntogether in Ulster, or they live in towns. In the country of the other\r\nthree provinces the Catholics see no other religion but their own, and\r\nare at the least as fifteen to one Protestant. In the diocese of Tuam\r\nthey are sixty to one; in the parish of St. Mulins, diocese of\r\nLeghlin, there are four thousand Catholics and one Protestant; in the\r\ntown of Grasgenamana, in the county of Kilkenny, there are between\r\nfour and five hundred Catholic houses, and three Protestant houses. In\r\nthe parish of Allen, county Kildare, there is no Protestant, though it\r\nis very populous. In the parish of Arlesin, Queen's County, the\r\nproportion is one hundred to one. In the whole county of Kilkenny, by\r\nactual enumeration, it is seventeen to one; in the diocese of\r\nKilmacduagh, province of Connaught, fifty-two to one, by ditto. These\r\nI give you as a few specimens of the present state of Ireland; and yet\r\nthere are men impudent and ignorant enough to contend that such evils\r\nrequire no remedy, and that mild family man who dwelleth in Hampstead\r\ncan find none but the cautery and the knife.\r\n\r\n    ----'Omne per ignem\r\n    Excoquitur vitium.'\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the horror and disgust which I felt at hearing Mr.\r\nPerceval call upon the then Ministry for measures of vigour in\r\nIreland. If I lived at Hampstead upon stewed meats and claret; if I\r\nwalked to church every Sunday before eleven young gentlemen of my own\r\nbegetting, with their faces washed, and their hair pleasingly combed;\r\nif the Almighty had blessed me with every earthly comfort--how awfully\r\nwould I pause before I sent forth the flame and the sword over the\r\ncabins of the poor, brave, generous, open-hearted peasants of\r\nIreland! How easy it is to shed human blood; how easy it is to\r\npersuade ourselves that it is our duty to do so, and that the decision\r\nhas cost us a severe struggle; how much in all ages have wounds and\r\nshrieks and tears been the cheap and vulgar resources of the rulers of\r\nmankind; how difficult and how noble it is to govern in kindness and\r\nto found an empire upon the everlasting basis of justice and\r\naffection! But what do men call vigour? To let loose hussars and to\r\nbring up artillery, to govern with lighted matches, and to cut, and\r\npush, and prime; I call this not vigour, but the _sloth of cruelty and\r\nignorance_. The vigour I love consists in finding out wherein subjects\r\nare aggrieved, in relieving them, in studying the temper and genius of\r\na people, in consulting their prejudices, in selecting proper persons\r\nto lead and manage them, in the laborious, watchful, and difficult\r\ntask of increasing public happiness by allaying each particular\r\ndiscontent. In this way Hoche pacified La Vendée--and in this way only\r\nwill Ireland ever be subdued. But this, in the eyes of Mr. Perceval,\r\nis imbecility and meanness. Houses are not broken open, women are not\r\ninsulted, the people seem all to be happy; they are not rode over by\r\nhorses, and cut by whips. Do you call this vigour? Is this government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--'LETTER TO THE JOURNEYMEN AND LABOURERS OF ENGLAND, WALES,\r\nSCOTLAND, AND IRELAND. LETTER TO JACK HARROW.'\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM COBBETT\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Although Cobbett produced not a few political pamphlets in the\r\nstrictest sense of the term, the infinitely greater part of his work\r\nis comprised during his earlier days in the volumes of _Peter\r\nPorcupine's Gazette_, during his later in those of the _Weekly\r\nRegister_. This latter, however, he himself for a time actually\r\nentitled _The Weekly Political Pamphlet_, while he alluded to it under\r\nthat name even at other times; and his whole work was imbued even more\r\ndeeply than that of Defoe with the pamphlet character. I have selected\r\ntwo examples from the critical time when he was still exasperated by\r\nhis imprisonment, and stung into fresh efforts by debt and the\r\nprospect of fresh difficulties. They exhibit in the most striking form\r\nall Cobbett's pet hatreds--of the unreformed Parliament, of paper\r\nmoney, of political economy, of potatoes, and of many other things.\r\nThe first is the _Register_ of 2d November 1816, the first number of\r\nthe cheapened form, which was sold at twopence, and so acquired the\r\nname of 'Twopenny Trash,' from a phrase of, as some say, Canning's,\r\nothers Castlereagh's. The second is an early number of the papers\r\nwritten from America. They will, with the notes, explain themselves._)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE JOURNEYMEN AND LABOURERS OF ENGLAND, WALES, SCOTLAND,\r\nAND IRELAND, ON THE CAUSE OF THEIR PRESENT MISERIES; ON THE MEASURES\r\nWHICH HAVE PRODUCED THAT CAUSE; ON THE REMEDIES WHICH SOME FOOLISH AND\r\nSOME CRUEL AND INSOLENT MEN HAVE PROPOSED; AND ON THE LINE OF CONDUCT\r\nWHICH JOURNEYMEN AND LABOURERS OUGHT TO PURSUE, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN\r\nEFFECTUAL RELIEF, AND TO ASSIST IN PROMOTING THE TRANQUILLITY AND\r\nRESTORING THE HAPPINESS OF THEIR COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nFriends And Fellow-countrymen--Whatever the pride of rank, of riches,\r\nor of scholarship may have induced some men to believe, or to affect\r\nto believe, the real strength and all the resources of a country ever\r\nhave sprung and ever must spring from the _labour_ of its people; and\r\nhence it is that this nation, which is so small in numbers and so poor\r\nin climate and soil compared with many others, has, for many ages,\r\nbeen the most powerful nation in the world: it is the most\r\nindustrious, the most laborious, and, therefore, the most powerful.\r\nElegant dresses, superb furniture, stately buildings, fine roads and\r\ncanals, fleet horses and carriages, numerous and stout ships,\r\nwarehouses teeming with goods; all these, and many other objects that\r\nfall under our view, are so many marks of national wealth and\r\nresources. But all these spring from _labour_. Without the journeyman\r\nand the labourer none of them could exist; without the assistance of\r\ntheir hands the country would be a wilderness, hardly worth the notice\r\nof an invader.\r\n\r\nAs it is the labour of those who toil which makes a country abound in\r\nresources, so it is the same class of men, who must, by their arms,\r\nsecure its safety and uphold its fame. Titles and immense sums of\r\nmoney have been bestowed upon numerous Naval and Military Commanders.\r\nWithout calling the justice of these in question, we may assert that\r\nthe victories were obtained by _you_ and your fathers and brothers and\r\nsons, in co-operation with those Commanders, who, with _your_ aid,\r\nhave done great and wonderful things; but who, without that aid, would\r\nhave been as impotent as children at the breast.\r\n\r\nWith this correct idea of your own worth in your minds, with what\r\nindignation must you hear yourselves called the Populace, the Rabble,\r\nthe Mob, the Swinish Multitude; and with what greater indignation, if\r\npossible, must you hear the projects of those cool and cruel and\r\ninsolent men, who, now that you have been, without any fault of yours,\r\nbrought into a state of misery, propose to narrow the limit of parish\r\nrelief, to prevent you from marrying in the days of your youth, or to\r\nthrust you out to seek your bread in foreign lands, never more to\r\nbehold your parents or friends? But suppress your indignation, until\r\nwe return to this topic, after we have considered the _cause_ of your\r\npresent misery, and the measures which have produced that cause.\r\n\r\nThe times in which we live are full of peril. The nation, as described\r\nby the very creatures of Government, is fast advancing to that period\r\nwhen an important change must take place. It is the lot of mankind\r\nthat some shall labour with their limbs and others with their minds;\r\nand, on all occasions, more especially on an occasion like the\r\npresent, it is the duty of the latter to come to the assistance of the\r\nformer. We are all equally interested in the peace and happiness of\r\nour common country. It is of the utmost importance that, in the\r\nseeking to obtain these objects, our endeavours should be uniform, and\r\ntend all to the same point. Such an uniformity cannot exist without\r\nan uniformity of sentiment as to public matters, and to produce this\r\nlatter uniformity amongst you is the object of this address.\r\n\r\nAs to the cause of our present miseries, it is the enormous amount of\r\nthe taxes which the Government compels us to pay for the support of\r\nits army, its placemen, its pensioners, etc., and for the payment of\r\nthe interest of its debt. That this is the _real_ cause has been a\r\nthousand times proved; and it is now so acknowledged by the creatures\r\nof the Government themselves. Two hundred and five of the\r\nCorrespondents of the Board of Agriculture ascribe the ruin of the\r\ncountry to taxation. Numerous writers, formerly the friends of the\r\nPitt system, now declare that taxation has been the cause of our\r\ndistress. Indeed, when we compare our present state to the state of\r\nthe country previous to the wars against France, we must see that our\r\npresent misery is owing to no other cause. The taxes then annually\r\nraised amounted to about fifteen millions: they amounted last year to\r\nseventy millions. The nation was then happy; it is now miserable.\r\n\r\nThe writers and speakers who labour in the cause of corruption, have\r\ntaken great pains to make the labouring classes believe that _they_\r\nare _not taxed_; that the taxes which are paid by the landlords,\r\nfarmers, and tradesmen, do not affect you, the journeymen and\r\nlabourers; and that the tax-makers have been very lenient towards\r\nyou. But, I hope that you see to the bottom of these things now. You\r\nmust be sensible that if all your employers were totally ruined in one\r\nday, you would be wholly without employment and without bread; and, of\r\ncourse, in whatever degree your employers are deprived of their means,\r\nthey must withhold means from you. In America the most awkward common\r\nlabourer receives five shillings a day, while provisions are cheaper\r\nin that country than in this. Here, a carter, boarded in the house,\r\nreceives about seven pounds a year; in America, he receives about\r\nthirty pounds a year. What is it that makes this difference? Why, in\r\nAmerica the whole of the taxes do not amount to more than about ten\r\nshillings a head upon the whole of the population; while in England\r\nthey amount to nearly six pounds a head! _There_, a journeyman or\r\nlabourer may support his family well, and save from thirty to sixty\r\npounds a year: _here_, he amongst you is a lucky man, who can provide\r\nhis family with food and with decent clothes to cover them, without\r\nany hope of possessing a penny in the days of sickness or of old age.\r\n_There_, the Chief Magistrate receives six thousand pounds a year;\r\n_here_, the civil list surpasses a million of pounds in amount, and as\r\nmuch is allowed to each of the Princesses in one year, as the chief\r\nmagistrate of America receives in two years, though that country is\r\nnearly equal to this in population.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Preston, a lawyer of great eminence, and a great praiser of\r\nPitt, has just published a pamphlet, in which is this remark: 'It\r\nshould always be remembered, that the eighteen pounds a year paid to\r\nany placeman or pensioner, withdraws from the public the means of\r\ngiving active employment to one individual as the head of a family;\r\nthus depriving five persons of the means of sustenance from the fruits\r\nof honest industry and active labour, and rendering them paupers.'\r\nThus this supporter of Pitt acknowledges the great truth that the\r\ntaxes are the cause of a people's poverty and misery and degradation.\r\nWe did not stand in need of this acknowledgment; the fact has been\r\nclearly proved before; but it is good for us to see the friends and\r\nadmirers of Pitt brought to make this confession.\r\n\r\nIt has been attempted to puzzle you with this sort of question: 'If\r\ntaxes be the cause of the people's misery, how comes it that they were\r\nnot so miserable before the taxes were reduced as they are now?' Here\r\nis a fallacy which you will be careful to detect. I know that the\r\ntaxes have been reduced; that is to say, _nominally_ reduced, but not\r\nso in fact; on the contrary, they have, in reality, been greatly\r\naugmented. This has been done by the sleight-of-hand of paper money.\r\nSuppose, for instance, that four years ago, I had a hundred pounds to\r\npay in taxes, then a hundred and thirty bushels of wheat would have\r\npaid my share. If I have now seventy-five pounds to pay in taxes, it\r\nwill require a hundred and ninety bushels of wheat to pay my share of\r\ntaxes. Consequently, though my taxes are nominally reduced, they are,\r\nin reality, greatly augmented. This has been done by the legerdemain\r\nof paper money. In 1812, the pound-note was worth only thirteen\r\nshillings in silver. It is now worth twenty shillings. Therefore, when\r\nwe now pay a pound-note to the tax-gatherer, we really pay him twenty\r\nshillings where we before paid him thirteen shillings; and the\r\nLandholders who lent pound-notes worth thirteen shillings each, are\r\nnow paid their interest in pounds worth twenty shillings each. And the\r\nthing is come to what Sir Francis Burdett told the Parliament it would\r\ncome to. He told them in 1811, that if they ever attempted to pay the\r\ninterest of their debt in gold and silver, or in paper money equal in\r\nvalue to gold and silver, the farmers and tradesmen must be ruined,\r\nand the journeymen and labourers reduced to the last stage of misery.\r\n\r\nThus, then, it is clear that it is the weight of the taxes, under\r\nwhich you are sinking, which has already pressed so many of you down\r\ninto the state of paupers, and which now threatens to deprive many of\r\nyou of your existence. We next come to consider what have been the\r\ncauses of this weight of taxes. Here we must go back a little in our\r\nhistory, and you will soon see that this intolerable weight has all\r\nproceeded from the want of a Parliamentary Reform.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1764, soon after the present king came to the throne, the\r\nannual interest of the Debt amounted to about five millions, and the\r\nwhole of the taxes to about nine millions. But, soon after this, a war\r\nwas entered on to compel the Americans to submit to be taxed by the\r\nParliament, without being represented in that Parliament. The\r\nAmericans triumphed, and, after the war was over, the annual interest\r\nof the Debt amounted to about nine millions, and the whole of the\r\ntaxes to about fifteen millions. This was our situation when the\r\nFrench people began their Revolution. The French people had so long\r\nbeen the slaves of a despotic government, that the friends of freedom\r\nin England rejoiced at their emancipation. The cause of Reform, which\r\nhad never ceased to have supporters in England for a great many years,\r\nnow acquired new life, and the Reformers urged the Parliament to grant\r\nreform, instead of going to war against the people of France. The\r\nReformers said: 'Give the nation reform, and you need fear no\r\nrevolution.' The Parliament, instead of listening to the Reformers,\r\ncrushed them, and went to war against the people of France; and the\r\nconsequence of these wars is, that the annual interest of the Debt now\r\namounts to forty-five millions, and the whole of the taxes, during\r\neach of the last several years, to seventy millions. So that these\r\nwars have ADDED thirty-six millions a year to the interest of the\r\nDebt, and fifty-five millions a year to the amount of the whole of\r\nthe taxes! This is the price that we have paid for having checked (for\r\nit is only checked) the progress of liberty in France; for having\r\nforced upon that people the family of Bourbon, and for having enabled\r\nanother branch of that same family to restore the bloody Inquisition,\r\nwhich Napoleon had put down.\r\n\r\nSince the restoration of the Bourbons and of the old Government of\r\nFrance has been, as far as possible, the grand result of the contest;\r\nsince this has been the end of all our fightings and all our past\r\nsacrifices and present misery and degradation; let us see (for the\r\ninquiry is now very full of interest) what sort of Government that was\r\nwhich the French people had just destroyed, when our Government began\r\nits wars against that people.\r\n\r\nIf, only twenty-eight years ago, any man in England had said that the\r\nGovernment of France was one that ought to be suffered to exist, he\r\nwould have been hooted out of any company. It is notorious that that\r\nGovernment was a cruel despotism; and that we and our forefathers\r\nalways called it such. This description of that Government is to be\r\nfound in all our histories, in all our Parliamentary debates, in all\r\nour books on Government and politics. It is notorious, that the family\r\nof Bourbon has produced the most perfidious and bloody monsters that\r\never disgraced the human form. It is notorious that millions of\r\nFrenchmen have been butchered, and burnt, and driven into exile by\r\ntheir commands. It is recorded, even in the history of France, that\r\none of them said that the putrid carcass of a Protestant smelt sweet\r\nto him. Even in these latter times, so late as the reign of Louis\r\nXIV., it is notorious that hundreds of thousands of innocent people\r\nwere put to the most cruel death. In some instances, they were burnt\r\nin their houses; in others they were shut into lower rooms, while the\r\nincessant noise of kettle-drums over their heads, day and night, drove\r\nthem to raving madness. To enumerate all the infernal means employed\r\nby this tyrant to torture and kill the people, would fill a volume.\r\nExile was the lot of those who escaped the swords, the wheels, the\r\naxes, the gibbets, the torches of his hell-hounds. England was the\r\nplace of refuge for many of these persecuted people. The grandfather\r\nof the present Earl of Radnor, and the father of the venerable Baron\r\nMaseres were amongst them; and it is well known that England owes no\r\ninconsiderable part of her manufacturing skill and industry to that\r\natrocious persecution. Enemies of freedom, wherever it existed, this\r\nfamily of Bourbon, in the reign of Louis XIV. and XV., fitted out\r\nexpeditions for the purpose of restoring the Stuarts to the throne of\r\nEngland, and thereby caused great expense and blood-shed to this\r\nnation; and, even the Louis who was beheaded by his subjects, did, in\r\nthe most perfidious manner, make war upon England, during her war\r\nwith America. No matter what was the nature of the cause, his conduct\r\nwas perfidious; he professed peace while he was preparing for war. His\r\nobject could not be to assist freedom, because his own subjects were\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nSuch was the family that were ruling in France when the French\r\nRevolution began. After it was resolved to go to war against the\r\npeople of France, all the hirelings of corruption were set to work to\r\ngloss over the character and conduct of the old Government, and to\r\npaint in the most horrid colours the acts of vengeance which the\r\npeople were inflicting on the numerous tyrants, civil, military, and\r\necclesiastical, whom the change of things had placed at their mercy.\r\nThe people's turn was now come, and, in the days of their power, they\r\njustly bore in mind the oppressions which they and their forefathers\r\nhad endured. The taxes imposed by the Government became at last\r\nintolerable. It had contracted a great debt to carry on its wars. In\r\norder to be able to pay the interest of this debt, and to support an\r\nenormous standing army in time of peace, it laid upon the people\r\nburdens which they could no longer endure. It fined and flogged\r\nfathers and mothers if their children were detected in smuggling. Its\r\ncourts of justice were filled with cruel and base judges. The nobility\r\ntreated the common people like dogs; these latter were compelled to\r\nserve as soldiers, but were excluded from all share, or chance of\r\nhonour and command, which were engrossed by the nobility.\r\n\r\nNow, when the time came for the people to have the power in their\r\nhands, was it surprising that the first use they made of it was to\r\ntake vengeance on their oppressors? I will not answer this question\r\nmyself. It shall be answered by Mr. Arthur Young, the present\r\nSecretary of the Board of Agriculture. He was in France at the time,\r\nand living upon the very spot, and having examined into the causes of\r\nthe Revolution, he wrote and published the following remarks, in his\r\n_Travels_, vol. i. page 603:--\r\n\r\n     'It is impossible to justify the excesses of the people on\r\n     their taking up arms; they were certainly guilty of\r\n     cruelties; it is idle to deny the facts, for they have been\r\n     proved too clearly to admit of doubt. But is it really the\r\n     people to whom we are to impute the whole? Or to their\r\n     oppressors, who had kept them so long in a state of bondage?\r\n     He who chooses to be served by slaves and by ill-treated\r\n     slaves, must know that he holds both his property and his\r\n     life by a tenure far different from those who prefer the\r\n     service of well-treated freemen; and he who dines to the\r\n     music of groaning sufferers, must not, in the moment of\r\n     insurrection, complain that his sons' throats are cut. When\r\n     such evils happen, they surely are more imputable to the\r\n     tyranny of the master than to the cruelty of the servant. The\r\n     analogy holds with the French peasants. The murder of a\r\n     seigneur, or a country seat in flames, is recorded in every\r\n     newspaper; the rank of the person who suffers attracts\r\n     notice; but where do we find the registers of that seigneur's\r\n     oppressions of his peasantry, and his exactions of feudal\r\n     services from those whose children were dying around them for\r\n     want of bread? Where do we find the minutes that assigned\r\n     these starving wretches to some vile pettifogger, to be\r\n     fleeced by impositions, and mockery of justice, in the\r\n     seigneural courts? Who gives us the awards of the Intendant\r\n     and his _sub-delegues_, which took off the taxes of a man of\r\n     fashion, and laid them with accumulated weight on the poor,\r\n     who were so unfortunate as to be his neighbours? Who has\r\n     dwelt sufficiently upon explaining all the ramifications of\r\n     despotism, regal, aristocratical, and ecclesiastical,\r\n     pervading the whole mass of the people; reaching, like a\r\n     circulating fluid, the most distant capillary tubes of\r\n     poverty and wretchedness? In these cases the sufferers are\r\n     too ignoble to be known; and the mass too indiscriminate to\r\n     be pitied. But should a philosopher feel and reason thus?\r\n     Should he mistake the cause for the effect? and, giving all\r\n     his pity to the few, feel no compassion for the many, because\r\n     they suffer in his eyes not individually but by millions? The\r\n     excesses of the people cannot, I fear, be justified; it would\r\n     undoubtedly have done them credit, both as men and as\r\n     Christians, if they had possessed their new acquired power\r\n     with moderation. But let it be remembered that the populace\r\n     in no country ever use power with moderation; excess is\r\n     inherent in their aggregate constitution: and as every\r\n     Government in the world knows that violence infallibly\r\n     attends power in such hands, it is doubly bound in common\r\n     sense, and for common safety, so to conduct itself, that the\r\n     people may not find an interest in public confusions. They\r\n     will always suffer much and long, before they are effectually\r\n     roused; nothing, therefore, can kindle the flame but such\r\n     oppressions of some classes or order in society as give able\r\n     men the opportunity of seconding the general mass; discontent\r\n     will diffuse itself around; and if the Government take not\r\n     warning in time, it is alone answerable for all the burnings\r\n     and all the plunderings and all the devastation and all the\r\n     blood that follow.'\r\n\r\nWho can deny the justice of these observations? It was the Government\r\nalone that was justly chargeable with the excesses committed in this\r\nearly stage, and, in fact, in every other stage, of the Revolution of\r\nFrance. If the Government had given way in time, none of these\r\nexcesses would have been committed. If it had listened to the\r\ncomplaints, the prayers, the supplications, the cries of the\r\ncruelly-treated and starving people; if it had changed its conduct,\r\nreduced its expenses, it might have been safe under the protection of\r\nthe peace-officers, and might have disbanded its standing army. But it\r\npersevered; it relied upon the bayonet, and upon its judges and\r\nhangmen. The latter were destroyed, and the former went over to the\r\nside of the people. Was it any wonder that the people burnt the houses\r\nof their oppressors, and killed the owners and their families? The\r\ncountry contained thousands upon thousands of men that had been ruined\r\nby taxation, and by judgments of infamous courts of justice, 'a\r\nmockery of justice'; and, when these ruined men saw their oppressors\r\nat their feet, was it any wonder that they took vengeance upon them?\r\nWas it any wonder that the son, who had seen his father and mother\r\nflogged, because he, when a child, had smuggled a handful of salt,\r\nshould burn for an occasion to shoot through the head the ruffians who\r\nhad thus lacerated the bodies of his parents? Moses slew the insolent\r\nEgyptian who had smitten one of his countrymen in bondage. Yet Moses\r\nhas never been called either a murderer or a cruel wretch for this\r\nact; and the bondage of the Israelites was light as a feather compared\r\nto the tyranny under which the people of France had groaned for ages.\r\nMoses resisted oppression in the only way that resistance was in his\r\npower. He knew that his countrymen had no chance of justice in any\r\ncourt; he knew that petitions against his oppressors were all in vain;\r\nand 'looking upon the burdens' of his countrymen, he resolved to begin\r\nthe only sort of resistance that was left him. Yet it was little more\r\nthan a mere insult that drew forth his anger and resistance; and, if\r\nMoses was justified, as he clearly was, what needs there any apology\r\nfor the people of France?\r\n\r\nIt seems at first sight very strange that the Government of France\r\nshould not have 'taken warning in time.' But it had so long been in\r\nthe habit of despising the people that its mind was incapable of\r\nentertaining any notion of danger from the oppressions heaped upon\r\nthem. It was surrounded with panders and parasites who told it nothing\r\nbut flattering falsehoods; and it saw itself supported by two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand bayonets, which it thought irresistible; though it\r\nfound in the end that those who wielded those bayonets were not long\r\nso base as to be induced, either by threats or promises, to butcher\r\ntheir brothers and sisters and parents. And, if you ask me how it\r\ncame to pass that they did not 'take warning in time,' I answer that\r\nthey did take warning, but that, seeing that the change which was\r\ncoming would deprive them of a great part of their power and\r\nemoluments, they resolved to resist the change, and to destroy the\r\ncountry, if possible, rather than not have all its wealth and power to\r\nthemselves. The ruffian whom we read of, a little time ago, who\r\nstabbed a young woman because she was breaking from him to take the\r\narm of another man whom she preferred, acted upon the principle of the\r\nministers, the noblesse, and the clergy of France. They could no\r\nlonger unjustly possess, therefore they would destroy. They saw that\r\nif a just government were established; that if the people were fairly\r\nrepresented in a national council; they saw that if this were to take\r\nplace, they would no longer be able to wallow in wealth at the expense\r\nof the people; and, seeing this, they resolved to throw all into\r\nconfusion, and, if possible, to make a heap of ruins of that country\r\nwhich they could no longer oppress, and the substance of which they\r\ncould no longer devour.\r\n\r\nTalk of violence indeed! Was there anything too violent, anything too\r\nsevere to be inflicted on these men? It was they who produced\r\nconfusion; it was they who caused the massacres and guillotinings; it\r\nwas they who destroyed the kingly government; it was they who brought\r\nthe king to the block. They were answerable for all and for every\r\nsingle part of the mischief, as much as Pharaoh was for the plagues in\r\nEgypt, which history of Pharaoh seems, by the bye, to be intended as a\r\nlesson to all future tyrants. He 'set taskmasters over the Israelites\r\nto afflict them with burdens; and he made them build treasure cities\r\nfor him; he made them serve with rigour; he made their lives bitter\r\nwith hard bondage, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of\r\nservice of the field; he denied them straw, and insisted upon their\r\nmaking the same quantity of bricks, and because they were unable to\r\nobey, the taskmasters called them idle and beat them.' Was it too much\r\nto scourge and to destroy all the first-born of men who could\r\ntolerate, assist, and uphold a tyrant like this? Yet was Pharaoh less\r\nan oppressor than the old government of France.\r\n\r\nThus, then, we have a view of the former state of that country, by\r\nwars against the people of which we have been brought into our present\r\nstate of misery. There are many of the hirelings of corruption, who\r\nactually insist on it that we ought now to go to war again for the\r\nrestoring of all the cruel despotism which formerly existed in France.\r\nThis is what cannot be done, however. Our wars have sent back the\r\nBourbons; but the tithes, the seigneurs, and many other curses have\r\nnot been restored. The French people still enjoy much of the benefit\r\nof the Revolution; and great numbers of their ancient petty tyrants\r\nhave been destroyed. So that even were things to remain as they are,\r\nthe French people have gained greatly by their Revolution. But things\r\ncannot remain as they are. Better days are at hand.\r\n\r\nIn proceeding now to examine the remedies for your distresses, I shall\r\nfirst notice some of those which foolish, or cruel and insolent men\r\nhave proposed. Seeing that the cause of your misery is the weight of\r\ntaxation, one would expect to hear of nothing but a reduction of\r\ntaxation in the way of remedy; but from the friends of corruption\r\nnever do we hear of any such remedy. To hear them, one would think\r\nthat _you_ had been the guilty cause of the misery you suffer; and\r\nthat you, and you alone, ought to be made answerable for what has\r\ntaken place. The emissaries of corruption are now continually crying\r\nout against the weight of the Poor-rates, and they seem to regard all\r\nthat is taken in that way as a dead loss to the Government! Their\r\nproject is to deny relief to all who are able to work. But what is the\r\nuse of your being able to work, if no one will, or can, give you work?\r\nTo tell you that you must work for your bread, and, at the same time,\r\nnot to find any work for you, is full as bad as it would be to order\r\nyou to make bricks without straw. Indeed, it is rather more cruel and\r\ninsolent; for Pharaoh's taskmasters did point out to the Israelites\r\nthat they might go into the fields and get _stubble_. The _Courier_\r\nnewspaper of the 9th of October, says, 'We must thus be cruel only to\r\nbe kind.' I am persuaded that you will not understand this kindness,\r\nwhile you will easily understand the cruelty. The notion of these\r\npeople seems to be that everybody that receives money out of the taxes\r\nhas a right to receive it, except you. They tremble at the fearful\r\namount of the Poor-rates: they say, and very truly, that those rates\r\nhave risen from two and a half to eight or ten millions since the\r\nbeginning of the wars against the people of France; they think, and\r\nnot without reason, that these rates will soon swallow up nearly all\r\nthe rent of the land. These assertions and apprehensions are perfectly\r\nwell founded; but how can _you_ help it? You have not had the\r\nmanagement of the affairs of the nation. It is not you who have ruined\r\nthe farmers and tradesmen. You only want food and raiment: you are\r\nready to work for it; but you cannot go naked and without food.\r\n\r\nBut the complaints of these persons against you are the more\r\nunreasonable, because they say not a word against the sums paid to\r\nsinecure placemen and pensioners. Of the five hundred and more\r\nCorrespondents of the Board of Agriculture, there are scarcely ten who\r\ndo not complain of the weight of the Poor-rates, of the immense sums\r\ntaken away from them by the poor, and many of them complain of the\r\nidleness of the poor. But not one single man complains of the immense\r\nsums taken away to support sinecure placemen, who do nothing for their\r\nmoney, and to support pensioners, many of whom are women and children,\r\nthe wives and daughters of the nobility and other persons in high\r\nlife, and who can do nothing, and never can have done anything for\r\nwhat they receive. There are of these places and pensions all sizes,\r\nfrom twenty pounds to thirty thousand and nearly forty thousand pounds\r\na year! And surely these ought to be done away before any proposition\r\nbe made to take the parish allowance from any of you who are unable to\r\nwork, or to find work to do. There are several individual placemen,\r\nthe profits of each of which would maintain a thousand families. The\r\nnames of the ladies upon the pension list would, if printed, one under\r\nanother, fill a sheet of paper like this. And is it not, then, base\r\nand cruel at the same time in these Agricultural correspondents to cry\r\nout so loudly against the charge of supporting the unfortunate poor,\r\nwhile they utter not a word of complaint against the sinecure places\r\nand pensions?\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate journeymen and labourers and their families have a\r\nright, they have a just claim, to relief from the purses of the rich.\r\nFor there can exist no riches and no resources which they by their\r\nlabour have not assisted to create. But I should be glad to know how\r\nthe sinecure placemen and lady pensioners have assisted to create\r\nfood and raiment, or the means of producing them. The labourer who is\r\nout of work or ill, to-day, may be able to work, and set to work\r\nto-morrow. While those placemen and pensioners never can work; or, at\r\nleast, it is clear that they never intend to do it.\r\n\r\nYou have been represented by the _Times_ newspaper, by the _Courier_,\r\nby the _Morning Post_, by the _Morning Herald_, and others, as the\r\n_scum_ of society. They say that you have no business at public\r\nmeetings; that you are rabble, and that you pay no taxes. These\r\ninsolent hirelings, who wallow in wealth, would not be able to put\r\ntheir abuse of you in print were it not for your labour. You create\r\nall that is an object of taxation; for even the land itself would be\r\ngood for nothing without your labour. But are you not taxed? Do you\r\npay no taxes? One of the correspondents of the Board of Agriculture\r\nhas said that care has been taken to lay as little tax as possible on\r\nthe articles used by you. One would wonder how a man could be found\r\nimpudent enough to put an assertion like this upon paper. But the\r\npeople of this country have so long been insulted by such men, that\r\nthe insolence of the latter knows no bounds.\r\n\r\nThe tax gatherers do not, indeed, come to you and demand money of you:\r\nbut there are few articles which you use, in the purchase of which you\r\ndo not pay a tax.\r\n\r\nOn your shoes, salt, beer, malt, hops, tea, sugar, candles, soap,\r\npaper, coffee, spirits, glass of your windows, bricks and tiles,\r\ntobacco: on all these, and many other articles you pay a tax, and even\r\non your loaf you pay a tax, because everything is taxed from which the\r\nloaf proceeds. In several cases the tax amounts to more than one half\r\nof what you pay for the article itself; these taxes go in part to\r\nsupport sinecure placemen and pensioners; and the ruffians of the\r\nhired press call you the scum of society, and deny that you have any\r\nright to show your faces at any public meeting to petition for a\r\nreform, or for the removal of any abuse whatever!\r\n\r\nMr. Preston, whom I quoted before, and who is a member of Parliament\r\nand has a large estate, says upon this subject, 'Every family, even of\r\nthe poorest labourer, consisting of five persons, may be considered as\r\npaying, in indirect taxes, at least ten pounds a year, or more than\r\nhalf his wages at seven shillings a week!' And yet the insolent\r\nhirelings call you the mob, the rabble, the scum, the swinish\r\nmultitude, and say that your voice is nothing; that you have no\r\nbusiness at public meetings; and that you are, and ought to be\r\nconsidered as nothing in the body politic! Shall we never see the day\r\nwhen these men will change their tone! Will they never cease to look\r\nupon us [as on] brutes! I trust they will change their tone, and that\r\nthe day of the change is at no great distance!\r\n\r\nThe weight of the Poor-rate, which must increase while the present\r\nsystem continues, alarms the corrupt, who plainly see that what is\r\npaid to relieve you, they cannot have. Some of them, therefore, hint\r\nat your early marriages as a great evil, and a clergyman named Malthus\r\nhas seriously proposed measures for checking you in this respect;\r\nwhile one of the correspondents of the Board of Agriculture complains\r\nof the increase of bastards, and proposes severe punishment on the\r\nparents! How hard these men are to please! What would they have you\r\ndo? As some have called you the swinish multitude, would it be much\r\nwonder if they were to propose to serve you as families of young pigs\r\nare served? Or if they were to bring forward the measure of Pharaoh,\r\nwho ordered the midwives to kill all the male children of the\r\nIsraelites?\r\n\r\nBut, if you can restrain your indignation at these insolent notions\r\nand schemes, with what feelings must you look upon the condition of\r\nyour country, where the increase of the people is now looked upon as a\r\ncurse! Thus, however, has it always been, in all countries where taxes\r\nhave produced excessive misery. Our countryman, Mr. Gibbon, in his\r\nHistory of the _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, has the\r\nfollowing passage: 'The horrid practice of murdering their new-born\r\ninfants was become every day more frequent in the provinces. It was\r\nthe effect of _distress_, and the distress was principally occasioned\r\nby the _intolerable burden of taxes_, and by the vexatious as well as\r\ncruel prosecutions of the officers of the revenue against their\r\ninsolvent debtors. The less opulent or less industrious part of\r\nmankind, instead of rejoicing at an increase of family, deemed it an\r\nact of paternal tenderness to release the children from the impending\r\nmiseries of a life which they themselves were unable to support.'\r\n\r\nBut that which took place under the base Emperor Constantine will not\r\ntake place in England. You will not murder your new-born infants, nor\r\nwill you, to please the corrupt and insolent, debar yourselves from\r\nenjoyments to which you are invited by the very first of Nature's\r\nlaws. It is, however, a disgrace to the country that men should be\r\nfound in it capable of putting ideas so insolent upon paper. So, then,\r\na young man arm-in-arm with a rosy-cheeked girl must be a spectacle of\r\nevil omen! What! and do they imagine that you are thus to be\r\nextinguished, because some of you are now (without any fault of yours)\r\nunable to find work? As far as you were wanted to labour, to fight, or\r\nto pay taxes, you were welcome, and they boasted of your numbers; but\r\nnow that your country has been brought into a state of misery, these\r\ncorrupt and insolent men are busied with schemes for getting rid of\r\nyou. Just as if you had not as good a right to live and to love and to\r\nmarry as they have! They do not propose, far from it, to check the\r\nbreeding of sinecure placemen and pensioners, who are supported in\r\npart by the taxes which you help to pay. They say not a word about the\r\nwhole families who are upon the pension list. In many cases there are\r\nsums granted in trust for _the children_ of such a lord or such a\r\nlady. And while labourers and journeymen who have large families too,\r\nare actually paying taxes for the support of these lords' and ladies'\r\nchildren, these cruel and insolent men propose that they shall have no\r\nrelief, and that their having children ought to be checked! To such a\r\nsubject no words can do justice. You will feel as you ought to feel;\r\nand to the effect of your feelings I leave these cruel and insolent\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThere is one more scheme to notice, which, though rather less against\r\nnature is not less hateful and insolent; namely, to encourage you to\r\nemigrate to foreign countries. This scheme is distinctly proposed to\r\nthe Government by one of the correspondents of the Board of\r\nAgriculture. What he means by encouragement must be to send away by\r\nforce, or by paying for the passage; for a man who has money stands in\r\nno need of relief. But, I trust, that not a man of you will move, let\r\nthe _encouragement_ be what it may. It is impossible for many to go,\r\nthough the prospect be ever so fair. We must stand by our country, and\r\nit is base not to stand by her, as long as there is a chance of seeing\r\nher what she ought to be. But the proposition is, nevertheless, base\r\nand insolent This man did not propose to encourage the sinecure\r\nplacemen and pensioners to emigrate; yet, surely, you who help to\r\nmaintain them by the taxes which you pay, have as good a right to\r\nremain in the country as they have! You have fathers and mothers and\r\nsisters and brothers and children and friends as well as they; but\r\nthis base projector recommends that you may be encouraged to leave\r\nyour relations and friends for ever; while he would have the sinecure\r\nplacemen and pensioners remain quietly where they are!\r\n\r\nNo: you will not leave your country. If you have suffered much and\r\nlong, you have the greater right to remain in the hope of seeing\r\nbetter days. And I beseech you not to look upon yourselves as the\r\n_scum_; but, on the contrary, to be well persuaded that a great deal\r\nwill depend upon your exertions; and therefore, I now proceed to point\r\nout to you what appears to me to be the line of conduct which\r\njourneymen and labourers ought to pursue in order to obtain effectual\r\nrelief, and to assist in promoting tranquillity and restoring the\r\nhappiness of the country.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the cause of our miseries is the burden of taxes\r\noccasioned by wars, by standing armies, by sinecures, by pensions,\r\netc. It would be endless and useless to enumerate all the different\r\nheads or sums of expenditure. The remedy is what we have now to look\r\nto, and that remedy consists wholly and solely of such a reform in the\r\nCommons' or People's House of Parliament, as shall give to every payer\r\nof direct taxes a vote at elections, and as shall cause the Members to\r\nbe elected annually.\r\n\r\nIn a late _Register_ I have pointed out how easily, how peaceably, how\r\nfairly, such a Parliament might be chosen. I am aware that it may, and\r\nnot without justice, be thought wrong to deprive those of the right of\r\nvoting who pay indirect taxes. Direct taxes are those which are\r\ndirectly paid by any person into the hands of the tax-gatherers, as\r\nthe assessed rates and taxes. Indirect taxes are those which are paid\r\nindirectly through the maker or seller of goods, as the tax on soap or\r\ncandles or salt or malt. And, as no man ought to be taxed without his\r\nconsent, there has always been a difficulty upon this head. There has\r\nbeen no question about the _right_ of every man who is free to\r\nexercise his will, who has a settled place in society, and who pays a\r\ntax of any sort, to vote for Members of Parliament. The difficulty is\r\nin taking the votes by any other means than by the Rate-book; for if\r\nthere be no list of tax-payers in the hands of any person, mere menial\r\nservants, vagrants, pickpockets, and scamps of all sorts might not\r\nonly come to the poll, but they might poll in several parishes or\r\nplaces, on one and the same day. A corrupt rich man might employ\r\nscores of persons of this description, and in this way would the\r\npurpose of reform be completely defeated. In America, where one branch\r\nof the Congress is elected for four years and the other for two years,\r\nthey have still adhered to the principle of direct taxation, and in\r\nsome of the States they have made it necessary for a voter to be worth\r\none hundred pounds. Yet they have, in that country, duties on goods,\r\ncustom duties, and excise duties also; and, of course, there are many\r\npersons who really pay taxes, and who, nevertheless, are not permitted\r\nto vote. The people do not complain of this. They know that the number\r\nof votes is so great that no corruption can take place, and they have\r\nno desire to see livery servants, vagrants, and pickpockets take part\r\nin their elections. Nevertheless it would be very easy for a reformed\r\nParliament, when once it had taken root, to make a just arrangement of\r\nthis matter. The most likely method would be to take off the indirect\r\ntaxes, and to put a small direct tax upon every master of a house,\r\nhowever low his situation in life.\r\n\r\nBut this and all other good things, must be done by a reformed\r\nParliament. We must have that first, or we shall have nothing good;\r\nand any man who would beforehand take up your time with the detail of\r\nwhat a reformed Parliament ought to do in this respect, or with\r\nrespect to any changes in the form of government, can have no other\r\nobject than that of defeating the cause of reform; and, indeed, the\r\nvery act must show, that to raise obstacles is his wish.\r\n\r\nSuch men, now that they find you justly irritated, would persuade you\r\nthat, because things have been perverted from their true ends, there\r\nis nothing good in our constitution and laws. For what, then, did\r\nHampden die in the field, and Sydney on the scaffold? And has it been\r\ndiscovered at last that England has always been an enslaved country\r\nfrom top to toe? The Americans, who are a very wise people, and who\r\nlove liberty with all their hearts, and who take care to enjoy it too,\r\ntook special care not to part with any of the great principles and\r\nlaws which they derived from their forefathers. They took special care\r\nto speak with reverence of, and to preserve Magna Charta, the Bill of\r\nRights, the Habeas Corpus, and not only all the body of the Common Law\r\nof England, but most of the rules of our courts, and all our form of\r\njurisprudence. Indeed it is the greatest glory of England that she has\r\nthus supplied with sound principles of freedom those immense regions\r\nwhich will be peopled perhaps by hundreds of millions.\r\n\r\nI know of no enemy of reform and of the happiness of the country so\r\ngreat as that man who would persuade you that we possess nothing good,\r\nand that all must be torn to pieces. There is no principle, no\r\nprecedent, no regulations (except as to mere matter of detail),\r\nfavourable to freedom, which is not to be found in the Laws of\r\nEngland or in the example of our ancestors. Therefore I say we may ask\r\nfor, and we want nothing new. We have great constitutional laws and\r\nprinciples to which we are immovably attached. We want great\r\nalteration, but we want nothing new. Alteration, modification, to suit\r\nthe times and circumstances; but the great principles ought to be and\r\nmust, be the same, or else confusion will follow.\r\n\r\nIt was the misfortune of the French people that they had no great and\r\nsettled principles to refer to in their laws or history. They sallied\r\nforth and inflicted vengeance on their oppressors; but, for want of\r\nsettled principles to which to refer they fell into confusion; they\r\nmassacred each other; they next flew to a military chief to protect\r\nthem even against themselves; and the result has been what we too well\r\nknow. Let us therefore congratulate ourselves that we have great\r\nconstitutional principles and laws, to which we can refer, and to\r\nwhich we are attached.\r\n\r\nThat reform will come I know, if the people do their duty; and all\r\nthat we have to guard against is confusion, which cannot come if\r\nreform take place in time. I have before observed to you that when the\r\nfriends of corruption in France saw that they could not prevent a\r\nchange, they bent their endeavours to produce confusion, in which they\r\nfully succeeded. They employed numbers of unprincipled men to go about\r\nthe country proposing all sorts of mad schemes. They produced first a\r\nconfusion in men's minds, and next a civil war between provinces,\r\ntowns, villages and families. The tyrant Robespierre, who was exceeded\r\nin cruelty only by some of the Bourbons, was proved to have been in\r\nleague with the open enemies of France. He butchered all the real\r\nfriends of freedom whom he could lay his hands on, except Paine, whom\r\nhe shut up in a dungeon till he was reduced to a skeleton. This\r\nmonster was at last put to death himself; and his horrid end ought to\r\nbe a warning to any man who may wish to walk in the same path. But I\r\nam, for my part, in little fear of the influence of such men. They\r\ncannot cajole you as Robespierre cajoled the people of Paris. It is,\r\nnevertheless, necessary for you to be on your guard against them, and\r\nwhen you hear a man talking big and hectoring about projects which go\r\nfurther than a real and radical reform of the Parliament, be you well\r\nassured that that man would be a second Robespierre if he could, and\r\nthat he would make use of you and sacrifice the life of the very last\r\nman of you; that he would ride upon the shoulders of some through\r\nrivers of the blood of others, for the purpose of gratifying his own\r\nselfish and base and insolent ambition.\r\n\r\nIn order effectually to avoid the rock of confusion, we should keep\r\nsteadily in our eye not only what we wish to be done but what can be\r\ndone now. We know that such a reform as would send up a Parliament,\r\nchosen by all payers of direct taxes, is not only just and\r\nreasonable, but easy of execution. I am therefore for accomplishing\r\nthat object first; and I am not at all afraid that a set of men who\r\nwould really hold the purse of the people, and who had been just\r\nchosen freely by the people, would very soon do everything that the\r\nwarmest friend of freedom could wish to see done.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, you are upon your guard against false friends, you\r\nshould neglect no opportunity of doing all that is within your power\r\nto give support to the cause of reform. Petition is the channel for\r\nyour sentiments, and there is no village so small that its petition\r\nwould not have some weight. You ought to attend at every public\r\nmeeting within your reach. You ought to read to and to assist, each\r\nother in coming at a competent knowledge of all public matters. Above\r\nall things, you ought to be unanimous in your object, and not suffer\r\nyourselves to be divided.\r\n\r\nThe subject of religion has nothing to do with this great question of\r\nreform. A reformed Parliament would soon do away with all religious\r\ndistinctions and disabilities. In their eyes, a Catholic and a\r\nProtestant would both appear in the same light.\r\n\r\nThe _Courier_, the _Times_, and other emissaries of corruption, are\r\nconstantly endeavouring to direct your wrath against bakers, brewers,\r\nbutchers, and other persons who deal in the necessaries of life. But,\r\nI trust that you are not to be stimulated to such a species of\r\nviolence. These tradesmen are as much in distress as you. They cannot\r\nhelp their malt and hops and beer and bread and meat being too dear\r\nfor you to purchase. They all sell as cheap as they can, without being\r\nabsolutely ruined. The beer you drink is more than half _tax_, and\r\nwhen the tax has been paid by the seller he must have payment back\r\nagain from you who drink, or he must be ruined. The baker has numerous\r\ntaxes to pay, and so has the butcher, and so has the miller and the\r\nfarmer. Besides, all men are eager to sell, and, if they could sell\r\ncheaper they certainly would, because that would be the sure way of\r\ngetting more custom. It is the weight of the taxes which presses us\r\nall to the earth, except those who receive their incomes out of those\r\ntaxes. Therefore I exhort you most earnestly not to be induced to lay\r\nviolent hands on those who really suffer as much as yourselves.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of lowering wages too, you ought to consider that your\r\nemployers cannot give to you that which they have not. At present,\r\ncorn is high in price, but that high price is no benefit to the\r\nfarmer, because it has risen from the badness of the crop, which Mr.\r\nHunt foretold at the Common Hall, and for the foretelling of which he\r\nwas so much abused by the hirelings of the press, who, almost up to\r\nthis very moment, have been boasting and thanking God for the goodness\r\nof the crop! The farmer whose corn is half destroyed, gains nothing by\r\nselling the remaining half for double the price at which he would\r\nhave sold the whole. If I grow 10 quarters of wheat, and if I save it\r\nall and sell it for two pounds a quarter, I receive as much money as\r\nif I had sold the one-half of it for four pounds a quarter. And I am\r\nbetter off in the former case, because I want wheat for seed, and\r\nbecause I want some to consume myself. These matters I recommend to\r\nyour serious consideration; because it being unjust to fall upon your\r\nemployers to force them to give that which they have not to give, your\r\nconduct in such cases must tend to weaken the great cause in which we\r\nought all now to be engaged, namely the removal of our burdens through\r\nthe means of a reformed Parliament. It is the interest of vile men of\r\nall descriptions to set one part of the people against the other part;\r\nand therefore it becomes you to be constantly on your guard against\r\ntheir allurements.\r\n\r\nWhen journeymen find their wages reduced, they should take time to\r\nreflect on the real cause, before they fly on their employers, who are\r\nin many cases in as great or greater distress than themselves. How\r\nmany of those employers have of late gone to jail for debt and left\r\nhelpless families behind them! The employer's trade falls off. His\r\ngoods are reduced in price. His stock loses the half of its value. He\r\nowes money. He is ruined; and how can he continue to pay high wages?\r\nThe cause of his ruin is the weight of the taxes, which presses so\r\nheavily on us all, that we lose the power of purchasing goods. But it\r\nis certain that a great many, a very large portion of the farmers,\r\ntradesmen, and manufacturers, have, by their supineness and want of\r\npublic spirit, contributed towards the bringing of this ruin upon\r\nthemselves and upon you. They have _skulked_ from their public duty.\r\nThey have kept aloof from, or opposed all measures for a redress of\r\ngrievances; and indeed, they still skulk, though ruin and destruction\r\nstare them in the face. Why do they not now come forward and explain\r\nto you the real cause of the reduction of your wages? Why do they not\r\nput themselves at your head in petitioning for redress? This would\r\nsecure their property much better than the calling in of troops, which\r\ncan never afford them more than a short and precarious security. In\r\nthe days of their prosperity they were amply warned of what has now\r\ncome to pass; and the far greater part of them abused and calumniated\r\nthose who gave them the warning. Even if they would now act the part\r\nof men worthy of being relieved, the relief to us all would speedily\r\nfollow. If they will not; if they will still skulk, they will merit\r\nall the miseries which they are destined to suffer.\r\n\r\nInstead of coming forward to apply for a reduction of those taxes\r\nwhich are pressing them as well as you to the earth, what are they\r\ndoing? Why, they are applying to the Government to add to their\r\nreceipts by passing Corn Bills, by preventing foreign wool from being\r\nimported; and many other silly schemes. Instead of asking for a\r\nreduction of taxes they are asking for the means of paying taxes!\r\nInstead of asking for the abolition of sinecure places and pensions,\r\nthey pray to be enabled to continue to pay the amount of those places\r\nand pensions! They know very well that the salaries of the judges and\r\nof many other persons were greatly raised, some years ago, on the\r\nground of the rise in the price of labour and provisions, why then do\r\nthey not ask to have those salaries reduced, now that labour is\r\nreduced? Why do they not apply to the case of the judges and others\r\nthe arguments which they apply to you? They can talk boldly enough to\r\nyou; but they are too great cowards to talk to the Government, even in\r\nthe way of petition! Far more honourable is it to be a ragged pauper\r\nthan to be numbered among such men.\r\n\r\nThese people call themselves the _respectable_ part of the nation.\r\nThey are, as they pretend, the virtuous part of the people, because\r\nthey are quiet; as if virtue consisted in immobility! There is a\r\ncanting Scotchman in London, who publishes a paper called the\r\n'_Champion_' who is everlastingly harping upon the virtues of the\r\n'fireside,' and who inculcates the duty of quiet submission. Might we\r\nask this Champion of the teapot and milk-jug whether Magna Charta and\r\nthe Bill of Rights were won by the fireside? Whether the tyrants of\r\nthe House of Stuart and of Bourbon were hurled down by fireside\r\nvirtues? Whether the Americans gained their independence, and have\r\npreserved their freedom, by sitting by the fireside? O, no! these were\r\nall achieved by action, and amidst bustle and noise. Quiet indeed! Why\r\nin this quality a log, or a stone, far surpasses even the pupils of\r\nthis Champion of quietness; and the chairs round his fireside exceed\r\nthose who sit in them. But in order to put these quiet, fireside,\r\nrespectable people to the test, let us ask them if they approve of\r\ndrunkenness, breaches of the peace, black eyes, bloody noses, fraud,\r\nbribery, corruption, perjury, and subornation of perjury; and if they\r\nsay no, let us ask them whether these are not going on all over the\r\ncountry at every general election. If they answer yes, as they must\r\nunless they be guilty of wilful falsehood, will they then be so good\r\nas to tell us how they reconcile their inactivity with sentiments of\r\nvirtue? Some men, in all former ages, have been held in esteem for\r\ntheir wisdom, their genius, their skill, their valour, their devotion\r\nto country, etc., but never until this age, was _quietness_ deemed a\r\nquality to be extolled. It would be no difficult matter to show that\r\nthe quiet, fireside gentry are the most callous and cruel, and,\r\ntherefore, the most wicked part of the nation. Amongst them it is that\r\nyou find all the peculators, all the blood-suckers of various degrees,\r\nall the borough-voters and their offspring, all the selfish and\r\nunfeeling wretches, who, rather than risk the disturbing of their\r\nease for one single month, rather than go a mile to hold up their hand\r\nat a public meeting, would see half the people perish with hunger and\r\ncold. The humanity, which is continually on their lips, is all\r\nfiction. They weep over the tale of woe in a novel; but round their\r\n'decent fireside,' never was compassion felt for a real sufferer, or\r\nindignation at the acts of a powerful tyrant.\r\n\r\nThe object of the efforts of such writers is clearly enough seen. Keep\r\nall _quiet_! Do not rouse! Keep still! Keep down! Let those who\r\nperish, perish in silence! It will, however, be out of the power of\r\nthese quacks, with all their laudanum, to allay the blood which is now\r\nboiling in the veins of the people of this kingdom; who, if they are\r\ndoomed to perish, are at any rate resolved not to perish in silence.\r\nThe writer whom I have mentioned above, says that he, of course, does\r\nnot count 'the lower classes, who, under the pressure of need or under\r\nthe influence of ignorant prejudice, may blindly and weakly rush upon\r\ncertain and prompt punishment; but that the security of every decent\r\nfireside, every respectable father's best hopes for his children,\r\nstill connect themselves with the Government.' And by Government he\r\nclearly means all the mass as it now stands. There is nobody so\r\ncallous and so insolent as your sentimental quacks and their patients.\r\nHow these 'decent fireside' people would stare, if some morning they\r\nwere to come down and find them occupied by uninvited visitors! I\r\nhope they never will. I hope that things will never come to this pass:\r\nbut if one thing more than any other tends to produce so sad an\r\neffect, it is the cool insolence with which such men as this writer\r\ntreats the most numerous and most suffering classes of the people.\r\n\r\nLong as this Address already is, I cannot conclude without some\r\nobservations on the 'Charity Subscriptions' at the London Tavern. The\r\nobject of this subscription professes to be to afford relief to the\r\ndistressed labourers, etc. About forty thousand pounds have been\r\nsubscribed, and there is no probability of its going much further.\r\nThere is an absurdity on the face of the scheme; for, as all parishes\r\nare compelled by law to afford relief to every person in distress, it\r\nis very clear that, as far as money is given by these people to\r\nrelieve the poor, there will be so much saved in the parish rates. But\r\nthe folly of the thing is not what I wish you most to attend to.\r\nSeveral of the subscribers to this fund receive each of them more than\r\nten thousand pounds and some more than thirty thousand pounds each,\r\nout of those taxes which you help to pay, and which emoluments not a\r\nman of them proposes to give up. The clergy appear very forward in\r\nthis subscription. An Archbishop and a Bishop assisted at the forming\r\nof the scheme. Now then, observe that there has been given out of the\r\ntaxes, for several years past, one hundred thousand pounds a year,\r\nfor what, think you? Why for the relief of the poor clergy! I have no\r\naccount at hand later than that delivered last year, and there I find\r\nthis sum!--for the poor clergy! The rich clergy do not pay this sum;\r\nbut it comes out of those taxes, part, and a large part of which you\r\npay on your beer, malt, salt, shoes, etc. I daresay that the 'decent\r\nfiresides' of these poor clergy still connect themselves with the\r\nGovernment. Amongst all our misery we have had to support the\r\nintolerable disgrace of being an object of the charity of a Bourbon\r\nPrince, while we are paying for supporting that family upon the throne\r\nof France. Well! But is this all? We are taxed, at the very same\r\nmoment, for the support of the French Emigrants! And you shall see to\r\nwhat amount. Nay, not only French, but Dutch and others, as appears\r\nfrom the forementioned account laid before Parliament last year. The\r\nsum, paid out of the taxes, in one year, for the relief of suffering\r\nFrench Clergy and Laity, St. Domingo Sufferers, Dutch Emigrants,\r\nCorsican Emigrants, was one hundred and eighty-seven thousand seven\r\nhundred and fifty pounds; yes, one hundred and eighty-seven thousand\r\nseven hundred and fifty pounds paid to this set in one year out of\r\nthose taxes of which you pay so large a share, while you are insulted\r\nwith a subscription to relieve you, and while there are projectors who\r\nhave the audacity to recommend schemes for preventing you from\r\nmarrying while young, and to induce you to emigrate from your\r\ncountry! I'll venture my life that the 'decent firesides' of all this\r\nswarm of French clergy and laity, and Dutch, and Corsicans, and St.\r\nDomingo sufferers 'still connect themselves closely with the\r\nGovernment'; and I will also venture my life that you do not stand in\r\nneed of one more word to warm every drop of blood remaining in your\r\nbodies! As to the money subscribed by regiments of soldiers, whose pay\r\narises from taxes in part paid by you, though it is a most shocking\r\nspectacle to behold, I do not think so much of it. The soldiers are\r\nyour fathers, brothers, and sons. But if they were all to give their\r\nwhole pay, and if they amount to one hundred and fifty thousand men,\r\nit would not amount to one-half of what is now paid in Poor-rates, and\r\nof course would not add half a pound of bread to every pound which the\r\nunhappy paupers now receive. All the expenses of the Army and Ordnance\r\namount to an enormous sum--to sixteen or eighteen millions; but the\r\npay of one hundred and fifty thousand men, at a shilling a day each,\r\namounts to no more than two million seven hundred and twelve thousand\r\nfive hundred pounds. So that, supposing them all to receive a shilling\r\na day each, the soldiers receive only about a third part of the sum\r\nnow paid annually in Poor-rates.\r\n\r\nI have no room, nor have I any desire, to appeal to your passions upon\r\nthis occasion. I have laid before you, with all the clearness I am\r\nmaster of, the causes of our misery, the measures which have led to\r\nthose causes, and I have pointed out what appears to me to be the only\r\nremedy--namely a reform of the Commons', or People's House of\r\nParliament. I exhort you to proceed in a peaceable and lawful manner,\r\nbut at the same time to proceed with zeal and resolution in the\r\nattainment of this object. If the skulkers will not join you, if the\r\n'decent fireside' gentry still keep aloof, proceed by yourselves. Any\r\nman can draw up a petition, and any man can carry it up to London,\r\nwith instructions to deliver it into trusty hands, to be presented\r\nwhenever the House shall meet. Some further information will be given\r\nas to this matter in a future Number. In the meanwhile, I remain your\r\nFriend, WM. COBBETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JACK HARROW, AN ENGLISH LABOURER\r\n\r\n_On the new Cheat which is now on foot, and which goes under the name\r\nof Savings Banks_\r\n\r\nNORTH HAMPSTEAD, LONG ISLAND,\r\n_November 7th, 1818._\r\n\r\nFriend Jack--You sometimes hear the Parson talk about deceivers, who\r\ngo about in sheep's clothing; but who inwardly are ravening wolves.\r\nYou frequently hear of the tricks of the London cheats, and I daresay\r\nyou have often enough witnessed those of mountebanks and gypsies. But,\r\nJack, all the tricks of these deceivers and cheaters, if the trickery\r\nof them all were put together, would fall far short of the trick now\r\nplaying off under the name of Savings Banks. And seeing that it is\r\npossible that you may be exposed to the danger of having a few pounds\r\npicked out of your pocket by this trick, I think it right to put you\r\non your guard against the cheat.\r\n\r\nYou have before been informed of who and what the Boroughmongers are.\r\nTherefore, at present, I shall enter into no explanation of their\r\nrecent conduct. But, in order to give you a clear view of their\r\nmotives in this new trick, and which, I think, is about the last in\r\ntheir budget, I must go back and tell you something of the history of\r\ntheir Debt, and of what are called the Funds. Some years ago the\r\nBoroughmongers put me into a loathsome prison for two years, made me\r\npay a thousand pounds fine, and made me enter into recognisances for\r\nseven years, only because I expressed my indignation at the flogging\r\nof Englishmen, in the heart of England, under the superintendence of\r\nhired German troops brought into the country to keep the people in\r\nawe. It pleased God, Jack, to preserve my life and health, while I was\r\nin that prison. And I employed a part of my time in writing a little\r\nbook entitled _Paper against Gold_. In this little book I fully\r\nexplained all the frauds of what is called the _National Debt_, and\r\nof what are called the _Funds_. But as it is possible that you may not\r\nhave seen that little book, I will here tell you enough about these\r\nthings to make you see the reasons for the Boroughmongers using this\r\ntrick of Savings Banks.\r\n\r\nThe Boroughmongers are, you know, those persons (some Lords, some\r\nBaronets, and some Esquires, as they call themselves) who fill, or\r\nnominate others to fill, the seats in the House of Commons. _Commons_\r\nmeans the mass of the _people_. So that this is the House of the\r\nPeople, according to the law of the land. The people--you, I, and all\r\nof us, ought to vote for the men who sit in this House. But the said\r\nLords, Baronets, and Esquires have taken our rights away, and they\r\nnominate the Members themselves. A _monger_ is a _dealer_, as\r\nironmonger, cheesemonger, and the like: and as the Lords, Baronets,\r\nand Esquires sometimes sell and sometimes buy seats, and as the seats\r\nare said to be filled by the people in certain Boroughs, these Lords,\r\nBaronets, and Esquires are very properly called _Boroughmongers_; that\r\nis to say, dealers in boroughs or in the seats of boroughs. As all\r\nlaws and all other matters of government are set up and enforced at\r\nthe will of the two Houses, against whose will the king cannot stir\r\nhand or foot; and as the Boroughmongers fill the seats of the two\r\nHouses, they have all the power, and, of course, the king and the\r\npeople have none. Being possessed of all the power; being able to tax\r\nus at their pleasure; being able to hang us for whatever they please\r\nto call a crime; they will, of course, do with our property and\r\npersons just what they please. And accordingly, they take from us more\r\nthan the half of our earnings; and they keep soldiers (whom they\r\ndeceive) to shoot at us and kill us, if we attempt to resist. They put\r\nus in dungeons when they like. And, in Ireland, they compel people to\r\nremain shut up in their houses from sunset to sunrise, and if any man,\r\ncontrary to their commands, goes out of his house in the night, in\r\norder to go to the privy, they punish him very severely; and in that\r\nunhappy country they transport men and women to Botany Bay without any\r\ntrial by jury, and merely by the orders of two justices of the peace\r\nappointed by themselves.\r\n\r\nThis, Jack, is horrid work to be going on amongst a people who call\r\nthemselves _free_; amongst a people who boast of their liberties. But\r\nthe facts are so; and now I shall explain to you how the\r\nBoroughmongers, who are so few in number compared to the whole people,\r\nare able to commit these cruel acts and to carry on this abominable\r\ntyranny; and you will see that the trick of Savings Banks makes a part\r\nof the means, which they now intend to use for the perpetuating of\r\nthis tyranny.\r\n\r\nFormerly, more than a hundred years ago, when the kings of England\r\nhad some real power, and before the Boroughmongers took all the powers\r\nof king and people into their hands, the people, when the kings\r\nbehaved amiss, used to rise against them and compel them to act\r\njustly. They beheaded Charles the First about one hundred and seventy\r\nyears ago; and they drove James the Second out of the kingdom; they\r\nwent so far as to set his family aside for ever, and they put up the\r\npresent royal family in its stead.\r\n\r\nThis was all very well; but when King James had been driven out, the\r\nLords and Baronets and Squires conceived the notion of ruling for ever\r\nover king and people. They made Parliaments, which used to be annual,\r\nthree years of duration; and when the members had been elected for\r\nthree years, the members themselves made a law to make the people obey\r\nthem for seven years. Thus was the usurpation completed; and from that\r\ntime to this the Boroughmongers have filled the seats just as it has\r\npleased them to do it; and they have, as I said before, done with our\r\nproperty and our persons just what they have pleased to do.\r\n\r\nNow it will naturally be matter of wonder to you, friend Jack, that\r\nthis small band of persons, and of debauched wretched persons too, any\r\nhalf dozen of whom you would be able to beat with one hand tied down;\r\nit will be matter of wonder to you that this contemptible band should\r\nhave been able thus to subjugate, and hold in bondage so degrading,\r\nthe whole of the English people. But, Jack, recollect that once a\r\nparcel of fat, lazy, drinking, and guttling monks and friars were able\r\nto make this same people to work and support them in their laziness\r\nand debaucheries, aye, and almost to adore them, too; to go to them,\r\nand kneel down and confess their sins to them, and to believe that it\r\nwas in their power to absolve them of their sins. Now how was it that\r\nthese fat, these bastard-propagating rascals succeeded in making the\r\npeople do this? Why by fraud; by deception; by cheatery; by making\r\nthem believe lies; by frightening them half out of their wits; by\r\nmaking them believe that they would go to hell if they did not work\r\nfor them. A ten-thousandth part of the people were able to knock the\r\ngreasy vagabonds on the head; and they would have done it too; but\r\nthey were afraid of going to hell if they had no priest to pardon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThus did these miscreants govern by fraud. The Boroughmongers, as I\r\nshall by and by show, have of late been compelled to resort to open\r\nforce; but for a long while they governed by fraud alone. First they,\r\nby the artful and able agents which they have constantly kept in pay,\r\nfrightened the people with the pretended dangers of a return of the\r\nold king's family. The people were amused with this scarecrow, while\r\nthe chains were silently forging to bind them with. But the great\r\nfraud, the cheat of all cheats, was what they call the national debt.\r\nAnd now, Jack, pray attend to me; for I am going to explain the chief\r\ncause of all the disgraces and sufferings of the labourers in England;\r\nand am also going to explain the reasons or motives which the\r\nBoroughmongers have for setting on foot this new fraud of Savings\r\nBanks. I beg you, Jack, if you have no other leisure time, to stay at\r\nhome instead of going to church, for one single Sunday. Shave\r\nyourself, put on a clean shirt, and sit down and read this letter ten\r\ntimes over, until you understand every word of it. And if you do that,\r\nyou will laugh at the parson and tax-gatherer's coaxings about Savings\r\nBanks. You will keep your odd pennies to yourself; or lay them out in\r\nbread or bacon.\r\n\r\nYou have heard, I daresay, a great deal about the national debt; and\r\nnow I will tell you what this thing is, and how it came, and then you\r\nwill see what an imposture it is, and how shamefully the people of\r\nEngland have been duped and robbed.\r\n\r\nThe Boroughmongers having usurped all the powers of government, and\r\nhaving begun to pocket the public money at a great rate, the people\r\ngrew discontented. They began to think that they had done wrong in\r\ndriving King James away. In a pretty little fable-book, there is a\r\nfable which says that the frogs, who had a log of wood for king,\r\nprayed to Jupiter to send them something more active. He sent them a\r\nstork, or heron, which gobbled them up alive by scores! The people of\r\nEngland found in the Boroughmongers what the poor frogs found in the\r\nstork; and they began to cry out against them and to wish for the old\r\nking back again.\r\n\r\nThe Boroughmongers saw their danger, and they adopted measures to\r\nprevent it. They saw that if they could make it the interest of a\r\ngreat many rich people to uphold them and their system they should be\r\nable to get along. They therefore passed a law to enable themselves to\r\nborrow money of rich people; and by the same law they imposed it on\r\nthe people at large to pay, for ever, the interest of the money so by\r\nthem borrowed.\r\n\r\nThe money which they thus borrowed they spent in wars, or divided\r\namongst themselves, in one shape or another. Indeed the money spent in\r\nwars was pocketed, for the greater part, by themselves. Thus they\r\nowed, in time, immense sums of money; and as they continued to pass\r\nlaws to compel the nation at large to pay the interest of what they\r\nborrowed, spent and pocketed, they called and still call this debt,\r\nthe debt of the nation; or, in the usual words, the national debt.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe that there has seldom been known in the world\r\nany very wicked and mischievous scheme of which a priest of some\r\ndescription or other was not at the bottom. This scheme, certainly as\r\nwicked in itself as any that was ever known, and far more mischievous\r\nin its consequences than any other, was the offspring of a Bishop of\r\nSalisbury, whose name was Burnet; a name that we ought to teach our\r\nvery children to execrate. This crafty priest was made a Bishop for\r\nhis invention of this scheme; a fit reward for such a service.\r\n\r\nThe Boroughmongers began this debt one hundred and twenty-four years\r\nago. They have gone on borrowing ever since; and have never paid off\r\none farthing, and never can. They have continued to pass Acts to make\r\nthe people pay the interest of what has been borrowed; till, at last,\r\nthe debt itself amounts to more than all the lands, all the houses,\r\nall the trees, all the canals and all the mines would sell for at\r\ntheir full sterling value; and the money to pay the interest is taken\r\nout of men's rents and out of their earnings; and you, Jack, as I\r\nshall by and by prove to you, pay to the Boroughmongers more than the\r\nhalf of what you receive in weekly wages from your master.\r\n\r\nIs not this a pretty state of things? Pray observe, Jack, the debt far\r\nexceeds the real full value of the whole kingdom, if there could be a\r\npurchaser found for it. So that, you see, as to private property no\r\nman has any, as long as this debt hangs upon the country. Your master,\r\nFarmer Gripe, for instance, calls his farm _his_. It is none of his,\r\naccording to the Boroughmongers' law; for that law has pawned it for\r\nthe payment of the interest of the Boroughmongers' debt; and the pawn\r\nmust remain as long as the Boroughmongers' law remains. Gripe is\r\ncompelled to pay out of the yearly value of his farm a certain portion\r\nto the debt. He may, indeed, sell the farm; but he can get only a part\r\nof the value; because the purchaser will have to pay a yearly sum on\r\naccount of the pawn. In short, the Boroughmongers have, in fact,\r\npassed laws to take every man's private property away from him, in\r\nwhatever portions their debt may demand such taking away; and a man\r\nwho thinks himself an owner of land, is at best only a steward who\r\nmanages it for the Boroughmongers.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is only a small part of the evil; for the whole of the\r\nrents of the houses and lands and mines and canals would not pay the\r\ninterest of this debt; no, and not much more than the half of it. The\r\nlabour is therefore pawned too. Every man's labour is pawned for the\r\npayment of the interest of this debt. Aye, Jack, you may think that\r\nyou are working for yourself, and that, when on a Saturday night you\r\ntake nine shillings from Farmer Gripe, the shillings are for your own\r\nuse. You are grievously deceived, for more than half the sum is paid\r\nto the Boroughmongers on account of the pawn. You do not see this, but\r\nthe fact is so. Come, what are the things in which you expend the nine\r\nshillings? Tea, sugar, tobacco, candles, salt, soap, shoes, beer,\r\nbread; for no meat do you ever taste. On the articles taken together,\r\nexcept bread, you pay far more than half tax; and you will observe\r\nthat your master's taxes are, in part, pinched out of you. There is an\r\narmy employed in Ireland to go with the excisemen and other taxers to\r\nmake the people pay. If the taxers were to wait at the ale houses and\r\ngrocers' shops, and receive their portion from your own hands, you\r\nwould then clearly see that the Boroughmongers take away more than the\r\nhalf of what you earn. You would then clearly see what it is that\r\nmakes you poor and ragged, and that makes your children cry for the\r\nwant of a bellyful. You would clearly see that what the hypocrites\r\ntell you about this being your lot, and about Providence placing you\r\nin such a state in order to try your patience and faith, is all a base\r\nfalsehood. Why does not Providence place the Boroughmongers and the\r\nparsons in a state to try their patience and faith? Is Providence less\r\nanxious to save them than to save you? If you could see clearly what\r\nyou pay on account of the Boroughmongers' pawn, you would see that\r\nyour misery arises from the designs of a benevolent Providence being\r\ncounteracted by the measures of the Borough-tyrants.\r\n\r\nYour lot, indeed! Your lot assigned by Providence! This is real\r\nblasphemy! Just as if Providence, which sends the salt on shore all\r\nround our coast, had ordained that you should not have any of it\r\nunless you would pay the Boroughmongers fifteen shillings a bushel tax\r\nupon it! But what a Providence must that be which would ordain that an\r\nEnglishman should pay fifteen shillings tax on a bushel of English\r\nsalt, while a Long Islander pays only two shillings and sixpence for a\r\nbushel of the same salt, after it is brought to America from England?\r\nWhat an idea must we have of such a Providence as this? Oh no, Jack;\r\nthis is not the work of Providence. It is the work of the\r\nBoroughmongers; the pretext about Providence has been invented to\r\ndeceive and cheat you, and to perpetuate your slavery.\r\n\r\nWell: all is pawned then. The land, the houses, the canals, the mines,\r\nand the labour are pawned for the payment of the interest of the\r\nBoroughmongers debt. Your labour, mind, Jack, is pawned for the\r\none-half of its worth. But you will naturally ask, how is it that the\r\nnation, that everybody submits to this? There's your mistake, Jack. It\r\nis not _everybody_ that submits. In the first place there are the\r\nBoroughmongers themselves and all their long tribe of relations,\r\nlegitimate and spurious, who profit from the taxes, and who have the\r\nchurch livings, which they enjoy without giving the poor any part of\r\ntheir legal share of those livings. Then there are all the officers of\r\narmy and navy, and all the endless hosts of place-men and place-women,\r\npensioned men and pensioned women, and all the hosts of tax-gatherers,\r\nwho alone, these last I mean, swallow more than would be necessary to\r\ncarry on the Government under a reformed Parliament. But have you\r\nforgotten the lenders of the money which makes the debt? These people\r\nlive wholly upon the interest of the debt; and of course they approve\r\nof your labour, and the labour of every man being pawned. The\r\nBoroughmongers have pawned your labour to them. Therefore they like\r\nthat your labour should be taxed. They cannot be said to submit to the\r\ntyranny; they applaud it, and to their utmost they support it.\r\n\r\nBut you will say, still the mass of the people would, if they had a\r\nmind to bestir themselves, be too strong for all these. Very true. But\r\nyou forget the army, Jack. This is a great military force, armed with\r\nbayonets, bullets and cannon-balls, ready at all times and in all\r\nplaces to march or gallop to attack the people, if they attempt to eat\r\nsugar or salt without paying the tax. There are forts, under the name\r\nof barracks, all over the kingdom, where armed men are kept in\r\nreadiness for this purpose. In Ireland they actually go in person to\r\nhelp to collect the taxes; and in England they are always ready to do\r\nthe same. Now, suppose, Jack, that a man who has a bit of land by the\r\nseaside, were to take up a little of the salt that Providence sends on\r\nshore. He would be prosecuted. He would resist the process. Soldiers\r\nwould come and take him away to be tried and _hanged_. Suppose you,\r\nJack, were to dip your rushes into grease, till they came to farthing\r\ncandles. The Excise would prosecute you. The sheriff would send men to\r\ndrag you to jail. You would fight in defence of your house and home.\r\nYou would beat off the sheriff's men. Soldiers would come and kill\r\nyou, or would take you away to be hanged.\r\n\r\nThis is the thing by which the Boroughmongers govern. There are enough\r\nwho would gladly not submit to their tyranny; but there is nobody but\r\nthemselves who has an army at command.\r\n\r\nNevertheless they are not altogether easy under these circumstances.\r\nAn army is a two-edged weapon. It may cut the employer as well as the\r\nthing that it is employed upon. It is made up of flesh and blood, and\r\nof English flesh and blood too. It may not always be willing to move,\r\nor to strike when moved. The Boroughmongers see that their titles and\r\nestates hang upon the army. They would fain coax the people back again\r\nto feelings of reverence and love. They would fain wheedle them into\r\nsomething that shall blunt their hostility. They have been trying\r\nBible-schemes, school-schemes, and soup-schemes. And at last they are\r\ntrying the Savings Banks scheme, upon which I shall now more\r\nparticularly address you.\r\n\r\nThis thing is of the same nature, and its design is the same, as those\r\nof the grand scheme of Bishop Burnet. The people are discontented.\r\nThey feel their oppressions; they seek a change; and some of them have\r\ndecidedly protested against paying any longer any part of the\r\ninterest of the debt, which they say ought to be paid, if at all, by\r\nthose who have borrowed and spent, or pocketed, the money. Now then,\r\nin order to enlist great numbers of labourers and artisans on their\r\nside, the Boroughmongers have fallen upon the scheme of coaxing them\r\nto put small sums into what they call _banks_. These sums they pay\r\nlarge interest upon, and suffer the parties to take them out whenever\r\nthey please. By this scheme they think to bind great numbers to them\r\nand their tyranny. They think that great numbers of labourers and\r\nartisans, seeing their little sums increase, as they will imagine,\r\nwill begin to conceive the hopes of becoming rich by such means; and\r\nas these persons are to be told that their money is in the _funds_,\r\nthey will soon imbibe the spirit of fundholders, and will not care who\r\nsuffers, or whether freedom or slavery prevail, so that the funds be\r\nbut safe.\r\n\r\nSuch is the scheme and such the motives. It will fail of its object,\r\nthough not unworthy the inventive powers of the servile knaves of\r\nEdinburgh. It will fail, first because the men from whom alone the\r\nBorough-tyrants have anything to dread, will see through the scheme\r\nand despise it; and will, besides, well know that the funds are a mere\r\nbubble that may burst, or be bursted at any moment. The parsons appear\r\nto be the main tools in this coaxing scheme. They are always at the\r\nhead of everything which they think likely to support tyranny. The\r\ndepositors will be domestic servants, particularly women, who will be\r\ntickled with the idea of having a fortune in the funds. The\r\nBoroughmongers will hint to their tenants that they must get their\r\nlabourers into the Savings Banks. A preference will be given to such\r\nas deposit. The Ladies, the 'Parsons' Ladies,' will scold poor people\r\ninto the funds. The parish officers will act their part in this\r\ncompulsory process: and thus will the Boroughmongers get into their\r\nhands some millions of the people's money by a sort of 'forced loan':\r\nor in other words, a robbery. In order to swell the thing out, the\r\nparsons and other tools of the Boroughmongers will lend money in this\r\nway themselves, under feigned names; and we shall, if the system last\r\na year or two, hear boastings of how rich the poor are become.\r\n\r\nNow then, Jack, supposing it possible that Farmer Gripe may, under\r\npain of being turned out of your cottage, have made you put your\r\ntwopence a week into one of these banks, let us see what is the\r\nnatural consequence of your so doing. Twopence a week is eight\r\nshillings and eightpence a year; and the interest will make the amount\r\nabout nine shillings perhaps. What use is this to you? Will you let it\r\nremain; and will you go on thus for years? You must go on a great many\r\nyears, indeed, before your deposit amounts to as much as the\r\nBoroughmongers take from you in one year! Twopence will buy you a\r\nquarter of a pound of meat. This is a dinner for your wife or\r\nyourself. You never taste meat. And why are you to give up half a\r\npound of your bread to the Boroughmongers. You are ill; your wife is\r\nill; your children are ill. 'Go to the bank and take out your money,'\r\nsays the overseer; 'for I'll give you no aid till that be spent.' Thus\r\nthen, you will have been robbing your own starved belly weekly, to no\r\nother end than that of favouring the parish purse, upon which you have\r\na just and legal claim, until the clergy restore to the poor what they\r\nhave taken from them. As the thing now stands, the poor are starved by\r\nothers, this scheme is intended to make them assist in the work\r\nthemselves, at the same time that it binds them to the tyranny.\r\n\r\nBut, Jack, what a monstrous thing is this, that the Boroughmongers\r\nshould kindly pass an Act to induce you to save your money, while they\r\ntake from you five shillings out of every nine that you earn? Why not\r\ntake less from you! That would be the more natural way to go to work,\r\nsurely. Why not leave you all your earnings to yourself? Oh, no! They\r\ncannot do that. It is from the labour of men like you that the far\r\ngreater part of the money comes to enrich the Boroughmongers, their\r\nrelations and dependants.\r\n\r\nHowever, suppose you have gotten together five pounds in a Savings\r\nBank. That is to say in the funds. This is a great deal for you,\r\nthough it is not half so much as you are compelled to give to the\r\nBoroughmongers in one year. This is a great sum. It is much more than\r\nyou ever will have; but suppose you have it. It is _in the funds_,\r\nmind. And now let me tell you what the funds are; which is necessary\r\nif you have not read my little book called _Paper against Gold._ The\r\nfunds is _no place_ at all, Jack. It is nothing, Jack. It is\r\nmoonshine. It is a lie, a bubble, a fraud, a cheat, a humbug. And it\r\nis all these in the most perfect degree. People think that the funds\r\nis a place where money is kept. They think that it is a place which\r\ncontains that which they have deposited. But the fact is, that the\r\nfunds is a word which means nothing that the most of the people think\r\nit means. It means the _descriptions of the several sorts of the\r\ndebt_. Suppose I owed money to a tailor, to a smith, to a shoemaker,\r\nto a carpenter, and that I had their several bills in my house. I\r\nshould in the language of the Boroughmongers, call these bills my\r\n_funds_. The Boroughmongers owe some people annuities at three pounds\r\nfor a hundred; some at four pounds for a hundred; some at five pounds\r\nfor a hundred; and these annuities, or debts they call their funds.\r\nAnd, Jack, if the Savings Bank people lend them a good parcel of\r\nmoney, they will have that money in these debts or funds. They will be\r\nowners of some of those debts which never will and never can be paid.\r\n\r\nBut what is this money too in which you are to be paid back again? It\r\nis no money. It is paper; and though that paper will pass just at this\r\ntime; it will not long pass, I can assure you, Jack. When you have\r\nworked a fortnight, and get a pound note for it, you set a high value\r\nupon the note, because it brings you food. But suppose nobody would\r\ntake the note from you. Suppose no one would give you anything in\r\nexchange for it. You would go back to Farmer Gripe and fling the note\r\nin his face. You would insist upon real money, and you would get it,\r\nor you would tear down his house. This is what will happen, Jack, in a\r\nvery short time.\r\n\r\nI will explain to you, Jack, how this matter stands. Formerly\r\nbank-notes were as good as real money, because anybody that had one\r\nmight go at any moment, and get real money for it at the Bank. But now\r\nthe thing is quite changed. The Bank broke some years ago; that is to\r\nsay, it could not pay its notes in real money; and it never has been\r\nable to do it from that time to this; and what is more, it never can\r\ndo it again. To be sure the paper passes at present. You take it for\r\nyour work, and others take it of you for bread and tea. But the time\r\nmay be, and I believe is, very near at hand, when this paper will not\r\npass at all; and then as the Boroughmongers and the Savings Bank\r\npeople have, and can have, no real money, how are you to get your five\r\npounds back again?\r\n\r\nThe bank-notes may be all put down at any moment, if any man of\r\ntalent and resolution choose to put them down; and why may not such a\r\nman exist, and have the Disposition to put them down? They are now of\r\nvalue, as I said before, because they will pass; because people will\r\ntake them and will give victuals and drink for them; but, if nobody\r\nwould give bread and tea and beer for them, would they then be good\r\nfor anything? They are taken because people are pretty sure that they\r\ncan pass them again; but who will take them when he does not think\r\nthat he can pass them again? And I assure you, Jack, that even I\r\nmyself could, before next May-day, do that which would prevent any man\r\nin England from ever taking a bank-note any more. If you should put\r\nfive pounds into a Savings Bank, therefore, you could, in such case,\r\nnever see a farthing in exchange for it.\r\n\r\nThis being a matter of so much importance to you, I will clearly\r\nexplain to you how I might easily do the thing. Mind, I do not say\r\nthat I will do the thing. Indeed, I will not; and I do not know any\r\none that intends to do it. But I will show you how I _might_ do it;\r\nbecause it is right that you should know what a ticklish state your\r\npoor five pounds will be in if you deposit them in the Savings Bank.\r\n\r\nYou know, Jack, that _forged_ notes pass till people find them out.\r\nThey keep passing very quietly till they come to the Bank, and there\r\nbeing known for forged notes, the man who carries them to the Bank, or\r\nowns them at the time, loses the amount of them. Suppose now, that Tom\r\nwere to forge a note, and pay it to Dick for a pig. Dick would pay it\r\nto Bob for some tea. Bob would send it up to London to pay his\r\ntea-man. The tea-man would send it to the Bank. The Bank would keep\r\nit, and give him nothing for it. If the tea-man forgot whom he got it\r\nfrom, he must lose. If he could prove that he got it from Bob, Bob\r\nmust lose it; and so on; but either Dick or Bob or the tea-man must\r\nlose it. There must be a loss somewhere.\r\n\r\nNow, it is clear that if there were a great quantity of forged notes\r\nin circulation, people would be afraid to take notes at all; and that\r\nif this great quantity came out all of a sudden, it would for a while\r\nput an end to all payments and all trade. And if such great quantity\r\ncan with safety be put out, I leave you to guess, Jack, at the\r\nsituation of your five pounds. I will now show you, then, that I could\r\ndo this myself, and with perfect safety and ease.\r\n\r\nI could have made, at a very trifling expense, a million of pounds in\r\nbank-notes of various amounts. There are fourteen different ways in\r\nwhich I could send them to England, and lodge them safely there,\r\nwithout the smallest chance of their arrival being known to any soul\r\nexcept the man to whom they should be confided. The Banks might\r\nsearch and ransack every vessel that arrived from America. They might\r\ndo what they would. They would never detect the cargo!\r\n\r\nThere they are then, safe in London; a famous stock of bank-notes, so\r\nwell executed that no human being except the Bank people would be able\r\nto discover the counterfeit. The agent takes a parcel at a time, and\r\ndrops them in the street in the dark. This work he carries on for a\r\nweek or two in such streets as are best calculated for the purpose,\r\ntill he has well stocked the town. He may do the same at Portsmouth\r\nand other great towns if he please, and he may send off large supplies\r\nby post.\r\n\r\nNow, Jack, suppose you were up at London with your master's waggon.\r\nYou might find a parcel of notes. You would go to the first shop to\r\nbuy your wife a gown and your children some clothes, yourself a hat, a\r\ngreatcoat, and some shoes. The rest you would lay out at shops on the\r\nroad home; for the sooner you got rid of this _foundal_, the less\r\nchance of having it taken from you. The shopkeepers would thank you\r\nfor your custom, and your wife's heart would bound with joy.\r\n\r\nThe notes would travel about most merrily. At last they would come to\r\nthe Bank. The holders would lose them; but you would gain by them. So\r\nthat, upon the whole, there would be no loss, and the maker of the\r\nnotes would have no gain. Others would find, and nearly all would do\r\nlike you. In a few days the notes would find their way to the Bank in\r\ngreat numbers, where they would all be stopped. The news would spread\r\nabroad. The thieftakers would be busy. Every man who had had his note\r\nstopped at the Bank would alarm his neighbourhood. The country would\r\nring with the news. Nobody would take a bank-note. All business would\r\nbe at a stand. The farmers would sell no corn for bank-notes. The\r\nmillers would have nothing else to pay with. No markets, because no\r\nmoney. The baker would be able to get no flour. He could sell no\r\nbread, for nobody would have money to pay him.\r\n\r\nJack, this thing will assuredly take place. Mind, I tell you so. I\r\nhave been right in my predictions on former occasions; and I am not\r\nwrong now. I beg you to believe me; or, at any rate, to blame yourself\r\nif you lose by such an event. In the midst of this hubbub what will\r\nyou do? Farmer Gripe will, I daresay, give you something to eat for\r\nyour labour. But what will become of your five pounds? That sum you\r\nhave in the Savings Bank, and as you are to have it out at any time\r\nwhen you please, your wife sets off to draw it. The banker gives her a\r\nfive-pound note. She brings it; but nobody will take it of you for a\r\npig, for bread, for clothing, or for anything else! And this, Jack,\r\nwill be the fate of all those who shall be weak enough to put their\r\nmoney into those banks!\r\n\r\nI beg you, Jack, not to rely on the power of the Boroughmongers in\r\nthis case. Anything that is to be done with halters, gags, dungeons,\r\nbayonets, powder, or ball, they can do a great deal at; but they are\r\nnot conjurers; they are not wizards. They cannot prevent a man from\r\ndropping bank-notes in the dark; and they cannot make people believe\r\nin the goodness of that which they must know to be bad. If they could\r\nhold a sword to every man's breast, they might indeed do something;\r\nbut short of this, nothing that they can do would be of any avail.\r\nHowever, the truth is that they, in such case, will have no sword at\r\nall. An army is a powerful weapon; but an army must be paid. Soldiers\r\nhave been called machines; but they are eating and drinking machines.\r\nWith good food and drink they will go far and do much; but without\r\nthem, they will not stir an inch. And in such a case whence is to come\r\nthe money to pay them? In short, Jack, the Boroughmongers would drop\r\ndown dead, like men in an apoplexy, and you would, as soon as things\r\ngot to rights, have your bread and beer and meat and everything in\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\nThe Boroughmongers possess no means of preventing the complete success\r\nof the dropping plan. If they do, they ought to thank me for giving\r\nthem a warning of their danger; and for telling them that if they do\r\nprevent the success of such a plan, they are the cleverest fellows in\r\nthis world.\r\n\r\nI now, Jack, take my leave of you, hoping that you will not be coaxed\r\nout of your money, and assuring you that I am your friend,\r\n\r\nWM. COBBETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--'THE LETTERS OF MALACHI MALAGROWTHER'\r\n\r\nBY SIR WALTER SCOTT\r\n\r\n\r\n(_To what has been said in the Introduction respecting the _Letters of\r\nMalachi Malagrowther_ it is only necessary to add that their immediate\r\ncause was a Bill due to the very commercial crisis which indirectly\r\nruined Scott himself, and introduced in the spring of 1826 for\r\nstopping the note circulation of private banks altogether, while\r\nlimiting that of the Bank of England to notes of £5 and upwards. The\r\nscheme, which was to extend to the whole of Great Britain, was from\r\nthe first unpopular in Scotland, and Scott plunged into the fray. The\r\nletters excited or coincided with such violent opposition throughout\r\nthe country that the Bill was limited to England only. As Scott was a\r\nstrong Tory, his friends in the Government, especially Lord Melville\r\nand Croker (who was officially employed to answer 'Malachi'), were\r\nrather sore at his action. He defended himself in some spirited\r\nprivate letters, which will be found in Lockhart._)\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER ON THE PROPOSED CHANGE OF CURRENCY\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Edinburgh Weekly Journal_\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Journalist--I am by pedigree a discontented person, so\r\nthat you may throw this letter into the fire, if you have any\r\napprehensions of incurring the displeasure of your superiors. I am, in\r\nfact, the lineal descendant of Sir Mungo Malagrowther, who makes a\r\nfigure in the _Fortunes of Nigel_, and have retained a reasonable\r\nproportion of his ill-luck, and, in consequence, of his ill-temper.\r\nIf, therefore, I should chance to appear too warm and poignant in my\r\nobservations, you must impute it to the hasty and peevish humour which\r\nI derive from my ancestor. But, at the same time, it often happens\r\nthat this disposition leads me to speak useful, though unpleasant\r\ntruths, when more prudent men hold their tongues and eat their\r\npudding. A lizard is an ugly and disgusting thing enough; but,\r\nmethinks, if a lizard were to run over my face and awaken me, which is\r\nsaid to be their custom when they observe a snake approach a sleeping\r\nperson, I should neither scorn his intimation, nor feel justifiable\r\nin crushing him to death, merely because he is a filthy little\r\nabridgment of a crocodile. Therefore, 'for my love, I pray you, wrong\r\nme not.'\r\n\r\nI am old, sir, poor, and peevish, and therefore I may be wrong; but\r\nwhen I look back on the last fifteen or twenty years, and more\r\nespecially on the last ten, I think I see my native country of\r\nScotland, if it is yet to be called by a title so discriminative,\r\nfalling, so far as its national, or rather, perhaps, I ought now to\r\nsay its _provincial_, interests are concerned, daily into more\r\nabsolute contempt. Our ancestors were a people of some consideration\r\nin the councils of the empire. So late as my own younger days, an\r\nEnglish minister would have paused, even in a favourite measure, if a\r\nreclamation of national rights had been made by a member for Scotland,\r\nsupported as it uniformly then was, by the voice of her\r\nrepresentatives and her people. Such ameliorations in our peculiar\r\nsystem as were thought necessary, in order that North Britain might\r\nkeep pace with her sister in the advance of improvement, were\r\nsuggested by our own countrymen, persons well acquainted with our\r\npeculiar system of laws (as different from those of England as from\r\nthose of France), and who knew exactly how to adapt the desired\r\nalteration to the principle of our legislative enactments, so that the\r\nwhole machine might, as mechanics say, work well and easily. For a\r\nlong time this wholesome check upon innovation, which requires the\r\nassimilation of a proposed improvement with the general constitution\r\nof the country to which it has been recommended, and which ensures\r\nthat important point, by stipulating that the measure shall originate\r\nwith those to whom the spirit of the constitution is familiar, has\r\nbeen, so far as Scotland is concerned, considerably disused. Those who\r\nhave stepped forward to repair the gradual failure of our\r\nconstitutional system of law, have been persons that, howsoever\r\nqualified in other respects, have had little further knowledge of its\r\nconstruction than could be acquired by a hasty and partial survey,\r\ntaken just before they commenced their labours. Scotland and her laws\r\nhave been too often subjected to the alterations of any person who\r\nchose to found himself a reputation, by bringing in a bill to cure\r\nsome defect which had never been felt in practice, but which was\r\nrepresented as a frightful bugbear to English statesmen, who, wisely\r\nand judiciously tenacious of the legal practice and principles\r\nreceived at home, are proportionally startled at the idea of anything\r\nabroad which cannot be brought to assimilate with them.\r\n\r\nThe English seem to have made a compromise with the active tendency to\r\ninnovation, which is one great characteristic of the day. Wise and\r\nsagacious themselves, they are nervously jealous of innovations in\r\ntheir own laws--_Nolumus leges Angliae mutari_, is written on the\r\nskirts of their judicial robes, as the most sacred texts of Scripture\r\nwere inscribed on the phylacteries of the Rabbis. The belief that the\r\nCommon Law of England constitutes the perfection of human reason, is a\r\nmaxim bound upon their foreheads. Law Monks they have been called in\r\nother respects, and like monks they are devoted to their own Rule, and\r\nadmit no question of its infallibility. There can be no doubt that\r\ntheir love of a system, which, if not perfect, has so much in it that\r\nis excellent, originates in the most praiseworthy feelings. Call it if\r\nyou will the prejudice of education, it is still a prejudice\r\nhonourable in itself, and useful to the public. I only find fault with\r\nit, because, like the Friars in the Duenna monopolising the bottle,\r\nthese English monks will not tolerate in their lay brethren of the\r\nnorth the slightest pretence to a similar feeling.\r\n\r\nIn England, therefore, no innovation can be proposed affecting the\r\nadministration of justice, without being subjected to the strict\r\nenquiry of the Guardians of the Law, and afterwards resisted\r\npertinaciously, until time and the most mature and reiterated\r\ndiscussion shall have proved its utility, nay, its necessity. The old\r\nsaying is still true in all its points--Touch but a cobweb in\r\nWestminster Hall, and the old spider will come out in defence of it.\r\nThis caution may sometimes postpone the adoption of useful\r\namendments, but it operates to prevent all hasty and experimental\r\ninnovations; and it is surely better that existing evils should be\r\nendured for some time longer, than that violent remedies should be\r\nhastily adopted, the unforeseen and unprovided for consequences of\r\nwhich are often so much more extensive than those which had been\r\nforeseen and reckoned upon. An ordinary mason can calculate upon the\r\nexact gap which will be made by the removal of a corner stone in an\r\nold building; but what architect, not intimately acquainted with the\r\nwhole edifice, can presume even to guess how much of the structure is,\r\nor is not, to follow?\r\n\r\nThe English policy in this respect is a wise one, and we have only to\r\nwish they would not insist in keeping it all to themselves. But those\r\nwho are most devoted to their own religion have least sympathy for the\r\nfeelings of dissenters; and a spirit of proselytism has of late shown\r\nitself in England for extending the benefits of their system, in all\r\nits strength and weakness, to a country which has been hitherto\r\nflourishing and contented under its own. They adopted the conclusion\r\nthat all English enactments are right; but the system of municipal law\r\nin Scotland is not English, therefore it is wrong. Under sanction of\r\nthis syllogism, our rulers have indulged and encouraged a spirit of\r\nexperiment and innovation at our expense, which they resist\r\nobstinately when it is to be carried through at their own risk.\r\n\r\nFor more than half of last century, this was a practice not to be\r\nthought of. Scotland was during that period disaffected, in bad\r\nhumour, armed too, and smarting under various irritating\r\nrecollections. This is not the sort of patient for whom an\r\nexperimental legislator chooses to prescribe. There was little chance\r\nof making Saunders take the patent pill by persuasion--main force was\r\na dangerous argument, and some thought claymores had edges.\r\n\r\nThis period passed away, a happier one arrived, and Scotland, no\r\nlonger the object of terror, or at least great uneasiness, to the\r\nBritish Government, was left from the year 1750 under the guardianship\r\nof her own institutions, to win her silent way to national wealth and\r\nconsequence. Contempt probably procured for her the freedom from\r\ninterference, which had formerly been granted out of fear; for the\r\nmedical faculty are as slack in attending the garrets of paupers as\r\nthe caverns of robbers. But neglected as she was, and perhaps\r\n_because_ she was neglected, Scotland, reckoning her progress during\r\nthe space from the close of the American War to the present day, has\r\nincreased her prosperity in a ratio more than five times greater than\r\nthat of her more fortunate and richer sister. She is now worth the\r\nattention of the learned faculty, and God knows she has had plenty of\r\nit. She has been bled and purged, spring and fall, and _talked_ into\r\ncourses of physic, for which she had little occasion. She has been of\r\nlate a sort of experimental farm, upon which every political student\r\nhas been permitted to try his theory--a kind of common property, where\r\nevery juvenile statesman has been encouraged to make his inroads, as\r\nin Moray land, where, anciently, according to the idea of the old\r\nHighlanders, all men had a right to take their prey--a subject in a\r\ncommon dissecting room, left to the scalpel of the junior students,\r\nwith the degrading inscription,--_fiat experimentum in corpore vili_.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to dispute, Sir, that much alteration was necessary in\r\nour laws, and that much benefit has followed many of the great changes\r\nwhich have taken place. I do not mean to deprecate a gradual approach\r\nto the English system, especially in commercial law. The Jury Court,\r\nfor example, was a fair experiment, in my opinion, cautiously\r\nintroduced as such, and placed under such regulations as might best\r\nassimilate its forms with those of the existing Supreme Court. I beg,\r\ntherefore, to be considered as not speaking of the alterations\r\nthemselves, but of the apparent hostility towards our municipal\r\ninstitutions, as repeatedly manifested in the course of late\r\nproceedings, tending to force and wrench them into a similarity with\r\nthose of England.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of our own lawyers, nay, of our Judges, than whom wiser\r\nand more honourable men never held that character, have been, if\r\nreport speaks true, something too much neglected and controlled in the\r\ncourse of these important changes, in which, methinks, they ought to\r\nhave had a leading and primary voice. They have been almost avowedly\r\nregarded not as persons the best qualified to judge of proposed\r\ninnovations, but as prejudiced men, determined to oppose them, right\r\nor wrong. The last public Commission was framed on the very principle,\r\nthat if Scotch lawyers were needs to be employed, a sufficient number\r\nof these should consist of gentlemen, who, whatever their talents and\r\nrespectability might be in other respects, had been too long estranged\r\nfrom the study of Scottish law to retain any accurate recollection of\r\nan abstruse science, or any decided partiality for its technical\r\nforms. This was done avowedly for the purpose of evading the natural\r\npartiality of the Scottish Judges and practitioners to their own\r\nsystem; that partiality which the English themselves hold so sacred a\r\nfeeling in their own Judges and Counsel learned in the law. I am not,\r\nI repeat, complaining of the result of the Commissions, but of the\r\nspirit in which the alterations were undertaken. Unquestionably much\r\nwas done in brushing up and improving the old machinery of Scottish\r\nLaw Courts, and in making it move more rapidly, though scarce, I\r\nthink, more correctly than before. Dispatch has been much attended\r\nto. But it may be ultimately found that the timepiece which runs\r\nfastest does not intimate the hour most accurately. At all events, the\r\nchanges have been made and established--there let them rest. And had\r\nI, Malachi Malagrowther, the sole power to-morrow of doing so, I would\r\nnot restore the old forms of judicial proceedings; because I hold the\r\nconstitution of Courts of Justice too serious matters to be put back\r\nor forward at pleasure, like a boy's first watch, merely for\r\nexperiment's sake.\r\n\r\nWhat I _do_ complain of is the general spirit of slight and dislike\r\nmanifested to our national establishments by those of the sister\r\ncountry who are so very zealous in defending their own; and not less\r\ndo I complain of their jealousy of the opinions of those who cannot\r\nbut be much better acquainted than they, both with the merits and\r\ndeficiencies of the system, which hasty and imperfectly informed\r\njudges have shown themselves so anxious to revolutionise.\r\n\r\nThere is no explanation to be given of this but one--namely, the\r\nentire conviction and belief of our English brethren that the true\r\nThemis is worshipped in Westminster Hall, and that her adorers cannot\r\nbe too zealous in her service; while she, whose image an ingenious\r\nartist has depicted balancing herself upon a _tee-totum_ on the\r\nsouthern window of the Parliament House of Edinburgh, is a mere\r\nidol,--a Diana of Ephesus,--whom her votaries worship, either because\r\nher shrine brings great gain to the craftsmen, or out of an ignorant\r\nand dotard superstition, which induces them to prefer the old Scottish\r\n_Mumpsimus_ to the modern English _Sumpsimus_. Now, this is not fair\r\nconstruction in our friends, whose intentions in our behalf, we allow,\r\nare excellent, but who certainly are scarcely entitled to beg the\r\nquestion at issue without inquiry or discussion, or to treat us as the\r\nSpaniards treated the Indians, whom they massacred for worshipping the\r\nimage of the Sun, while they themselves bowed down to that of the\r\nVirgin Mary. Even Queen Elizabeth was contented with the evasive\r\nanswer of Melville, when hard pressed with the trying question,\r\nwhether Queen Mary or she were the fairest. We are willing, in the\r\nspirit of that answer, to say that the Themis of Westminster Hall is\r\nthe best fitted to preside over the administration of the larger, and\r\nmore fertile country of beef and pudding; while she of the tee-totum\r\n(placed in that precarious position, we presume, to express her\r\ninstability, since these new lights were struck out) claims a more\r\nlimited but equally respectful homage, within her ancient\r\njurisdiction--_sua paupera regna_--the Land of Cakes. If this\r\ncompromise does not appease the ardour of our brethren for converting\r\nus to English forms and fashions, we must use the scriptural question,\r\n\"Who hath required these things at your hands?\"\r\n\r\nThe inquiries and result of another Commission are too much to the\r\npurpose to be suppressed. The object was to investigate the conduct of\r\nthe Revenue Boards in Ireland and Scotland. In the former, it is well\r\nknown, great mismanagement was discovered; for Pat, poor fellow, had\r\nbeen playing the loon to a considerable extent. In Scotland, _not a\r\nshadow of abuse prevailed_. You would have thought, Mr. Journalist,\r\nthat the Irish Boards would have been reformed in some shape, and the\r\nScotch Establishments honourably acquitted, and suffered to continue\r\non the footing of independence which they had so long enjoyed, and of\r\nwhich they had proved themselves so worthy. Not so, sir. The Revenue\r\nBoards, in both countries, underwent exactly the same regulation, were\r\ndeprived of their independent consequence, and placed under the\r\nsuperintendence of English control; the innocent and the guilty being\r\ntreated in every respect alike. Now, on the side of Scotland, this was\r\nlike Trinculo losing his bottle in the pool--there was not only\r\ndishonour in the thing, but an infinite loss.\r\n\r\nI have heard two reasons suggested for this indiscriminating\r\napplication of punishment to the innocent and to the culpable.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it was honestly confessed that Ireland would never\r\nhave quietly submitted to the indignity offered to her, unless poor\r\ninoffensive Scotland had been included in the regulation. The Green\r\nIsle, it seems, was of the mind of a celebrated lady of quality, who,\r\nbeing about to have a decayed tooth drawn, refused to submit to the\r\noperation till she had seen the dentist extract a sound and\r\nserviceable grinder from the jaws of her waiting-woman--and her humour\r\nwas to be gratified. The lady was a termagant dame--the wench a\r\ntame-spirited simpleton--the dentist an obliging operator--and the\r\nteeth of both were drawn accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis gratification of his humours is gained by Pat's being up with the\r\npike and shillelagh on any or no occasion. God forbid Scotland should\r\nretrograde towards such a state--much better that the Deil, as in\r\nBurns's song, danced away with the whole excisemen in the country. We\r\ndo not want to hear her prate of her number of millions of men, and\r\nher old military exploits. We had better remain in union with England,\r\neven at the risk of becoming a subordinate species of Northumberland,\r\nas far as national consequence is concerned, than remedy ourselves by\r\neven hinting the possibility of a rupture. But there is no harm in\r\nwishing Scotland to have just so much ill-nature, according to her own\r\nproverb, as may keep her good-nature from being abused; so much\r\nnational spirit as may determine her to stand by her own rights,\r\nconducting her assertion of them with every feeling of respect and\r\namity toward England.\r\n\r\nThe other reason alleged for this equal distribution of _punishment_,\r\nas if it had been the influence of the common sun, or the general\r\nrain, to the just and the unjust, was one which is extremely\r\npredominant at present with our Ministers--the _necessity_ of\r\n_Uniformity_ in all such cases; and the consideration what an awkward\r\nthing it would be to have a Board of Excise or Customs remaining\r\nindependent in the one country, solely because they had, without\r\nimpeachment, discharged their duty; while the same establishment was\r\ncashiered in another, for no better reason than that it had been\r\nmisused.\r\n\r\nThis reminds us of an incident, said to have befallen at the Castle of\r\nGlammis, when these venerable towers were inhabited by a certain old\r\nEarl of Strathmore, who was as great an admirer of uniformity as the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer could have desired. He and his gardener\r\ndirected all in the garden and pleasure grounds upon the ancient\r\nprinciple of exact correspondence between the different parts, so that\r\neach alley had its brother; a principle which, renounced by gardeners,\r\nis now adopted by statesmen. It chanced once upon a time that a fellow\r\nwas caught committing some petty theft, and, being taken in the\r\nmanner, was sentenced by the Bailie Macwheeble of the jurisdiction to\r\nstand for a certain time in the baronial pillory, called the _jougs_,\r\nbeing a collar and chain, one of which contrivances was attached to\r\neach side of the portal of the great avenue which led to the castle.\r\nThe thief was turned over accordingly to the gardener, as\r\nground-officer, to see the punishment duly inflicted. When the Thane\r\nof Glammis returned from his morning ride, he was surprised to find\r\nboth sides of the gateway accommodated each with a prisoner, like a\r\npair of heraldic supporters, _chained_ and _collared proper_. He asked\r\nthe gardener, whom he found watching the place of punishment, as his\r\nduty required, whether another delinquent had been detected? \"No, my\r\nLord,\" said the gardener, in the tone of a man excellently well\r\nsatisfied with himself,--\"but I thought the single fellow looked very\r\nawkward standing on one side of the gateway, so I gave half a crown to\r\none of the labourers to stand on the other side for _uniformity's\r\nsake_.\" This is exactly a case in point, and probably the only one\r\nwhich can be found--with this sole difference, that I do not hear that\r\nthe members of the Scottish Revenue Board got any boon for standing in\r\nthe pillory with those of Ireland--for uniformity's sake.\r\n\r\nLastly, sir, I come to this business of extending the provisions of\r\nthe Bill prohibiting the issue of notes under five pounds to Scotland,\r\nin six months after the period that the regulation shall be adopted in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nI am not about to enter upon the question which so much agitates\r\nspeculative writers upon the wealth of nations, or attempt to discuss\r\nwhat proportion of the precious metals ought to be detained within a\r\ncountry; what are the best means of keeping it there; or to what\r\nextent the want of specie can be supplied by paper credit: I will not\r\nask if a poor man can be made a rich one, by compelling him to buy a\r\nservice of plate, instead of the delf ware which served his turn.\r\nThese are questions I am not adequate to solve. But I beg leave to\r\nconsider the question in a practical point of view, and to refer\r\nmyself entirely to experience.\r\n\r\nI assume, without much hazard of contradiction, that Banks have\r\nexisted in Scotland for near one hundred and twenty years--that they\r\nhave flourished, and the country has flourished with them--and that\r\nduring the last fifty years particularly, provincial Banks, or\r\nbranches of the principal established and chartered Banks, have\r\ngradually extended themselves in almost every Lowland district in\r\nScotland; that the notes, and especially the small notes, which they\r\ndistribute, entirely supply the demand for a medium of currency; and\r\nthat the system has so completely expelled gold from the country of\r\nScotland, that you never by any chance espy a guinea there, unless in\r\nthe purse of an accidental stranger, or in the coffers of these Banks\r\nthemselves. This is granting the facts of the case as broadly as can\r\nbe asked.\r\n\r\nIt is not less unquestionable that the consequence of this Banking\r\nsystem, as conducted in Scotland, has been attended with the greatest\r\nadvantage to the country. The facility which it has afforded to the\r\nindustrious and enterprising agriculturalist or manufacturer, as well\r\nas to the trustees of the public in executing national works, has\r\nconverted Scotland from a poor, miserable, and barren country, into\r\none, where, if nature has done less, art and industry have done more,\r\nthan in perhaps any country in Europe, England herself not excepted.\r\nThrough means of the credit which this system has afforded, roads have\r\nbeen made, bridges built, and canals dug, opening up to reciprocal\r\ncommunication the most sequestered districts of the country--manufactures\r\nhave been established, unequalled in extent or success--wastes have\r\nbeen converted into productive farms--the productions of the earth for\r\nhuman use have been multiplied twentyfold, while the wealth of the rich\r\nand the comforts of the poor have been extended in the same proportion.\r\nAnd all this in a country where the rigour of the climate, and\r\nsterility of the soil, seem united to set improvement at defiance. Let\r\nthose who remember Scotland forty years since, bear witness if I speak\r\ntruth or falsehood.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that this change has been produced by the facilities\r\nof procuring credit, which the Scottish Banks held forth, both by\r\ndiscounting bills, and by granting cash-accounts. Every undertaking of\r\nconsequence, whether by the public or by individuals, has been carried\r\non by such means; at least exceptions are extremely rare.\r\n\r\nThere is as little doubt that the Banks could not have furnished these\r\nnecessary funds of cash, without enjoying the reciprocal advantage of\r\ntheir own notes being circulated in consequence, and by means of the\r\naccommodation thus afforded. It is not to be expected that every\r\nundertaking which the system enabled speculators or adventurers to\r\ncommence, should be well-judged, attentively carried on, or successful\r\nin issue. Imprudence in some cases, misfortune in others, have had\r\ntheir usual quantity of victims. But in Scotland, as elsewhere, it has\r\nhappened in many instances that improvements, which turned out ruinous\r\nto those who undertook them, have, notwithstanding, themselves\r\nultimately produced the most beneficial advantages to the country,\r\nwhich derived in such instances an addition to its general prosperity,\r\neven from the undertakings which had proved destructive to the private\r\nfortune of the projectors.\r\n\r\nNot only did the Banks dispersed throughout Scotland afford the means\r\nof bringing the country to an unexpected and almost marvellous degree\r\nof prosperity, but in no considerable instance, save one, have their\r\nown over-speculating undertakings been the means of interrupting that\r\nprosperity. The solitary exception was the undertaking called the Ayr\r\nBank, rashly entered into by a large body of country gentlemen and\r\nothers, unacquainted with commercial affairs, and who had moreover the\r\nmisfortune not only to set out on false principles, but to get false\r\nrogues for their principal agents and managers. The fall of this Bank\r\nbrought much calamity on the country; but two things are remarkable in\r\nits history: First, that under its too prodigal, yet beneficial\r\ninfluence, a fine county (that of Ayr) was converted from a desert\r\ninto a fertile land. Secondly, that, though at a distant interval, the\r\nAyr Bank paid all its engagements, and the loss only fell on the\r\noriginal stockholders. The warning was, however, a terrible one, and\r\nhas been so well attended to in Scotland, that very few attempts seem\r\nto have been afterwards made to establish Banks prematurely--that is,\r\nwhere the particular district was not in such an advanced state as to\r\nrequire the support of additional credit; for in every such case, it\r\nwas judiciously foreseen, the forcing a capital on the district could\r\nonly lead to wild speculation, instead of supporting solid and\r\npromising undertakings.\r\n\r\nThe character and condition of the persons pursuing the profession\r\nought to be noticed, however slightly. The Bankers of Scotland have\r\nbeen, generally speaking, _good_ men, in the mercantile phrase,\r\nshowing, by the wealth of which they have died possessed, that their\r\ncredit was sound; and _good_ men also, many of them eminently so, in\r\nthe more extensive and better sense of the word, manifesting, by the\r\nexcellence of their character, the fairness of the means by which\r\ntheir riches were acquired. There may have been, among so numerous a\r\nbody, men of a different character, fishers in troubled waters,\r\ncapitalists who sought gain not by the encouragement of fair trade\r\nand honest industry, but by affording temporary fuel to rashness or\r\navarice. But the number of upright traders in the profession has\r\nnarrowed the means of mischief which such Christian Shylocks would\r\notherwise have possessed. There was loss, there was discredit, in\r\nhaving recourse to such characters, when honest wants could be fairly\r\nsupplied by upright men, and on liberal terms. Such reptiles have been\r\nconfined in Scotland to batten upon their proper prey of folly, and\r\nfeast, like worms, on the corruption in which they are bred.\r\n\r\nSince the period of the Ayr Bank, now near half a century, I recollect\r\nvery few instances of Banking Companies issuing notes which have\r\nbecome insolvent. One, about thirty years since, was the Merchant Bank\r\nof Stirling, which never was in high credit, having been known almost\r\nat the time of its commencement by the odious nickname of _Black in\r\nthe West_. Another was within these ten years, the East Lothian\r\nBanking Company, whose affairs had been very ill conducted by a\r\nvillainous manager. In both cases, the notes were paid up in full. In\r\nthe latter case, they were taken up by one of the most respectable\r\nhouses in Edinburgh; so that all current engagements were paid without\r\nthe least check to the circulation of their notes, or inconvenience to\r\npoor or rich, who happened to have them in possession. The Union Bank\r\nof Falkirk also became insolvent within these fifteen years, but paid\r\nup its engagements without much loss to the creditors. Other cases\r\nthere may have occurred, not coming within my recollection; but I\r\nthink none which made any great sensation, or could at all affect the\r\ngeneral confidence of the country in the stability of the system. None\r\nof these bankruptcies excited much attention, or, as we have seen,\r\ncaused any considerable loss.\r\n\r\nIn the present unhappy commercial distress, I have always heard and\r\nunderstood that the Scottish Banks have done all in their power to\r\nalleviate the evils which came thickening on the country; and far from\r\nacting illiberally, that they have come forward to support the\r\ntottering credit of the commercial world with a frankness which\r\naugured the most perfect confidence in their own resources. We have\r\nheard of only one provincial Bank being even for a moment in the\r\npredicament of suspicion; and of that copartnery the funds and credit\r\nwere so well understood, that their correspondents in Edinburgh, as in\r\nthe case of the East Lothian Bank formerly mentioned, at once\r\nguaranteed the payment of their notes, and saved the public even from\r\nmomentary agitation, and individuals from the possibility of distress.\r\nI ask what must be the stability of a system of credit of which such\r\nan universal earthquake could not displace or shake even the slightest\r\nindividual portion?\r\n\r\nThus stands the case in Scotland; and it is clear any restrictive\r\nenactment affecting the Banking system, or their mode of issuing\r\nnotes, must be adopted in consequence of evils, operating elsewhere\r\nperhaps, but certainly unknown in this country.\r\n\r\nIn England, unfortunately, things have been very different, and the\r\ninsolvency of many provincial Banking Companies, of the most\r\nestablished reputation for stability, has greatly distressed the\r\ncountry, and alarmed London itself, from the necessary reaction of\r\ntheir misfortunes upon their correspondents in the capital.\r\n\r\nI do not think, sir, that the advocate of Scotland is called upon to\r\ngo further, in order to plead an exemption from any experiment which\r\nEngland may think proper to try to cure her own malady, than to say\r\nsuch malady does not exist in her jurisdiction. It is surely enough to\r\nplead, 'We are well, our pulse and complexion prove it--let those who\r\nare sick take physic.' But the opinion of the English Ministers is\r\nwidely different; for, granting our premisses, they deny our\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar humour of a friend, whom I lost some years ago, is the\r\nonly one I recollect, which jumps precisely with the reasoning of the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. My friend was an old Scottish laird, a\r\nbachelor and a humorist--wealthy, convivial, and hospitable, and of\r\ncourse having always plenty of company about him. He had a regular\r\ncustom of swallowing every night in the world one of Dr. Anderson's\r\npills, for which reasons may be readily imagined. But it is not so\r\neasy to account for his insisting on every one of his guests taking\r\nthe same medicine, and whether it was by way of patronising the\r\nmedicine, which is in some sense a national receipt, or whether the\r\nmischievous old wag amused himself with anticipating the scenes of\r\ndelicate embarrassment, which the dispensation sometimes produced in\r\nthe course of the night, I really cannot even guess. What is equally\r\nstrange, he pressed the request with a sort of eloquence which\r\nsucceeded with every guest. No man escaped, though there were few who\r\ndid not make resistance. His powers of persuasion would have been\r\ninvaluable to a minister of state. 'What! not one _Leetle Anderson_,\r\nto oblige your friend, your host, your entertainer! He had taken one\r\nhimself--he would take another, if you pleased--surely what was good\r\nfor his complaint must of course be beneficial to yours?' It was in\r\nvain you pleaded your being perfectly well,--your detesting the\r\nmedicine,--your being certain it would not agree with you--none of the\r\napologies were received as valid. You might be warm, pathetic or\r\nsulky, fretful or patient, grave or serious in testifying your\r\nrepugnance, but you were equally a doomed man; escape was impossible.\r\nYour host was in his turn eloquent,--authoritative,--facetious,\r\n--argumentative,--precatory,--pathetic, above all, pertinacious. No\r\nguest was known to escape the _Leetle Anderson_. The last time I\r\nexperienced the laird's hospitality there were present at the evening\r\nmeal the following catalogue of guests:--a Bond-street dandy, of the most\r\nbrilliant water, drawn thither by the temptation of grouse-shooting--a\r\nwriter from the neighbouring borough (the lairds _doer_, I\r\nbelieve),--two country lairds, men of reserved and stiff habits--three\r\nsheep-farmers, as stiff-necked and stubborn as their own haltered\r\nrams--and I, Malachi Malagrowther, not facile or obvious to persuasion.\r\nThere was also the Esculapius of the vicinity--one who gave, but\r\nelsewhere was never known to _take_ medicine. All succumbed--each took,\r\nafter various degrees of resistance according to his peculiar fashion,\r\nhis own _Leetle Anderson_. The doer took a brace. On the event I\r\nam silent. None had reason to congratulate himself on his complaisance.\r\nThe laird has slept with his ancestors for some years, remembered\r\nsometimes with a smile on account of his humorous eccentricities, always\r\nwith a sigh when his surviving friends and neighbours reflect on his\r\nkindliness and genuine beneficence. I have only to add that I hope he\r\nhas not bequeathed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, otherwise so\r\nhighly gifted, his invincible powers of persuading folks to take\r\nmedicine, which their constitutions do not require.\r\n\r\nHave I argued my case too high in supposing that the present intended\r\nlegislative enactment is as inapplicable to Scotland as a pair of\r\nelaborate knee-buckles would be to the dress of a kilted Highlander? I\r\nthink not.\r\n\r\nI understand Lord Liverpool and the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\ndistinctly to have admitted the fact, that no distress whatever had\r\noriginated in Scotland from the present issuing of small notes of the\r\nbankers established there, whether provincial in the strict sense, or\r\nsent abroad by branches of the larger establishments settled in the\r\nmetropolis. No proof can be desired better than the admission of the\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we have been positively informed by the newspapers that\r\nMinisters see no reason why any law adopted on this subject should not\r\nbe imperative over all his Majesty's dominions, including Scotland,\r\n_for uniformity's sake_. In my opinion they might as well make a law\r\nthat the Scotsman, for uniformity's sake, should not eat oatmeal,\r\nbecause it is found to give Englishmen the heartburn. If an ordinance\r\nprohibiting the oatcake, can be accompanied with a regulation capable\r\nof being enforced, that in future, for uniformity's sake, our moors\r\nand uplands shall henceforth bear the purest wheat, I for one have no\r\nobjection to the regulation. But till Ben Nevis be level with\r\nNorfolkshire, though the natural wants of the two nations may be the\r\nsame, the extent of these wants, natural or commercial, and the mode\r\nof supplying them, must be widely different, let the rule of\r\nuniformity be as absolute as it will. The nation which cannot raise\r\nwheat, must be allowed to eat oat-bread; the nation which is too poor\r\nto retain a circulating medium of the precious metals, must be\r\npermitted to supply its place with paper credit; otherwise, they must\r\ngo without food, and without currency.\r\n\r\nIf I were called on, Mr. Journalist, I think I could give some reasons\r\nwhy the system of banking which has been found well adapted for\r\nScotland is not proper for England, and why there is no reason for\r\ninflicting upon us the intended remedy; in other words, why this\r\npolitical balsam of Fierabras which is to relieve Don Quixote, may\r\nhave a great chance to poison Sancho. With this view, I will mention\r\nbriefly some strong points of distinction affecting the comparative\r\ncredit of the banks in England and in Scotland; and they seem to\r\nfurnish, to one inexperienced in political economies (upon the\r\ntranscendental doctrines of which so much stress is now laid), very\r\nsatisfactory reasons for the difference which is not denied to exist\r\nbetwixt the effects of the same general system in different countries.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, almost all Banking Companies consist of a considerable\r\nnumber of persons, many of them men of landed property, whose landed\r\nestates, with the burthens legally affecting them, may be learned from\r\nthe records, for the expense of a few shillings; so that all the\r\nworld knows, or may know, the general basis on which their credit\r\nrests, and the extent of real property, which, independent of their\r\npersonal means, is responsible for their commercial engagements. In\r\nmost banking establishments this fund of credit is considerable, in\r\nothers immense; especially in those where the shares are numerous, and\r\nare held in small proportions, many of them by persons of landed\r\nestates, whose fortunes, however large, and however small their share\r\nof stock, must all be liable to the engagements of the Bank. In\r\nEngland, as I believe, the number of the partners engaged in a banking\r\nconcern cannot exceed five; and though of late years their landed\r\nproperty has been declared subject to be attacked by their commercial\r\ncreditors, yet no one can learn, without incalculable trouble, the\r\nreal value of that land, or with what mortgages it is burthened. Thus,\r\n_cæteris paribus_, the English banker cannot make his solvency\r\nmanifest to the public, therefore cannot expect, or receive, the same\r\nunlimited trust, which is willingly and securely reposed in those of\r\nthe same profession in Scotland.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the circulation of the Scottish bank-notes is free and\r\nunlimited; an advantage arising from their superior degree of credit.\r\nThey pass without a shadow of objection through the whole limits of\r\nScotland, and, though they cannot be legally tendered, are current\r\nnearly as far as York in England. Those of English Banking Companies\r\nseldom extend beyond a very limited horizon: in two or three stages\r\nfrom the place where they are issued, many of them are objected to,\r\nand give perpetual trouble to any traveller who has happened to take\r\nthem in change on the road. Even the most creditable provincial notes\r\nnever approach London in a free tide--never circulate like blood to\r\nthe heart, and from thence to the extremities, but are current within\r\na limited circle; often, indeed, so very limited, that the notes\r\nissued in the morning, to use an old simile, fly out like pigeons from\r\nthe dovecot, and are sure to return in the evening to the spot which\r\nthey have left at break of day.\r\n\r\nOwing to these causes, and others which I forbear mentioning, the\r\nprofession of provincial Bankers in England is limited in its regular\r\nprofits, and uncertain in its returns, to a degree unknown in\r\nScotland; and is, therefore, more apt to be adopted in the South by\r\nmen of sanguine hopes and bold adventure (both frequently\r\ndisproportioned to the extent of their capital), who sink in mines or\r\nother hazardous speculations the funds which their banking credit\r\nenables them to command, and deluge the country with notes, which, on\r\nsome unhappy morning, are found not worth a penny--as those to whom\r\nthe foul fiend has given apparent treasures are said in due time to\r\ndiscover they are only pieces of slate.\r\n\r\nI am aware it may be urged that the restrictions imposed on those\r\nEnglish provincial Banks are necessary to secure the supremacy of the\r\nBank of England; on the same principle on which dogs, kept near the\r\npurlieus of a royal forest, were anciently lamed by the cutting off of\r\none of the claws, to prevent their interfering with the royal sport.\r\nThis is a very good regulation for England, for what I know; but why\r\nshould the Scottish institutions, which do not, and cannot interfere\r\nwith the influence of the Bank of England, be put on a level with\r\nthose of which such jealousy is, justly or unjustly, entertained? We\r\nreceive no benefit from that immense establishment, which, like a\r\ngreat oak, overshadows England from Tweed to Cornwall. Why should our\r\nnational plantations be cut down or cramped for the sake of what\r\naffords us neither shade nor shelter, and which, besides, can take no\r\nadvantage by the injury done to us? Why should we be subjected to a\r\nmonopoly from which we derive no national benefit?\r\n\r\nI have only to add that Scotland has not felt the slightest\r\ninconvenience from the want of specie, nay, that it has never been in\r\nrequest among them. A tradesman will take a guinea more unwillingly\r\nthan a note of the same value--to the peasant the coin is unknown. No\r\none ever wishes for specie save when upon a journey to England. In\r\noccasional runs upon particular houses, the notes of other Banking\r\nCompanies have always been the value asked for--no holder of these\r\nnotes ever demanded specie. The credit of one establishment might be\r\ndoubted for the time--that of the general system was never brought\r\ninto question. Even avarice, the most suspicious of passions, has in\r\nno instance I ever heard of, desired to compose her hoards by an\r\naccumulation of the precious metals. The confidence in the credit of\r\nour ordinary medium has not been doubted even in the dreams of the\r\nmost irritable and jealous of human passions.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations are so obvious that a statesman so acute as\r\nMr. Robinson must have taken them in at the first glance, and must at\r\nthe same time have deemed them of no weight, compared with the\r\nnecessary conformity between the laws of the two kingdoms. I must,\r\ntherefore, speak to the justice of this point of uniformity.\r\n\r\nSir, my respected ancestor, Sir Mungo, when he had the distinguished\r\nhonour to be _whipping_, or rather _whipped boy_, to his Majesty King\r\nJames the Sixth of gracious memory, was always, in virtue of his\r\noffice, scourged when the king deserved flogging; and the same\r\nequitable rule seems to distinguish the conduct of Government towards\r\nScotland, as one of the three United Kingdoms. If Pat is guilty of\r\npeculation, Sister Peg loses her Boards of Revenue--if John Bull's\r\ncashiers mismanage his money-matters, those who have conducted Sister\r\nMargaret's to their own great honour, and her no less advantage, must\r\nbe deprived of the power of serving her in future; at least that power\r\nmust be greatly restricted and limited.\r\n\r\n     'Quidquid delirant reges plectuntur Achivi.'\r\n\r\nThat is to say, if our superiors of England and Ireland eat sour\r\ngrapes, the Scottish teeth must be set on edge as well as their own.\r\nAn uniformity in benefits may be well--an uniformity in penal\r\nmeasures, towards the innocent and the guilty, in prohibitory\r\nregulations, whether necessary or not, seems harsh law, and worse\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nThis levelling system, not equitable in itself, is infinitely unjust,\r\nif a story, often told by my poor old grandfather, was true, which I\r\nown I am inclined to doubt. The old man, sir, had learned in his\r\nyouth, or dreamed in his dotage, that Scotland had become an integral\r\npart of England,--not in right of conquest, or rendition, or through\r\nany right of inheritance--but in virtue of a solemn Treaty of Union.\r\nNay, so distinct an idea had he of this supposed Treaty, that he used\r\nto recite one of its articles to this effect:--'That the laws in use\r\nwithin the kingdom of Scotland, do, after the Union, remain in the\r\nsame force as before, but alterable by the Parliament of Great\r\nBritain, with this difference between the laws concerning public\r\nright, policy, and civil government, and those which concern private\r\nright, that the former may be made the same through the whole United\r\nKingdom; but that no alteration be made on laws which concern private\r\nright, _excepting for the evident utility of the subjects within\r\nScotland_.' When the old gentleman came to the passage, which you will\r\nmark in italics, he always clenched his fist, and exclaimed, 'Nemo me\r\nimpune lacessit!' which, I presume, are words belonging to the black\r\nart, since there is no one in the Modern Athens conjuror enough to\r\nunderstand their meaning, or at least to comprehend the spirit of the\r\nsentiment which my grandfather thought they conveyed.\r\n\r\nI cannot help thinking, sir, that if there had been any truth in my\r\ngrandfather's story, some Scottish member would, on the late occasion,\r\nhave informed the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that, in virtue of this\r\nTreaty, it was no sufficient reason for innovating upon the private\r\nrights of Scotsmen in a most tender and delicate point, merely that\r\nthe Right Honourable Gentleman saw no reason why the same law should\r\nnot be current through the whole of his Majesty's dominions; and that,\r\non the contrary, it was incumbent upon him to go a step further, and\r\nto show that the alteration proposed _was_ for the EVIDENT UTILITY _of\r\nthe subjects within Scotland_,--a proposition disavowed by the Right\r\nHonourable Gentleman's candid admission, as well as by that of the\r\nPrime Minister, and contradicted in every circumstance by the actual\r\nstate of the case.\r\n\r\nMethinks, sir, our 'Chosen Five and Forty,' supposing they had bound\r\nthemselves to Ministers by such oaths of silence and obedience as are\r\ntaken by Carthusian friars, must have had free-will and speech to\r\nexpress their sentiments, had they been possessed of so irrefragable\r\nan argument in such a case of extremity. The sight of a father's life\r\nin danger is said to have restored the power of language to the dumb;\r\nand truly, the necessary defence of the rights of our native country\r\nis not, or at least ought not to be, a less animating motive. Lord\r\nLauderdale almost alone interfered, and procured, to his infinite\r\nhonour, a delay of six months in the extension of this act,--a sort of\r\nreprieve from the southern _jougs_,--by which we may have some chance\r\nof profiting, if, during the interval, we can show ourselves true\r\nScotsmen, by some better proof than merely by being 'wise behind the\r\nhand.'\r\n\r\nIn the first place, sir, I would have this old Treaty searched for,\r\nand should it be found to be still existing, I think it decides the\r\nquestion. For, how can it be possible that it should be for the\r\n'evident utility' of Scotland to alter her laws of private right, to\r\nthe total subversion of a system under which she is admitted to have\r\nflourished for a century, and which has never within North Britain\r\nbeen attended with the inconveniences charged against it in the sister\r\ncountry, where, by the way, it never existed? Even if the old\r\nparchment should be voted obsolete, there would be some satisfaction\r\nin having it looked out and preserved--not in the Register-Office, or\r\nAdvocates' Library, where it might awaken painful recollections--but\r\nin the Museum of the Antiquaries, where, with the Solemn League and\r\nCovenant, the Letter of the Scottish Nobles to the Pope on the\r\nindependence of their country, and other antiquated documents, once\r\nheld in reverence, it might silently contract dust, yet remain to bear\r\nwitness that such things had been.\r\n\r\nI earnestly hope, however, that an international league of such\r\nimportance may still be found obligatory on both the _high_ and the\r\n_low_ contracting parties; on that which has the power, and apparently\r\nthe will, to break it, as well as on the weaker nation, who cannot,\r\nwithout incurring still worse, and more miserable consequences, oppose\r\naggression, otherwise than by invoking the faith of treaties, and the\r\nnational honour of Old England.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, all ranks and bodies of men in North Britain (for\r\nall are concerned, the poor as well as the rich) should express by\r\npetition their sense of the injustice which is offered to the country,\r\nand the distress which will probably be the necessary consequence.\r\nWithout the power of issuing their own notes the Banks cannot supply\r\nthe manufacturer with that credit which enables him to pay his\r\nworkmen, and wait his return; or accommodate the farmer with that\r\nfund which makes it easy for him to discharge his rent, and give wages\r\nto his labourers, while in the act of performing expensive operations\r\nwhich are to treble or quadruple the produce of his farm. The trustees\r\non the high-roads and other public works, so ready to stake their\r\npersonal credit for carrying on public improvements, will no longer\r\npossess the power of raising funds by doing so. The whole existing\r\nstate of credit is to be altered from top to bottom, and Ministers are\r\nsilent on any remedy which such a state of things would imperiously\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nThese are subjects worth struggling for, and rather of more importance\r\nthan generally come before County Meetings. The English legislature\r\nseems inclined to stultify our Law Authorities in their department;\r\nbut let us at least try if they will listen to the united voice of a\r\nNation in matters which so intimately concern its welfare, that almost\r\nevery man must have formed a judgment on the subject, from something\r\nlike personal experience. For my part, I cannot doubt the result.\r\n\r\nTimes are undoubtedly different from those of Queen Anne, when, Dean\r\nSwift having in a political pamphlet passed some sarcasms on the\r\nScottish nation, as a poor and fierce people, the Scythians of\r\nBritain,--the Scottish peers, headed by the Duke of Argyll, went in\r\na body to the ministers, and compelled them to disown the sentiments\r\nwhich had been expressed by their partisan, and offer a reward of\r\nthree hundred pounds for the author of the libel, well known to be the\r\nbest advocate and most intimate friend of the existing administration.\r\nThey demanded also that the printer and publisher should be prosecuted\r\nbefore the House of Peers; and Harley, however unwillingly, was\r\nobliged to yield to their demand.\r\n\r\nIn the celebrated case of Porteous, the English legislature saw\r\nthemselves compelled to desist from vindictive measures, on account of\r\na gross offence committed in the metropolis of Scotland. In that of\r\nthe Roman Catholic bill they yielded to the voice of the Scottish\r\npeople, or rather of the Scottish mob, and declared the proposed\r\nalteration of the law should not extend to North Britain. The cases\r\nwere different, in point of merit, though the Scots were successful in\r\nboth. In the one, a boon of clemency was extorted; in the other,\r\nconcession was an act of decided weakness. But ought the present\r\nadministration of Great Britain to show less deference to our\r\ntemperate and general remonstrance on a matter concerning ourselves\r\nonly, than their predecessors did to the passions, and even the\r\nill-founded and unjust prejudices, of our ancestors?\r\n\r\nTimes, indeed, have changed since those days, and circumstances also.\r\nWe are no longer a poor, that is, so _very poor_ a country and\r\npeople; and as we have increased in wealth, we have become somewhat\r\npoorer in spirit, and more loath to incur displeasure by contests upon\r\nmere etiquette, or national prejudice. But we have some grounds to\r\nplead for favour with England. We have borne our pecuniary impositions\r\nduring a long war, with a patience the more exemplary, as they lay\r\nheavier on us from our comparative want of means--our blood has flowed\r\nas freely as that of England or of Ireland--our lives and fortunes\r\nhave become unhesitatingly devoted to the defence of the empire--our\r\nloyalty as warmly and willingly displayed towards the person of our\r\nSovereign. We have consented with submission, if not with\r\ncheerfulness, to reductions and abolitions of public offices, required\r\nfor the good of the state at large, but which must affect materially\r\nthe condition, and even the respectability, of our overburthened\r\naristocracy. We have in every respect conducted ourselves as good and\r\nfaithful subjects of the general empire.\r\n\r\nWe do not boast of these things as actual merits; but they are at\r\nleast duties discharged, and in an appeal to men of honour and of\r\njudgment, must entitle us to be heard with patience, and even\r\ndeference, on the management of our own affairs, if we speak\r\nunanimously, lay aside party feeling, and use the voice of one leaf of\r\nthe holy Trefoil,--one distinct and component part of the United\r\nKingdoms.\r\n\r\nLet no consideration deter us from pleading our own cause temperately\r\nbut firmly, and we shall certainly receive a favourable audience. Even\r\nour acquisition of a little wealth, which might abate our courage on\r\nother occasions, should invigorate us to unanimous perseverance at the\r\npresent crisis, when the very source of our national prosperity is\r\ndirectly, though unwittingly, struck at. Our plaids are, I trust, not\r\nyet sunk into Jewish gaberdines, to be wantonly spit upon; nor are we\r\nyet bound to 'receive the insult with a patient shrug.' But exertion\r\nis now demanded on other accounts than those of mere honourable\r\npunctilio. Misers themselves will struggle in defence of their\r\nproperty, though tolerant of all aggressions by which that is not\r\nthreatened. Avarice herself, however mean-spirited, will rouse to\r\ndefend the wealth she possesses, and preserve the means of gaining\r\nmore. Scotland is now called upon to rally in defence of the sources\r\nof her national improvement, and the means of increasing it; upon\r\nwhich, as none are so much concerned in the subject, none can be such\r\ncompetent judges as Scotsmen themselves.\r\n\r\nI cannot believe so generous a people as the English, so wise an\r\nadministration as the present, will disregard our humble\r\nremonstrances, merely because they are made in the form of peaceful\r\nentreaty, and not _secundum perfervidum ingenium Scotorum_, with\r\n'durk and pistol at our belt.' It would be a dangerous lesson to teach\r\nthe empire at large, that threats can extort what is not yielded to\r\nreasonable and respectful remonstrance.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. The principle of 'uniformity of laws,' if not\r\nmanfully withstood, may have other blessings in store for us. Suppose,\r\nthat when finished with blistering Scotland when in perfect health,\r\nEngland should find time and courage to withdraw the veil from the\r\ndeep cancer which is gnawing her own bowels, and make an attempt to\r\nstop the fatal progress of her _poor-rates_. Some system or other must\r\nbe proposed in its place--a grinding one it must be, for it is not an\r\nevil to be cured by palliatives. Suppose the English, for uniformity's\r\nsake, insist that Scotland, which is at present free from this foul\r\nand shameful disorder, should nevertheless be included in the severe\r\n_treatment_ which the disease demands, how would the landholders of\r\nScotland like to undergo the scalpel and cautery, merely because\r\nEngland requires to be scarified?\r\n\r\nOr again;--Supposing England should take a fancy to impart to us her\r\nsanguinary criminal code, which, too cruel to be carried into effect,\r\ngives every wretch that is condemned a chance of one to twelve that he\r\nshall not be executed, and so turns the law into a lottery--would this\r\nbe an agreeable boon to North Britain?\r\n\r\nOnce more;--What if the English ministers should feel disposed to\r\nextend to us their equitable system of process respecting civil debt,\r\nwhich divides the advantages so admirably betwixt debtor and\r\ncreditor--_That_ equal dispensation of justice, which provides that an\r\nimprisoned debtor, if a rogue, may remain in undisturbed possession of\r\na great landed estate, and enjoy in a jail all the luxuries of\r\nSardanapalus, while the wretch to whom he owes money is starving; and\r\nthat, to balance the matter, a creditor, if cruel, may detain a debtor\r\nin prison for a lifetime, and make, as the established phrase goes,\r\n_dice of his bones_--would this admirable reciprocity of privilege,\r\nindulged alternately to knave and tyrant, please Saunders better than\r\nhis own humane action of Cessio, and his equitable process of\r\nAdjudication?\r\n\r\nI will not insist further on such topics, for I daresay that these\r\napparent enormities in principle are, in England where they have\r\noperation, modified and corrected in practice by circumstances unknown\r\nto me; so that, in passing judgment on them, I may myself fall into\r\nthe error I deprecate, of judging of foreign laws without being aware\r\nof all the premisses. Neither do I mean that we should struggle with\r\nilliberality against any improvements which can be borrowed from\r\nEnglish principle. I would only desire that such ameliorations were\r\nadopted, not merely because they are English, but because they are\r\nsuited to be assimilated with the laws of Scotland, and lead, in\r\nshort, _to her evident utility_; and this on the principle, that in\r\ntransplanting a tree, little attention need be paid to the character\r\nof the climate and soil from which it is brought, although the\r\ngreatest care must be taken that those of the situation to which it is\r\ntransplanted are fitted to receive it. It would be no reason for\r\nplanting mulberry-trees in Scotland, that they luxuriate in the south\r\nof England. There is sense in the old proverb, 'Ilk land has its ain\r\nlauch.'\r\n\r\nIn the present case, it is impossible to believe the extension of\r\nthese restrictions to Scotland can be for the _evident utility_ of the\r\ncountry, which has prospered so long and so uniformly under directly\r\nthe contrary system.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable I may be deemed illiberal in all this reasoning;\r\nbut if to look for information to practical results, rather than to\r\ntheoretical principles, and to argue from the effect of the experience\r\nof a century, rather than the deductions of a modern hypothesis, be\r\nilliberal, I must sit down content with a censure, which will include\r\nwiser men than I. The philosophical tailors of Laputa, who wrought by\r\nmathematical calculation, had, no doubt, a supreme contempt for those\r\nhumble fashioners who went to work by measuring the person of their\r\ncustomer; but Gulliver tells us, that the worst clothes he ever wore,\r\nwere constructed upon abstract principles; and truly, I think, we have\r\nseen some laws, and may see more, not much better adapted to existing\r\ncircumstances, than the Captain's philosophical uniform to his actual\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that every wise statesman keeps sound and general\r\npolitical principles in his eye, as the pilot looks upon his compass\r\nto discover his true course. But this true course cannot always be\r\nfollowed out straight and diametrically; it must be altered from time\r\nto time, nay sometimes apparently abandoned, on account of shoals,\r\nbreakers, and headlands, not to mention contrary winds. The same\r\nobstacles occur to the course of the statesman. The point at which he\r\naims may be important, the principle on which he steers may be just;\r\nyet the obstacles arising from rooted prejudices, from intemperate\r\npassions, from ancient practices, from a different character of\r\npeople, from varieties in climate and soil, may cause a direct\r\nmovement upon his ultimate object to be attended with distress to\r\nindividuals, and loss to the community, which no good man would wish\r\nto occasion, and with dangers which no wise man would voluntarily\r\nchoose to encounter.\r\n\r\nAlthough I think the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been rather\r\nprecipitate in the decided opinion which he is represented to have\r\nexpressed on this occasion, I am far from entertaining the slightest\r\ndisrespect for the right honourable gentleman. 'I hear as good\r\nexclamation upon him as on any man in Messina, and though I am but a\r\npoor man, I am glad to hear it.' But a decided attachment to abstract\r\nprinciple, and to a spirit of generalising, is--like a rash rider on a\r\nheadstrong horse--very apt to run foul of local obstacles, which might\r\nhave been avoided by a more deliberate career, where the nature of the\r\nground had been previously considered.\r\n\r\nI make allowance for the temptation natural to an ingenious and active\r\nmind. There is a natural pride in following out an universal and\r\nlevelling principle. It seems to augur genius, force of conception,\r\nand steadiness of purpose; qualities which every legislator is\r\ndesirous of being thought to possess. On the other hand, the study of\r\nlocal advantages and impediments demands labour and inquiry, and is\r\nrewarded after all only with the cold and parsimonious praise due to\r\nhumble industry. It is no less true, however, that measures which go\r\nstraight and direct to a great general object, without noticing\r\nintervening impediments, must often resemble the fierce progress of\r\nthe thunderbolt or the cannon-ball, those dreadful agents, which, in\r\nrushing right to their point, care not what ruin they make by the way.\r\nThe sounder and more moderate policy, accommodating its measures to\r\nexterior circumstances, rather resembles the judicious course of a\r\nwell-conducted highway, which, turning aside frequently from its\r\ndirect course,\r\n\r\n    'Winds round the corn-field and the hill of vines,'\r\n\r\nand becomes devious, that it may respect property and avoid obstacles;\r\nthus escaping even temporary evils, and serving the public no less in\r\nits more circuitous, than it would have done in its direct course.\r\n\r\nCan you tell me, sir, if this _uniformity_ of civil institutions,\r\nwhich calls for such sacrifices, be at all descended from, or related\r\nto, a doctrine nearly of the same nature, called Conformity in\r\nreligious doctrine, very fashionable about one hundred and fifty years\r\nsince, which undertook to unite the jarring creeds of the United\r\nKingdom to one common standard, and excited a universal strife by the\r\nvain attempt, and a thousand fierce disputes, in which she\r\n\r\n        '----umpire sate,\r\n    And by decision more embroiled the fray'?\r\n\r\nShould Uniformity have the same pedigree, Malachi Malagrowther\r\nproclaims her 'a hawk of a very bad nest.'\r\n\r\nThe universal opinion of a whole kingdom, founded upon a century's\r\nexperience, ought not to be lightly considered as founded in ignorance\r\nand prejudice. I am something of an agriculturist; and in travelling\r\nthrough the country I have often had occasion to wonder that the\r\ninhabitants of particular districts had not adopted certain obvious\r\nimprovements in cultivation. But, upon inquiry, I have usually found\r\nout that appearances had deceived me, and that I had not reckoned on\r\nparticular local circumstances, which either prevented the execution\r\nof the system I should have theoretically recommended, or rendered\r\nsome other more advantageous in the particular circumstances.\r\n\r\nI do not therefore resist theoretical innovation in general; I only\r\nhumbly desire it may not outrun the suggestions arising from the\r\nexperience of ages. I would have the necessity felt and acknowledged\r\nbefore old institutions are demolished--the _evident utility_ of every\r\nalteration demonstrated before it is adopted upon mere speculation. I\r\nsubmit our ancient system to the primary knife of the legislature, but\r\nwould not willingly see our reformers employ a weapon, which, like the\r\nsword of Jack the Giant-Killer, _cuts before the point_.\r\n\r\nIt is always to be considered, that in human affairs, the very best\r\nimaginable result is seldom to be obtained, and that it is wise to\r\ncontent ourselves with the best which can be got. This principle\r\nspeaks with a voice of thunder against violent innovation, for the\r\nsake of possible improvement, where things are already well. We ought\r\nnot to desire better bread than is made of wheat. Our Scotch proverb\r\nwarns us to _Let weel bide_; and all the world has heard of the\r\nuntranslatable Italian epitaph upon the man, who died of taking physic\r\nto make him better, when he was already in health.--I am, Mr.\r\nJournalist, yours,\r\n\r\nMALACHI MALAGROWTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT\r\n\r\n\r\nSince writing these hasty thoughts, I hear it reported that we are to\r\nhave an extension of our precarious reprieve, and that our six months\r\nare to be extended to six years. I would not have Scotland trust to\r\nthis hollow truce. The measure ought, like all others, to be canvassed\r\non its merits, and frankly admitted or rejected; it has been stirred\r\nand ought to be decided. I request my countrymen not to be soothed\r\ninto inactivity by that temporising, and, I will say, unmanly\r\nvacillation. Government is pledged to nothing by taking an open\r\ncourse; for if the bill, so far as applicable to Scotland, is at\r\npresent absolutely laid aside, there can be no objection to their\r\nresuming it at any period, when from change of circumstances, it may\r\nbe advantageous to Scotland, and when, for what I know, it may be\r\nwelcomed as a boon.\r\n\r\nBut if held over our heads as a minatory measure, to take place within\r\na certain period, what can the event be but to cripple and ultimately\r\ndestroy the present system, on which a direct attack is found at\r\npresent inexpedient? Can the bankers continue to conduct their\r\nprofession on the same secure footing, with an abrogation of it in\r\nprospect? Must it not cease to be what it has hitherto been--a\r\nbusiness carried on both for their own profit, and for the\r\naccommodation of the country? Instead of employing their capital in\r\nthe usual channels, must they not in self-defence employ it in forming\r\nothers? Will not the substantial and wealthy withdraw their funds from\r\nthat species of commerce? And may not the place of these be supplied\r\nby men of daring adventure, without corresponding capital, who will\r\ntake a chance of wealth or ruin in the chances of the game?\r\n\r\nIf it is the absolute and irrevocable determination that the bill is\r\nto be extended to us, the sooner the great penalty is inflicted the\r\nbetter; for in politics and commerce, as in all the other affairs of\r\nlife, absolute and certain evil is better than uncertainty and\r\nprotracted suspense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: I have added the pamphlet headings, since the\r\noriginal page numbers are not helpful.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. LETTER TO A DISSENTER.\r\n\r\n_The exclusion_--of James from the succession.\r\n\r\n_The rebellion_--Monmouth's.\r\n\r\n_The Quakers_.--A hit, of course, at Penn.\r\n\r\n_Piqueer_, 'do outpost duty,' 'raid.'\r\n\r\n_Lords of the Articles_.--A well-known body in the older Scottish\r\nConstitution, through whom only legislation could be originated, and who\r\nthus almost nullified the powers of Parliament.\r\n\r\n_Squeaziness_ = 'squeamishness,' 'queasiness.'\r\n\r\n_It is impossible_.--Another form of 'No bishop no king.'\r\n\r\n_The new converts_.--After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\r\n\r\n_T.W._ is, of course, a mere fancy signature. It might stand for\r\n'True Wellwisher' or anything. The wiseacres took it as ='W.T.,' William\r\nTemple.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SHORTEST WAY WITH THE DISSENTERS.\r\n\r\n_Neither_, for 'too,' is colloquial but rather picturesque. Cf. the\r\nfamous 'And yet but yaw neither' in _Hamlet_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE DRAPIER'S LETTERS.\r\n\r\nI have not thought it desirable to reproduce the abundance of italics\r\nwith which the original is furnished. They no doubt appealed to the\r\nvulgar, as where poor Mr. Wood is described as '_a mean ordinary man,\r\na hard-ware dealer_.' But the vigour of the onslaught is wholly\r\nindependent of them.\r\n\r\n_Written_--by Swift himself.\r\n\r\n_Bere_, or 'bear,' also 'bigg,' a kind of barley largely cultivated\r\nin Ireland, Scotland, and Northern England. It has six rows in the ear,\r\nand will grow in much poorer ground and a much damper and rougher\r\nclimate than the two-rowed variety. It is also, I believe, still thought\r\nto give the best whisky, if not the best beer, when malted.\r\n\r\n_Conolly_.--Speaker of the Irish House of Commons.\r\n\r\n_Pistole_--about ten shillings.\r\n\r\n_Brought to the bullion_ seems here to have the meaning of the\r\nFrench _billonner_ or _envoyer au billon_, 'to melt for recoining.'\r\n\r\n_Our Cæsar's statue_.--The statue of George I. on Essex Bridge,\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. SECOND LETTER ON A REGICIDE PEACE.\r\n\r\n_Contignation_.--This rather pedantic, and now, I think, quite\r\nobsolete word (from _tignum_, 'beam') means 'having a common or\r\ncontinuous roof.'\r\n\r\nThe slackness of England in taking advantage of the Vendéan and Chouan\r\nmovements, of which Burke here complains, has never been fully\r\nexplained. The poltroonery of the Bourbon princes, and the factions of\r\nthe emigrants, throw a certain but not a complete light on it; and\r\nthough conjectural explanations are obvious enough, there is little\r\npositive evidence to support them.\r\n\r\n_But when the possibility ... that the_.--It will probably seem\r\nto a modern reader that either 'that' or 'the' has crept in improperly.\r\nIt might be so; but Burke still maintained the authoritative but rather\r\ninelegant tradition by which 'that,' like the French _que_, could\r\nreplace any such antecedent word as 'when,' 'because,' etc.\r\n\r\n_Louis the Sixteenth_.--To this is appended a note in the editions\r\nbeginning, 'It may be right to do justice to Louis XVI. He did what he\r\ncould to destroy the double diplomacy of France.' The subject has of\r\nlate years received considerable illustration in the Duke of Broglie's\r\n_Le Secret du Roi_, and other works by the same author.\r\n\r\n_Montalembert_.--Marc René, Marquis de (1714-1800), a voluminous\r\nmilitary writer.\r\n\r\n_Harrington_--of the _Oceana_.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. PETER PLYMLEY'S LETTERS.\r\n\r\n_Dear Abraham_.--'Peter Plymley' addresses his _Letters_ to\r\n'my brother Abraham, who lives in the country,' and is a\r\nparson.\r\n\r\n_Baron Maseres_.--Cursitor Baron of the Exchequer, a descendant\r\nof Huguenots, very well thought of by his contemporaries. Dr. Rennel I\r\nknow not, unless he was the Herodotus man.\r\n\r\n_C----_, Canning.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Duigenan_.--A delightful person who, in his hot youth, as a\r\njunior Fellow of T.C., D., threatened to 'bulge the Provost's' [Provost\r\nHely Hutchinson's] 'eye,' and was afterwards a pillar of Protestantism.\r\n\r\nThis _light and frivolous jester_ was _not_ the Rev. Sydney\r\nSmith, but George Canning, Esq.\r\n\r\n_The pecuniary Rose_.--'Old George' Rose, Pitt's right hand. He\r\nwas rather heavily rewarded with places and pensions; but even Liberals\r\nnow admit that the country has hardly had an abler official.\r\n\r\n_Lord Hawkesbury_, Jenkinson, better known as Lord Liverpool.\r\n\r\n_Tickell_--the _Rolliad_ Tickell.\r\n\r\n_Joel_--Peter's nephew and Abraham's son.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. LETTER TO THE JOURNEYMEN AND LABOURERS OF ENGLAND, WALES,\r\nSCOTLAND, AND IRELAND. LETTER TO JACK HARROW.\r\n\r\n_Paint in the most horrid colours_.--See, for instance, _The\r\nBloody Buoy_ and _The Cannibal's Progress_, by William Cobbett.\r\n\r\n_Flogging_.--Some of the militia mutinied at Ely, and were\r\npunished, the guard on the occasion being furnished by the cavalry of\r\nthe German Legion. Cobbett noticed this in the most inflammatory\r\nmanner, and it being war time, was indicted, tried, found guilty, and\r\nsentenced as he describes.\r\n\r\n_Monks and friars_.--A time came when Cobbett thought and wrote\r\nvery differently of these persons. But that was his way.\r\n\r\n_Foundal_.--I do not know whether Cobbett invented this equivalent\r\nfor _trouvaille_, 'windfall,' or not. His notable scheme for breaking\r\nthe Bank is a good example of him in his insaner moods.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. FIRST LETTER OF MALACHI MALAGROWTHER.\r\n\r\n_The Duenna_--Sheridan's.\r\n\r\n_The Jury Court_.--Trial by jury in _civil_ cases was only introduced\r\ninto Scotland in 1815.\r\n\r\n_Evasive answer_--to the effect that each queen was the fairest\r\nwoman in her own country.\r\n\r\n_Doer_ = 'factor' or agent.\r\n\r\n_Them_--as if 'Scotsmen' had been written for 'Scotland.'\r\n\r\n_Chosen Five and Forty_--the original number of members\r\nassigned to Scotland.\r\n\r\n_Political pamphlet_--'The Public Spirit of the Whigs.'\r\n\r\n_Durk, sic_ in original.\r\n\r\n_Cessio, sc. bonorum_, whereby a debtor on giving up his property\r\ncould be relieved of liabilities.\r\n\r\n_Adjudication_, whereby a creditor could attach landed as\r\nwell as personal property.\r\n\r\n_Lauch_ = 'laugh.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Political Pamphlets, by George Saintsbury",
