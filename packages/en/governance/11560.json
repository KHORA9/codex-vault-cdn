THE WAR ON THE WORD\r\n\r\n II. THE REFUSAL OF RECIPROCITY\r\n\r\nIII. THE APPETITE OF TYRANNY\r\n\r\n IV. THE ESCAPE OF FOLLY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS OF THE CASE.\r\n\r\nUnless we are all mad, there is at the back of the most bewildering\r\nbusiness a story: and if we are all mad, there is no such thing as\r\nmadness. If I set a house on fire, it is quite true that I may illuminate\r\nmany other people's weaknesses as well as my own. It may be that the master\r\nof the house was burned because he was drunk: it may be that the mistress\r\nof the house was burned because she was stingy, and perished arguing about\r\nthe expense of a fire-escape. It is, nevertheless, broadly true that they\r\nboth were burned because I set fire to their house. That is the story\r\nof the thing. The mere facts of the story about the present European\r\nconflagration are quite as easy to tell.\r\n\r\nBefore we go on to the deeper things which make this war the most sincere\r\nwar of human history, it is as easy to answer the question of why England\r\ncame to be in it at all, as it is to ask how a man fell down a coal-hole,\r\nor failed to keep an appointment. Facts are not the whole truth. But\r\nfacts are facts, and in this case the facts are few and simple. Prussia,\r\nFrance, and England had all promised not to invade Belgium. Prussia\r\nproposed to invade Belgium, because it was the safest way of invading\r\nFrance. But Prussia promised that if she might break in, through her own\r\nbroken promise and ours, she would break in and not steal. In other words,\r\nwe were offered at the same instant a promise of faith in the future and\r\na proposal of perjury in the present. Those interested in human origins\r\nmay refer to an old Victorian writer of English, who, in the last and most\r\nrestrained of his historical essays, wrote of Frederick the Great, the\r\nfounder of this unchanging Prussian policy. After describing how Frederick\r\nbroke the guarantee he had signed on behalf of Maria Theresa, he then\r\ndescribes how Frederick sought to put things straight by a promise that\r\nwas an insult. \"If she would but let him have Silesia, he would, he said,\r\nstand by her against any power which should try to deprive her of her other\r\ndominions, as if he was not already bound to stand by her, or as if his new\r\npromise could be of more value than the old one.\" That passage was written\r\nby Macaulay, but so far as the mere contemporary facts are concerned it\r\nmight have been written by me.\r\n\r\nUpon the immediate logical and legal origin of the English interest\r\nthere can be no rational debate. There are some things so simple that\r\none can almost prove them with plans and diagrams, as in Euclid. One\r\ncould make a kind of comic calendar of what would have happened to the\r\nEnglish diplomatist, if he had been silenced every time by Prussian\r\ndiplomacy. Suppose we arrange it in the form of a kind of diary:\r\n\r\nJuly 24: Germany invades Belgium.\r\n\r\nJuly 25: England declares war.\r\n\r\nJuly 26: Germany promises not to annex Belgium.\r\n\r\nJuly 27: England withdraws from the war.\r\n\r\nJuly 28: Germany annexes Belgium, England declares war.\r\n\r\nJuly 29: Germany promises not to annex France, England withdraws from the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nJuly 30: Germany annexes France, England declares war.\r\n\r\nJuly 31: Germany promises not to annex England.\r\n\r\nAug. 1: England withdraws from the war. Germany invades England.\r\n\r\nHow long is anybody expected to go on with that sort of game; or keep peace\r\nat that illimitable price? How long must we pursue a road in which promises\r\nare all fetishes in front of us; and all fragments behind us? No; upon the\r\ncold facts of the final negotiations, as told by any of the diplomatists in\r\nany of the documents, there is no doubt about the story. And no doubt about\r\nthe villain of the story.\r\n\r\nThese are the last facts; the facts which involved England. It is equally\r\neasy to state the first facts; the facts which involved Europe. The\r\nprince who practically ruled Austria was shot by certain persons whom the\r\nAustrian Government believed to be conspirators from Servia. The Austrian\r\nGovernment piled up arms and armies, but said not a word either to Servia\r\ntheir suspect, or Italy their ally. From the documents it would seem\r\nthat Austria kept everybody in the dark, except Prussia. It is probably\r\nnearer the truth to say that Prussia kept everybody in the dark, including\r\nAustria. But all that is what is called opinion, belief, conviction, or\r\ncommon sense: and we are not dealing with it here. The objective fact is\r\nthat Austria told Servia to permit Servian officers to be suspended by the\r\nauthority of Austrian officers; and told Servia to submit to this within\r\nforty-eight hours. In other words, the Sovereign of Servia was practically\r\ntold to take off not only the laurels of two great campaigns, but his own\r\nlawful and national crown, and to do it in a time in which no respectable\r\ncitizen is expected to discharge an hotel bill. Servia asked for time for\r\narbitration--in short, for peace. But Russia had already begun to mobilise;\r\nand Prussia, presuming that Servia might thus be rescued, declared war.\r\n\r\nBetween these two ends of fact, the ultimatum to Servia, the ultimatum\r\nto Belgium, anyone so inclined can of course talk as if everything were\r\nrelative. If anyone asks why the Czar should rush to the support of\r\nServia, it is easy to ask why the Kaiser should rush to the support of\r\nAustria. If anyone says that the French would attack the Germans, it\r\nis sufficient to answer that the Germans did attack the French. There\r\nremain, however, two attitudes to consider, even perhaps two arguments to\r\ncounter, which can best be considered and countered under this general\r\nhead of facts. First of all, there is a curious, cloudy sort of argument,\r\nmuch affected by the professional rhetoricians of Prussia, who are sent\r\nout to instruct and correct the minds of Americans or Scandinavians. It\r\nconsists of going into convulsions of incredulity and scorn at the mention\r\nof Russia's responsibility of Servia, or England's responsibility of\r\nBelgium; and suggesting that, treaty or no treaty, frontier or no frontier,\r\nRussia would be out to slay Teutons or England to steal Colonies. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, I think the professors dotted all over the Baltic plain fail in\r\nlucidity and in the power of distinguishing ideas. Of course it is quite\r\ntrue that England has material interests to defend, and will probably use\r\nthe opportunity to defend them; or, in other words, of course England, like\r\neverybody else, would be more comfortable if Prussia were less predominant.\r\n\r\nThe fact remains that we did not do what the Germans did. We did not\r\ninvade Holland to seize a naval and commercial advantage; and whether\r\nthey say that we wished to do it in our greed, or feared to do it in our\r\ncowardice, the fact remains that we did not do it. Unless this commonsense\r\nprinciple be kept in view, I cannot conceive how any quarrel can possibly\r\nbe judged. A contract may be made between two persons solely for material\r\nadvantage on each side: but the moral advantage is still generally\r\nsupposed to lie with the person who keeps the contract. Surely it cannot\r\nbe dishonest to be honest--even if honesty is the best policy. Imagine the\r\nmost complex maze of indirect motive; and still the man who keeps faith for\r\nmoney cannot possibly be worse than the man who breaks faith for money. It\r\nwill be noted that this ultimate test applies in the same way to Servia as\r\nto Belgium and Britain. The Servians may not be a very peaceful people,\r\nbut on the occasion under discussion it was certainly they who wanted\r\npeace. You may choose to think the Serb a sort of born robber: but on this\r\noccasion it was certainly the Austrian who was trying to rob. Similarly,\r\nyou may call England perfidious as a sort of historical summary; and\r\ndeclare your private belief that Mr. Asquith was vowed from infancy to the\r\nruin of the German Empire, a Hannibal and hater of the eagles. But, when\r\nall is said, it is nonsense to call a man perfidious because he keeps his\r\npromise. It is absurd to complain of the sudden treachery of a business man\r\nin turning up punctually to his appointment: or the unfair shock given to a\r\ncreditor by the debtor paying his debts.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is an attitude, not unknown in the crisis, against which I\r\nshould particularly like to protest. I should address my protest especially\r\nto those lovers and pursuers of peace who, very shortsightedly, have\r\noccasionally adopted it. I mean the attitude which is impatient of these\r\npreliminary details about who did this or that, and whether it was right\r\nor wrong. They are satisfied with saying that an enormous calamity, called\r\nwar, has been begun by some or all of us and should be ended by some or\r\nall of us. To these people, this preliminary chapter about the precise\r\nhappenings must appear not only dry (and it must of necessity be the driest\r\npart of the task) but essentially needless and barren. I wish to tell\r\nthese people that they are wrong; that they are wrong upon all principles\r\nof human justice and historic continuity; but that they are specially and\r\nsupremely wrong upon their own principles of arbitration and international\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThese sincere and high-minded peace-lovers are always telling us that\r\ncitizens no longer settle their quarrels by private violence; and that\r\nnations should no longer settle theirs by public violence. They are always\r\ntelling us that we no longer fight duels; and need not wage wars. In\r\nshort, they perpetually base their peace proposals on the fact that an\r\nordinary citizen no longer avenges himself with an axe. But how is he\r\nprevented from revenging himself with an axe? If he hits his neighbour on\r\nthe head with the kitchen chopper, what do we do? Do we all join hands,\r\nlike children playing Mulberry Bush, and say, \"We are all responsible for\r\nthis; but let us hope it will not spread. Let us hope for the happy day\r\nwhen we shall leave off chopping at the man's head; and when nobody shall\r\never chop anything for ever and ever.\" Do we say, \"Let bygones be bygones;\r\nwhy go back to all the dull details with which the business began; who can\r\ntell with what sinister motives the man was standing there, within reach of\r\nthe hatchet?\" We do not. We keep the peace in private life by asking for\r\nthe facts of provocation, and the proper object of punishment. We do go\r\ninto the dull details; we do enquire into the origins; we do emphatically\r\nenquire who it was that hit first. In short, we do what I have done very\r\nbriefly in this place.\r\n\r\nGiven this, it is indeed true that behind these facts there are truths;\r\ntruths of a terrible, of a spiritual sort. In mere fact, the Germanic\r\npower has been wrong about Servia, wrong about Russia, wrong about Belgium,\r\nwrong about England, wrong about Italy. But there was a reason for its\r\nbeing wrong everywhere; and of that root reason, which has moved half the\r\nworld against it, I shall speak later in this series. For that is something\r\ntoo omnipresent to be proved, too indisputable to be helped by detail. It\r\nis nothing less than the locating, after more than a hundred years of\r\nrecriminations and wrong explanations, of the modern European evil; the\r\nfinding of the fountain from which poison has flowed upon all the nations\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE WAR ON THE WORD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be denied that there is one lingering doubt in many, who\r\nrecognise unavoidable self-defence in the instant parry of the English\r\nsword, and who have no great love for the sweeping sabre of Sadowa and\r\nSedan. That doubt is the doubt whether Russia, as compared with Prussia,\r\nis sufficiently decent and democratic to be the ally of liberal and\r\ncivilised powers. I take first, therefore, this matter of civilisation.\r\n\r\nIt is vital in a discussion like this that we should make sure we are\r\ngoing by meanings and not by mere words. It is not necessary in any\r\nargument to settle what a word means or ought to mean. But it is necessary\r\nin every argument to settle what we propose to mean by the word. So long\r\nas our opponent understands what is the _thing_ of which we are talking,\r\nit does not matter to the argument whether the word is or is not the one\r\nhe would have chosen. A soldier does not say \"We were ordered to go to\r\nMechlin; but I would rather go to Malines.\" He may discuss the etymology\r\nand archaeology of the difference on the march: but the point is that he\r\nknows where to go. So long as we know what a given word is to mean in\r\na given discussion, it does not even matter if it means something else\r\nin some other and quite distinct discussion. We have a perfect right to\r\nsay that the width of a window comes to four feet; even if we instantly\r\nand cheerfully change the subject to the larger mammals, and say that an\r\nelephant has four feet. The identity of the words does not matter, because\r\nthere is no doubt at all about the meanings; because nobody is likely to\r\nthink of an elephant as four feet long, or of a window as having tusks and\r\na curly trunk.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to emphasise this consciousness of the _thing_ under\r\ndiscussion in connection with two or three words that are, as it were, the\r\nkey-words of this war. One of them is the word \"barbarian.\" The Prussians\r\napply it to the Russians: the Russians apply it to the Prussians. Both,\r\nI think, really mean something that really exists, name or no name. Both\r\nmean different things. And if we ask what these different things are, we\r\nshall understand why England and France prefer Russia; and consider Prussia\r\nthe really dangerous barbarian of the two. To begin with, it goes so much\r\ndeeper even than atrocities; of which, in the past at least, all the three\r\nEmpires of Central Europe have partaken pretty equally, as they partook of\r\nPoland. An English writer, seeking to avert the war by warnings against\r\nRussian influence, said that the flogged backs of Polish women stood\r\nbetween us and the Alliance. But not long before, the flogging of women by\r\nan Austrian general led to that officer being thrashed in the streets of\r\nLondon by Barclay and Perkins' draymen. And as for the third power, the\r\nPrussians, it seems clear that they have treated Belgian women in a style\r\ncompared with which flogging might be called an official formality. But, as\r\nI say, something much deeper than any such recrimination lies behind the\r\nuse of the word on either side. When the German Emperor complains of our\r\nallying ourselves with a barbaric and half-oriental power, he is not (I\r\nassure you) shedding tears over the grave of Kosciusko. And when I say (as\r\nI do most heartily) that the German Emperor is a barbarian, I am not merely\r\nexpressing any prejudices I may have against the profanation of churches\r\nor of children. My countrymen and I mean a certain and intelligible thing\r\nwhen we call the Prussians barbarians. It is quite different from the\r\nthing attributed to Russians; and it could not possibly be attributed to\r\nRussians. It is very important that the neutral world should understand\r\nwhat this thing is.\r\n\r\nIf the German calls the Russian barbarous, he presumably means imperfectly\r\ncivilised. There is a certain path along which Western nations have\r\nproceeded in recent times, and it is tenable that Russia has not proceeded\r\nso far as the others: that she has less of the special modern system in\r\nscience, commerce, machinery, travel, or political constitution. The\r\nRuss ploughs with an old plough; he wears a wild beard; he adores\r\nrelics; his life is as rude and hard as that of a subject of Alfred the\r\nGreat. Therefore he is, in the German sense, a barbarian. Poor fellows like\r\nGorky and Dostoieffsky have to form their own reflections on the scenery\r\nwithout the assistance of large quotations from Schiller on garden seats,\r\nor inscriptions directing them to pause and thank the All-Father for\r\nthe finest view in Hesse-Pumpernickel. The Russians, having nothing but\r\ntheir faith, their fields, their great courage, and their self-governing\r\ncommunes, are quite cut off from what is called (in the fashionable street\r\nin Frankfort) The True, The Beautiful and The Good. There is a real sense\r\nin which one can call such backwardness barbaric, by comparison with the\r\nKaiserstrasse; and in that sense it is true of Russia.\r\n\r\nNow we, the French and English, do not mean this when we call the Prussians\r\nbarbarians. If their cities soared higher than their flying ships, if\r\ntheir trains travelled faster than their bullets, we should still call\r\nthem barbarians. We should know exactly what we meant by it; and we\r\nshould know that it is true. For we do not mean anything that is an\r\nimperfect civilisation by accident. We mean something that is the enemy\r\nof civilisation by design. We mean something that is wilfully at war with\r\nthe principles by which human society has been made possible hitherto. Of\r\ncourse it must be partly civilised even to destroy civilisation. Such\r\nruin could not be wrought by the savages that are merely undeveloped or\r\ninert. You could not have even Huns without horses; or horses without\r\nhorsemanship. You could not have even Danish pirates without ships,\r\nor ships without seamanship. This person, whom I may call the Positive\r\nBarbarian, must be rather more superficially up-to-date than what I may\r\ncall the Negative Barbarian. Alaric was an officer in the Roman legions:\r\nbut for all that he destroyed Rome. Nobody supposes that Eskimos could\r\nhave done it at all neatly. But (in our meaning) barbarism is not a matter\r\nof methods, but of aims. We say that these veneered vandals have the\r\nperfectly serious aim of destroying certain ideas, which, as they think,\r\nthe world has outgrown; without which, as we think, the world will die.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that this perilous peculiarity in the Pruss, or Positive\r\nBarbarian, should be seized. He has what he fancies is a new idea; and\r\nhe is going to apply it to everybody. As a fact it is simply a false\r\ngeneralisation; but he is really trying to make it general. This does\r\nnot apply to the Negative Barbarian: it does not apply to the Russian\r\nor the Servian, even if they are barbarians. If a Russian peasant does\r\nbeat his wife, he does it because his fathers did it before him: he is\r\nlikely to beat less rather than more, as the past fades away. He does\r\nnot think, as the Prussian would, that he has made a new discovery in\r\nphysiology in finding that a woman is weaker than a man. If a Servian\r\ndoes knife his rival without a word, he does it because other Servians\r\nhave done it. He may regard it even as piety, but certainly not as\r\nprogress. He does not think, as the Prussian does, that he founds a new\r\nschool of horology by starting before the word \"Go.\" He does not think\r\nhe is in advance of the world in militarism merely because he is behind\r\nit in morals. No; the danger of the Pruss is that he is prepared to\r\nfight for old errors as if they were new truths. He has somehow heard\r\nof certain shallow simplifications, and imagines that we have never\r\nheard of them. And, as I have said, his limited, but very sincere lunacy\r\nconcentrates chiefly in a desire to destroy two ideas, the twin root ideas\r\nof rational society. The first is the idea of record and promise: the\r\nsecond is the idea of reciprocity.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the promise, or extension of responsibility through time,\r\nis what chiefly distinguishes us, I will not say from savages, but from\r\nbrutes and reptiles. This was noted by the shrewdness of the Old Testament,\r\nwhen it summed up the dark irresponsible enormity of Leviathan in the\r\nwords, \"Will he make a pact with thee?\" The promise, like the wheel, is\r\nunknown in Nature: and is the first mark of man. Referring only to human\r\ncivilisation, it may be said with seriousness that in the beginning was\r\nthe Word. The vow is to the man what the song is to the bird, or the bark\r\nto the dog; his voice, whereby he is known. Just as a man who cannot keep\r\nan appointment is not fit even to fight a duel, so the man who cannot keep\r\nan appointment with himself is not sane enough even for suicide. It is not\r\neasy to mention anything on which the enormous apparatus of human life can\r\nbe said to depend. But if it depends on anything, it is on this frail cord,\r\nflung from the forgotten hills of yesterday to the invisible mountains of\r\nto-morrow. On that solitary string hangs everything from Armageddon to an\r\nalmanac, from a successful revolution to a return ticket. On that solitary\r\nstring the Barbarian is hacking heavily, with a sabre which is fortunately\r\nblunt.\r\n\r\nAnyone can see this well enough, merely by reading the last negotiations\r\nbetween London and Berlin. The Prussians had made a new discovery in\r\ninternational politics: that it may often be convenient to make a promise;\r\nand yet curiously inconvenient to keep it. They were charmed, in their\r\nsimple way, with this scientific discovery, and desired to communicate it\r\nto the world. They therefore promised England a promise, on condition that\r\nshe broke a promise, and on the implied condition that the new promise\r\nmight be broken as easily as the old one. To the profound astonishment of\r\nPrussia, this reasonable offer was refused! I believe that the astonishment\r\nof Prussia was quite sincere. That is what I mean when I say that the\r\nBarbarian is trying to cut away that cord of honesty and clear record on\r\nwhich hangs all that men have made.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the German cause have complained that Asiatics and Africans\r\nupon the very verge of savagery have been brought against them from\r\nIndia and Algiers. And in ordinary circumstances, I should sympathise\r\nwith such a complaint made by a European people. But the circumstances\r\nare not ordinary. Here, again, the quiet unique barbarism of Prussia\r\ngoes deeper than what we call barbarities. About mere barbarities, it\r\nis true, the Turco and the Sikh would have a very good reply to the\r\nsuperior Teuton. The general and just reason for not using non-European\r\ntribes against Europeans is that given by Chatham against the use of the\r\nRed Indian: that such allies might do very diabolical things. But the\r\npoor Turco might not unreasonably ask, after a week-end in Belgium, what\r\nmore diabolical things he _could_ do than the highly cultured Germans\r\nwere doing themselves. Nevertheless, as I say, the justification of any\r\nextra-European aid goes deeper than any such details. It rests upon\r\nthe fact that even other civilisations, even much lower civilisations,\r\neven remote and repulsive civilisations, depend as much as our own on\r\nthis primary principle, on which the super-morality of Potsdam declares\r\nopen War. Even savages promise things; and respect those who keep their\r\npromises. Even Orientals write things down: and though they write them\r\nfrom right to left, they know the importance of a scrap of paper. Many\r\nmerchants will tell you that the word of the sinister and almost unhuman\r\nChinaman is often as good as his bond: and it was amid palm trees and\r\nSyrian pavilions that the great utterance opened the tabernacle to him that\r\nsweareth to his hurt and changeth not. There is doubtless a dense labyrinth\r\nof duplicity in the East, and perhaps more guile in the individual Asiatic\r\nthan in the individual German. But we are not talking of the violations\r\nof human morality in various parts of the world. We are talking about a\r\nnew and inhuman morality, which denies altogether the day of obligation.\r\nThe Prussians have been told by their literary men that everything depends\r\nupon Mood: and by their politicians that all arrangements dissolve before\r\n\"necessity.\" That is the importance of the German Chancellor's phrase. He\r\ndid not allege some special excuse in the case of Belgium, which might\r\nmake it seem an exception that proved the rule. He distinctly argued, as\r\non a principle applicable to other cases, that victory was a necessity\r\nand honour was a scrap of paper. And it is evident that the half-educated\r\nPrussian imagination really cannot get any farther than this. It cannot\r\nsee that if everybody's action were entirely incalculable from hour to\r\nhour, it would not only be the end of all promises, but the end of all\r\nprojects. In not being able to see that, the Berlin philosopher is really\r\non a lower mental level than the Arab who respects the salt, or the Brahmin\r\nwho preserves the caste. And in this quarrel we have a right to come with\r\nscimitars as well as sabres, with bows as well as rifles, with assegai\r\nand tomahawk and boomerang, because there is in all these at least a seed\r\nof civilisation that these intellectual anarchists would kill. And if\r\nthey should find us in our last stand girt with such strange swords and\r\nfollowing unfamiliar ensigns, and ask us for what we fight in so singular\r\na company, we shall know what to reply: \"We fight for the trust and for\r\nthe tryst; for fixed memories and the possible meeting of men; for all\r\nthat makes life anything but an uncontrollable nightmare. We fight for the\r\nlong arm of honour and remembrance; for all that can lift a man above the\r\nquicksands of his moods, and give him the mastery of time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE REFUSAL OF RECIPROCITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last summary I suggested that Barbarism, as we mean it, is not mere\r\nignorance or even mere cruelty. It has a more precise sense, and means\r\nmilitant hostility to certain necessary human ideas. I took the case of the\r\nvow or the contract, which Prussian intellectualism would destroy. I urged\r\nthat the Prussian is a spiritual Barbarian, because he is not bound by his\r\nown past, any more than a man in a dream. He avows that when he promised\r\nto respect a frontier on Monday, he did not foresee what he calls \"the\r\nnecessity\" of not respecting it on Tuesday. In short, he is like a child,\r\nwho at the end of all reasonable explanations and reminders of admitted\r\narrangements has no answer except \"But I _want_ to.\"\r\n\r\nThere is another idea in human arrangements so fundamental as to be\r\nforgotten; but now for the first time denied. It may be called the idea\r\nof reciprocity; or, in better English, of give and take. The Prussian\r\nappears to be quite intellectually incapable of this thought. He cannot,\r\nI think, conceive the idea that is the foundation of all comedy; that, in\r\nthe eyes of the other man, he is only the other man. And if we carry this\r\nclue through the institutions of Prussianised Germany, we shall find how\r\ncuriously his mind has been limited in the matter. The German differs from\r\nother patriots in the inability to understand patriotism. Other European\r\npeoples pity the Poles or the Welsh for their violated borders; but Germans\r\nonly pity themselves. They might take forcible possession of the Severn or\r\nthe Danube, of the Thames or the Tiber, of the Garry or the Garonne--and\r\nthey would still be singing sadly about how fast and true stands the watch\r\non Rhine; and what a shame it would be if anyone took their own little\r\nriver away from them. That is what I mean by not being reciprocal: and you\r\nwill find it in all that they do: as in all that is done by savages.\r\n\r\nHere, again, it is very necessary to avoid confusing this soul of the\r\nsavage with mere savagery in the sense of brutality or butchery; in which\r\nthe Greeks, the French and all the most civilised nations have indulged in\r\nhours of abnormal panic or revenge. Accusations of cruelty are generally\r\nmutual. But it is the point about the Prussian that with him nothing is\r\nmutual. The definition of the true savage does not concern itself even with\r\nhow much more he hurts strangers or captives than do the other tribes of\r\nmen. The definition of the true savage is that he laughs when he hurts you;\r\nand howls when you hurt him. This extraordinary inequality in the mind is\r\nin every act and word that comes from Berlin. For instance, no man of the\r\nworld believes all he sees in the newspapers; and no journalist believes a\r\nquarter of it. We should, therefore, be quite ready in the ordinary way to\r\ntake a great deal off the tales of German atrocities; to doubt this story\r\nor deny that. But there is one thing that we cannot doubt or deny: the seal\r\nand authority of the Emperor. In the Imperial proclamation the fact that\r\ncertain \"frightful\" things have been done is admitted; and justified on\r\nthe ground of their frightfulness. It was a military necessity to terrify\r\nthe peaceful populations with something that was not civilised, something\r\nthat was hardly human. Very well. That is an intelligible policy: and in\r\nthat sense an intelligible argument. An army endangered by foreigners\r\nmay do the most frightful things. But then we turn the next page of the\r\nKaiser's public diary, and we find him writing to the President of the\r\nUnited States, to complain that the English are using dum-dum bullets\r\nand violating various regulations of the Hague Conference. I pass for\r\nthe present the question of whether there is a word of truth in these\r\ncharges. I am content to gaze rapturously at the blinking eyes of the True,\r\nor Positive, Barbarian. I suppose he would be quite puzzled if we said that\r\nviolating the Hague Conference was \"a military necessity\" to us; or that\r\nthe rules of the Conference were only a scrap of paper. He would be quite\r\npained if we said that dum-dum bullets, \"by their very frightfulness,\"\r\nwould be very useful to keep conquered Germans in order. Do what he will,\r\nhe cannot get outside the idea that he, because he is he and not you, is\r\nfree to break the law; and also to appeal to the law. It is said that the\r\nPrussian officers play at a game called Kriegsspiel, or the War Game. But\r\nin truth they could not play at any game; for the essence of every game is\r\nthat the rules are the same on both sides.\r\n\r\nBut taking every German institution in turn, the case is the same; and\r\nit is not a case of mere bloodshed or military bravado. The duel, for\r\nexample, can legitimately be called a barbaric thing; but the word is\r\nhere used in another sense. There are duels in Germany; but so there are\r\nin France, Italy, Belgium and Spain; indeed, there are duels wherever\r\nthere are dentists, newspapers, Turkish baths, time-tables, and all the\r\ncurses of civilisation; except in England and a corner of America. You\r\nmay happen to regard the duel as an historic relic of the more barbaric\r\nStates on which these modern States were built. It might equally well be\r\nmaintained that the duel is everywhere the sign of high civilisation;\r\nbeing the sign of its more delicate sense of honour, its more vulnerable\r\nvanity, or its greater dread of social disrepute. But whichever of the two\r\nviews you take, you must concede that the essence of the duel is an armed\r\nequality. I should not, therefore, apply the word barbaric, as I am using\r\nit, to the duels of German officers or even to the broadsword combats\r\nthat are conventional among the German students. I do not see why a young\r\nPrussian should not have scars all over his face if he likes them; nay,\r\nthey are often the redeeming points of interest on an otherwise somewhat\r\nunenlightening countenance. The duel may be defended; the sham duel may be\r\ndefended.\r\n\r\nWhat cannot be defended is something really peculiar to Prussia, of which\r\nwe hear numberless stories, some of them certainly true. It might be called\r\nthe one-sided duel. I mean the idea that there is some sort of dignity\r\nin drawing the sword upon a man who has not got a sword; a waiter, or a\r\nshop assistant, or even a schoolboy. One of the officers of the Kaiser\r\nin the affair at Saberne was found industriously hacking at a cripple. In\r\nall these matters I would avoid sentiment. We must not lose our tempers\r\nat the mere cruelty of the thing; but pursue the strict psychological\r\ndistinction. Others besides German soldiers have slain the defenceless,\r\nfor loot or lust or private malice, like any other murderer. The point is\r\nthat nowhere else but in Prussian Germany is any theory of honour mixed\r\nup with such things; any more than with poisoning or picking pockets. No\r\nFrench, English, Italian or American gentleman would think he had in some\r\nway cleared his own character by sticking his sabre through some ridiculous\r\ngreengrocer who had nothing in his hand but a cucumber. It would seem as if\r\nthe word which is translated from the German as \"honour,\" must really mean\r\nsomething quite different in German. It seems to mean something more like\r\nwhat we should call \"prestige.\"\r\n\r\nThe fundamental fact, however, is the absence of the reciprocal idea. The\r\nPrussian is not sufficiently civilised for the duel. Even when he crosses\r\nswords with us his thoughts are not as our thoughts; when we both glorify\r\nwar, we are glorifying different things. Our medals are wrought like his,\r\nbut they do not mean the same thing; our regiments are cheered as his are,\r\nbut the thought in the heart is not the same; the Iron Cross is on the\r\nbosom of his king, but it is not the sign of our God. For we, alas, follow\r\nour God with many relapses and self-contradictions, but he follows his very\r\nconsistently. Through all the things that we have examined, the view of\r\nnational boundaries, the view of military methods, the view of personal\r\nhonour and self-defence, there runs in their case something of an atrocious\r\nsimplicity; something too simple for us to understand: the idea that glory\r\nconsists in holding the steel, and not in facing it.\r\n\r\nIf further examples were necessary, it would be easy to give hundreds\r\nof them. Let us leave, for the moment, the relation between man and man\r\nin the thing called the duel. Let us take the relation between man and\r\nwoman, in that immortal duel which we call a marriage. Here again we shall\r\nfind that other Christian civilisations aim at some kind of equality;\r\neven if the balance be irrational or dangerous. Thus, the two extremes\r\nof the treatment of women might be represented by what are called the\r\nrespectable classes in America and in France. In America they choose the\r\nrisk of comradeship; in France the compensation of courtesy. In America it\r\nis practically possible for any young gentleman to take any young lady for\r\nwhat he calls (I deeply regret to say) a joyride; but at least the man goes\r\nwith the woman as much as the woman with the man. In France the young woman\r\nis protected like a nun while she is unmarried; but when she is a mother\r\nshe is really a holy woman; and when she is a grandmother she is a holy\r\nterror. By both extremes the woman gets something back out of life. There\r\nis only one place where she gets little or nothing back; and that is the\r\nnorth of Germany. France and America aim alike at equality--America by\r\nsimilarity; France by dissimilarity. But North Germany does definitely\r\naim at inequality. The woman stands up, with no more irritation than a\r\nbutler; the man sits down, with no more embarrassment than a guest. This is\r\nthe cool affirmation of inferiority, as in the case of the sabre and the\r\ntradesman. \"Thou goest with women; forget not thy whip,\" said Nietzsche.\r\nIt will be observed that he does not say \"poker\"; which might come more\r\nnaturally to the mind of a more common or Christian wife-beater. But then\r\na poker is a part of domesticity; and might be used by the wife as well as\r\nthe husband. In fact, it often, is. The sword and the whip are the weapons\r\nof a privileged caste.\r\n\r\nPass from the closest of all differences, that between husband and wife,\r\nto the most distant of all differences, that of the remote and unrelated\r\nraces who have seldom seen each other's faces, and never been tinged\r\nwith each other's blood. Here we still find the same unvarying Prussian\r\nprinciple. Any European might feel a genuine fear of the Yellow Peril; and\r\nmany Englishmen, Frenchmen, and Russians have felt and expressed it. Many\r\nmight say, and have said, that the Heathen Chinee is very heathen indeed;\r\nthat if he ever advances against us he will trample and torture and utterly\r\ndestroy, in a way that Eastern people do, but Western people do not. Nor do\r\nI doubt the German Emperor's sincerity when he sought to point out to us\r\nhow abnormal and abominable such a nightmare campaign would be, supposing\r\nthat it could ever come. But now comes the comic irony; which never fails\r\nto follow on the attempt of the Prussian to be philosophic. For the Kaiser,\r\nafter explaining to his troops how important it was to avoid Eastern\r\nBarbarism, instantly commanded them to become Eastern Barbarians. He told\r\nthem, in so many words, to be Huns: and leave nothing living or standing\r\nbehind them. In fact, he frankly offered a new army corps of aboriginal\r\nTartars to the Far East, within such time as it may take a bewildered\r\nHanoverian to turn into a Tartar. Anyone who has the painful habit of\r\npersonal thought will perceive here at once the non-reciprocal principle\r\nagain. Boiled down to its bones of logic, it means simply this: \"I am a\r\nGerman and you are a Chinaman. Therefore I, being a German, have a right\r\nto be a Chinaman. But you have no right to be a Chinaman; because you\r\nare only a Chinaman.\" This is probably the highest point to which German\r\nculture has risen.\r\n\r\nThe principle here neglected, which may be called Mutuality by those who\r\nmisunderstand and dislike the word Equality, does not offer so clear a\r\ndistinction between the Prussian and the other peoples as did the first\r\nPrussian principle of an infinite and destructive opportunism; or, in\r\nother words, the principle of being unprincipled. Nor upon this second\r\ncan one take up so obvious a position touching the other civilisations or\r\nsemi-civilisations of the world. Some idea of oath and bond there is in the\r\nrudest tribes, in the darkest continents. But it might be maintained, of\r\nthe more delicate and imaginative element of reciprocity, that a cannibal\r\nin Borneo understands it almost as little as a professor in Berlin. A\r\nnarrow and one-sided seriousness is the fault of barbarians all over the\r\nworld. This may have been the meaning, for aught I know, of the one eye of\r\nthe Cyclops: that the Barbarian cannot see round things or look at them\r\nfrom two points of view; and thus becomes a blind beast and an eater of\r\nmen. Certainly there can be no better summary of the savage than this,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, unfits him for the duel. He is the man who cannot\r\nlove--no, nor even hate--his neighbour as himself.\r\n\r\nBut this quality in Prussia does have one effect which has reference\r\nto the same quest of the lower civilisations. It disposes once and\r\nfor all at least of the civilising mission of Germany. Evidently the\r\nGermans are the last people in the world to be trusted with the task. They\r\nare as shortsighted morally as physically. What is their sophism of\r\n\"necessity\" but an inability to imagine to-morrow morning? What is their\r\nnon-reciprocity but an inability to imagine, not a god or devil, but\r\nmerely another man? Are these to judge mankind? Men of two tribes in\r\nAfrica not only know that they are all men, but can understand that they\r\nare all black men. In this they are quite seriously in advance of the\r\nintellectual Prussian; who cannot be got to see that we are all white\r\nmen. The ordinary eye is unable to perceive in the North-East Teuton,\r\nanything that marks him out especially from the more colourless classes of\r\nthe rest of Aryan mankind. He is simply a white man, with a tendency to\r\nthe grey or the drab. Yet he will explain, in serious official documents,\r\nthat the difference between him and us is a difference between \"the\r\nmaster-race and the inferior-race.\" The collapse of German philosophy\r\nalways occurs at the beginning, rather than the end of an argument; and the\r\ndifficulty here is that there is no way of testing which is a master-race\r\nexcept by asking which is your own race. If you cannot find out (as is\r\nusually the case) you fall back on the absurd occupation of writing history\r\nabout prehistoric times. But I suggest quite seriously that if the Germans\r\ncan give their philosophy to the Hottentots, there is no reason why they\r\nshould not give their sense of superiority to the Hottentots. If they can\r\nsee such fine shades between the Goth and the Gaul, there is no reason why\r\nsimilar shades should not lift the savage above other savages; why any\r\nOjibway should not discover that he is one tint redder than the Dacotahs;\r\nor any nigger in the Cameroons say he is not so black as he is painted. For\r\nthis principle of a quite unproved racial supremacy is the last and worst\r\nof the refusals of reciprocity. The Prussian calls all men to admire the\r\nbeauty of his large blue eyes. If they do, it is because they have inferior\r\neyes: if they don't, it is because they have no eyes.\r\n\r\nWherever the most miserable remnant of our race, astray and dried up in\r\ndeserts, or buried for ever under the fall of bad civilisations, has some\r\nfeeble memory that men are men, that bargains are bargains, that there are\r\ntwo sides to a question, or even that it takes two to make a quarrel--that\r\nremnant has the right to resist the New Culture, to the knife and club\r\nand the splintered stone. For the Prussian begins all his culture by that\r\nact which is the destruction of all creative thought and constructive\r\naction. He breaks that mirror in the mind, in which a man can see the face\r\nof his friend and foe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE APPETITE OF TYRANNY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German Emperor has reproached this country with allying itself with\r\n\"barbaric and semi-oriental power.\" We have already considered in what\r\nsense we use the word barbaric: it is in the sense of one who is hostile\r\nto civilisation, not one who is insufficient in it. But when we pass from\r\nthe idea of the barbaric to the idea of the oriental, the case is even\r\nmore curious. There is nothing particularly Tartar in Russian affairs,\r\nexcept the fact that Russia expelled the Tartars. The eastern invader\r\noccupied and crushed the country for many years; but that is equally true\r\nof Greece, of Spain, and even of Austria. If Russia has suffered from the\r\nEast she has suffered in order to resist it: and it is rather hard that\r\nthe very miracle of her escape should make a mystery about her origin.\r\nJonah may or may not have been three days inside a fish, but that does\r\nnot make him a merman. And in all the other cases of European nations who\r\nescaped the monstrous captivity, we do admit the purity and continuity\r\nof the European type. We consider the old Eastern rule as a wound, but\r\nnot as a stain. Copper-coloured men out of Africa overruled for centuries\r\nthe religion and patriotism of Spaniards. Yet I have never heard that\r\nDon Quixote was an African fable on the lines of Uncle Remus. I have\r\nnever heard that the heavy black in the pictures of Velasquez was due\r\nto a negro ancestry. In the case of Spain, which is close to us, we can\r\nrecognise the resurrection of a Christian and cultured nation after its\r\nage of bondage. But Russia is rather remote; and those to whom nations are\r\nbut names in newspapers can really fancy, like Mr. Baring's friend, that\r\nall Russian churches are \"mosques.\" Yet the land of Turgeniev is not a\r\nwilderness of fakirs; and even the fanatical Russian is as proud of being\r\ndifferent from the Mongol, as the fanatical Spaniard was proud of being\r\ndifferent from the Moor.\r\n\r\nThe town of Reading, as it exists, offers few opportunities for piracy\r\non the high seas: yet it was the camp of the pirates in Alfred's day. I\r\nshould think it hard to call the people of Berkshire half-Danish, merely\r\nbecause they drove out the Danes. In short, some temporary submergence\r\nunder the savage flood was the fate of many of the most civilised states\r\nof Christendom; and it is quite ridiculous to argue that Russia, which\r\nwrestled hardest, must have recovered least. Everywhere, doubtless, the\r\nEast spread a sort of enamel over the conquered countries, but everywhere\r\nthe enamel cracked. Actual history, in fact, is exactly opposite to\r\nthe cheap proverb invented against the Muscovite. It is not true to\r\nsay \"Scratch a Russian and you find a Tartar.\" In the darkest hour of\r\nthe barbaric dominion it was truer to say, \"Scratch a Tartar and you\r\nfind a Russian.\" It was the civilisation that survived under all the\r\nbarbarism. This vital romance of Russia, this revolution against Asia, can\r\nbe proved in pure fact; not only from the almost superhuman activity of\r\nRussia during the struggle, but also (which is much rarer as human history\r\ngoes) by her quite consistent conduct since. She is the only great nation\r\nwhich has really expelled the Mongol from her country, and continued to\r\nprotest against the presence of the Mongol in her continent. Knowing\r\nwhat he had been in Russia, she knew what he would be in Europe. In\r\nthis she pursued a logical line of thought, which was, if anything, too\r\nunsympathetic with the energies and religions of the East. Every other\r\ncountry, one may say, has been an ally of the Turk; that is, of the Mongol\r\nand the Moslem. The French played them as pieces against Austria; the\r\nEnglish warmly supported them under the Palmerston regime; even the young\r\nItalians sent troops to the Crimea; and of Prussia and her Austrian vassal\r\nit is nowadays needless to speak. For good or evil, it is the fact of\r\nhistory that Russia is the only Power in Europe that has never supported\r\nthe Crescent against the Cross.\r\n\r\nThat, doubtless, will appear an unimportant matter; but it may become\r\nimportant under certain peculiar conditions. Suppose, for the sake\r\nof argument, that there were a powerful prince in Europe who had gone\r\nostentatiously out of his way to pay reverence to the remains of the\r\nTartar, Mongol and Moslem, which are left as outposts in Europe. Suppose\r\nthere were a Christian Emperor who could not even go to the tomb of\r\nthe Crucified, without pausing to congratulate the last and living\r\ncrucifier. If there were an Emperor who gave guns and guides and maps and\r\ndrill instructors to defend the remains of the Mongol in Christendom, what\r\nshould we say to him? I think at least we might ask him what he meant by\r\nhis impudence, when he talked about supporting a semi-oriental power. That\r\nwe support a semi-oriental power we deny. That he has supported an entirely\r\noriental power cannot be denied--no, not even by the man who did it.\r\n\r\nBut here is to be noted the essential difference between Russia and\r\nPrussia; especially by those who use the ordinary Liberal arguments\r\nagainst the latter. Russia has a policy which she pursues, if you will,\r\nthrough evil and good; but at least so as to produce good as well as\r\nevil. Let it be granted that the policy has made her oppressive to the\r\nFinns and the Poles--though the Russian Poles feel far less oppressed than\r\ndo the Prussian Poles. But it is a mere historic fact, that if Russia\r\nhas been a despot to some small nations, she has been a deliverer to\r\nothers. She did, so far as in her lay, emancipate the Servians and the\r\nMontenegrins. But whom did Prussia ever emancipate--even by accident? It\r\nis indeed somewhat extraordinary that in the perpetual permutations of\r\ninternational politics, the Hohenzollerns have never gone astray into the\r\npath of enlightenment. They have been in alliance with almost everybody\r\noff and on: with France, with England, with Austria, with Russia. Can\r\nanyone candidly say that they have left on any one of these people the\r\nfaintest impress of progress or liberation? Prussia was the enemy of the\r\nFrench Monarchy; but a worse enemy of the French Revolution. Prussia had\r\nbeen an enemy of the Czar; but she was a worse enemy of the Duma. Prussia\r\ntotally disregarded Austrian rights: but she is to-day quite ready to\r\ninflict Austrian wrongs. This is the strong particular difference between\r\nthe one empire and the other. Russia is pursuing certain intelligible and\r\nsincere ends, which to her at least are ideals, and for which, therefore,\r\nshe will make sacrifices and will protect the weak. But the North German\r\nsoldier is a sort of abstract tyrant, everywhere and always on the side of\r\nmaterialistic tyranny. This Teuton in uniform has been found in strange\r\nplaces; shooting farmers before Saratoga and flogging soldiers in Surrey,\r\nhanging niggers in Africa and raping girls in Wicklow; but never, by some\r\nmysterious fatality, lending a hand to the freeing of a single city or the\r\nindependence of one solitary flag. Wherever scorn and prosperous oppression\r\nare, there is the Prussian; unconsciously consistent, instinctively\r\nrestrictive, innocently evil; \"following darkness like a dream.\"\r\n\r\nSuppose we heard of a person (gifted with some longevity) who had helped\r\nAlva to persecute Dutch Protestants, then helped Cromwell to persecute\r\nIrish Catholics, and then helped Claverhouse to persecute Scotch Puritans,\r\nwe should find it rather easier to call him a persecutor than to call\r\nhim a Protestant or a Catholic. Curiously enough this is actually the\r\nposition in which the Prussian stands in Europe. No argument can alter\r\nthe fact that in three converging and conclusive cases, he has been on\r\nthe side of three distinct rulers of different religions, who had nothing\r\nwhatever in common except that they were ruling oppressively. In these\r\nthree Governments, taken separately, one can see something excusable or at\r\nleast human. When the Kaiser encouraged the Russian rulers to crush the\r\nRevolution, the Russian rulers undoubtedly believed they were wrestling\r\nwith an inferno of atheism and anarchy. A Socialist of the ordinary English\r\nkind cried out upon me when I spoke of Stolypin, and said he was chiefly\r\nknown by the halter called \"Stolypin's Necktie.\" As a fact, there were many\r\nother things interesting about Stolypin besides his necktie: his policy of\r\npeasant proprietorship, his extraordinary personal courage, and certainly\r\nnone more interesting than that movement in his death agony, when he made\r\nthe sign of the cross towards the Czar, as the crown and captain of his\r\nChristianity. But the Kaiser does not regard the Czar as the captain of\r\nChristianity. Far from it. What he supported in Stolypin was the necktie\r\nand nothing but the necktie: the gallows and not the cross. The Russian\r\nruler did believe that the Orthodox Church was orthodox. The Austrian\r\nArchduke did really desire to make the Catholic Church catholic. He did\r\nreally believe that he was being Pro-Catholic in being Pro-Austrian. But\r\nthe Kaiser cannot be Pro-Catholic, and therefore cannot have been really\r\nPro-Austrian, he was simply and solely Anti-Servian. Nay, even in the cruel\r\nand sterile strength of Turkey, anyone with imagination can see something\r\nof the tragedy and therefore of the tenderness of true belief. The worst\r\nthat can be said of the Moslems is, as the poet put it, they offered to\r\nman the choice of the Koran or the sword. The best that can be said for\r\nthe German is that he does not care about the Koran, but is satisfied if\r\nhe can have the sword. And for me, I confess, even the sins of these three\r\nother striving empires take on, in comparison, something that is sorrowful\r\nand dignified: and I feel they do not deserve that this little Lutheran\r\nlounger should patronise all that is evil in them, while ignoring all that\r\nis good. He is not Catholic, he is not Orthodox, he is not Mahomedan. He\r\nis merely an old gentleman who wishes to share the crime though he cannot\r\nshare the creed. He desires to be a persecutor by the pang without the\r\npalm. So strongly do all the instincts of the Prussian drive against\r\nliberty, that he would rather oppress other people's subjects than think\r\nof anybody going without the benefits of oppression. He is a sort of\r\ndisinterested despot. He is as disinterested as the devil who is ready to\r\ndo anyone's dirty work.\r\n\r\nThis would seem obviously fantastic were it not supported by solid facts\r\nwhich cannot be explained otherwise. Indeed it would be inconceivable\r\nif we were thinking of a whole people, consisting of free and varied\r\nindividuals. But in Prussia the governing class is really a governing\r\nclass: and a very few people are needed to think along these lines to make\r\nall the other people act along them. And the paradox of Prussia is this:\r\nthat while its princes and nobles have no other aim on this earth but to\r\ndestroy democracy wherever it shows itself, they have contrived to get\r\nthemselves trusted, not as wardens of the past but as forerunners of the\r\nfuture. Even they cannot believe that their theory is popular, but they\r\ndo believe that it is progressive. Here again we find the spiritual chasm\r\nbetween the two monarchies in question. The Russian institutions are, in\r\nmany cases, really left in the rear of the Russian people, and many of the\r\nRussian people know it. But the Prussian institutions are supposed to be\r\nin advance of the Prussian people, and most of the Prussian people believe\r\nit. It is thus much easier for the war-lords to go everywhere and impose\r\na hopeless slavery upon everyone, for they have already imposed a sort of\r\nhopeful slavery on their own simple race.\r\n\r\nAnd when men shall speak to us of the hoary iniquities of Russia and of\r\nhow antiquated is the Russian system, we shall answer \"Yes; that is the\r\nsuperiority of Russia.\" Their institutions are part of their history,\r\nwhether as relics or fossils. Their abuses have really been uses: that\r\nis to say, they have been used up. If they have old engines of terror\r\nor torment, they may fall to pieces from mere rust, like an old coat of\r\narmour. But in the case of the Prussian tyranny, if it be tyranny at all,\r\nit is the whole point of its claim that it is not antiquated, but just\r\ngoing to begin, like the showman. Prussia has a whole thriving factory of\r\nthumbscrews, a whole humming workshop of wheels and racks, of the newest\r\nand neatest pattern, with which to win back Europe to the Reaction ...\r\n_infandum renovare dolorem_ And if we wish to test the truth of this, it\r\ncan be done by the same method which showed us that Russia, if her race or\r\nreligion could sometimes make her an invader and an oppressor, could also\r\nbe made an emancipator and a knight errant. In the same way, if the Russian\r\ninstitutions are old-fashioned, they honestly exhibit the good as well as\r\nthe bad that can be found in old-fashioned things.\r\n\r\nIn their police system they have an inequality which is against our ideas\r\nof law. But in their commune system they have an equality that is older\r\nthan law itself. Even when they flogged each other like barbarians, they\r\ncalled upon each other by their Christian names like children. At their\r\nworst they retained all the best of a rude society. At their best, they\r\nare simply good, like good children or good nuns. But in Prussia, all that\r\nis best in the civilised machinery is put at the service of all that is\r\nworst in the barbaric mind. Here again the Prussian has no accidental\r\nmerits, none of those lucky survivals, none of those late repentances,\r\nwhich make the patchwork glory of Russia. Here all is sharpened to a point\r\nand pointed to a purpose, and that purpose, if words and acts have any\r\nmeaning at all, is the destruction of liberty throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPE OF FOLLY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering the Prussian point of view, we have been considering what\r\nseems to be mainly a mental limitation: a kind of knot in the brain.\r\nTowards the problem of Slav population, of English colonisation, of French\r\narmies and reinforcements, it shows the same strange philosophic sulks.\r\nSo far as I can follow it, it seems to amount to saying \"It is very wrong\r\nthat you should be superior to me, because I am superior to you.\" The\r\nspokesmen of this system seem to have a curious capacity for concentrating\r\nthis entanglement or contradiction, sometimes into a single paragraph, or\r\neven a single sentence. I have already referred to the German Emperor's\r\ncelebrated suggestion that in order to avert the peril of Hunnishness we\r\nshould all become Huns. A much stronger instance is his more recent order\r\nto his troops touching the war in Northern France. As most people know,\r\nhis words ran \"It is my Royal and Imperial command that you concentrate\r\nyour energies, for the immediate present, upon one single purpose, and that\r\nis that you address all your skill and all the valour of my soldiers to\r\nexterminate first the treacherous English and to walk over General French's\r\ncontemptible little army.\" The rudeness of the remark an Englishman can\r\nafford to pass over; what I am interested in is the mentality, the train\r\nof thought that can manage to entangle itself even in so brief a space.\r\nIf French's little Army is contemptible, it would seem clear that all the\r\nskill and valour of the German Army had better not be concentrated on it,\r\nbut on the larger and less contemptible allies. If all the skill and valour\r\nof the German Army are concentrated on it, it is not being treated as\r\ncontemptible. But the Prussian rhetorician had two incompatible sentiments\r\nin his mind; and he insisted on saying them both at once. He wanted to\r\nthink of an English Army as a small thing; but he also wanted to think of\r\nan English defeat as a big thing. He wanted to exult, at the same moment,\r\nin the utter weakness of the British in their attack; and the supreme\r\nskill and valour of the Germans in repelling such an attack. Somehow\r\nit must be made a common and obvious collapse for England; and yet a\r\ndaring and unexpected triumph for Germany. In trying to express these\r\ncontradictory conceptions simultaneously, he got rather mixed. Therefore\r\nhe bade Germania fill all her vales and mountains with the dying agonies of\r\nthis almost invisible earwig; and let the impure blood of this cockroach\r\nredden the Rhine down to the sea.\r\n\r\nBut it would be unfair to base the criticism on the utterance of any\r\naccidental and hereditary prince: and it is quite equally clear in the\r\ncase of the philosophers who have been held up to us, even in England, as\r\nthe very prophets of progress. And in nothing is it shown more sharply\r\nthan in the curious confused talk about Race and especially about the\r\nTeutonic Race. Professor Harnack and similar people are reproaching us,\r\nI understand, for having broken \"the bond of Teutonism\": a bond which the\r\nPrussians have strictly observed both in breach and observance. We note\r\nit in their open annexation of lands wholly inhabited by negroes, such as\r\nDenmark. We note it equally in their instant and joyful recognition of\r\nthe flaxen hair and light blue eyes of the Turks. But it is still the\r\nabstract principle of Professor Harnack which interests me most; and in\r\nfollowing it I have the same complexity of inquiry, but the same simplicity\r\nof result. Comparing the Professor's concern about \"Teutonism\" with his\r\nunconcern about Belgium, I can only reach the following result: \"A man\r\nneed not keep a promise he has made. But a man must keep a promise he has\r\nnot made.\" There certainly was a treaty binding Britain to Belgium; if\r\nit was only a scrap of paper. If there was any treaty binding Britain to\r\nTeutonism it is, to say the least of it, a lost scrap of paper; almost\r\nwhat one would call a scrap of waste-paper. Here again the pedants under\r\nconsideration exhibit the illogical perversity that makes the brain reel.\r\nThere is obligation and there is no obligation: sometimes it appears that\r\nGermany and England must keep faith with each other; sometimes that Germany\r\nneed not keep faith with anybody and anything; sometimes that we alone\r\namong European peoples are almost entitled to be Germans; sometimes that\r\nbesides us, Russians and Frenchmen almost rise to a Germanic loveliness of\r\ncharacter. But through all there is, hazy but not hypocritical, this sense\r\nof some common Teutonism.\r\n\r\nProfessor Haeckel, another of the witnesses raised up against us, attained\r\nto some celebrity at one time through proving the remarkable resemblance\r\nbetween two different things by printing duplicate pictures of the same\r\nthing. Professor Haeckel's contribution to biology, in this case, was\r\nexactly like Professor Harnack's contribution to ethnology. Professor\r\nHarnack knows what a German is like. When he wants to imagine what an\r\nEnglishman is like, he simply photographs the same German over again. In\r\nboth cases there is probably sincerity as well as simplicity. Haeckel\r\nwas so certain that the species illustrated in embryo really are closely\r\nrelated and linked up, that it seemed to him a small thing to simplify it\r\nby mere repetition. Harnack is so certain that the German and Englishman\r\nare almost alike, that he really risks the generalisation that they are\r\nexactly alike. He photographs, so to speak, the same fair and foolish face\r\ntwice over; and calls it a remarkable resemblance between cousins. Thus, he\r\ncan prove the existence of Teutonism just about as conclusively as Haeckel\r\nhas proved the more tenable proposition of the non-existence of God.\r\n\r\nNow the German and the Englishman are not in the least alike--except\r\nin the sense that neither of them are negroes. They are, in everything\r\ngood and evil, more unlike than any other two men we can take at random\r\nfrom the great European family. They are opposite from the roots of\r\ntheir history, nay of their geography. It is an understatement to call\r\nBritain insular. Britain is not only an island, but an island slashed by\r\nthe sea till it nearly splits into three islands; and even the Midlands\r\ncan almost smell the salt. Germany is a powerful, beautiful and fertile\r\ninland country, which can only find the sea by one or two twisted and\r\nnarrow paths, as people find a subterranean lake. Thus the British Navy\r\nis really national because it is natural; it has cohered out of hundreds\r\nof accidental adventures of ships and shipmen before Chaucer's time and\r\nafter it. But the German Navy is an artificial thing; as artificial as a\r\nconstructed Alp would be in England. William II. has simply copied the\r\nBritish Navy as Frederick II. copied the French Army: and this Japanese\r\nor ant-like assiduity in imitation is one of the hundred qualities which\r\nthe Germans have and the English markedly have not. There are other German\r\nsuperiorities which are very much superior.\r\n\r\nThe one or two really jolly things that the Germans have got are precisely\r\nthe things which the English haven't got: notably a real habit of popular\r\nmusic and of the ancient songs of the people, not merely spreading from\r\nthe towns or caught from the professionals. In this the Germans rather\r\nresemble the Welsh; though heaven knows what becomes of Teutonism if\r\nthey do. But the difference between the Germans and the English goes\r\ndeeper than all these signs of it; they differ more than any other two\r\nEuropeans in the normal posture of the mind. Above all, they differ in\r\nwhat is the most English of all English traits; that shame which the\r\nFrench may be right in calling \"the bad shame\"; for it is certainly mixed\r\nup with pride and suspicion, the upshot of which we called shyness. Even\r\nan Englishman's rudeness is often rooted in his being embarrassed. But\r\na German's rudeness is rooted in his never being embarrassed. He eats\r\nand makes love noisily. He never feels a speech or a song or a sermon or\r\na large meal to be what the English call \"out of place\" in particular\r\ncircumstances. When Germans are patriotic and religious, they have no\r\nreaction against patriotism and religion as have the English and the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nNay, the mistake of Germany in the modern disaster largely arose from the\r\nfacts that she thought England was simple, when England is very subtle.\r\nShe thought that because our politics have become largely financial that\r\nthey had become wholly financial; that because our aristocrats had become\r\npretty cynical that they had become entirely corrupt. They could not seize\r\nthe subtlety by which a rather used-up English gentleman might sell a\r\ncoronet when he would not sell a fortress; might lower the public standards\r\nand yet refuse to lower the flag.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Germans are quite sure that they understand us entirely,\r\nbecause they do not understand us at all. Possibly if they began to\r\nunderstand us they might hate us even more: but I would rather be hated for\r\nsome small but real reason, than pursued with love on account of all kinds\r\nof qualities which I do not possess and which I do not desire. And when the\r\nGermans get their first genuine glimpse of what modern England is like,\r\nthey will discover that England has a very broken, belated and inadequate\r\nsense of having an obligation to Europe, but no sort of sense whatever of\r\nhaving any obligation to Teutonism.\r\n\r\nThis is the last and strongest of the Prussian qualities we have here\r\nconsidered. There is in stupidity of this sort a strange slippery\r\nstrength: because it can be not only outside rules but outside reason. The\r\nman who really cannot see that he is contradicting himself has a great\r\nadvantage in controversy; though the advantage breaks down when he tries\r\nto reduce it to simple addition, to chess, or to the game called war. It\r\nis the same about the stupidity of the one-sided kinship. The drunkard who\r\nis quite certain that a total stranger is his long-lost brother, has a\r\ngreater advantage until it comes to matters of detail. \"We must have chaos\r\nwithin,\" said Nietzsche, \"that we may give birth to a dancing star.\"\r\n\r\nIn these slight notes I have suggested the principal strong points of\r\nthe Prussian character. A failure in honour which almost amounts to a\r\nfailure in memory: an egomania that is honestly blind to the fact that\r\nthe other party is an ego; and, above all, an actual itch for tyranny\r\nand interference, the devil which everywhere torments the idle and the\r\nproud. To these must be added a certain mental shapelessness which can\r\nexpand or contract without reference to reason or record; a potential\r\ninfinity of excuses. If the English had been on the German side, the\r\nGerman professors would have noted what irresistible energies had evolved\r\nthe Teutons. As the English are on the other side, the German professors\r\nwill say that these Teutons were not sufficiently evolved. Or they will\r\nsay that they were just sufficiently evolved to show that they were not\r\nTeutons. Probably they will say both. But the truth is that all that they\r\ncall evolution should rather be called evasion. They tell us they are\r\nopening windows of enlightenment and doors of progress. The truth is that\r\nthey are breaking up the whole house of the human intellect, that they\r\nmay abscond in any direction. There is an ominous and almost monstrous\r\nparallel between the position of their over-rated philosophers and of their\r\ncomparatively under-rated soldiers. For what their professors call roads of\r\nprogress are really routes of escape.",
