Our National\r\nStrategy for Combating Terrorism, first published in February 2003,\r\nrecognizes that we are at war and that protecting and defending the\r\nHomeland, the American people, and their livelihoods remains our first\r\nand most solemn obligation.\r\n\r\nOur strategy also recognizes that the War on Terror is a different kind\r\nof war. From the beginning, it has been both a battle of arms and a\r\nbattle of ideas. Not only do we fight our terrorist enemies on the\r\nbattlefield, we promote freedom and human dignity as alternatives to\r\nthe terrorists' perverse vision of oppression and totalitarian rule.\r\nThe paradigm for combating terrorism now involves the application of\r\nall elements of our national power and influence. Not only do we employ\r\nmilitary power, we use diplomatic, financial, intelligence, and law\r\nenforcement activities to protect the Homeland and extend our defenses,\r\ndisrupt terrorist operations, and deprive our enemies of what they need\r\nto operate and survive. We have broken old orthodoxies that once\r\nconfined our counterterrorism efforts primarily to the criminal justice\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nThis updated strategy sets the course for winning the War on Terror. It\r\nbuilds directly from the National Security Strategy issued in March\r\n2006 as well as the February 2003 National Strategy for Combating\r\nTerrorism, and incorporates our increased understanding of the enemy.\r\nFrom the beginning, we understood that the War on Terror involved more\r\nthan simply finding and bringing to justice those who had planned and\r\nexecuted the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Our strategy\r\ninvolved destroying the larger al-Qaida network and also confronting\r\nthe radical ideology that inspired others to join or support the\r\nterrorist movement. Since 9/11, we have made substantial progress in\r\ndegrading the al-Qaida network, killing or capturing key lieutenants,\r\neliminating safehavens, and disrupting existing lines of support.\r\nThrough the freedom agenda, we also have promoted the best long-term\r\nanswer to al-Qaida's agenda: the freedom and dignity that comes when\r\nhuman liberty is protected by effective democratic institutions.\r\n\r\nIn response to our efforts, the terrorists have adjusted, and so we\r\nmust continue to refine our strategy to meet the evolving threat.\r\nToday, we face a global terrorist movement and must confront the\r\nradical ideology that justifies the use of violence against innocents\r\nin the name of religion. As laid out in this strategy, to win the War\r\non Terror, we will:\r\n\r\n--Advance effective democracies as the long-term antidote to the\r\nideology of terrorism;\r\n\r\n--Prevent attacks by terrorist networks;\r\n\r\n--Deny weapons of mass destruction to rogue states and terrorist allies\r\nwho seek to use them;\r\n\r\n--Deny terrorists the support and sanctuary of rogue states;\r\n\r\n--Deny terrorists control of any nation they would use as a base and\r\nlaunching pad for terror; and\r\n\r\n--Lay the foundations and build the institutions and structures we need\r\nto carry the fight forward against terror and help ensure our ultimate\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Today's Realities in the War on Terror+\r\n\r\nThe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, were acts of war against\r\nthe United States, peaceful people throughout the world, and the very\r\nprinciples of liberty and human dignity. The United States, together\r\nwith our Coalition partners, has fought back and will win this war. We\r\nwill hold the perpetrators accountable and work to prevent the\r\nrecurrence of similar atrocities on any scale--whether at home or\r\nabroad. The War on Terror extends beyond the current armed conflict\r\nthat arose out of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and embraces all\r\nfacets of continuing U.S. efforts to bring an end to the scourge of\r\nterrorism. Ultimately, we will win the long war to defeat the\r\nterrorists and their murderous ideology.\r\n\r\n\r\n+_Successes_+\r\n\r\n--We have deprived al-Qaida of safehaven in Afghanistan and helped a\r\ndemocratic government to rise in its place. Once a terrorist sanctuary\r\nruled by the repressive Taliban regime, Afghanistan is now a full\r\npartner in the War on Terror.\r\n\r\n--A multinational coalition joined by the Iraqis is aggressively\r\nprosecuting the war against the terrorists in Iraq. Together, we are\r\nworking to secure a united, stable, and democratic Iraq, now a new War\r\non Terror ally in the heart of the Middle East.\r\n\r\n--We have significantly degraded the al-Qaida network. Most of those in\r\nthe al-Qaida network responsible for the September 11 attacks,\r\nincluding the plot's mastermind Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, have been\r\ncaptured or killed. We also have killed other key al-Qaida members,\r\nsuch as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the group's operational commander in Iraq\r\nwho led a campaign of terror that took the lives of countless American\r\nforces and innocent Iraqis.\r\n\r\n--We have led an unprecedented international campaign to combat\r\nterrorist financing that has made it harder, costlier, and riskier for\r\nal-Qaida and related terrorist groups to raise and move money.\r\n\r\n--There is a broad and growing global consensus that the deliberate\r\ntargeting of innocents is never justified by any calling or cause.\r\n\r\n--Many nations have rallied to fight terrorism, with unprecedented\r\ncooperation on law enforcement, intelligence, military, and diplomatic\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n--We have strengthened our ability to disrupt and help prevent future\r\nattacks in the Homeland by enhancing our counterterrorism architecture\r\nthrough the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the Office\r\nof Director of National Intelligence, and the National Counterterrorism\r\nCenter. Overall, the United States and our partners have disrupted\r\nseveral serious plots since September 11, including al-Qaida plots to\r\nattack inside the United States.\r\n\r\n--Numerous countries that were part of the problem before September 11\r\nare now increasingly becoming part of the solution--and this\r\ntransformation has occurred without destabilizing friendly regimes in\r\nkey regions.\r\n\r\n--The Administration has worked with Congress to adopt, implement, and\r\nrenew key reforms like the USA PATRIOT Act that promote our security\r\nwhile also protecting our fundamental liberties.\r\n\r\nYet while America is safer, we are not yet safe. The enemy remains\r\ndetermined, and we face serious challenges at home and abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n+_Challenges_+\r\n\r\n--Terrorist networks today are more dispersed and less centralized.\r\nThey are more reliant on smaller cells inspired by a common ideology\r\nand less directed by a central command structure.\r\n\r\n--While the United States Government and its partners have thwarted\r\nmany attacks, we have not been able to prevent them all. Terrorists\r\nhave struck in many places throughout the world, from Bali to Beslan to\r\nBaghdad.\r\n\r\n--While we have substantially improved our air, land, sea, and border\r\nsecurity, our Homeland is not immune from attack.\r\n\r\n--Terrorists have declared their intention to acquire and use weapons\r\nof mass destruction (WMD) to inflict even more catastrophic attacks\r\nagainst the United States, our allies, partners, and other interests\r\naround the world.\r\n\r\n--Some states, such as Syria and Iran, continue to harbor terrorists at\r\nhome and sponsor terrorist activity abroad.\r\n\r\n--The ongoing fight for freedom in Iraq has been twisted by terrorist\r\npropaganda as a rallying cry.\r\n\r\n--Increasingly sophisticated use of the Internet and media has enabled\r\nour terrorist enemies to communicate, recruit, train, rally support,\r\nproselytize, and spread their propaganda without risking personal\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Today's Terrorist Enemy+\r\n\r\nThe United States and our partners continue to pursue a significantly\r\ndegraded but still dangerous al-Qaida network. Yet the enemy we face\r\ntoday in the War on Terror is not the same enemy we faced on September\r\n11. Our effective counterterrorist efforts, in part, have forced the\r\nterrorists to evolve and modify their ways of doing business. Our\r\nunderstanding of the enemy has evolved as well. Today, the principal\r\nterrorist enemy confronting the United States is a transnational\r\nmovement of extremist organizations, networks, and individuals--and\r\ntheir state and non-state supporters--which have in common that they\r\nexploit Islam and use terrorism for ideological ends.\r\n\r\nThis transnational movement is not monolithic. Although al-Qaida\r\nfunctions as the movement's vanguard and remains, along with its\r\naffiliate groups and those inspired by them, the most dangerous present\r\nmanifestation of the enemy, the movement is not controlled by any\r\nsingle individual, group, or state. What unites the movement is a\r\ncommon vision, a common set of ideas about the nature and destiny of\r\nthe world, and a common goal of ushering in totalitarian rule. What\r\nunites the movement is the ideology of oppression, violence, and hate.\r\n\r\nOur terrorist enemies exploit Islam to serve a violent political\r\nvision. Fueled by a radical ideology and a false belief that the United\r\nStates is the cause of most problems affecting Muslims today, our\r\nenemies seek to expel Western power and influence from the Muslim world\r\nand establish regimes that rule according to a violent and intolerant\r\ndistortion of Islam. As illustrated by Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, such\r\nregimes would deny all political and religious freedoms and serve as\r\nsanctuaries for extremists to launch additional attacks against not\r\nonly the United States, its allies and partners, but the Muslim world\r\nitself. Some among the enemy, particularly al-Qaida, harbor even\r\ngreater territorial and geopolitical ambitions and aim to establish a\r\nsingle, pan-Islamic, totalitarian regime that stretches from Spain to\r\nSoutheast Asia.\r\n\r\nThis enemy movement seeks to create and exploit a division between the\r\nMuslim and non-Muslim world and within the Muslim world itself. The\r\nterrorists distort the idea of jihad into a call for violence and\r\nmurder against those they regard as apostates or unbelievers, including\r\nall those who disagree with them. Most of the terrorist attacks since\r\nSeptember 11 have occurred in Muslim countries--and most of the victims\r\nhave been Muslims.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this principal enemy, a host of other groups and\r\nindividuals also use terror and violence against innocent civilians to\r\npursue their political objectives. Though their motives and goals may\r\nbe different, and often include secular and more narrow territorial\r\naims, they threaten our interests and those of our partners as they\r\nattempt to overthrow civil order and replace freedom with conflict and\r\nintolerance. Their terrorist tactics ensure that they are enemies of\r\nhumanity regardless of their goals and no matter where they operate.\r\n\r\nFor our terrorist enemies, violence is not only justified, it is\r\nnecessary and even glorified--judged the only means to achieve a world\r\nvision darkened by hate, fear, and oppression. They use suicide\r\nbombings, beheadings, and other atrocities against innocent people as a\r\nmeans to promote their creed. Our enemy's demonstrated indifference to\r\nhuman life and desire to inflict catastrophic damage on the United\r\nStates and its friends and allies around the world have fueled their\r\ndesire for weapons of mass destruction. We cannot permit the world's\r\nmost dangerous terrorists and their regime sponsors to threaten us with\r\nthe world's most destructive weapons.\r\n\r\nFor the enemy, there is no peaceful coexistence with those who do not\r\nsubscribe to their distorted and violent view of the world. They accept\r\nno dissent and tolerate no alternative points of view. Ultimately, the\r\nterrorist enemy we face threatens global peace, international security\r\nand prosperity, the rising tide of democracy, and the right of all\r\npeople to live without fear of indiscriminate violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Strategic Vision for the War on Terror+\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, the War on Terror has been both a battle of arms\r\nand a battle of ideas--a fight against the terrorists and their\r\nmurderous ideology. In the short run, the fight involves the\r\napplication of all instruments of national power and influence to kill\r\nor capture the terrorists; deny them safehaven and control of any\r\nnation; prevent them from gaining access to WMD; render potential\r\nterrorist targets less attractive by strengthening security; and cut\r\noff their sources of funding and other resources they need to operate\r\nand survive. In the long run, winning the War on Terror means winning\r\nthe battle of ideas. Ideas can transform the embittered and\r\ndisillusioned either into murderers willing to kill innocents, or into\r\nfree peoples living harmoniously in a diverse society.\r\n\r\nThe battle of ideas helps to define the strategic intent of our\r\nNational Strategy for Combating Terrorism. The United States will\r\ncontinue to lead an expansive international effort in pursuit of a\r\ntwo-pronged vision:\r\n\r\n--The defeat of violent extremism as a threat to our way of life as a\r\nfree and open society; and\r\n\r\n--The creation of a global environment inhospitable to violent\r\nextremists and all who support them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Strategy for Winning the War on Terror+\r\n\r\n+_Long-term approach: Advancing effective democracy_+\r\n\r\nThe long-term solution for winning the War on Terror is the advancement\r\nof freedom and human dignity through effective democracy. Elections are\r\nthe most visible sign of a free society and can play a critical role in\r\nadvancing effective democracy. But elections alone are not enough.\r\nEffective democracies honor and uphold basic human rights, including\r\nfreedom of religion, conscience, speech, assembly, association, and\r\npress. They are responsive to their citizens, submitting to the will of\r\nthe people. Effective democracies exercise effective sovereignty and\r\nmaintain order within their own borders, address causes of conflict\r\npeacefully, protect independent and impartial systems of justice,\r\npunish crime, embrace the rule of law, and resist corruption. Effective\r\ndemocracies also limit the reach of government, protecting the\r\ninstitutions of civil society. In effective democracies, freedom is\r\nindivisible. They are the long-term antidote to the ideology of\r\nterrorism today. This is the battle of ideas.\r\n\r\nTo wage the battle of ideas effectively, we must recognize what does\r\nand does not give rise to terrorism:\r\n\r\n--Terrorism is not the inevitable by-product of poverty. Many of the\r\nSeptember 11 hijackers were from middle-class backgrounds, and many\r\nterrorist leaders, like bin Laden, are from privileged upbringings.\r\n\r\n--Terrorism is not simply a result of hostility to U.S. policy in Iraq.\r\nThe United States was attacked on September 11 and many years earlier,\r\nwell before we toppled the Saddam Hussein regime. Moreover, countries\r\nthat did not participate in Coalition efforts in Iraq have not been\r\nspared from terror attacks.\r\n\r\n--Terrorism is not simply a result of Israeli-Palestinian issues.\r\nAl-Qaida plotting for the September 11 attacks began in the 1990s,\r\nduring an active period in the peace process.\r\n\r\n--Terrorism is not simply a response to our efforts to prevent terror\r\nattacks. The al-Qaida network targeted the United States long before\r\nthe United States targeted al-Qaida. Indeed, the terrorists are\r\nemboldened more by perceptions of weakness than by demonstrations of\r\nresolve. Terrorists lure recruits by telling them that we are decadent,\r\neasily intimidated, and will retreat if attacked.\r\n\r\nThe terrorism we confront today springs from:\r\n\r\n--+_Political alienation_+. Transnational terrorists are recruited from\r\npopulations with no voice in their own government and see no legitimate\r\nway to promote change in their own country. Without a stake in the\r\nexisting order, they are vulnerable to manipulation by those who\r\nadvocate a perverse political vision based on violence and destruction.\r\n\r\n--+_Grievances that can be blamed on others_+. The failures the\r\nterrorists feel and see are blamed both on others and on perceived\r\ninjustices from the recent or sometimes distant past. The terrorists'\r\nrhetoric keeps wounds associated with this past fresh and raw, a potent\r\nmotivation for revenge and terror.\r\n\r\n--+_Subcultures of conspiracy and misinformation_+. Terrorists recruit\r\nmore effectively from populations whose information about the world is\r\ncontaminated by falsehoods and corrupted by conspiracy theories. The\r\ndistortions keep alive grievances and filter out facts that would\r\nchallenge popular prejudices and self-serving propaganda.\r\n\r\n--+_An ideology that justifies murder_+. Terrorism ultimately depends\r\nupon the appeal of an ideology that excuses or even glorifies the\r\ndeliberate killing of innocents. Islam has been twisted and made to\r\nserve an evil end, as in other times and places other religions have\r\nbeen similarly abused.\r\n\r\nDefeating terrorism in the long run requires that each of these factors\r\nbe addressed. Effective democracy provides a counter to each,\r\ndiminishing the underlying conditions terrorists seek to exploit.\r\n\r\n--In place of alienation, democracy offers an ownership stake in\r\nsociety, a chance to shape one's own future.\r\n\r\n--In place of festering grievances, democracy offers the rule of law,\r\nthe peaceful resolution of disputes, and the habits of advancing\r\ninterests through compromise.\r\n\r\n--In place of a culture of conspiracy and misinformation, democracy\r\noffers freedom of speech, independent media, and the marketplace of\r\nideas, which can expose and discredit falsehoods, prejudices, and\r\ndishonest propaganda.\r\n\r\n--In place of an ideology that justifies murder, democracy offers a\r\nrespect for human dignity that abhors the deliberate targeting of\r\ninnocent civilians.\r\n\r\nDemocracy is the antithesis of terrorist tyranny, which is why the\r\nterrorists denounce it and are willing to kill the innocent to stop it.\r\nDemocracy is based on empowerment, while the terrorists' ideology is\r\nbased on enslavement. Democracies expand the freedom of their citizens,\r\nwhile the terrorists seek to impose a single set of narrow beliefs.\r\nDemocracy sees individuals as equal in worth and dignity, having an\r\ninherent potential to create, govern themselves, and exercise basic\r\nfreedoms of speech and conscience. The terrorists see individuals as\r\nobjects to be exploited, and then to be ruled and oppressed.\r\n\r\nDemocracies are not immune to terrorism. In some democracies, some\r\nethnic or religious groups are unable or unwilling to grasp the\r\nbenefits of freedom otherwise available in the society. Such groups can\r\nevidence the same alienation and despair that the transnational\r\nterrorists exploit in undemocratic states. This accounts for the\r\nemergence in democratic societies of homegrown terrorists--even among\r\nsecond- and third-generation citizens. Even in these cases, the\r\nlong-term solution remains deepening the reach of democracy so that all\r\ncitizens enjoy its benefits. We will continue to guard against the\r\nemergence of homegrown terrorists within our own Homeland as well.\r\n\r\nThe strategy to counter the lies behind the terrorists' ideology and\r\ndeny them future recruits must empower the very people the terrorists\r\nmost want to exploit: the faithful followers of Islam. We will continue\r\nto support political reforms that empower peaceful Muslims to practice\r\nand interpret their faith. We will work to undermine the ideological\r\nunderpinnings of violent Islamic extremism and gain the support of\r\nnon-violent Muslims around the world. The most vital work will be done\r\nwithin the Islamic world itself, and Jordan, Morocco, and Indonesia,\r\namong others, have begun to make important strides in this effort.\r\nResponsible Islamic leaders need to denounce an ideology that distorts\r\nand exploits Islam to justify the murder of innocent people and defiles\r\na proud religion.\r\n\r\nMany of the Muslim faith are already making this commitment at great\r\npersonal risk. They realize they are a target of this ideology of\r\nterror. Everywhere we have joined in the fight against terrorism,\r\nMuslim allies have stood beside us, becoming partners in this vital\r\ncause. They know the stakes--the survival of their own liberty, the\r\nfuture of their own region, the justice and humanity of their own\r\ntraditions--and the United States is proud to stand beside them. Not\r\nonly will we continue to support the efforts of our Muslim partners\r\noverseas to reject violent extremism, we will continue to engage with\r\nand strengthen the efforts of Muslims within the United States as well.\r\nThrough outreach programs and public diplomacy we will reveal the\r\nterrorists' violent extremist ideology for what it is--a form of\r\ntotalitarianism following in the path of fascism and Nazism.\r\n\r\n\r\n+_Over the short term: Four priorities of action_+\r\n\r\nThe advance of freedom, opportunity, and human dignity through\r\ndemocracy is the long-term solution to the transnational terror\r\nmovement of today. To create the space and time for this long-term\r\nsolution to take root, we are operating along four priorities of action\r\nin the short term.\r\n\r\n+Prevent attacks by terrorist networks+. A government has no higher\r\nobligation than to protect the lives and livelihoods of its citizens.\r\nThe hard core among our terrorist enemies cannot be reformed or\r\ndeterred; they will be tracked down, captured, or killed. They will be\r\ncut off from the network of individuals, institutions, and other\r\nresources they depend on for support and that facilitate their\r\nactivities. The network, in turn, will be deterred, disrupted, and\r\ndisabled. Working with committed partners across the globe, we continue\r\nto use a broad range of tools at home and abroad to take the fight to\r\nthe terrorists, deny them entry to the United States, hinder their\r\nmovement across international borders, and establish protective\r\nmeasures to further reduce our vulnerability to attack.\r\n\r\n--+_Attack terrorists and their capacity to operate_+. The United\r\nStates and our partners continue to take active and effective measures\r\nagainst our primary terrorist enemies and certain other violent\r\nextremist groups that also pose a serious and continuing threat. We are\r\nattacking these terrorists and their capacity to operate effectively at\r\nhome and abroad. Specifically, through the use of all elements of\r\nnational power, we are denying or neutralizing what our terrorist\r\nenemies need to operate and survive:\r\n\r\n--Leaders, who provide the vision that followers strive to realize.\r\nThey also offer the necessary direction, discipline, and motivation for\r\naccomplishing a given goal or task. Most terrorist organizations have a\r\ncentral figure who embodies the cause, in addition to several\r\noperational leaders and managers who provide guidance on a functional,\r\nregional, or local basis. The loss of a leader can degrade a group's\r\ncohesiveness and in some cases may trigger its collapse. Other\r\nterrorist groups adapt by promoting experienced cadre or decentralizing\r\ntheir command structures, making our challenge in neutralizing\r\nterrorist leaders even greater.\r\n\r\n--Foot soldiers, which include the operatives, facilitators, and\r\ntrainers in a terrorist network. They are the lifeblood of a terrorist\r\ngroup--they make it run. Technology and globalization have enhanced the\r\nability of groups to recruit foot soldiers to their cause, including\r\nwell-educated recruits. We and our partners will not only continue to\r\ncapture and kill foot soldiers, but will work to halt the influx of\r\nrecruits into terrorist organizations as well. Without a continuing\r\nsupply of personnel to facilitate and carry out attacks, these groups\r\nultimately will cease to operate.\r\n\r\n--Weapons, or the tools of terrorists and the means by which they\r\nmurder to advance their cause. Terrorists exploit many avenues to\r\ndevelop and acquire weapons, including through state sponsors, theft or\r\ncapture, and black market purchases. Our enemies employ existing\r\ntechnology--explosives, small arms, missiles and other devices--in both\r\nconventional and unconventional ways to terrorize and achieve mass\r\neffects. They also use non-weapon technologies as weapons, such as the\r\nairplanes on September 11. Our greatest and gravest concern, however,\r\nis WMD in the hands of terrorists. Preventing their acquisition and the\r\ndire consequences of their use is a key priority of this strategy.\r\n\r\n--Funds, which provide the fungible, easily transportable means to\r\nsecure all other forms of material support necessary to the survival\r\nand operation of terrorist organizations. Our enemies raise funds\r\nthrough a variety of means, including soliciting contributions from\r\nsupporters; operating businesses, NGOs, and charitable fronts; and\r\nengaging in criminal activity such as fraud, extortion, and kidnapping\r\nfor ransom. They transfer funds through several mechanisms, including\r\nthe formal banking system, wire transfers, debit or \"smart\" cards, cash\r\ncouriers, and hawalas, which are alternative remittance systems based\r\non trust. Effective disruption of funding sources and interdiction of\r\ntransfer mechanisms can help our partners and us to starve terrorist\r\nnetworks of the material support they require.\r\n\r\n--Communications, which allow terrorists the ability to receive, store,\r\nmanipulate, and exchange information. The methods by which terrorists\r\ncommunicate are numerous and varied. Our enemies rely on couriers and\r\nface-to-face contacts with associates and tend to use what is\r\naccessible in their local areas as well as what they can afford. They\r\nalso use today's technologies with increasing acumen and\r\nsophistication. This is especially true with the Internet, which they\r\nexploit to create and disseminate propaganda, recruit new members,\r\nraise funds and other material resources, provide instruction on\r\nweapons and tactics, and plan operations. Without a communications\r\nability, terrorist groups cannot effectively organize operations,\r\nexecute attacks, or spread their ideology. We and our partners will\r\ncontinue to target the communication nodes of our enemy.\r\n\r\n--Propaganda operations, which are used by terrorists to justify\r\nviolent action as well as inspire individuals to support or join the\r\nmovement. The ability of terrorists to exploit the Internet and 24/7\r\nworldwide media coverage allows them to bolster their prominence as\r\nwell as feed a steady diet of radical ideology, twisted images, and\r\nconspiracy theories to potential recruits in all corners of the globe.\r\nBesides a global reach, these technologies allow terrorists to\r\npropagate their message quickly, often before an effective counter to\r\nterrorist messages can be coordinated and distributed. These are force\r\nmultipliers for our enemy.\r\n\r\n--+_Deny terrorists entry to the United States and disrupt their travel\r\ninternationally_+. Denying our enemies the tools to travel\r\ninternationally and across and within our borders significantly impedes\r\ntheir mobility and can inhibit their effectiveness. They rely on\r\nillicit networks to facilitate travel and often obtain false\r\nidentification documents through theft or in-house forgery operations.\r\nWe will continue to enhance the security of the American people through\r\na layered system of protections along our borders, at our ports, on our\r\nroadways and railways, in our skies, and with our international\r\npartners. We will continue to develop and enhance security practices\r\nand technologies to reduce vulnerabilities in the dynamic\r\ntransportation network, inhibit terrorists from crossing U.S. borders,\r\nand detect and prevent terrorist travel within the United States. Our\r\nefforts will include improving all aspects of aviation security;\r\npromoting secure travel and identity documents; disrupting travel\r\nfacilitation networks; improving border security and visa screening;\r\nand building international capacity and improving international\r\ninformation exchange to secure travel and combat terrorist travel. Our\r\nNational Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel and our National Strategy\r\nfor Maritime Security will help guide our efforts.\r\n\r\n--+_Defend potential targets of attack_+. Our enemies are\r\nopportunistic, exploiting vulnerabilities and seeking alternatives to\r\nthose targets with increased security measures. The targeting trend\r\nsince at least September 11 has been away from hardened sites, such as\r\nofficial government facilities with formidable security, and toward\r\nsofter targets--schools, restaurants, places of worship, and nodes of\r\npublic transportation--where innocent civilians gather and which are\r\nnot always well secured. Specific targets vary, but they tend to be\r\nsymbolic and often selected because they will produce mass casualties,\r\neconomic damage, or both.\r\n\r\nWhile it is impossible to protect completely all potential targets all\r\nthe time, we can deter and disrupt attacks, as well as mitigate the\r\neffects of those that do occur, through strategic security improvements\r\nat sites both at home and overseas. Among our most important defensive\r\nefforts is the protection of critical infrastructures and key\r\nresources--sectors such as energy, food and agriculture, water,\r\ntelecommunications, public health, transportation, the defense\r\nindustrial base, government facilities, postal and shipping, the\r\nchemical industry, emergency services, monuments and icons, information\r\ntechnology, dams, commercial facilities, banking and finance, and\r\nnuclear reactors, materials, and waste. These are systems and assets so\r\nvital that their destruction or incapacitation would have a\r\ndebilitating effect on the security of our Nation. We will also\r\ncontinue to protect various assets such as historical attractions or\r\ncertain highprofile events whose destruction or attack would not\r\nnecessarily debilitate our national security but could damage the\r\nmorale and confidence of the American people. Beyond the Homeland, we\r\nwill continue to protect and defend U.S. citizens, diplomatic missions,\r\nand military facilities overseas, as well as work with our partners to\r\nstrengthen their ability to protect their populations and critical\r\ninfrastructures.\r\n\r\n+Deny WMD to rogue states and terrorist allies who seek to use them+.\r\nWeapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists is one of the\r\ngravest threats we face. We have taken aggressive efforts to deny\r\nterrorists access to WMD-related materials, equipment, and expertise,\r\nbut we will enhance these activities through an integrated effort at\r\nall levels of government and with the private sector and our foreign\r\npartners to stay ahead of this dynamic and evolving threat. In July\r\n2006, the United States and Russia launched the Global Initiative to\r\nCombat Nuclear Terrorism to establish an international framework to\r\nenhance cooperation, build capacity, and act to combat the global\r\nthreat of nuclear terrorism. This initiative will help drive\r\ninternational focus and action to ensure the international community is\r\ndoing everything possible to prevent nuclear weapons, materials, and\r\nknowledge from reaching the hands of terrorists.\r\n\r\nWith regard to our own efforts, our comprehensive approach for\r\naddressing WMD terrorism hinges on six objectives, and we will work\r\nacross all objectives simultaneously to maximize our ability to\r\neliminate the threat.\r\n\r\n--+_Determine terrorists' intentions, capabilities, and plans to\r\ndevelop or acquire WMD_+. We need to understand and assess the\r\ncredibility of threat reporting and provide technical assessments of\r\nterrorists' WMD capabilities.\r\n\r\n--+_Deny terrorists access to the materials, expertise, and other\r\nenabling capabilities required to develop WMD_+. We have an aggressive,\r\nglobal approach to deny our enemies access to WMDrelated materials\r\n(with a particular focus on weapons-usable fissile materials),\r\nfabrication expertise, methods of transport, sources of funds, and\r\nother capabilities that facilitate the execution of a WMD attack. In\r\naddition to building upon existing initiatives to secure materials, we\r\nare developing innovative approaches that blend classic\r\ncounterproliferation, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism efforts.\r\n\r\n--+_Deter terrorists from employing WMD_+. A new deterrence calculus\r\ncombines the need to deter terrorists and supporters from contemplating\r\na WMD attack and, failing that, to dissuade them from actually\r\nconducting an attack. Traditional threats may not work because\r\nterrorists show a wanton disregard for the lives of innocents and in\r\nsome cases for their own lives. We require a range of deterrence\r\nstrategies that are tailored to the situation and the adversary. We\r\nwill make clear that terrorists and those who aid or sponsor a WMD\r\nattack would face the prospect of an overwhelming response to any use\r\nof such weapons. We will seek to dissuade attacks by improving our\r\nability to mitigate the effects of a terrorist attack involving WMD--to\r\nlimit or prevent large-scale casualties, economic disruption, or panic.\r\nFinally, we will ensure that our capacity to determine the source of\r\nany attack is well-known, and that our determination to respond\r\noverwhelmingly to any attack is never in doubt.\r\n\r\n--+_Detect and disrupt terrorists' attempted movement of WMD-related\r\nmaterials, weapons, and personnel_+. We will expand our global\r\ncapability for detecting illicit materials, weapons, and personnel\r\ntransiting abroad or heading for the United States or U.S. interests\r\noverseas. We will use our global partnerships, international\r\nagreements, and ongoing border security and interdiction efforts. We\r\nalso will continue to work with countries to enact and enforce strict\r\npenalties for WMD trafficking and other suspect WMD-related activities.\r\n\r\n--+_Prevent and respond to a WMD-related terrorist attack_+. Once the\r\npossibility of a WMD attack against the United States has been\r\ndetected, we will seek to contain, interdict, and eliminate the threat.\r\nWe will continue to develop requisite capabilities to eliminate the\r\npossibility of a WMD operation and to prevent a possible follow-on\r\nattack. We will prepare ourselves for possible WMD incidents by\r\ndeveloping capabilities to manage the range of consequences that may\r\nresult from such an attack against the United States or our interests\r\naround the world.\r\n\r\n--Define the nature and source of a terrorist-employed WMD device.\r\nShould a WMD terrorist attack occur, the rapid identification of the\r\nsource and perpetrator of an attack will enable our response efforts\r\nand may be critical in disrupting follow-on attacks. We will develop\r\nthe capability to assign responsibility for the intended or actual use\r\nof WMD via accurate attribution--the rapid fusion of technical forensic\r\ndata with intelligence and law enforcement information.\r\n\r\n+Deny terrorists the support and sanctuary of rogue states+. The United\r\nStates and its allies and partners in the War on Terror make no\r\ndistinction between those who commit acts of terror and those who\r\nsupport and harbor terrorists. Any government that chooses to be an\r\nally of terror has chosen to be an enemy of freedom, justice, and\r\npeace. The world will hold those regimes to account. To break the bonds\r\nbetween rogue states and our terrorist enemies, we will work to disrupt\r\nthe flow of resources from states to terrorists while simultaneously\r\nworking to end state sponsorship of terrorism.\r\n\r\n--+_End state sponsorship of terrorism_+. State sponsors are a critical\r\nresource for our terrorist enemies, often providing funds, weapons,\r\ntraining, safe passage, and sanctuary. Some of these countries have\r\ndeveloped or have the capability to develop WMD and other destabilizing\r\ntechnologies that could fall into the hands of terrorists. The United\r\nStates currently designates five state sponsors of terrorism: Iran,\r\nSyria, Sudan, North Korea, and Cuba. We will maintain sanctions against\r\nthem and promote their international isolation until they end their\r\nsupport for terrorists, including the provision of sanctuary. To\r\nfurther isolate these regimes and persuade other states not to sponsor\r\nterror, we will use a range of tools and efforts to delegitimate\r\nterrorism as an instrument of statecraft. Any act of international\r\nterrorism, whether committed by a state or individual, is\r\nreprehensible, a threat to international peace and security, and should\r\nbe unequivocally and uniformly rejected. Similarly, states that harbor\r\nand assist terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists, and they will be\r\nheld to account.\r\n\r\nIran remains the most active state sponsor of international terrorism.\r\nThrough its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Ministry of\r\nIntelligence and Security, the regime in Tehran plans terrorist\r\noperations and supports groups such as Lebanese Hizballah, Hamas, and\r\nPalestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Iran also remains unwilling to account\r\nfor and bring to justice senior al-Qaida members it detained in 2003.\r\nMost troubling is the potential WMD-terrorism nexus that emanates from\r\nTehran. Syria also is a significant state sponsor of terrorism and thus\r\na priority for concern. The regime in Damascus supports and provides\r\nhaven to Hizballah, Hamas, and PIJ. We will continue to stand with the\r\npeople of Iran and Syria against the regimes that oppress them at home\r\nand sponsor terror abroad.\r\n\r\nWhile Iranian and Syrian terrorist activities are especially worrisome,\r\nwe are pressing all state sponsors to take the steps that are required\r\nto have state sponsorship designation rescinded. Each case is unique,\r\nand our approach to each will be tailored accordingly. Moreover, we\r\nnever foreclose future membership in the coalition against tyranny and\r\nterror. The designation of Iraq as a state sponsor was rescinded in\r\n2004 as it transitioned to democracy, ceased its terrorist support, and\r\nbecame an ally in the War on Terror. Similarly, the United States in\r\nJune 2006 rescinded the designation of Libya, which has renounced\r\nterrorism and since September 11 has provided excellent cooperation to\r\nthe United States and other members of the international community in\r\nresponse to the new global threats we face. Libya can serve as a model\r\nfor states who wish to rejoin the community of nations by rejecting\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n--+_Disrupt the flow of resources from rogue states to terrorists_+.\r\nUntil we can eliminate state sponsorship of terror, we will disrupt and\r\ndeny the flow of support from states to terrorists. We will continue to\r\ncreate and strengthen international will to interdict material support,\r\nakin to our efforts in the Proliferation Security Initiative--a global\r\neffort to stop shipments of WMD, their delivery systems, and related\r\nmaterial. We will build international cooperation to financially\r\nisolate rogue states and their terrorist proxies. We also will continue\r\nto expose the vehicles and fronts that states use to support their\r\nterrorist surrogates.\r\n\r\n+Deny terrorists control of any nation they would use as a base and\r\nlaunching pad for terror+. Our terrorist enemies are striving to claim\r\na strategic country as a haven for terror. From this base, they could\r\ndestabilize the Middle East and strike America and other free nations\r\nwith everincreasing violence. This we can never allow. Our enemies had\r\nestablished a sanctuary in Afghanistan prior to Operation Enduring\r\nFreedom, and today terrorists see Iraq as the central front of their\r\nfight against the United States. This is why success in helping the\r\nAfghan and Iraqi peoples forge effective democracies is vital. We will\r\ncontinue to prevent terrorists from exploiting ungoverned or\r\nunder-governed areas as safehavens--secure spaces that allow our\r\nenemies to plan, organize, train, and prepare for operations.\r\nUltimately, we will eliminate these havens altogether.\r\n\r\n--+_Eliminate physical safehavens_+. Physical sanctuaries can stretch\r\nacross an entire sovereign state, be limited to specific ungoverned or\r\nill-governed areas in an otherwise functioning state, or cross national\r\nborders. In some cases the government wants to exercise greater\r\neffective sovereignty over its lands and maintain control within its\r\nborders but lacks the necessary capacity. We will strengthen the\r\ncapacity of such War on Terror partners to reclaim full control of\r\ntheir territory through effective police, border, and other security\r\nforces as well as functioning systems of justice. To further counter\r\nterrorist exploitation of under-governed lands, we will promote\r\neffective economic development to help ensure long-term stability and\r\nprosperity. In failing states or states emerging from conflict, the\r\nrisks are significant. Spoilers can take advantage of instability to\r\ncreate conditions terrorists can exploit. We will continue to work with\r\nforeign partners and international organizations to help prevent\r\nconflict and respond to state failure by building foreign capacity for\r\npeace operations, reconstruction, and stabilization so that countries\r\nin transition can reach a sustainable path to peace, democracy, and\r\nprosperity. Where physical havens cross national boundaries, we will\r\ncontinue to work with the affected countries to help establish\r\neffective cross-border control. Yet some countries will be reluctant to\r\nfulfill their sovereign responsibilities to combat terrorist-related\r\nactivities within their borders. In addition to cooperation and\r\nsustained diplomacy, we will continue to partner with the international\r\ncommunity to persuade states to meet their obligations to combat\r\nterrorism and deny safehaven under U.N. Security Council Resolution\r\n1373.\r\n\r\nYet safehavens are not just limited to geographic territories. They\r\nalso can be non-physical or virtual, existing within legal, cyber, and\r\nfinancial systems.\r\n\r\n--+_Legal safehavens_+. Some legal systems lack adequate procedural,\r\nsubstantive, and international assistance laws that enable effective\r\ninvestigation, prosecution, and extradition of terrorists. Such gaps\r\noffer a haven in which terrorists and their organizations can operate\r\nfree from fear of prosecution. In the United States we have developed a\r\ndomestic legal system that supports effective investigation and\r\nprosecution of terrorist activities while preserving individual\r\nprivacy, the First Amendment rights of association, religious freedom,\r\nfree speech, and other civil rights. We will continue to work with\r\nforeign partners to build their legal capacity to investigate,\r\nprosecute, and assist in the foreign prosecution of the full range of\r\nterrorist activities--from provision of material support to conspiracy\r\nto operational planning to a completed act of terrorism.\r\n\r\n--+_Cyber safehavens_+. The Internet provides an inexpensive,\r\nanonymous, geographically unbounded, and largely unregulated virtual\r\nhaven for terrorists. Our enemies use the Internet to develop and\r\ndisseminate propaganda, recruit new members, raise and transfer funds,\r\ntrain members on weapons use and tactics, and plan operations.\r\nTerrorist organizations can use virtual safehavens based anywhere in\r\nthe world, regardless of where their members or operatives are located.\r\nUse of the Internet, however, creates opportunities for us to exploit.\r\nTo counter terrorist use of the Internet as a virtual sanctuary, we\r\nwill discredit terrorist propaganda by promoting truthful and peaceful\r\nmessages. We will seek ultimately to deny the Internet to the\r\nterrorists as an effective safehaven for their propaganda,\r\nproselytizing, recruitment, fundraising, training, and operational\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\n--+_Financial safehavens_+. Financial systems are used by terrorist\r\norganizations as a fiscal sanctuary in which to store and transfer the\r\nfunds that support their survival and operations. Terrorist\r\norganizations use a variety of financial systems, including formal\r\nbanking, wire transfers, debit and other stored value cards, online\r\nvalue storage and value transfer systems, the informal hawala system,\r\nand cash couriers. Terrorist organizations may be able to take\r\nadvantage of such financial systems either as the result of willful\r\ncomplicity by financial institutions or as the result of poor oversight\r\nand monitoring practices. Domestically, we have hardened our financial\r\nsystems against terrorist abuse by promulgating effective regulations,\r\nrequiring financial institutions to report suspicious transactions, and\r\nbuilding effective public/private partnerships. We will continue to\r\nwork with foreign partners to ensure they develop and implement similar\r\nregulations, requirements, and partnerships with their financial\r\ninstitutions. We also will continue to use the domestic and\r\ninternational designation and targeted sanctions regimes provided by,\r\namong other mechanisms, Executive Order 13224, USA PATRIOT Act Section\r\n311, and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 and subsequent\r\nresolutions. These tools identify and isolate those actors who form\r\npart of terrorist networks or facilitate their activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Institutionalizing Our Strategy for Long-term Success+\r\n\r\nThe War on Terror will be a long war. Yet we have mobilized to win\r\nother long wars, and we can and will win this one. During the Cold War\r\nwe created an array of domestic and international institutions and\r\nenduring partnerships to defeat the threat of communism. Today, we\r\nrequire similar transformational structures to carry forward the fight\r\nagainst terror and to help ensure our ultimate success:\r\n\r\n--+_Establish and maintain international standards of accountability_+.\r\nStates that have sovereign rights also have sovereign responsibilities,\r\nincluding the responsibility to combat terrorism. The international\r\ncommunity has developed a compelling body of international obligations\r\nrelating to counterterrorism. Twelve universal conventions and\r\nprotocols in force against terrorism have been developed under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations as well as various U.N. Security Council\r\nResolutions related to combating terror. These include UNSCR 1373,\r\nwhich imposes binding obligations on all states to suppress and prevent\r\nterrorist financing, improve their border controls, enhance information\r\nsharing and law enforcement cooperation, suppress the recruitment of\r\nterrorists, and deny them sanctuary.\r\n\r\nThe Group of Eight (G-8) along with other multilateral and regional\r\nbodies also have been instrumental in developing landmark\r\ncounterterrorism standards and best practices that have been adopted by\r\ninternational standard-setting organizations. But our obligations are\r\nnot static. We will collaborate with our partners to update and tailor\r\ninternational obligations to meet the evolving nature of the terrorist\r\nenemies and threats we face. We also will work to ensure that each\r\ncountry is both willing and able to meet its counterterrorist\r\nresponsibilities. Finally, we will not just continually monitor whether\r\nwe and the community of nations are meeting these standards but will\r\nevaluate if we are achieving results both individually and collectively.\r\n\r\n--+_Strengthen coalitions and partnerships_+. Since September 11, most\r\nof our important successes against al-Qaida and other terrorist\r\norganizations have been made possible through effective partnerships.\r\nContinued success depends on the actions of a powerful coalition of\r\nnations maintaining a united front against terror. Multilateral groups\r\nsuch as the International Maritime Organization and the International\r\nCivil Aviation Organization, as well as regional organizations such as\r\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Organization of American\r\nStates, NATO, the European Union, the African Union, and the\r\nAssociation of South East Asia Nations, among others, are essential\r\nelements of this front.\r\n\r\nWe will ensure that such international cooperation is an enduring\r\nfeature of the long war we will fight. We will continue to leverage the\r\ncomparative advantage of these institutions and organizations--drawing\r\non what each does best in counterterrorism, from setting standards to\r\ndeveloping regional strategies to providing forums for training and\r\neducation. Indeed, a significant part of this effort includes expanding\r\npartnership capacity. We are building the capacity of foreign partners\r\nin all areas of counterterrorism activities, including strengthening\r\ntheir ability to conduct law enforcement, intelligence, and military\r\ncounterterrorism operations. Through the provision of training,\r\nequipment, and other assistance, the United States, along with a\r\ncoalition of willing and able states and organizations, will enhance\r\nthe ability of partners across the globe to attack and defeat\r\nterrorists, deny them funding and freedom of movement, secure their\r\ncritical infrastructures, and deny terrorists access to WMD and\r\nsafehavens. Ultimately, it will be essential for our partners to come\r\ntogether to facilitate appropriate international, regional, and local\r\nsolutions to the challenges of terrorism.\r\n\r\n--+_Enhance government architecture and interagency collaboration_+. In\r\nthe aftermath of September 11, we have enhanced our counterterrorism\r\narchitecture and interagency collaboration by setting clear national\r\npriorities and transforming the government to achieve those priorities.\r\nWe have established the Department of Homeland Security, bringing under\r\none authority 22 Federal entities with vital roles to play in\r\npreventing terrorist attacks within the Homeland, reducing America's\r\nvulnerability to terrorism, and minimizing the damage and facilitating\r\nthe recovery from attacks that do occur. We have reorganized the\r\nIntelligence Community. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was\r\ncreated to better integrate the efforts of the Community into a more\r\nunified, coordinated, and effective whole. The DNI also launched a new\r\nOpen Source Center to coordinate open source intelligence and ensure\r\nthis information is integrated into Intelligence Community products.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) was established\r\nto serve as a multiagency center analyzing and integrating all\r\nintelligence pertaining to terrorism, including threats to U.S.\r\ninterests at home and abroad. NCTC also is responsible for developing,\r\nimplementing, and assessing the effectiveness of strategic operational\r\nplanning efforts to achieve counterterrorism objectives. We similarly\r\nestablished a National Counterproliferation Center to manage and\r\ncoordinate planning and activities in those areas.\r\n\r\nThe transformation extends to the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\r\nwhich, with the help of legislation such as the USA PATRIOT Act, is now\r\nmore fully integrated with the Intelligence Community, has refocused\r\nits efforts on preventing terrorism, and has been provided important\r\ntools to pursue this mission. CIA also has transformed to fulfill its\r\nrole to provide overall direction for and coordination of overseas\r\nhuman intelligence operations of Intelligence Community elements. In\r\naddition, the Department of the Treasury created the Office of\r\nTerrorism and Financial Intelligence to arm ourselves for the long term\r\nwith the intelligence and tools to undercut the financial underpinnings\r\nof terrorism around the world.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Defense also is preparing to meet a wider range of\r\nasymmetric challenges by restructuring its capabilities, rearranging\r\nits global posture, and adapting its forces to be better positioned to\r\nfight the War on Terror. This includes significantly expanding Special\r\nOperations Forces, increasing the capabilities of its general purpose\r\nforces to conduct irregular warfare operations, and initiating the\r\nlargest rearrangement of its global force posture since the end of\r\nWorld War II.\r\n\r\nThe Department of State is implementing a new framework for foreign\r\nassistance to establish more integrated and coherent strategic\r\ndirection and tactical plans to meet our current and longterm\r\nchallenges, including terrorism. The State Department also is\r\nrepositioning its domestic and overseas staff to better promote\r\nAmerica's policies and interests and have more direct local and\r\nregional impact. This transformational diplomacy positions State to\r\nwork with partners around the world to build and sustain democratic,\r\nwell-governed states that will respond to the needs of their people and\r\nconduct themselves responsibly in the international system.\r\n\r\nWe will sustain the transformation already under way in these and other\r\ndepartments and agencies. Moreover, we will continue to build and\r\nstrengthen a unified team across the counterterrorism community, and a\r\nkey component of this effort will be fostering \"jointness.\" Where\r\npracticable, we will increase interagency and intergovernmental\r\nassignments for personnel in counterterrorism-related positions. This\r\nwill help to break down organizational stovepipes and advance the\r\nexchange of ideas and practices for more effective counterterrorism\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n--+_Foster intellectual and human capital_+. To better prepare\r\nourselves for a generational struggle against terrorism and the\r\nextremist ideologies fueling it, we will create an expert community of\r\ncounterterrorism professionals. We will continue to establish more\r\nsystematic programs for the development and education of current\r\nprofessionals in counterterrorism-related fields. We will substantively\r\nexpand our existing programs with curricula that includes not only\r\ntraining in counterterrorism policies, plans and planning, strategies,\r\nand legal authorities, but continuing education in appropriate area\r\nstudies, religious philosophies, and languages. We also will ensure\r\nthat personnel throughout all levels of government and in all fields\r\nrelated to combating terror are invited to participate.\r\n\r\nYet such development and education programs must not be restricted to\r\ncurrent counterterrorism personnel. We will support multidisciplinary\r\nstudies throughout our educational system to build a knowledgeable pool\r\nof counterterrorism recruits for the future. The recent National\r\nSecurity Language Initiative is an essential step forward. It will help\r\nto expand U.S. foreign language education beginning in early childhood\r\nand continuing throughout formal schooling and into the workforce. Our\r\nefforts to foster intellectual and human capital also will extend\r\nbeyond our borders--to academic and non-governmental forums with our\r\ninternational partners to discuss and enhance our knowledge about the\r\ncritical counterterrorism challenges we confront.\r\n\r\nIn the War on Terror, there is also a need for all elements of our\r\nNation--from Federal, State, and local governments to the private\r\nsector to local communities and individual citizens--to help create and\r\nshare responsibilities in a Culture of Preparedness. This Culture of\r\nPreparedness, which applies to all catastrophes and all hazards,\r\nnatural or man-made, rests on four principles: a shared acknowledgement\r\nof the certainty of future catastrophes and that creating a prepared\r\nNation will be a continuing challenge; the importance of initiative and\r\naccountability at all levels of society; the role of citizen and\r\ncommunity preparedness; and finally, the roles of each level of\r\ngovernment and the private sector in creating a prepared Nation. Built\r\nupon a foundation of partnerships, common goals, and shared\r\nresponsibility, the creation of a Culture of Preparedness will be among\r\nour most profound and enduring transformations in the broader effort to\r\nprotect and defend the Homeland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Conclusion+\r\n\r\nSince the September 11 attacks, America is safer, but we are not yet\r\nsafe. We have done much to degrade al-Qaida and its affiliates and to\r\nundercut the perceived legitimacy of terrorism. Our Muslim partners are\r\nspeaking out against those who seek to use their religion to justify\r\nviolence and a totalitarian vision of the world. We have significantly\r\nexpanded our counterterrorism coalition, transforming old adversaries\r\ninto new and vital partners in the War on Terror. We have liberated\r\nmore than 50 million Afghans and Iraqis from despotism, terrorism, and\r\noppression, permitting the first free elections in recorded history for\r\neither nation. In addition, we have transformed our governmental\r\ninstitutions and framework to wage a generational struggle. There will\r\ncontinue to be challenges ahead, but along with our partners, we will\r\nattack terrorism and its ideology, and bring hope and freedom to the\r\npeople of the world. This is how we will win the War on Terror.",
