The problem thus\r\npresented has been keenly discussed. On the one hand we have the\r\nadvocates of the Block Vote asserting that the party in a majority is\r\nentitled to return all six senators; and on the other, a small band of\r\nardent reformers pressing the claims of the Hare system, which would\r\nallow the people in each State to group themselves into six sections,\r\neach returning one senator. The claim that every section of the people\r\nis entitled to representation appears at first sight so just that it\r\nseems intolerable that a method should have been used all these years\r\nwhich excludes the minority in each electorate from any share of\r\nrepresentation; and, of course, the injustice becomes more evident when\r\nthe electorate returns several members. But in view of the adage that\r\nit is the excellence of old institutions which preserves them, it is\r\nsurely a rash conclusion that the present method of election has no\r\ncompensating merit. We believe there is such a merit--namely, that _the\r\npresent method of election has developed the party system_. Once this\r\ntruth is grasped, it is quite evident that the Hare system would be\r\nabsolutely destructive to party government, since each electorate would\r\nbe contested, not by two organized parties, but by several groups. For\r\nit is precisely this splitting into groups which is causing such anxiety\r\namong thoughtful observers as to the future of representative\r\ninstitutions; Mr. Lecky has attributed to it, in his \"Democracy and\r\nLiberty,\" the decline in the parliamentary system which has accompanied\r\nthe progress of democracy all over the world. The object of this book is\r\nto suggest a reform, which possesses the advantages of both methods and\r\nthe disadvantages of neither; which will still ensure that each\r\nelectorate is contested by the two main parties, but will allow its just\r\nshare of representation to each; and which will, by discouraging the\r\nformation of minor groups, provide a remedy for the evil instead of\r\naggravating it.\r\n\r\n                                                                T.R.A.\r\n                                                                H.P.C.A.\r\n\r\n325 COLLINS STREET, MELBOURNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAPPLIED TO\r\n\r\nPARTY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL REPRESENTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld establishments, like the British Constitution, said Edmund Burke,\r\n\"are not often constructed after any theory; theories are rather drawn\r\nfrom them.\" In setting out on an endeavour to understand the principles\r\nunderlying political representation, the saying expresses exactly the\r\ncourse which should be followed. The inquiry is the more necessary as,\r\nalthough representation more than anything else in the domain of\r\ngovernment distinguishes the modern from the ancient world, the ideas\r\nwhich prevail as to the part it has played, is playing, and is destined\r\nto play on the world's stage are not merely hazy, but extremely\r\ninaccurate. The intimate connection of representation with the progress\r\nwhich has followed its introduction is so little recognized that the\r\nmost advanced democracies are now willing to listen to any proposal to\r\nreturn to direct government. In spite of the fact that the nineteenth\r\ncentury has witnessed the triumph of the historical method in most\r\nfields of social inquiry, the dangers of _a priori_ speculation on\r\npolitical institutions are as much in evidence as when Burke wrote.\r\n\r\nIf we would understand, then, the meaning of representative\r\ninstitutions, it is in the gradual development of the \"mother of\r\nparliaments\" that we must seek for the most reliable information. We\r\nmust be careful, however, to leave out of sight those features of the\r\ngrowth of the British Constitution which are merely the expression of\r\ntransitory social conditions, and to confine our attention to the\r\nlandmarks which bear directly on the inquiry. The subject is best\r\ndivided into two stages; the first characterized by the origin of\r\nrepresentation; and the second by the division into parties, and the\r\ncreation of cabinet government.\r\n\r\n+The First Stage of Representation.+--Rightly to understand the\r\nconditions which led to the introduction and development of the\r\nrepresentative principle, we must look back to the period immediately\r\nfollowing the signing of the Great Charter by the tyrant King John.\r\n\r\nThe Charter reaffirmed the ancient principle that free Englishmen should\r\nnot be taxed without their consent, and representation was the natural\r\noutcome of that provision. A brief glance at the social conditions of\r\nthe time is necessary to understand why this was so. First, it must be\r\nremembered that the true political unit of ancient times was the city\r\nor local community. England at that time was a collection of local\r\ncommunities, having more or less a corporate life. Then, again, there\r\nwere the three estates of the realm--the clergy, the lords, and the\r\ncommons--who were accustomed to confer with the King on public affairs.\r\nThe stage which marks the birth of representation was when these\r\ndifferent estates and communities were asked to tax themselves to\r\nrelieve the necessities of the King. It was obviously impossible that\r\nthe consent of every freeman should be obtained, hence the duty had to\r\nbe deputed to agents. Now, the idea of agency was not unknown in the\r\nancient world, but that agents should have power to bind those for whom\r\nthey acted was something entirely new. It was necessary, however, that\r\nthey should have this power, and it suited the King's convenience that\r\nthey should exercise it. Already, in the earliest writ of which we have\r\nknowledge, summoning each shire to send two good and discreet knights,\r\nit was provided that they should be chosen in the stead of each and all.\r\nThis happened in 1254, and in the following year the clergy were also\r\nsummoned for the same purpose of granting aid to the King. In the\r\nmeantime the merchants and trade guilds in the cities were growing rich.\r\nThe King cast longing eyes on their possessions, and wished to tax them.\r\nSo we find that in 1264 Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, issued the\r\ncelebrated writ summoning each of the cities and boroughs to send two\r\nof its more discreet and worthy citizens and burgesses. This is\r\nsometimes regarded as the beginning of the House of Commons, but it was\r\nreally not until the fourteenth century that these several assemblies,\r\neach of which up till then taxed itself separately and legislated in its\r\nown sphere, coalesced into the present Houses. First the lower clergy\r\nfell out, and, with the knights, citizens, and burgesses, were merged\r\ninto the House of Commons; and the higher prelates with the earls and\r\nbarons formed the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the first stage of representation. What was the nature of\r\nthis new force which had come into the world and was destined to so\r\nprofoundly affect the whole course of human affairs? One result of\r\nimmense importance is apparent at a glance. It solved a problem which\r\nhad baffled the ancients--that of the nationalization of local\r\ncommunities on a free basis. But it is generally assumed that the only\r\ndifficulty overcome was that of size; that the representative assembly\r\nis a mere substitute for the larger assembly of the whole nation.\r\nStarting with this assumption, it is claimed that the representative\r\nassembly should be a mirror of the people on a small scale, and the more\r\nfaithfully it reflects their faults as well as their virtues, their\r\nignorance as well as their intelligence, the more truly representative\r\nit is said to be. It is even asserted that with the modern facilities\r\nfor taking a poll, representative government might be dispensed with\r\nand the people allowed to govern themselves. Democracy, we are assured,\r\nmeans that every man should exercise an equality of political power.\r\nNow, if this conception is correct, we should at once insist that every\r\nlaw should be submitted to a direct referendum of the people; that\r\nlegislators should be mere agents for drawing up laws; and that the\r\nexecutive should be directly responsible to and elected by the people.\r\nBut if representation is not a mere substitute for the direct action of\r\nthe people this idea as to the true line of democratic progress falls to\r\nthe ground. The whole question, therefore, hinges on what representation\r\nis and what are the principles underlying it.\r\n\r\nLooking back to the history of its introduction, we have seen that it\r\nwas only in proportion as the deputies of the local communities were not\r\nregarded as delegates or agents that they became representatives.\r\nProfessor E. Jenks has written an interesting article in the\r\n_Contemporary Review_ for December, 1898, in which he advances the\r\ntheory that representation is a union of the ideas of agency, borrowed\r\nfrom the Roman law, and of vicarious liability from barbaric sources. As\r\nto the latter he points out that in Anglo-Saxon times the only way for\r\nthe King to control the free local communities was to exact hostages\r\ntill crimes were punished or fines paid. In England, where these ideas\r\nwere combined, constitutional monarchy was firmly established; but in\r\nFrance, Germany, &c, in whose medieval parliaments the idea of agency\r\nprevailed, and where in consequence the parliamentary idea was weak,\r\nabsolute monarchy held its ground. When Edward I. desired for purposes\r\nof his own to emphasize the unlimited liability of political\r\nrepresentatives, and insisted that they should have \"full and sufficient\r\npower to do what of common council shall be ordained,\" he probably never\r\nrealized that a body having power to bind the shires and towns was a\r\nformidable institution, or that the trembling hostages would become in\r\ntime haughty plenipotentiaries. But whatever may have been the social\r\nconditions which gave rise to the idea, it is certain that it was the\r\npower of binding those to whom they owed their selection which enabled\r\nthe representatives to resist the encroachments of the monarchy on the\r\nliberties of the people. At first they were not legislators, but merely\r\nsought to uphold the ancient laws. They presented petitions to redress\r\ntheir grievances; but in time these petitions became demands; and they\r\nrefused to grant the King's subsidies till the demands were complied\r\nwith. It was, therefore, this first stage of representation which\r\nenabled the people to start that long struggle against the power of the\r\nKing and nobles which has ended in complete self-government; nay, more,\r\nit was necessary that they should pass through this first stage before\r\nthey could learn to govern themselves. Yet we have seen that if we apply\r\nthe modern ideas on representation the start could never have been\r\nmade. In what respects, then, did these early representative\r\ninstitutions differ from the modern conception as a reproduction of the\r\npeople on a small scale? One obvious difference at once suggests itself.\r\nThe representatives were not average members of the communities; they\r\nwere the most influential; they were selected because of their special\r\nfitness for the work to be done; they were leaders of the people, not\r\nfollowers; they did not take inspiration from the people, but brought it\r\nto them; and having selected these men the people deferred to their\r\njudgment to act for them and protect their interests. Here, then, we\r\narrive at the first principle involved in representation, which is\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nBut there is another and still more important difference between a\r\nrepresentative assembly and a primary assembly of the people. It is\r\nthis: that a representative cannot be a violent partisan of a small\r\nsection of his constituents; he must be in general favour with all\r\nsections. Therefore a representative assembly is composed of moderate\r\nmen, representing a compromise of the views of their individual\r\nsupporters. Moreover, the representatives appeal to the people to sink\r\ntheir minor differences for the general welfare. This feature is very\r\nprominent in the early parliaments. The local communities were arrayed\r\nas a united people against the aggression of the monarchy. The principle\r\nwhich is here apparent is that of organization. In the first stage of\r\nEnglish parliamentary history we may say at once that these two\r\nprinciples--organization and leadership--were most conspicuous. The\r\npeople, sinking all minor differences, formed one united party; and\r\nrecognised that their struggle against the party of prerogative depended\r\non the ability, influence, and integrity of their deputies.\r\n\r\n+The Second Stage of Representation.+--There is no need to enter into\r\nthat long struggle between the nation and the monarchy which followed.\r\nWe pass on, then, to the time when the parliaments, having wrested a\r\nshare of power, began to split up into parties. It was natural that when\r\npower became divided two parties should arise; one upholding the\r\nauthority of the Parliament against the King; and the other favouring\r\nthe divine right of Kings. The Puritans and Cavaliers in the troublous\r\ntimes of Charles I. were the earliest signs of this tendency. The Long\r\nParliament, which met in 1640, was divided on these lines; the\r\nmisdemeanors of the King brought on civil war; the parliamentary troops\r\ndefeated the royal troops after a bloody struggle; and the King was\r\nbrought to execution. The succeeding events were full of instruction.\r\nThe Parliament attempted to govern the nation--or, rather, we should say\r\nthe House of Commons did, for the House of Lords was abolished. But it\r\nproved quite unfit for the purpose. It was thoroughly disorganized, and\r\nrent by violent factions. The anarchy which ensued was ended by a\r\nmilitary despot, Oliver Cromwell, who entered the House of Commons in\r\n1653 with his soldiers. The Speaker was pulled from his chair; the\r\nmembers were driven from the House; and Cromwell was proclaimed\r\ndictator. It is strange, indeed, that the lesson which is to be drawn\r\nfrom this event, and which has been repeated in France time after time\r\nsince the Revolution, has not yet been learned: the only escape from\r\ncontinued political anarchy is despotism. But the weakness of despotism\r\nis that it ends with the life of the despot. Cromwell's son was forced\r\nto abdicate, and the monarchy was restored. The same division of parties\r\nin the Parliament continued, and they began to take the names of Whigs\r\nand Tories. Towards the end of the seventeenth century, the dissensions\r\nof these two factions again threatened to make government impossible. In\r\nadministration the evil was felt most; the union of ministers of both\r\nparties was proving unworkable. So fickle did legislation become that no\r\none could say one day what the House would do the next. It was at this\r\ncrisis, and about the year 1693, that William III., who cared more for a\r\nstrong administration than for political differences, created what is\r\nknown as cabinet government, and, as Professor Gardiner says, \"refounded\r\nthe government of England on a new basis.\" Recognizing that power should\r\nnot be separated from responsibility, he affirmed the principle that the\r\nministers of state should be selected from the party which had a\r\nmajority in the House of Commons. But the time was not yet ripe for the\r\ncomplete application of this principle. Early in the eighteenth century\r\nSir Robert Walpole set the example of resigning when he no longer\r\npossessed the confidence of a majority of the House of Commons; but in\r\nthe latter half of the century the great Earl of Chatham introduced\r\nagain the practice of selecting ministers irrespective of party. Despite\r\nthe fact that he was supported by the personal influence of George III.,\r\nthe attempt failed. A succession of weak ministries followed; and out of\r\nthe confusion the modern division of Liberals and Conservatives emerged.\r\nThus it was not until the beginning of the present century that the\r\ndoctrines of the solidarity of the Cabinet and its complete dependence\r\non a majority of the House of Commons were thoroughly developed in their\r\npresent form. England, now grown into the United Kingdom, had at last,\r\nafter six centuries of strife, won her national independence, and for\r\none brief century has enjoyed a full measure of self-government.\r\n\r\n+Comparison of the Two Stages.+--How do the conditions presented by the\r\nnineteenth century differ from those of the fourteenth? And how is the\r\nproblem of representation affected? We have seen that the great forces\r\nwhich animated the nation in the fourteenth century were organization\r\nand leadership. Have these forces ceased to operate? Assuredly not. In\r\nthe fourteenth century we had a united people organized under its chosen\r\nleaders against the encroachments of the King and nobility on its\r\nnational liberty. In the nineteenth century the people have won their\r\npolitical independence, but the struggle is now carried on between two\r\ngreat organized parties. The principle of leadership is still as strong\r\nas ever. The careers of Pitt, Peel, Palmerston, Beaconsfield, and\r\nGladstone attest that fact. The one great difference, then, between the\r\nfourteenth and the nineteenth centuries is that instead of one party\r\nthere are two. The problem of representation in the fourteenth century\r\nwas to keep the people together in one united party, and to allow them\r\nto select their most popular leaders. Surely the problem is different in\r\nthe nineteenth century. The requirements now are to organize the people\r\ninto two great parties, and to allow each party separately to elect its\r\nmost popular leaders. And yet we are still using the same method of\r\nelection as our forefathers used six centuries ago. Although the\r\nconditions have entirely changed, we have not adapted the electoral\r\nmachinery to the change. The system of single-membered electorates was\r\nrational in the fourteenth century, because there was only one party. Is\r\nit not on the face of it absurd to-day, when there are two parties?\r\n\r\n+The Meaning of Party Government.+--Why should there be two parties\r\ninstead of one in order that the people should be able to govern\r\nthemselves? To answer this question we must start at the beginning, and\r\nconsider what is the problem of popular government. The best definition\r\nis that it is to promote the general welfare--to reconcile or average\r\nthe real interests of all sections of the community. Now, if the people\r\ncould all agree what is best in the interests of all, unity of action\r\nmight certainly be obtained; but even then the problem would not be\r\nsolved, for the people are not infallible. The greater part of the\r\nproblem consists in finding out what is best in the interests of all,\r\nand no amount of mere abstract speculation can solve this part. So\r\ndiverse and so complex are the interests to be reconciled, so interwoven\r\nand interdependent one with another, that the problem of securing a just\r\nbalance is incapable of solution by anything short of omniscience. But\r\nin any case the people cannot be always got to agree to one course of\r\naction. Therefore the people cannot govern themselves as one united\r\nparty. The only workable basis is, then, the rule of the majority, and\r\nthe problem of popular government is how to ensure that the majority\r\nshall rule in the interests of all.\r\n\r\nParty government provides the best known means of solving this problem.\r\nThe only way of finding out what is best for the whole people is by the\r\nincessant action and interaction of two great organized parties under\r\ntheir chosen leaders; each putting forth its energies to prove its\r\nfitness to hold the reins of government; each anxious to expose the\r\ndefects of the other. This healthy emulation as to what is best for all,\r\nwith the people to judge, is the real secret of free government. The\r\ntwo parties are virtually struggling as to which shall be king. Each is\r\nstriving to gain the support of a majority of the people; and the\r\ngrounds on which it appeals for support are that the measures it\r\nproposes are the best for the country, and that the men it puts forward\r\nare the best men for passing those measures into law and carrying on the\r\nadministration of the country. This constant agitation, and this mutual\r\ncompetition to devise new measures, and to bring forward new men,\r\nprevent stagnation. Both sides of every leading public question of the\r\nday are presented in the rival party policies, and the people are\r\ninvited to decide between them. The forces on which the parties rely to\r\nmove the people are enthusiasm for measures and enthusiasm for\r\nmen--party and personality, or, in other words, organization and\r\nleadership. It is in opposing these forces to counteract the selfish and\r\nanti-social passions that party government acquires its virtue. By\r\nappealing to their higher nature it induces the people to subordinate\r\ntheir class prejudices to the general welfare, and by setting before\r\nthem definite moral ideals, and appealing to them by the force of\r\npersonality, it raises the character of public opinion, and moulds\r\nindividual and national character to an extent that is seldom\r\nappreciated. Here, then, is the key of human progress. Direct\r\ndemocracies may hold together so long as there are external enemies to\r\ninduce the people to sink their differences in the common interest, or\r\nso long as there is a slave caste to do the menial work, as in the\r\nancient democracies; but representative democracy offers the only hope\r\nof welding together a free people into a united whole. The unrestrained\r\nrule of the majority under direct democracy must degenerate into the\r\ntyranny of the majority. Instead of the equality of political power\r\nwhich it promises, the minority is deprived of all power. Representative\r\ndemocracy, on the other hand, deprives the people of the personal\r\nexercise of political power, in order to save them from the free play of\r\ntheir self-assertive passions, but still leaves to every man an equality\r\nof influence in deciding the direction of progress. Thus every man is\r\ninduced to express his opinion as to the direction of progress; and the\r\nparty policy is the resultant direction of progress of all the party\r\nelectors, and therefore represents their organized opinion. Now, bear in\r\nmind that the true direction of progress is not known, and can only be\r\nfound out by constant experiment directed by the most far-seeing and\r\ncapable minds. It is the means of carrying on this experiment which\r\nparty government provides. The party representing the organized opinion\r\nof the majority has, rightly, complete control of the direction of\r\nprogress so long as it remains in a majority. But, although deliberation\r\nis the work of many, execution is the work of one. Hence the creation of\r\na small committee of the party in power--the cabinet--associated with\r\nthe leader of the party, who becomes for the time being the Prime\r\nMinister, the cabinet ministers being jointly responsible for the\r\ncontrol of administration and the initiation of measures for the public\r\ngood. But an organized minority is quite as essential to progress as an\r\norganized majority--not merely to oppose, but to criticise and expose\r\nthe errors of the party in power, and to supplant it when it ceases to\r\npossess the confidence of the country. Hence progress under party\r\ngovernment may be compared to a zigzag line, in which the changes in\r\ndirection correspond to changes in ministry. By this mutual action and\r\nalternation of parties every vote cast has, in the long run, an equal\r\ninfluence in guiding progress. The only justification for majority rule\r\nsanctioned by free government is that when two parties differ as to what\r\nis best for the whole people the majority shall prevail, and party\r\ngovernment tends to realize this condition. But direct government by the\r\npeople offers no check whatever on the power of the majority, which is\r\nas absolute as that of the Czar of Russia. As Calhoun, the American\r\nstatesman, writes in his \"Disquisition on Government,\" \"the principle by\r\nwhich constitutional governments are upheld, is _compromise_, that of\r\nabsolute governments is _force_!\" Now, the significance of party\r\ngovernment as a guarantee of free government lies in this: that party\r\npolicies represent a compromise of what every section composing each\r\nparty supposes to be the interests of the whole people; and the parties\r\nare engaged in fighting out a compromise of the real interests of every\r\nsection of the people.\r\n\r\nLest it be thought that in this panegyric on party government we have\r\nbeen indulging in a wild flight into the region of speculative politics,\r\nwe hasten to add that the ideal condition we have pictured has never\r\nbeen reached. The British Parliament has perhaps most nearly approached\r\nit, but already shows signs of retrogression. America and the Australian\r\ncolonies are drifting further away from it. Already political\r\nphilosophers are shaking their heads and predicting the failure of\r\npopular government. The cry everywhere is for a stronger executive.\r\nParty organization is breaking down; small factions actuated by\r\nself-interest hold the balance of power between the main parties, and\r\nrender government unstable and capricious. The main parties themselves\r\ntend to degenerate into factions. Personality is declining--the demand\r\nis for followers, not leaders. Compromise is supplanted by log-rolling\r\nand lobbying. And, to crown all, the rumbling of class strife grows\r\nominously louder. The danger is that these tendencies may be allowed to\r\ngo too far before reform is attempted--that the confidence between\r\nclasses may be destroyed.\r\n\r\n+Organization and Leadership.+--We have shown that the two great\r\nprinciples underlying representation are organization and leadership.\r\nNow, after all, there is nothing very profound in this conclusion. Is\r\nthere a single department of concerted human action in which these same\r\nprinciples are not apparent? What would be thought of an army without\r\ndiscipline and without generals; or of a musical production in which\r\nevery performer played his own tune? Even in the region of sport, can a\r\ncricket or a football team dispense with its captain and its places? And\r\nyet many people imagine that a disorganized collection of delegates of\r\nvarious sections can rule a nation? Such an assembly would be as much a\r\nmob as any primary assembly of the people, and would in no sense be a\r\nrepresentative assembly. The fact is that the growing intensity of the\r\nevils which beset representative institutions throughout the civilized\r\nworld to-day is due to imperfect expression of these two principles.\r\nRepresentative assemblies are not properly organized into two coherent\r\nparties, nor is each party allowed free play to select its most popular\r\nleaders. What is the remedy?\r\n\r\n+A Change in Electoral Machinery the Key to Reform.+--The great mistake\r\nmade by all writers on electoral reform is that they have failed to\r\nrecognize that the character of public opinion depends upon the way it\r\nis expressed. If the electoral machinery be adapted to give effect to\r\nthose principles of organization and leadership which lie at the root of\r\nrepresentation, then the character of public opinion will be improved.\r\nRepresentation, in fact, is not only a means of expressing public\r\nopinion, but also of guiding, informing, educating, and organizing it.\r\nTherefore, the method of election is an all-important factor.\r\n\r\nThe first and greatest necessity is to counteract the tendency of the\r\npeople to split up into factions. It may seem a startling conclusion\r\nthat this is a mere matter of electoral machinery, but it is\r\nnevertheless quite true. It must be remembered that we are dealing with\r\nhuman beings and not with insentient figures. If the method of election\r\nallows representation to two sections only, the people will group\r\nthemselves into two sections. But if it allows representation to a large\r\nnumber of sections, then the people will group themselves into as many\r\nsections as are allowed. Now, party government offers every hope of\r\npreventing two sections degenerating into factions, but with a number of\r\nsections there is absolutely none.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we see the one great merit of the present system of\r\nelection, which explains why it has persisted so long, with all its\r\nfaults. It is that it tends to confine representation to the two main\r\nparties, since each electorate is generally contested by them; but in so\r\nfar as it does not completely effect that object and allows\r\nrepresentation to independent factions it is defective. Moreover, the\r\nmerit we have indicated is purchased at too high a price. It is these\r\ndefects which are causing the degradation of representative institutions\r\nthroughout the world to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously impossible to give a just share of representation to two\r\nparties and allow each party to elect its most popular leaders, in an\r\nelectorate which returns only a single representative. Hence the first\r\nnecessity for reform is to enlarge electorates, so that each may return\r\nseveral representatives. Now, the requirements for giving effect to the\r\nprinciples of organization and leadership in such an electorate are:--\r\n\r\n     1. Proportional representation to the two main parties--Ministerial\r\n     and Opposition, the majority and the minority.\r\n\r\n     2. The election by each party of its most popular\r\n     candidates--_i.e._, those most in general favour with all sections\r\n     of the party.\r\n\r\nThis is the problem of representation as it presents itself to us.\r\nLeaving a detailed account of the means by which it is proposed to give\r\neffect to these great desiderata to a later chapter, let us indicate\r\nbriefly where they strike at the root of the evils of the present\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n+Enlarged Electorates.+--With enlarged electorates the minority will not\r\nbe excluded. Each party will secure its just share of representation.\r\nWhen both parties are represented in each electorate the interests of\r\nthe electorate will not be bargained for as the price of support.\r\nMembers will cease to be mere local delegates.\r\n\r\n+Proportional Representation to the Two Main Parties.+--Representation\r\nmust be absolutely confined to the two main parties, and each party must\r\nbe allowed its just share. Every candidate should be required to\r\nnominate either as a Ministerialist or Oppositionist, and each party\r\nshould be allotted a number of representatives proportional to the total\r\namount of support received. If democracy means that every man's opinion,\r\nas expressed by his vote, is to have the same weight, it follows that\r\nthe parties should be represented in the Legislature in the same\r\nproportion as among the people, otherwise it is ridiculous to talk of\r\nthe rule of the majority. The present system sometimes results in\r\nminority rule and sometimes in minority extermination; it is difficult\r\nto say which alternative is the worse.\r\n\r\n+Election of its Most Popular Candidates by each Party.+--It would be\r\nlittle use to confine representation to the two main parties if the\r\nparties were allowed to split up into factions. The only way to prevent\r\nthis is to provide such electoral machinery as will ensure the return of\r\nthe candidates most in general favour with all sections, and will\r\nexclude the favourites of sections within the party. This distinction is\r\nvital. The general favourite is a representative; the favourite of a\r\nfaction is a delegate. A representative is not only independent of any\r\none section, but if he does favour a faction he will sink in general\r\nfavour. He therefore represents a compromise of the demands of all\r\nsections. But a delegate is the mouthpiece of a faction--a follower, not\r\na leader of the people.\r\n\r\nNo section will be disfranchised by this proposal, for the true\r\nfunction of all minor sections is to influence the policies of the two\r\nmain parties. Thus every section will be proportionally represented in\r\none or the other policy and by all the party candidates. Not only will\r\neach party be proportionally represented but all the sections which\r\ncompose each party will be proportionally represented in its policy.\r\nThis is the only true meaning of proportional representation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE SO-CALLED REPRESENTATIVE PRINCIPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll schemes of electoral reform hitherto proposed under the name of\r\nproportional representation are based on the so-called \"representative\r\nprinciple\"--viz., that every section of the people is entitled to\r\nseparate representation in proportion to its numbers. The ideal varies\r\nsomewhat, but the usual conception, is that if each member represents a\r\ndifferent section or interest the assembly will represent all sections\r\nor all interests. Now this is simply an attempt to return to what we\r\nhave described as the first stage of representation, but without the\r\nfear of the monarchy to keep the sections together. For a deliberative\r\nbody or a king's council it might be suitable, but for an assembly\r\ncharged with the complete control of government in the interests of all\r\nit is utterly impracticable. Each representative must represent all\r\ninterests; he must be elected on a definite policy as to what is best\r\nfor all the people. If he is sent in as the agent of one interest or one\r\nsection of the people, he ceases to be a representative and becomes a\r\ndelegate. All these schemes are therefore not proportional\r\nrepresentation at all, but proportional delegation.\r\n\r\nWe have shown that representation means the organization of public\r\nopinion into two definite lines of policy, and that this is the only way\r\nto prevent political anarchy. But the proportionalists (as they like to\r\ncall themselves) say that it means representing men and the opinions\r\nthey hold in proportion to their numbers. The fundamental error is that\r\nthey neglect the all-important factor of human nature. They look on\r\npublic opinion as something having an independent existence apart from\r\nthe questions about which it is expressed and from the means of\r\nexpressing it; and they fail to recognize that the character of public\r\nopinion depends on the manner in which it is expressed and organized. It\r\nis but a natural consequence that they also conceive the number of\r\nsections of opinion awaiting representation as pre-existing and\r\nindependent of the electoral machinery.\r\n\r\nIn short, they reduce the whole problem to a nice little exercise in\r\nmathematics, requiring only for its clear exposition some columns of\r\nfigures and a few coloured diagrams to represent the different shades of\r\npublic opinion. No better example of the dangers of _a priori_\r\nspeculation could be adduced than this chimerical idea of the\r\nproportionalists that public opinion is something to be divided into\r\nfractions like a mathematical quantity, unless it be, perhaps, the\r\nconclusion that if you gather together delegates representing these\r\nfractions you will have an assembly representing the sum total of public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe issue is quite clear. Are we to have two parties aiming at the\r\ncontrol of administration and appealing to all sections for support, or\r\nthe separate delegation of a number of sections? In the one case we will\r\nhave parties based on national policies, and in the other case we will\r\nhave a number of factions, each wanting something different and\r\ndetermined to block progress till it gets it. Remember that it is a mere\r\nmatter of electoral machinery which will determine the choice. It is\r\ntrue that at present we do not have two very coherent parties, but that\r\nis the fault of the present electoral system.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that there can be but one answer to this question, and yet\r\nthe \"representative principle\" shows such wonderful vitality that it is\r\nworth while considering the arguments on which it is based, and the\r\nvarious stages through which the idea has passed.\r\n\r\n+Mr. Hare's Scheme.+--The \"representative principle\" was first\r\npropounded in England in 1857 by Mr. Thomas Hare. He proposed that the\r\nUnited Kingdom should be constituted one huge electorate for the return\r\nof the 654 members of the House of Commons. The people were to group\r\nthemselves into 654 voluntary unanimous sections, each returning one\r\nmember, and each gathered from every corner of the kingdom. We propose\r\nto consider here not the scheme itself but only the principle on which\r\nit was founded. Mr. Hare rightly conceived that the great evil of the\r\npresent system is the exclusion of the minority in each electorate, but\r\nhe altogether failed to appreciate that the excluded minority nearly\r\nalways represented one of the two main parties. He could not see, in\r\nfact, that to divide each electorate into majority and minority is to\r\ndivide the whole country into majority and minority, nor that the\r\ninjustice is tolerated because it is usually as bad for one party as the\r\nother. Instead, therefore, of proposing to do justice to both the\r\nmajority and the minority in each electorate, he proposed to allow\r\nrepresentation to as many minorities as possible. To him, the rule of\r\nthe majority was the rule of a majority of interests; this he called the\r\nconstitutional majority, as opposed to the \"mere rule of numbers.\" Now,\r\nat the time Mr. Hare wrote party government was rather weak in England.\r\nHe quotes with approval a statement of Mr. Sidney Herbert, M.P., that\r\nthe House was divided into many parties, or rather no party, because the\r\ncountry was divided into many parties or no party, and that the division\r\ninto two parties would never be restored again. It is amusing, in view\r\nof after events, to find Mr. Hare asking what would be the result of any\r\ncontrivance to re-establish party. Assuming that _party_ representation\r\nwas dead, Mr. Hare proposed to substitute _personal_ representation. It\r\nis positively ludicrous at this interval of time to note how the\r\nelectors were expected to group themselves. They were to take personal\r\nmerit as the basis of representation; every vote cast was to be a\r\nspontaneous tribute to the qualities and attainments of the person for\r\nwhom it was given. And in order, presumably, that they should choose\r\ngood men in preference to corrupt men, the polling-day was to be set\r\napart as a sacred holiday, and church services were to be held to\r\nsolemnize the public act and seek for the Divine blessing!\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of a responsible ministry in such a House presented no\r\ndifficulty to Mr. Hare. The electors were to indicate whom they\r\nconsidered the most illustrious statesmen, and no one would dare to\r\nquestion their decision!\r\n\r\nIt seems strange now that this scheme should have received serious\r\nconsideration. Mr. Hare was so much under the spell of the apparent\r\njustice of the underlying principle that he was blind to its results.\r\nBut it was soon perceived that the electors would not group themselves\r\nas Mr. Hare supposed; that the personal ideal of every class of electors\r\nwould be simply men of their own class. It was further pointed out that\r\ncranks and faddists and every organization founded on questions of the\r\nremotest interest would combine to secure representation. Mr. Disraeli\r\ndeclared it to be \"opposed to every sound principle, its direct effect\r\nbeing to create a stagnant representation ... an admirable scheme for\r\nbringing crotchety men into the House.\" Mr. Shaw-Lefevre condemned it\r\nas \"a vicious principle based upon a theory of classes,\" and Mr.\r\nGladstone said that it regarded electors \"not as rational and thinking\r\nbeings, but merely as the equivalents of one another.\" Walter Bagehot,\r\nin his standard work on the \"English Constitution,\" opposes the\r\nprinciple of voluntary constituencies, because it would promote a\r\nconstituency-making trade. \"But upon the plan suggested,\" he writes,\r\n\"the House would be made up of party politicians selected by a party\r\ncommittee, chained to that committee, and pledged to party violence, and\r\nof characteristic, and therefore unmoderate, representatives for every\r\n'ism' in all England. Instead of a deliberate assembly of moderate and\r\njudicious men, we should have a various compound of all sorts of\r\nviolence. I may seem to be drawing a caricature, but I have not reached\r\nthe worst. Bad as these members would be if they were left to\r\nthemselves--if in a free Parliament they were confronted with the perils\r\nof government, close responsibility might improve them, and make them\r\ntolerable. But they would not be left to themselves. A voluntary\r\nconstituency will nearly always be a despotic constituency.\"\r\n\r\nThe practical difficulties in the application of Mr. Hare's scheme are\r\nalmost insuperable, but it is not worth while pursuing the subject,\r\nsince it is now admitted by recent advocates that the faddist argument\r\nis fatal. This is an admission that Mr. Hare completely neglected the\r\nfactor of human nature. Professor Nanson writes:--\"Hare proposed that\r\nthere should be only one electorate, consisting of the whole State. It\r\nis unfortunate that this proposal was made. There can be no doubt that\r\nit has retarded the progress of true electoral reform for at least a\r\ngeneration ... it would inevitably lead to the election of a certain\r\nnumber of faddists.\"\r\n\r\n+John Stuart Mill.+--The great vogue which the Hare system has obtained\r\nis to be traced more to the influence of John Stuart Mill than to that\r\nof anyone else. Mill was captivated by the apparent justice of the\r\nproposal, and devoted a chapter of his \"Representative Government\" to\r\nit, wherein he declared:--\"Mr. Hare's scheme has the almost unparalleled\r\nmerit of carrying out a great principle of government in a manner\r\napproaching to ideal perfection, while it attains incidentally several\r\nother things of scarcely inferior importance.\" Believing in the absolute\r\njustice of the principle, Mill and Hare were certainly consistent in\r\nsetting no limit to its application except the size of the assembly.\r\nMill is emphatic on this point. \"Real equality of representation,\" he\r\nasserted, \"is not obtained unless any set of electors, amounting to\r\naverage number of a constituency, wherever they happen to reside, have\r\nthe power of combining with one another to return a representative.\"\r\nNow, the recent disciples of Mr. Hare are never tired of claiming the\r\nsupport of Mill, although they have thrown this definition to the\r\nwinds. But they are guilty of far more than that, for in another chapter\r\nof Mill's book we find that his conception of a representative assembly\r\nelected by the Hare system is a purely deliberative body. He expressly\r\ndeclares it to be radically unfit for legislation, which he proposes to\r\nhand over to a commission appointed by the Crown. The value of his\r\ntestimony is very much discounted by this fact.\r\n\r\n+Sir John Lubbock.+[1]--We have asserted that the proportional principle\r\nshould be applied to two parties only--the majority and the minority,\r\nand that every section can then be represented. Mill and Hare thought\r\nthat no limit should be set except the size of the assembly. All the\r\nrecent advocates of the system take up an intermediate position.\r\nAppreciating the serious objections against allowing independent\r\nrepresentation to a large number of small sections, Sir John Lubbock,\r\npresident of the English Proportional Representation Society, proposes\r\nto constitute electorates returning only three to five members each,\r\nthus confining representation to only three to five sections in each\r\nelectorate, and sacrificing to a great extent accurate proportional\r\nrepresentation. In his book on \"Representation,\" he writes:--\"I have\r\nassumed that Parliament should be 'a mirror of the nation;' if the\r\nobject were to secure unity of action rather than freedom of discussion,\r\nto form an executive body such as a Government, a Board of Directors, or\r\na Vestry, the case would be quite different. It is, however, I presume,\r\nour wish that Parliament should be a deliberative assembly in which all\r\nparties should be fairly represented.\" But to make Parliament a\r\ndeliberative body is to destroy its power to secure unity of action at\r\nall, and to render it useless as a working machine.\r\n\r\n+Miss Spence.+--An active campaign has for some time been carried on for\r\nthe adoption of the Hare system in Australia. Miss C.H. Spence, of South\r\nAustralia, was the pioneer reformer, and has laboured in the cause by\r\npen and voice for no less than forty years. Great credit is undoubtedly\r\ndue to Miss Spence for the clear and simple manner in which she has\r\nexpounded the system, and for the good work she has done in exposing the\r\ndefects of the present methods. Not only has she lectured in all parts\r\nof Australia, but she has made visits to England, where she met Mr. Hare\r\nand Sir John Lubbock, and also to America. But we may admire Miss\r\nSpence's courage and devotion to principle without agreeing with her\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting held at River House, Chelsea, London, in 1894, Miss Spence\r\nsubmitted an analysis of 8,824 votes recorded at 50 public meetings in\r\nSouth Australia. The audiences were in each case asked to select six\r\nrepresentatives out of twelve candidates. The result of a scrutiny of\r\nall the votes combined was that the following six \"parties\" secured one\r\n\"representative\" each--viz., Capital, Labour, Single Tax, Irish\r\nCatholic, Prohibition, and Women's Suffrage. Miss Spence frankly\r\nconfesses that these \"parties\" are minorities, but holds that a majority\r\ncan be formed by the union of minorities, and that party responsible\r\ngovernment can still be carried on. Now, can any sensible man or woman\r\nimagine a working ministry formed by a union of any four of these\r\n\"parties?\" Capital would certainly be permanently opposed to Labour and\r\nto Single Tax, and as for the others, there is not a single principle in\r\ncommon. How, then, could a union be formed? The only possible way is by\r\nlog-rolling; they must make a bargain to support one another's demands.\r\nSuch a union could not possibly be stable, because the minority is free\r\nto offer a better bargain to any one of the \"parties\" to induce it to\r\ndesert. Again, it may be called the rule of the majority, but what sort\r\nof a majority? Is it not plainly the rule of a majority in the interests\r\nof minorities? That is very different to the rule of the majority in the\r\ninterests of all, which free government demands. The simple truth is\r\nthat the \"parties\" are factions, and that the \"representatives\" are mere\r\ndelegates of those factions.\r\n\r\nBut in practice the case would be far worse than we have assumed. There\r\nis not the slightest guarantee that the same six factions would be\r\nelected in each six-seat electorate. We might have an unlimited number\r\nof delegates of various religions, classes, races, localities, and\r\npolitical organizations on all kinds of single questions. An assembly\r\nformed on these lines could hardly be dignified with the name of a\r\nrepresentative assembly.\r\n\r\nMr. G. Bradford, in his work on \"The Lesson of Popular Government,\"\r\ndisplays a more intimate knowledge of human nature than any other recent\r\nwriter. Of these schemes for the representation of minorities he says:--\r\n\r\n     As an illustration of the effect in popular government of looking\r\n     to popular impulse for the initiation of measures, it may be\r\n     observed that perhaps the worst of all expedients for remedying the\r\n     defective working of a government by a legislature like ours, that\r\n     which combines the evils of them all, is one which is urged by\r\n     perfectly disinterested advocates of reform, and is known as\r\n     proportional representation. If there is one principle at the base\r\n     of popular government it is that the majority shall rule. If the\r\n     largest of three or four fractions is to rule it ceases to be\r\n     popular government, and becomes government by faction. If the\r\n     tyranny of the majority is bad a tyranny of the minority is still\r\n     worse. (Vol. i., p. 505.)\r\n\r\nAnd the following picture could hardly be better drawn:--\r\n\r\n     If the basis of carrying on the government is to be the wishes of\r\n     some millions of units, it is evident that they must to a greater\r\n     or less extent agree in wishing for something. It is equally\r\n     evident that they cannot all agree in wishing for the same thing at\r\n     the same time, while if they, or any considerable number of groups,\r\n     want different things at the same time, the result in so far is\r\n     anarchy. Government is paralysed, and with the well-known\r\n     excitability of humanity in groups men begin to confound the\r\n     importance of the thing wanted with the importance of getting what\r\n     they want. The clash of contending factions is apt to suggest the\r\n     clash of arms. The first necessity, therefore, is the formation of\r\n     large and coherent parties, not merely for the purpose of\r\n     accomplishing what is desired by the majority of the people, but\r\n     also for suppressing agitation and social disturbance on behalf of\r\n     what may be called merely objects of passion or private interest\r\n     with comparatively small groups, at least until those objects\r\n     enlist the support of a large minority. (Vol. i., pp. 492, 493.)\r\n\r\n+Professor Nanson.+--In Victoria the Hare system is championed by Mr.\r\nE.J. Nanson, Professor of Mathematics at Melbourne University. Professor\r\nNanson approaches the subject entirely from a mathematical standpoint,\r\nand resolutely refuses to admit the factor of human nature into his\r\ncalculations. Following Mr. Hare, he is a declared opponent of party\r\ngovernment, and \"would like to see it pushed further into the\r\nbackground.\" Moreover, he regards every step in the process as an end in\r\nitself. Thus the act of voting is one end, representation is another,\r\nand the rule of the majority a third. Leaving aside for the present,\r\nhowever, the elaborate mathematical devices which are proposed for\r\nattaining these supposed ends, let us take only the principles on which\r\nthey are based. These are laid down as follows:--\r\n\r\n     (_a_) The rule of the majority.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) The fair representation of all parties in proportion to their\r\n     strength.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Perfect freedom to every elector to vote exactly as he\r\n     pleases.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) The emancipation of the voters from the tyranny of the\r\n     political \"boss\" or caucus.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) The full value of his vote to each voter without loss or\r\n     waste.\r\n\r\nThe principles involved, we are assured, \"must appeal to every democrat,\r\nto every Liberal, to every lover of true and just representation.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the first claim, we are willing to grant the rule of the majority,\r\nif the words are added \"in the interests of minorities.\" The second\r\ncould also be granted if by \"all parties\" were meant both parties, for\r\nthere cannot be more than two parties in the true sense of the word. But\r\nProfessor Nanson proposes such large electorates that any small section,\r\nfrom one-sixth to one-twelfth, can secure independent representation.\r\nNotwithstanding this, he claims that it is quite possible to give fair\r\nrepresentation to the main parties and to small sections at the same\r\ntime. In illustrating the system he avoids the issue as to the character\r\nof these sections by giving them a \"scientific\" nomenclature, such as\r\nColour, Place, Pursuits, Qualities, &c. These abstractions are very\r\nmisleading, as attention is diverted from the fact that they refer to\r\nvoluntary groups of men united for some political purpose. The real\r\nquestion is, on what basis are these groups likely to be formed? When\r\nthe element of human nature is taken into account it must be apparent\r\nthat they will be formed for the propaganda of some sectional interest;\r\nsome on a religious basis, others on a class basis, &c. Now, if we were\r\nto ask each candidate to declare his religion, we could easily take\r\nreligions as the basis of representation and allow proportional\r\nrepresentation to each religion; and similarly with classes, races, and\r\nso on. But we could only take one basis at a time, and the important\r\ndeduction is that if we were to take religions as the basis of\r\nrepresentation, the people would be induced to vote according to\r\nreligion; if we were to take classes, according to class, and so on.\r\nNow, no one but the fanatic or the demagogue will claim that the\r\nmajority is entitled to rule where religions only or classes only are\r\nrepresented. The questions then arise--What is the correct basis of\r\nrepresentation? How should the people be induced to vote? And the answer\r\nis clearly that the people should be induced to vote on questions of\r\ngeneral public policy, on the leading questions of the day which decide\r\nthe party lines, and that, therefore, _the policies of the two main\r\nparties should form the primary basis of proportional representation_.\r\nBut the Hare system, by taking individual candidates as the basis of\r\nrepresentation, induces the elector to vote on any basis or on sectional\r\nlines. It promotes dissension instead of repressing it, and instead of\r\nencouraging all sections to express their opinion as to what is best for\r\nthe general well-being, it encourages them to express their opinion as\r\nto what they imagine to be best for themselves. Public opinion expressed\r\non these lines would be worse than useless. But Professor Nanson thinks\r\nthat the electors would still have regard for the main parties, even\r\nthough they grouped themselves into small sections. He declares that\r\n\"any party amounting to anything like a quota would not only have two\r\ncandidates of its own--one Liberal and one Conservative--but would also\r\nbe wooed by candidates of both leading parties.\" We may well question\r\nwhether factions would trouble themselves about the main parties; but,\r\ngranting the assumption, the small parties might just as well be single\r\nelectorates as far as the main parties are concerned. The Liberal\r\ncandidates might be successful in all of them, and the Conservatives be\r\nunrepresented. The peculiar feature is that the defeated Conservatives\r\nare expected to transfer their votes to the Liberals to make up the\r\nquotas for the small parties!\r\n\r\nThe third claim is that electors should have perfect freedom to vote\r\nexactly as they please, and yet Professor Nanson, in condemning Mr.\r\nHare's original scheme, has denied that they are free to vote as\r\nfaddists; but he still holds that they are free to vote on any basis if\r\nonly they form one-sixth to one-twelfth of an electorate. Thus the\r\namount of freedom is variable and a matter of opinion. Now, we\r\naltogether deny that electors should be given the opportunity to\r\nsubordinate the national interests to factious interests. Just as the\r\nfaddist argument is fatal to Mr. Hare's original scheme, so the\r\nsplitting up into factions is fatal to Professor Nanson's present\r\nscheme. Where is the freedom which Professor Nanson claims under the\r\npresent system of election? Is it not the fact that throughout England,\r\nAmerica, and Australia the electors have very often a choice between two\r\ncandidates only--one Ministerialist and one Oppositionist? By all means\r\nlet us have as many political organizations as possible to make known\r\nthe wishes of all sections; but the true function of all such\r\norganizations is to influence the policies of the two main parties, and\r\nnot to secure independent delegates in Parliament. This means simply\r\nthat the compromise among the different sections supporting a party must\r\nbe effected in the electors' minds, and at the elections, and not on the\r\nfloor of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe fourth claim is the emancipation of the voters from the tyranny of\r\nthe \"boss.\" Now, the power of the \"boss\" lies in the control of\r\nnominations, and although to some extent this control is necessary with\r\nthe present system of election, it is not essential to party government,\r\nas we hope to show. But with government by faction there would be no\r\nescape from this control. The tyranny of a faction is worse than the\r\ntyranny of the \"boss.\" The voters need saving from their own selfish\r\npassions far more than from the \"boss.\"\r\n\r\nThe final claim that each elector is entitled to the full value of his\r\nvote, regardless of the way in which it is used, is really a claim to an\r\nequality of political power, _i.e._, to direct government. It means\r\nthat electors are absolutely free to combine for their own interests, or\r\nfor their interest as a class, in opposition to the public welfare.\r\nThese combinations would, with an equality of direct political power,\r\nsoon bring on social disruption.\r\n\r\n+Professor Jethro Brown.+--In the preface to \"The New Democracy,\" by\r\nProfessor Jethro Brown, the two fundamental difficulties of present-day\r\npolitics are correctly stated to be--how to express public opinion, and\r\nhow to improve its value. For the first of these Professor Brown\r\nrecommends the Hare system, and for the second the study of history.\r\nLater on he writes:--\"How is the amelioration of popular sovereignty to\r\nbe effected? Not, I venture to believe, by the pursuit of the policy\r\nwhich hopes to play off ignorance against ignorance and prejudice\r\nagainst prejudice, and to secure good government by the arts of\r\nflattery, manipulation, and intrigue; nor, indeed, by the improvement of\r\ndemocratic machinery, though this is extremely desirable, and calls for\r\nimmediate attention. For, above all, towers the question of character.\"\r\nIt is quite evident that Professor Brown shares the delusion of the\r\nother advocates of the Hare system, that the manner of expressing public\r\nopinion has nothing to do with the character of public opinion. The two\r\ndifficulties laid down are essentially one. The cardinal fact underlying\r\nrepresentation is that it is a real social force, capable of reacting\r\nupon and moulding character, and therefore of improving the value of\r\npublic opinion. The independence, love of freedom, respect for\r\nminorities, and capacity for self-government, which are the most\r\ndistinctive traits in the English character, are not innate, but are\r\nlargely the products of the British Constitution. If the only chance of\r\nimproving the value of public opinion lay in the hope of inducing the\r\nindividual electors to study the lessons of history, the prospect would\r\nbe indeed gloomy.\r\n\r\nProfessor Brown regards party government as a necessary evil, resulting\r\nfrom the mechanical difficulty of securing unity of action from a\r\nplurality of wills. This is practically equivalent to saying that\r\nlegislation itself is a necessary evil. But he writes:--\"Whatever may be\r\nthe evils of party government, there can be no doubt of the utility as\r\nwell as of the necessity of the institution itself. The alternative to\r\nparty government is the system of government by small groups. In\r\nAustralia the evils of this alternative have been occasionally displayed\r\nin practical politics; but it is to France that we must look for their\r\nsupreme illustration.\" Turning to the chapter on the Hare system, we\r\nfind that Professor Brown believes that the electors would still divide\r\nthemselves into two parties, even if given the opportunity to form small\r\ngroups. \"I cannot believe,\" he writes, \"that the reputation of our race\r\nfor sound common-sense is so far misplaced that a provision for the\r\nfaithful representation of the people would end in an immoderate\r\nLegislature! For, although the Hare system is not perfect, it does\r\nundoubtedly afford an opportunity for an absolutely _fair\r\nrepresentation_. Of course the opportunity would be abused by some; but\r\nto argue that the abuse would be general, or if at all general, would\r\nlong continue, is to argue that the people would prove themselves\r\nunworthy of the opportunity offered.\" While he was at the University of\r\nTasmania the first election under the Hare system was held, and\r\nProfessor Brown's opinions are based on the result. A second election\r\nhas, however, just been held, which shows the futility of his hopes.\r\n\r\n+The Tasmanian Experiment.+--Despite the fact that it has been advocated\r\nfor over forty years, the trial now being made of the Hare system in\r\nTasmania is the first application of the \"representative principle\" to\r\nany assembly modelled on the English plan of party government, and\r\ntherefore deserves more than passing notice. But the experiment is on\r\nsuch a small scale, and has been conducted for such a short time, that\r\nthe result can hardly be expected to be conclusive as yet. The objection\r\nagainst the Hare system is not so much that it is not suitable to\r\npresent conditions as that it will speedily bring about altered\r\nconditions. It is interesting to find that this is exactly what is\r\ntaking place. The system is applied in two electorates only, at Hobart\r\nand Launceston the former returning six members and the latter four. At\r\nthe first election, in 1897, the possibilities of the system were not\r\nappreciated, and electors voted on the old lines; and although the\r\nresults were rather erratic and unexpected, they were considered fairly\r\nsatisfactory. But the second election, held early in the present year,\r\nproved a great blow to the system. No less than three of the successful\r\ncandidates were intensely unpopular; and one of them, an ex-minister,\r\nhad recently been banished from public life on the report of a select\r\ncommittee of the House. His reinstatement aroused a storm of indignation\r\nthroughout the colony, and he was forced to retire again before\r\nParliament met. It will be as well to take the evidence of a strong\r\nadvocate of the system--the _Argus_ correspondent. Of one candidate he\r\nwrites:--\"Judging by all available definite evidences, it seemed that\r\nfive-sixths of the electors of Hobart were directly in favour of the\r\nconstruction of the railway by the present Great Western Railway\r\nSyndicate; while those of the remaining sixth were variously opposed to\r\nthe company or to the project of constructing such a railway by private\r\nenterprise at all. This sixth is represented by Mr. R.C. Patterson, who\r\nheaded the poll.\" Of another candidate we learn that \"Mr. Mulcahy had\r\nfought a hard fight, and it is a fair assumption that on the list of the\r\nelected he represents the Roman Catholic vote. As a member of a\r\ngenerally popular Government, the extent of Mr. Mulcahy's personal\r\nunpopularity was remarkable and probably unique.\" But it was over the\r\nreturn of Mr. Miles that the storm raged most. The excuse is made that\r\n\"the fault of Mr. Miles's return (assuming that it is a fault) lies with\r\nthe electors who returned him, and not with the system under which his\r\nreturn was accomplished.... Once grant that a section of Hobart electors\r\nhave the right to select for their representative whom they choose, and\r\nit would seem that the Hare system must be held free of all\r\nresponsibility for the return of Mr. Miles.\" But this is precisely what\r\ncannot be granted for a moment, as we have endeavoured to show. The\r\nassertion is made that Mr. Miles would have been returned as easily\r\nunder the old system, but this is not a fact. He polled only one-eighth\r\nof the votes, so that, even supposing that his supporters were twice as\r\nstrong in a single electorate, he would have had only one-fourth of the\r\nvotes. It is safe to say, from the small proportion of second and third\r\npreferences which he secured, that if the Block Vote had been adopted he\r\nwould have been at the bottom of the poll. Commenting on these results,\r\nthe _Argus_ declares that the Hare system does not pretend to reform or\r\nguide the people. Very likely not! But is it not quite evident that it\r\nhas the opposite effect?\r\n\r\nIs it too much to say that, if the Hobart experiment be persevered with,\r\nthe ultimate tendency will be the return of six members, each acceptable\r\nto one-sixth of the electors, and obnoxious to the other five-sixths?\r\nIt is quite obvious already that the usual party lines are entirely\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\n+Professor Commons.+--The best book on the subject yet published is the\r\n\"Proportional Representation\" of John E. Commons, Professor of Sociology\r\nin Syracuse University, U.S. Its great merit is that the political and\r\nsocial bearings of the reform are fully treated. Professor Commons\r\nrejects the Hare system in favour of the Free List system. He\r\nwrites:--\"The Hare system is advocated by those who, in a too\r\n_doctrinaire_ fashion, wish to abolish political parties. They\r\napparently do not realize the impossibility of acting in politics\r\nwithout large groupings of individuals.\" He makes a great step in\r\nadvance of the disciples of Mr. Hare in recognizing that the\r\nproportional principle should be applied to parties, and not to\r\nindividuals, and he even defines parties correctly as being based \"not\r\naltogether on sectional divisions, but on social and economic problems\r\nof national scope;\" but, unfortunately, he fails to see that there can\r\nbe only two parties, and that the representation of small parties would\r\nnot reform the main parties, but break them up altogether. At the same\r\ntime he is no mere theorist, for he declares:--\"If a practicable and\r\neffective method of proportional representation cannot be discovered,\r\nthe theoretical principle is a mere dream.\" Moreover, he prudently\r\nrecognizes that his arguments as regards Federal and State Legislatures\r\nin America are in advance of what the public is ready to accept, and\r\nadds:--\"We, as a people are not yet ready to abandon the notion that\r\nparty responsibility in Federal affairs is essential to safety.\" His\r\nimmediate object is, therefore, the reform of city councils, which in\r\nAmerica are controlled by the national parties, and are exploited by the\r\nnotorious \"machine\" organizations. We may sympathize with this object,\r\nfor parties in an administrative body are a serious evil, but with\r\nlegislatures the case is quite different. Professor Commons admits that\r\nthird and fourth parties, if given their proportionate weight in\r\nlegislation, would hold the balance of power, but he declares that \"the\r\nweight of this objection, the most serious yet presented against\r\nproportional representation, varies in different grades of government.\"\r\nHe then proceeds to examine the objection \"as applied to Congress (and\r\nincidentally to the State Legislatures), where it has its greatest\r\nforce, and where pre-eminently party responsibility may be expected to\r\nbe decisive.\" And the only answer he can find is that the objection\r\n\"overlooks the principle of equality and justice in representation. It\r\nmay prove here that justice is the wisest expediency. It is a curious\r\nanomaly, showing confusion of thought regarding democracy, that a people\r\nwho insist on universal suffrage, and who go to ludicrous limits in\r\ngranting it, should deny the right of representation to those minor\r\npolitical parties whose existence is the natural fruit of this\r\nsuffrage.\" But these minor parties would not be denied representation if\r\nthey were allowed to exercise freely their true function, which is to\r\ninfluence the policies of the main parties; and it is essential to the\r\nworking of the political machine that they be limited to that function.\r\nProfessor Commons continues:--\"The argument, however, of those who fear\r\nthat third parties will hold the balance of power is not based solely on\r\na dread of the corrupt classes, but rather of the idealists, the\r\nreformers, 'faddists,' and 'cranks,' so called. They would retain\r\nexclusive majority rule and party responsibility in order to prevent the\r\ndisproportionate influence of these petty groups. They overlook, of\r\ncourse, the weight of the argument already made that individual\r\nresponsibility is more important for the people than the corporate\r\nresponsibility of parties.\" The assumption is here made that the\r\ncomplete suppression of individuality is an essential feature of party\r\ngovernment, whereas it is in fact a peculiar feature of American\r\npolitics, due to \"machine\" control of nominations. The one point which\r\nProfessor Commons has missed is that individual candidature can be\r\npermitted and representation still be confined to the two main parties.\r\n\r\n+Conclusion.+--The advocates of proportional delegation have failed to\r\ngrasp the importance of the principles of organization and leadership,\r\nwhich underlie representation. Mr. Hare thought that the effect of doing\r\naway with organization would be to improve leadership. But he reckoned\r\nwithout his host--Human Nature. Organization cannot be dispensed with\r\nwithout destroying leadership and bringing on the strife of factions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] Now Lord Avebury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT POSITION OF PARTY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n+England.+--We have seen that the fundamental error of the\r\nproportionalists is that they have failed to distinguish between the two\r\nstages of representation. In constantly appealing back to the earlier\r\nparliaments they altogether overlook the fact that the functions which\r\nParliament now exercises were then vested in the King. But this error is\r\nnot confined to the proportionalists, most of whom, indeed, however\r\ninconsistently, favour party government. It is also put forth as an\r\nargument by those who lay all the blame of present evils on the party\r\nsystem, and who think that all sections should work together as one\r\nunited party. Take, for instance, the diatribe of Mr. W.S. Lilly on \"The\r\nPrice of Party Government\" in the _Fortnightly Review_ for June, 1900.\r\nMr. Lilly complains bitterly that the infallible oracle in politics\r\nto-day is \"the man in the street.\" He asserts that all issues are\r\nsettled \"by counting heads, in entire disregard of what the heads\r\ncontain.\" His bugbear is the extension of the franchise. \"Representative\r\ninstitutions, for example,\" he asks, \"what do they represent? The true\r\ntheory unquestionably is that they should represent all the features of\r\nnational life, all the living forces of society, all that makes the\r\ncountry what it is; and that in due proportion. And such was the\r\nConstitution of England up to the date of the first _Parliamentary\r\nReform Act_. Its ideal was, to use the words of Bishop Stubbs, 'an\r\norganized collection of the several orders, states, and conditions of\r\nmen, recognized as possessing political power.'\" Could anything be more\r\nridiculous? Political power is to be apportioned in the nineteenth\r\ncentury as it was in the fourteenth century! The people are to be always\r\ngoverned by their superiors! Mr. Lilly continues:--\"It appears to me\r\nthat the root of the falsification of our parliamentary system by the\r\nparty game is to be found in the falsification of our representative\r\nsystem by the principle of political atomism. Men are not equal in\r\nrights any more than they are equal in mights. They are unequal in\r\npolitical value. They ought not to be equal in political power.\"\r\n\r\nThe mistake here is in the premise. Has not the demagogue more power\r\nthan his dupes, or the Member of Parliament more power than the elector?\r\nWe have hardly yet reached, and are never likely to reach, that ideal of\r\ndirect government. But what is this price which Mr. Lilly is railing at?\r\n\"The price may be stated in eight words. 'The complete subordination of\r\nnational to party interests.' The _complete_ subordination. I use the\r\nadjective advisedly. Party interests are not only the first thought of\r\npoliticians in England, but, too often, the last and only thought.\" All\r\nthis is sheer nonsense. The coincidence of party aims with the real\r\ninterests of the people which the British Parliament has displayed since\r\nthe _Reform Act_ of 1832 has never been even remotely approached by any\r\nother country. Two causes have contributed to this great result; first,\r\nthe gradual extension of the franchise to all sections of the people,\r\nand second, the fact that the principles of organization and leadership\r\nhave been highly developed. In one respect, however, Mr. Lilly is right.\r\nThe zenith has been passed. Party government is not the same to-day in\r\nEngland as it was twenty years ago. But the fault lies not with the\r\nextension of the suffrage, but with the fact that the principles of\r\norganization and leadership are less operative. True, the extension of\r\nthe franchise is indirectly concerned in the failure, but the primary\r\ncause is that the present system of election is unable to bear the\r\nincreased strain. It no longer suffices to organize the people into two\r\ncoherent parties. The effect on the parties is correctly noted by Mr.\r\nLilly. \"A danger which ever besets them,\" he declares, \"is that of\r\nsinking into factions.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the result of the want of organization is the presence in\r\nParliament of small independent factions, which, by holding the balance\r\nof power, cause the main parties to degenerate into factions.\r\n\r\nThis tendency is apparent even in England, and the rock on which the\r\nparties have split is the Irish faction. Into the merits of the Irish\r\nquestion we do not propose to enter; it is the career of the faction in\r\nParliament which interests us. But it may be noted that the Irish party\r\nrests on a three-fold basis as a faction; it is based mainly on a class\r\ngrievance, and is also partly racial and partly religious. It was the\r\nIrish party in the House of Commons which first discovered that, by\r\nkeeping aloof from the two main parties, it could terrorize both; and\r\nthus found out the weak spot in party government. Its tactics were\r\nsuccessful up to a certain point, for Mr. Gladstone succumbed to the\r\ntemptation to purchase its support, and brought in the Home Rule Bill.\r\nThe result is known to all; the historical Liberal party was rent in\r\ntwain; party lines were readjusted; Mr. Gladstone was left in a hopeless\r\nminority; and the remnant of his following is to-day in the same\r\ncondition. What is the lesson to be learned from these events? That\r\nthese tactics cannot succeed in the long run. All interests suffer, but\r\nthe culprits most of all. Moreover, such tactics are unconstitutional,\r\nand would in some circumstances justify retaliatory measures. Let us\r\ntrace the constitutional course. The Irish members could have exerted a\r\nconsiderable influence on the policies of both Liberals and\r\nConservatives, just as the Scotch did. If they had followed this course,\r\nmight they not have been in a better position to-day?\r\n\r\nOf course, the Irish faction can hardly be said to be the result of the\r\npresent system of election; it is mainly the expression of old wrongs.\r\nBut it has set the example, and the disintegration of the old parties is\r\nrapidly proceeding. One feature, however, in connection with the present\r\nsystem in Ireland may be mentioned, and that is the permanent\r\ndisfranchisement of the minority. In the greater part of Ireland there\r\nis no such thing as a contest between the main parties. If a system were\r\nintroduced by which the minority could get its share of representation\r\nthe parties would compete on even terms for the support of the people,\r\nand good feeling would tend to be restored.\r\n\r\nTo return to Mr. Lilly. The present position of party government in\r\nEngland is not due to defects in the institution itself, still less to\r\nthe extension of the suffrage, but to imperfect organization. The true\r\nremedy is, therefore, to improve organization, not to restrict the\r\nsuffrage. By this means such a condition will be brought about that if\r\neither party favours a faction it will lose in general favour; then,\r\nindeed, we may hope that the main parties themselves will cease to\r\ndegenerate into factions.\r\n\r\nThe same number of the _Fortnightly_ contains an unsigned article on\r\n\"Lord Rosebery and a National Cabinet,\" in which the party system is\r\nalluded to as defunct, and in which the suggestion is thrown out that on\r\nthe retirement of Lord Salisbury a national cabinet should be formed,\r\ncomprising both Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Rosebery. Impending foreign\r\ncomplications are given as the excuse for terminating party action. Now,\r\nit is not to be denied that party government is more suitable for what\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer calls the industrial type of society than for the\r\nmilitant type. Quite recently Lord Salisbury blamed the British\r\nConstitution for the state of unpreparedness for the present war. But it\r\nis equally true that in foreign affairs party action is generally\r\nsuspended: in the control of India, for instance, it is so. The real\r\nquestion, then, is this: Is the danger of foreign aggression so serious\r\nthat all questions of internal policy can be permanently set aside? If\r\nwe have reached this stage, the end of modern civilization is in sight.\r\nIn effect, the proposal is a return to the first stage of\r\nrepresentation, with the difference that all sections of the people are\r\nexpected to be held together by the fear of foreign aggression, instead\r\nof the fear of the aggression of the monarchy.\r\n\r\nMr. David Syme is a censor of a very different type. So far from wishing\r\nto take control from the people, he would give the people absolute\r\ncontrol over everything, and at all times. Seldom has the case against\r\nparty government been more powerfully presented than in his work on\r\n\"Representative Government in England.\" But Mr. Syme founds his proposed\r\nremedies on a theory of representation which is based on the literal\r\nmeaning of the word. No one has put the delegation theory more clearly\r\nthan in the following passage, or gone so far in applying it:--\r\n\r\n     Representation is a mental act; it is the presentation or\r\n     reproduction of the state of mind of another person; and before one\r\n     person can represent another person he must first know what the\r\n     opinions of that other person are. A representative is a\r\n     substitute; he stands in the place of, and acts for, another\r\n     person. But one man cannot act for another unless he knows what\r\n     that other would do were he acting for himself. In other words, he\r\n     requires to know the motives which actuate that other person, or\r\n     what influences his motives, namely, his principles and beliefs.\r\n     The House of Commons is a representative body, not because every\r\n     individual member of it represents the opinions of the whole\r\n     nation, but because members in the aggregate represent those\r\n     opinions, (p. 170).\r\n\r\nThis position is diametrically opposed to the principles we have laid\r\ndown, for it eliminates entirely the ideas of organization and\r\nleadership. Again, Mr. Syme says:--\"If the government is to be carried\r\non for the benefit of all classes, representatives should be chosen from\r\nall classes. We had class representation in the early parliaments, but\r\nthen all classes were fairly represented.\" We have shown that the\r\nanalogy from early parliaments is fallacious. Representatives should now\r\nbe chosen irrespective of class, and not as class delegates. But Mr.\r\nSyme does not carry his theory to its logical conclusion. For if\r\nrepresentatives merely express the thoughts of others, and should be\r\nclass delegates, surely all classes are entitled to have their thoughts\r\n\"represented;\" and Mr. Syme should range himself among the disciples of\r\nMr. Hare. But here comes in an interesting difference. Mr. Syme would\r\nretain the present system and make members continually responsible to a\r\nmajority of their constituents; he would even give this majority power\r\nto dismiss them at any time. Now, this is practically an admission that\r\nrepresentation involves the existence of a majority and a minority, or,\r\nin other words, is a means of organizing the people into a majority and\r\na minority. Again, as regards leadership, the theory will hardly bear\r\nthe test of facts. Could a man like Gladstone be said to merely express\r\nthe thoughts of his constituents? Was he not rather a guide and leader\r\nof the thoughts of a great part of the British nation?\r\n\r\nIn addition to the continual responsibility of members to their\r\nconstituents, Mr. Syme would also make the individual ministers of state\r\nresponsible to a majority of the members. He adds:--\"The whole system of\r\nparty government could in this manner be quietly and effectively got rid\r\nof.\" We do not propose to criticise the latter suggestion, as we do not\r\nbelieve it would be put forward to-day, in the light of fuller\r\nknowledge. Mr. Syme's book was written nearly twenty years ago. But, as\r\nregards the continual responsibility of members, we consider it\r\nimportant that the electors should not have their way on single\r\nquestions. They should periodically express their opinion as to the\r\ngeneral line of progress, and the representatives should then have\r\ncomplete control. The necessity for this is to save the people from\r\ntheir anti-social tendencies, which we have already stated as the great\r\nobjection to all forms of direct government. Lord Macaulay once defined\r\nthe position exactly in a letter addressed to the electors of Edinburgh.\r\n\"My opinion,\" he declared, \"is that electors ought at first to choose\r\ncautiously; then to confide liberally; and when the term for which they\r\nhave selected their member has expired to review his conduct equitably,\r\nand to pronounce on the whole taken together.\"\r\n\r\nWe hope to have left on the reader's mind by this time no doubt as to\r\nthe intimate connection between the machinery of election and the\r\nresulting character of the legislature. Now it is a most extraordinary\r\nfact that this connection is hardly noticed by the leading\r\nconstitutional authorities. It is true they often recognize that\r\nsuggested changes like the Hare system would debase our legislatures,\r\nbut it never seems to occur to them that present evils might be cured by\r\na change in the electoral machinery. They point out the evils indeed,\r\nbut only to indulge in gloomy forebodings at the onward march of\r\ndemocracy, or as warnings of the necessity for placing checks on the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nTake Bagehot's study of the House of Commons in his standard work on\r\n\"The English Constitution,\" where he classifies the functions exercised\r\nby the House. He insists that the most important of these is the\r\nelective function--its power to elect and dismiss the ministry. In\r\naddition, it exercises an expressive function, a teaching function, an\r\ninforming function, and, lastly, the function of legislation. But not a\r\nword is said of the relation of these functions to representation, or to\r\nthe method of election. It is asserted that the reason the House of\r\nCommons is able to exercise these functions is because England is a\r\ndeferential nation, and the people leave government in the hands of\r\ntheir betters, the higher classes. On one point he is emphatic, and that\r\nis the absolute necessity of party. He writes:--\r\n\r\n     The moment, indeed, that we distinctly conceive that the House of\r\n     Commons is mainly and above all things an elective assembly, we at\r\n     once perceive that party is of its essence. The House of Commons\r\n     lives in a state of perpetual potential choice; at any moment it\r\n     can choose a ruler and dismiss a ruler. And therefore party is\r\n     inherent in it, is bone of its bone, and breath of its breath.\r\n\r\nAs to the present trend of affairs, the opinion of a foreign observer,\r\nGneist--\"History of the English Constitution\"--may be quoted:--\r\n\r\n     England, too, will experience the fact that the transition to the\r\n     new order of industrial society is brought about through a process\r\n     of dissolution of the old cohesions, upon which the constitution of\r\n     Parliament is based. The unrepresented social mass, which is now\r\n     flooding the substructure of the English Constitution, will only\r\n     stay its course at a universal suffrage, and a thorough and\r\n     arithmetical equalization of the constituencies, and will thus\r\n     attempt, and in a great measure achieve, a further dissolution of\r\n     the elective bodies. To meet the coming storm a certain fusion of\r\n     the old parties seems to be immediately requisite, though the\r\n     propertied classes, in defending their possessions, will certainly\r\n     not at first display their best qualities. As, further, a regular\r\n     formation in two parties cannot be kept up, a splitting up into\r\n     fractions, as in the parliaments of the Continent, will ensue, and\r\n     the changing of the ministry will modify itself accordingly, so\r\n     that the Crown will no longer be able to commit the helm of the\r\n     state in simple alternation to the leader of the one or the other\r\n     majority. And then a time will recur in which the _King in Council_\r\n     may have to undertake the actual leadership. (Vol. ii., pp. 452,\r\n     453.)\r\n\r\nIn other words, that an industrial society is incapable of\r\nself-government! Note the reason for this remarkable conclusion--a\r\nsplitting up into fractions, _i.e._, imperfect organization.\r\n\r\nTake now the evidence of the distinguished historian and publicist, Mr.\r\nW.E.H. Leeky, M.P., as given in his recent work on \"Democracy and\r\nLiberty\":--\r\n\r\n     After all due weight has been given to the possible remedies that\r\n     have been considered, it still seems to me that the parliamentary\r\n     system, when it rests on manhood suffrage, or something closely\r\n     approaching to manhood suffrage, is extremely unlikely to be\r\n     permanent. This was evidently the opinion of Tocqueville, who was\r\n     strongly persuaded that the natural result of democracy was a\r\n     highly concentrated, enervating, but mild despotism. It is the\r\n     opinion of many of the most eminent contemporary thinkers in France\r\n     and Germany, and it is, I think, steadily growing in England. This\r\n     does not mean that parliaments will cease, or that a wide suffrage\r\n     will be abolished. It means that parliaments, if constructed on\r\n     this type, cannot permanently remain the supreme power among the\r\n     nations of the world. Sooner or later they will sink by their own\r\n     vices and inefficiencies into a lower plane. They will lose the\r\n     power of making and unmaking ministries, and it will be found\r\n     absolutely necessary to establish some strong executive\r\n     independently of their fluctuations. Very probably this executive\r\n     may be established, as in America and under the French Empire, upon\r\n     a broad basis of an independent suffrage. Very possibly upper\r\n     chambers, constituted upon some sagacious plan, will again play a\r\n     great restraining and directing part in the government of the\r\n     world. Few persons who have watched the changes that have passed\r\n     over our own House of Commons within the last few years will either\r\n     believe or wish that in fifty years' time it can exercise the power\r\n     it now does. It is only too probable that some great catastrophe or\r\n     the stress of a great war may accelerate the change. (Vol. i., pp.\r\n     300, 301.)\r\n\r\nAnd the reason assigned for this very unsatisfactory state of affairs is\r\nprecisely as before:\r\n\r\n     All the signs of the times point to the probability in England as\r\n     elsewhere of many ministries resting on precarious majorities\r\n     formed out of independent or heterogeneous groups. There are few\r\n     conditions less favourable to the healthy working of parliamentary\r\n     institutions or in which the danger of an uncontrolled House of\r\n     Commons is more evident. One consequence of this disintegration of\r\n     Parliament is a greatly increasing probability that policies which\r\n     the nation does not really wish for may be carried into effect. The\r\n     process which the Americans call \"log-rolling\" becomes very easy.\r\n     One minority will agree to support the objects of another minority\r\n     on condition of receiving in return a similar assistance, and a\r\n     number of small minorities aiming at different objects, no one of\r\n     which is really desired by the majority of the nation, may attain\r\n     their several ends by forming themselves into a political syndicate\r\n     and mutually co-operating. (Vol. i., pp. 152, 153.)\r\n\r\nMr. Lecky, too, holds out very little hope for the future:--\r\n\r\n     When the present evils infecting our parliamentary system have\r\n     grown still graver; when a democratic House, more and more broken\r\n     up into small groups, more and more governed by sectional and\r\n     interested motives, shall have shown itself evidently incompetent\r\n     to conduct the business of the country with honour, efficiency, and\r\n     safety; when the public has learned more fully the enormous danger\r\n     to national prosperity as well as individual happiness of\r\n     dissociating power from property and giving the many an unlimited\r\n     right of confiscating by taxation the possessions of the few--some\r\n     great reconstruction of government is sure to be demanded. Fifty or\r\n     even twenty-five years hence the current of political opinion in\r\n     England will be as different from that of our own day as\r\n     contemporary political tendencies are different from those in the\r\n     generation of our fathers. Experience and arguments that are now\r\n     dismissed may then revive, and play no small part in the politics\r\n     of the future.\r\n\r\nWhy make democracy the scapegoat for all these evils, when they are\r\nsimply due to the imperfect organization of democracy? In any case, the\r\nmost that could rightly be urged would be that universal suffrage had\r\ncome before its time. The conclusion that its time will never come is\r\ncertainly not warranted. Universal suffrage cannot be condemned till it\r\nhas had a fair trial under a rational system of election. Mr. Lecky\r\nappreciates so little the connection between the method of election and\r\nthe splitting up into groups that he views without alarm the Hare\r\nsystem, which would still further develop groups.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps no one has caught the spirit of party government more truly\r\nthan Mr. Lecky. Dealing with the motives which should actuate the\r\nstatesman, in his latest work, \"The Map of Life,\" he writes:--\r\n\r\n     In free countries party government is the best if not the only way\r\n     of conducting public affairs, but it is impossible without a large\r\n     amount of moral compromise; without a frequent surrender of private\r\n     judgment and will. A good man will choose his party through\r\n     disinterested motives, and with a firm and honest conviction that\r\n     it represents the cast of policy most beneficial to the country. He\r\n     will on grave occasions assert his independence of party, but in\r\n     the large majority of cases he must act with his party, even if\r\n     they are pursuing courses in some degree contrary to his own\r\n     judgment.\r\n\r\n     Everyone who is actively engaged in politics--everyone especially\r\n     who is a member of the House of Commons--must soon learn that if\r\n     the absolute independence of individual judgment were pushed to its\r\n     extreme, political anarchy would ensue. The complete concurrence of\r\n     a large number of independent judgments in a complicated measure is\r\n     impossible. If party government is to be carried on there must be,\r\n     both in the Cabinet and in Parliament, perpetual compromise. The\r\n     first condition of its success is that the Government should have a\r\n     stable, permanent, disciplined support behind it, and in order that\r\n     this should be attained the individual member must in most cases\r\n     vote with his party. Sometimes he must support a measure which he\r\n     knows to be bad, because its rejection would involve a change of\r\n     government, which he believes would be a still greater evil than\r\n     its acceptance, and in order to prevent this evil he may have to\r\n     vote a direct negative to some resolution containing a statement\r\n     which he believes to be true, (p. 112.)\r\n\r\nMr. Lecky goes on to point out that \"many things have to be done from\r\nwhich a very rigid and austere nature would recoil;\" but he\r\nadds:--\"Those who refuse to accept the conditions of parliamentary life\r\nshould abstain from entering into it.\" Moreover, he holds that\r\n\"inconsistency is no necessary condemnation of a politician, and\r\nparties as well as individual statesmen have abundantly shown it.\" But\r\nstill \"all this curious and indispensable mechanism of party government\r\nis compatible with a high and genuine sense of public duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe American theory of government is that checks must be placed on a\r\ndemocratic legislature by a fixed Constitution and a separate executive\r\nexercising a veto. The late Professor Freeman Snow, of Harvard\r\nUniversity, was a strong supporter of this school. His objections to\r\ncabinet government are given in the \"Annals of the American Academy of\r\nPolitical and Social Science\" for July, 1892:--\r\n\r\n     Cabinet government is the government of a party; and for its\r\n     successful operation it must have at all times a majority at its\r\n     back in Parliament. If it were possible to direct the current of\r\n     public opinion into exactly two channels, there would be but two\r\n     parties, one of which would generally be in the ascendency; but in\r\n     practice this is found to be a very difficult thing to accomplish,\r\n     and it becomes the more difficult as the right of suffrage is\r\n     extended to the mass of the people, with their ever-varying\r\n     interests. In the countries of continental Europe parties, if\r\n     indeed they may be said to exist, are broken up into groups, no two\r\n     or more of which ever act together for any considerable length of\r\n     time; and ministries are without a moment's notice confronted at\r\n     brief intervals with opposing majorities, and must give place to\r\n     others, whose tenure of office is, however, equally unstable and\r\n     ephemeral. There is no other alternative; one of the two great\r\n     parties must yield to any faction which becomes strong enough to\r\n     hold the balance of power between them, or suffer the inevitable\r\n     consequences--instability and impotence of government.\r\n\r\nDr. Snow evidently thought that it is not possible to direct the\r\ncurrent of public opinion into exactly two channels. He certainly had\r\nnot the slightest idea that it might be a matter of electoral machinery.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may quote the opinion of Mr. James Bryce, M.P., whose\r\n\"American Commonwealth\" is one of the most complete studies of the\r\ntendencies of democracy in existence. Comparing the English and American\r\nsystems, he writes of the former:--\r\n\r\n     That system could not be deemed to have reached its maturity till\r\n     the power of the people at large had been established by the Reform\r\n     Act of 1832. For its essence resides in the delicate equipoise it\r\n     creates between the three powers, the ministry, the House of\r\n     Commons, and the people. The House is strong because it can call\r\n     the ministry to account for every act, and can by refusing supplies\r\n     compel their resignation. The ministry are not defenceless, because\r\n     they can dissolve Parliament, and ask the people to judge between\r\n     it and them. Parliament, when it displaces a ministry, does not\r\n     strike at executive authority; it merely changes its agents. The\r\n     ministry when they dissolve Parliament do not attack Parliament as\r\n     an institution; they recognise the supremacy of the body in asking\r\n     the country to change the individuals who compose it. Both the\r\n     House of Commons and the ministry act and move in the full view of\r\n     the people, who sit as arbiters, prepared to judge in any\r\n     controversy that may arise. The House is in touch with the people,\r\n     because every member must watch the lights and shadows of sentiment\r\n     which play over his own constituency. The ministry are in touch\r\n     with the people, because they are not only themselves\r\n     representatives, but are heads of a great party, sensitive to its\r\n     feelings, forced to weigh the effect of every act they do upon the\r\n     confidence which the party places in them.... The drawback to this\r\n     system of exquisite equipoise is the liability of its equilibrium\r\n     to be frequently disturbed, each disturbance involving either a\r\n     change of government, with immense temporary inconvenience to the\r\n     departments, or a general election, with immense expenditure of\r\n     money and trouble in the country. It is a system whose successful\r\n     working presupposes the existence of two great parties and no more,\r\n     parties each strong enough to restrain the violence of the other,\r\n     yet one of them steadily predominant in any given House of Commons.\r\n     Where a third, perhaps a fourth, party appears, the conditions are\r\n     changed. The scales of Parliament oscillate as the weight of this\r\n     detached group is thrown on one side or the other; dissolutions\r\n     become more frequent, and even dissolutions may fail to restore\r\n     stability. The recent history of the French Republic has shown the\r\n     difficulties of working a Chamber composed of groups, nor is the\r\n     same source of difficulty unknown in England. (Vol. i., pp. 286,\r\n     287.)\r\n\r\nThus we find the opinion unanimously held that the one great fault to\r\nwhich cabinet government is liable is instability of the ministry, owing\r\nto imperfect organization of public opinion into two definite lines of\r\npolicy. Bagehot called it a case of unstable equilibrium, and Bradford,\r\nin \"The Lesson of Popular Government,\" goes further when he\r\ndeclares:--\"Not to speak disrespectfully, the ministry is like a company\r\nof men who, after excessive conviviality, are able to stand upright only\r\nby holding on to each other.\"\r\n\r\nYet, after all, the amount of stability simply depends on the state of\r\norganization; and England has demonstrated in the golden period of her\r\npolitical history (about the middle of the present century) that the\r\ncabinet form of government can be quite as stable as the presidential\r\nform. Therefore, if the present position gives cause for alarm, it is\r\nnot in the abolition of the cabinet or the restriction of the suffrage\r\nthat the remedy must be sought, but in improved organization. And this,\r\nwe hope to show, involves improved electoral machinery.\r\n\r\n+France.+--Turn to France. Is there no lesson to be drawn from the\r\nhistory of that unstable country since the Revolution let loose its\r\nflood of human passions, ambitions, and aspirations? Has not every\r\nattempt at popular government failed for the same cause--want of\r\norganization?\r\n\r\nFrance before the Revolution had groaned for centuries under the burden\r\nof a decayed feudalism and an absolute monarchy. The last vestige of\r\nconstitutional forms had disappeared. The representatives of the estates\r\nhad not been convened since the meeting of the States-General in 1614.\r\nThe widespread and unprecedented misery of the people caused them to\r\nrevolt against being taxed without their consent, and a cry went up for\r\na convocation of the estates. The finances were in such a bad way that\r\nLouis XVI. was forced to consent, and the three estates--clergy, nobles,\r\nand commons--met at Versailles in 1789. At first they called themselves\r\nthe National Assembly, but the King foolishly took up such a position\r\nwith regard to the people's representatives that they swore solemnly\r\nthat they would not separate till they had laid the foundation of a new\r\nConstitution, and henceforth were known as the Constituent Assembly. It\r\nwas determined that the King should no longer be absolute, and the\r\nchoice lay between a constitutional monarchy and a republic. The\r\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man was first drawn up, and the Assembly\r\nsettled down to its task. The leading spirit was Mirabeau. He had been\r\nto England, and had studied the British Constitution, and he rightly saw\r\nthat France was too distracted by faction to maintain an independent\r\nexecutive. He therefore openly advocated a constitutional monarchy with\r\na cabinet chosen from among the majority of the representatives. But,\r\nunfortunately, the Assembly refused to follow his lead; nor would the\r\nKing take his advice to make a separate appeal to the people. In the\r\nmidst of the negotiations Mirabeau died, and the last chance of\r\nestablishing a constitutional monarchy disappeared. The King realized\r\nthis, and tried to escape to the German frontier but was brought back.\r\nHe then accepted the new Constitution, and the Legislative Assembly was\r\nelected in 1791. From the first it had no elements of stability, being\r\nsplit up into groups, and subject to the fear of the Paris mob. The King\r\ncontinued to plot with the emigrant nobles against the Constitution, and\r\nthe foreign armies massed on the frontier. The danger brought on the\r\ntriumph of the revolutionary spirit in 1792. The Paris commune\r\noverwhelmed both the King and the Assembly, and the republic was\r\nproclaimed. Then followed the execution of the King, the Reign of\r\nTerror, the control of the Committee of Public Safety, till finally the\r\nanarchy was ended by the military despotism of Bonaparte, who became\r\nFirst Consul and afterwards Emperor.\r\n\r\nWhat is the significance of these events in the light of our previous\r\nexamination of English history? Simply this: That the French, in passing\r\nat once from absolutism and feudalism to complete self-government, were\r\ntrying to jump to the Second stage of representation without passing\r\nthrough the first stage. Mirabeau was right; the republic was foredoomed\r\nto failure because the people had learned neither the power of nor the\r\nnecessity for organization.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the French Revolution parallels the English Revolution.\r\nIn each case the King was beheaded; in each case the anarchy of a\r\ndisorganized representative body was succeeded by a military despotism;\r\nand in each case the monarchy was restored.\r\n\r\nIt was after the restoration that the English system of party government\r\nwas developed. Why did this system not now take root in France? Partly\r\nbecause France was not blessed with a king like William of Orange, and\r\npartly because the new _systeme de bascule_, the balance system, in\r\nwhich the king allows each faction in turn to hold the reins of power,\r\nwas discovered. So, instead of the gradual growth of constitutional\r\nliberty which took place in England, the tendency in France was back to\r\nabsolutism. In 1830 Charles X., finding that he could not manage the\r\nChamber of Deputies, issued the ordinances of St. Cloud, suspending the\r\nliberty of the press and dissolving the Legislature. Paris immediately\r\nbroke out into insurrection, and the King was forced to abdicate. The\r\ncrown was offered to Louis Philippe, and a second attempt at\r\nconstitutional monarchy was made. But France was too divided by her\r\nunfortunate legacy of faction to maintain a continuous policy. The\r\nLegitimists, the Republicans, and the Bonapartists were all awaiting\r\ntheir opportunity. In 1848 the second revolution broke out in Paris; the\r\nking fled to England, and a republic was again tried. But the\r\nimperialist idea revived when Louis Napoleon was elected President. In\r\n1851 he carried out his famous _coup d'etat,_ and again the Constitution\r\nwas swept away. In the following year he was accepted as Emperor by an\r\nalmost unanimous vote. Thus France again elected to be ruled by an\r\nirresponsible head. The Third Empire ended with the capture of Napoleon\r\nIII. at Sedan in 1870, and since then France has carried on her third\r\nexperiment in republicanism. But still the fatal defect of\r\ndisorganization retards her progress; the Legislature is still split up\r\ninto contending factions, and in consequence it has been found\r\nimpossible to maintain a strong executive. Occasionally the factions\r\nsink their differences for a time when their patriotism is appealed to,\r\nas they have agreed to do during the currency of the present Exhibition,\r\nbut it is abundantly evident that France can never be well governed\r\ntill the people are able to organize two coherent parties. There is\r\nground for hope that the monarchical and imperialist ideas are\r\ndeclining, and that the people are settling down to the conviction that\r\nthere is nothing left but the republic. What makes recovery difficult is\r\nthat the national character has been affected by the continual strife in\r\nthe direction of excitability and desire for change.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to understand the forces which brought about the\r\ndifferent changes and revolutions, traced by one who has grasped their\r\nmeaning, should read the account in the first volume of Mr. Bradford's\r\n\"Lesson of Popular Government.\" His conclusion only need be quoted\r\nhere:--\r\n\r\n     As has been said, that which constitutes the strength of the\r\n     English. Government, that which has made up its history for the\r\n     last two hundred years, is the growth and continuity of two solid\r\n     and coherent parties. Occasionally they have wavered when available\r\n     leaders and issues were wanting, but as soon as a strong man came\r\n     forward to take the reins the ranks closed up and the work of\r\n     mutual competition again went on. On the other hand, the curse and\r\n     the cause of failure of representative government on the Continent\r\n     of Europe is the formation within the legislature of unstable and\r\n     dissolving groups. In France the Extreme Eight, the Eight, the\r\n     Eight Centre, the Left Centre, the Left, and the Extreme Left are\r\n     names of differing factions which unite only for temporary purposes\r\n     and to accomplish a victory over some other unit, but which are\r\n     fatal to stable and firm government. The same is true of Italy,\r\n     Spain, and Austria, and if not of Germany it is because military\r\n     despotism holds all alike in subjection.\r\n\r\nMr. Bodley has come to the same conclusion in his work on \"France.\" He\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n     There is no restraining power in the French parliamentary system to\r\n     arrest a member on his easy descent, and he knows that if he\r\n     escapes penal condemnation he will enjoy relative impunity. Many\r\n     deputies are men of high integrity; but virtue in a large assembly\r\n     is of small force without organization, and, moreover, a group of\r\n     legislators leagued together as a vigilance committee would have\r\n     neither consistency nor durability, which the discipline of party\r\n     can alone effect. Corruption of this kind, which has undermined the\r\n     republic, could not co-exist with party government. A party whose\r\n     ministers or supporters had incurred as much suspicion as fell on\r\n     the politicians acquitted in the Panama affair would under it be\r\n     swept out of existence for a period. When the first denunciations\r\n     appeared, the leaders of the party, to avert that fate, would have\r\n     said to their implicated colleagues--\"In spite of your abilities\r\n     and of the manifest exaggeration of these charges we must part\r\n     company, for though you may have been culpable only of\r\n     indiscretion, we cannot afford to be identified with doubtful\r\n     transactions;\" and the Opposition, eager not to lose its vantage,\r\n     would scan with equal keenness the acts of its own members. With\r\n     party government the electorate would not have appeared to condone\r\n     those scandals. But as it was, when a deputy involved in them went\r\n     down before his constituents, whose local interest he had well\r\n     served, with no opponent more formidable than the nominee of some\r\n     decayed or immature group, they gave their votes to the old member,\r\n     whose influence with the prefecture in the past had benefited the\r\n     district, rather than to the new comer, whose denunciations had no\r\n     authority; whereas, had each electoral district been the scene of a\r\n     contest between organized parties, the same spectacle would not\r\n     have been presented.\" (Vol. ii., pp. 302, 303.)\r\n\r\nMr. Bodley has, in this last sentence, touched the heart of the\r\nproblem. If the salvation of France depends on making each electoral\r\ndistrict the scene of a contest between two organized parties, is not\r\nelectoral machinery destined to play an important part in the solution?\r\n\r\n+The United States.+--The third great experiment in representative\r\ndemocracy which the nineteenth century has furnished is that which is\r\nbeing conducted in the United States. The contrast with France is\r\nremarkable. Just as France is the supreme example of want of\r\norganization, so America is the most conspicuous instance of perfect\r\norganization into two great national parties which the world has seen.\r\nYet both experiments were started by a revolution, and practically at\r\nthe same time. The difference lay in the fact that the Americans\r\ninherited the capacity for self-government from their British ancestors,\r\nand had already practised it in colonial times, while the French only\r\ninherited innumerable causes of dissension.\r\n\r\nBut organization is not the only characteristic feature of American\r\npolitics. Strange to say, it is accompanied by a suppression of\r\nindividuality just as complete. It is organization without responsible\r\nleadership. For, in the first place, the politicians look on themselves\r\nnot as leaders but as followers of the people; and in the second place,\r\nthere are no leaders in Congress, corresponding to the cabinet ministers\r\nof British countries.\r\n\r\nNow, the view which we wish to emphasize here is that the present\r\nposition of American politics is the natural result of the principles\r\nembodied in the Constitution adopted in 1789, when the Union was formed.\r\nThe complete organization and the want of leadership are directly to be\r\ntraced to the labours of George Washington and his associates. A brief\r\nglance at the Constitution and the early history of its working will\r\nmake this clear.\r\n\r\nThe thirteen States which revolted from England worked fairly well\r\ntogether under the \"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\" as\r\nlong as the war lasted, but as soon as peace was proclaimed it was, as\r\nWashington said, no better than anarchy. The famous Convention of 1787\r\nwas therefore held, and the Constitution was drawn up. One guiding\r\nprinciple of its framers was to divide power so as to place checks on\r\nthe will of the people, and on outbursts of popular passion, which were\r\nthen greatly dreaded. One means of attaining this object was the\r\nattempted separation of the legislative and executive functions. We say\r\nattempted advisedly, for time has but shown that the two are\r\ninseparable. But the framers of the Constitution divided the legislative\r\nfunction between the two Houses, and vested the executive function\r\nalmost entirely, as they thought, in the President. Montesquieu, in his\r\n\"_Esprit des Lois_\" had laid down that the great merit of the English\r\nConstitution was the separation of these functions, and the Americans\r\naccepted this view. But, in truth, the English cabinet system had not\r\nthen been fully developed. The King was still, not only in appearance,\r\nbut to some extent also in fact, the head of the executive, and there\r\nwas nothing to indicate that ministers were so soon to become the real\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this provision was a struggle between the two branches for\r\nsupremacy, and the legislatures have won. The President has been\r\ndegraded to a mere agent, and the legislatures have absorbed the greater\r\npart of executive functions, even to the control of finance. Now, the\r\nframers of the Constitution were apprehensive that the President might\r\nbecome a mere party agent, and they tried to strengthen his position by\r\ntwo devices. First, they gave him the power to veto statutes unless\r\noverruled by a two-thirds majority of Congress; and, secondly, they\r\nprovided for his election by an electoral college, or by a double system\r\nof election. This second provision was designed to ensure the election\r\nof a President for personal instead of for party reasons; but it has\r\nproved a complete failure. Almost from the first the electoral delegates\r\nhave had to pledge themselves to support the party nominee. The veto,\r\ntherefore, has also become practically useless. Thus it has come about\r\nthat Congress is a body entirely without leaders.\r\n\r\nA second defect in the Constitution was that it said nothing about the\r\nright of any State to withdraw from the Union. After nearly 70 years\r\nthis omission was responsible for the Civil War. The legal basis for\r\nsecession was then abandoned, but combinations of States have since been\r\nregarded with the greatest apprehension. This conviction that the Union\r\nmust be maintained at any price has had very important consequences on\r\nthe party system. The danger of allowing combinations of States to\r\ndominate party lines was demonstrated; and the division of each State by\r\nthe same national parties was recognized as essential to safety.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, as we have seen, Congress had practically got control\r\nof the executive functions, which were supposed to be exercised by the\r\nPresident, including the nominations to office. Thus every member of the\r\nparty in a majority had a share of the plunder, and \"the spoils to the\r\nvictors\" became the basis of party organization. The system soon\r\nunderwent such a remarkable development that nearly 200,000 public\r\noffices were at the disposal of the victors at each election. The party\r\norganizations immediately became omnipotent. The secret of their power\r\nlay in the control of nominations. Each party would nominate one\r\ncandidate only, and the electors voted neither for men nor measures, but\r\nblindly for party. As Mr. Bryce declares:--\"The class of professional\r\npoliticians was therefore the first crop which the spoils system--the\r\nsystem of using public office as private prize of war--bore. Bosses\r\nwere the second crop.\"\r\n\r\nThe development which these party organizations have now reached is\r\nextraordinary. Practically we may say that there are only two\r\nparties--Republicans and Democrats--and they dominate not only Federal\r\nand State politics but also city government. Each party has its list of\r\nregistered electors, and each holds a primary election before the real\r\nelection, to decide the party candidate. But these primary elections are\r\na mere matter of form. Only a small fraction of the electors attend\r\nthem, and only those who have always supported the party are allowed to\r\nvote. The nominations are therefore really controlled, by fraud if\r\nnecessary, by the \"ring\" of party managers. Generally there is one man\r\nwho can pull the most strings, and he becomes the \"boss.\" All power is\r\ncentred in the hands of this irresponsible despot. The men who are\r\nelected owe their positions to him, and are responsible to him, not to\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nRemember that these \"machine\" organizations have absolute sway in every\r\nelectorate, from one end of the United States to the other. It may be\r\nwondered why the people tolerate them, but they are powerless. Sometimes\r\nan independent movement is attempted, but it very rarely succeeds, and\r\neven when it does the two \"machines\" combine against it and agree to\r\ndivide the spoils. Mr. Bryce writes:--\r\n\r\n     The disgust is less than a European expects, for it is mingled\r\n     with amusement. The \"boss\" is a sort of joke, albeit an expensive\r\n     joke. \"After all,\" people say, \"it is our own fault. If we all went\r\n     to the primaries, or if we all voted an independent ticket, we\r\n     could make an end of the 'boss.'\" There is a sort of fatalism in\r\n     their view of democracy. (Vol ii., p. 241.)\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of all this wonderful party machinery? It is this:\r\nthat organization without responsible leadership can only be founded on\r\ncorruption. In other words, _the spoils system is the price which the\r\nUnited States pay for maintaining the Union under the present\r\nConstitution_. The fault lies ultimately, therefore, in the\r\nConstitution, which tends to repress responsible leadership.\r\n\r\nNow, the mass of public opinion in America, as Mr. Bryce continually\r\npoints out, is sound, and attempts have not been wanting to put an end\r\nto the system of rotation in public offices. A sustained agitation for\r\ncivil service reform was entered upon, and the system of competitive\r\nexamination was applied to a large number of offices. Now at last, the\r\nreformers thought, American politics would be purified. But, no! The\r\ncorruption, simply took a new and more alarming turn. Direct money\r\ncontributions took the place of the spoils. It became the practice to\r\nlevy blackmail on corporations either to be let alone, or for the\r\npurpose of fleecing the public. The monopolies granted to protected\r\nindustries are the source of a large share of these \"campaign funds.\"\r\nThe Legislatures are crowded by professional lobbyists, and it is, in\r\nconsequence, impossible to obtain justice against the corporations.\r\nSurely no stronger proof can be needed that corruption is and must\r\nremain the basis of organization so long as there is no responsible\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake, however, to suppose that the Americans are not\r\nalive to the failure of their representative institutions. Since Mr.\r\nBryce's great work on \"The American Commonwealth\" was published two\r\nbooks by American authors have appeared which are very outspoken in\r\ncondemnation. These are \"The Unforeseen Tendencies of Democracy,\" by Mr.\r\nE.L. Godkin; and \"The Lesson of Popular Government,\" by Mr. Gamaliel\r\nBradford. The keynote of the first of these two books is to abolish\r\ncorruption by destroying the power of the \"machine\" and the \"boss,\" and\r\nof the second to introduce responsible leadership. Mr. Godkin traces the\r\ndisappearance of distinguished men from public life to the control of\r\nall entrance to it by the \"machine.\" The reform of primary elections, he\r\nholds, is then the first necessity, since \"independent voting\" has\r\nceased to be a remedy. But he fails to find a solution. The conclusion\r\nhe comes to is as follows:--\r\n\r\n     Is the situation then hopeless? Are we tied up inexorably simply to\r\n     a choice of evils? I think not. It seems to me that the nomination\r\n     of candidates is another of the problems of democracy which are\r\n     never seriously attacked without prolonged perception and\r\n     discussion of their importance. One of these was the formation of\r\n     the federal government; another was the abolition of slavery;\r\n     another was the reform of the civil service. Every one of them\r\n     looked hopeless in the beginning; but the solution came in each\r\n     case, through the popular determination to find some better way.\r\n     (Pp. 92, 93.)\r\n\r\nBut the evil goes far deeper than Mr. Godkin appears to think. To\r\nabolish corruption is to take away the present basis of organization\r\nwithout substituting any other. If irresponsible leadership is to be\r\nabandoned, responsible leadership must be introduced. Mr. Bradford's\r\nplan, therefore, promises more, for if responsible leadership could be\r\nintroduced into Congress corruption would then be abolished also.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradford's whole book may be said to be a study of the relations of\r\nthe executive to the legislature, and the conclusions at which he\r\narrives are a complete vindication of cabinet government. But he finds\r\none fault, and that is the instability of ministries, which he confesses\r\nhas not been apparent so far in the British House of Commons. He holds,\r\nhowever, that it will become more apparent with the rising tide of\r\ndemocracy. It is rather amusing to find that the greatest obstacle which\r\nhas to be overcome in proposing a responsible executive is the\r\nveneration in which the Constitution is still held and the dislike to\r\ncopying anything from England. His plan is, therefore, an adaptation of\r\nthe cabinet to the conditions imposed by the Constitution. He holds that\r\nthe ministers appointed by the President should sit in Congress and have\r\ncontrol of the initiation of legislation. It is to be feared that this\r\nwould hardly realize the idea of responsible leadership. Mr. Bradford\r\nestablishes a chain of responsibility by the fact that the ministers are\r\nresponsible to the President and the President is responsible to the\r\npeople; but that is a very different thing to the continual\r\nresponsibility of the cabinet to a majority of the legislature. It is\r\nprobable that the President's ministers would have to encounter the\r\nopposition of a majority in one or both Houses, and it is difficult to\r\nsee how a deadlock could be avoided. Mr. Bradford contemplates that the\r\npeople would settle any issues which arise between the two branches at\r\nthe end of the Presidential term of four years; but it is just as likely\r\nthat there would then be a new President in any case. We are driven to\r\nthe conclusion, therefore, that responsible leadership is incompatible\r\nwith the American system of divided powers and fixed terms of office.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryce comments on the proposal as follows:--\r\n\r\n     It is hard to say, when one begins to make alterations in an old\r\n     house, how far one will be led on in rebuilding, and I doubt\r\n     whether this change in the present American system, possibly in\r\n     itself desirable, might not be found to involve a reconstruction\r\n     large enough to put a new face upon several parts of that system.\r\n     (Vol. i, pp. 290, 291.)\r\n\r\nThis is very true, but is not a new building required? Is not the old\r\nhouse built on a rotten foundation? Mr. Bradford has certainly\r\noverlooked the effect of his proposal on party organization for one\r\nthing. If the power over legislation, and especially over expenditure of\r\npublic money, is to be taken away from the irresponsible committees of\r\nCongress, the basis of party organization would cease to be corruption,\r\nand both representatives and parties would have to take on an entirely\r\nnew character. As to the present character of representatives, Mr. Bryce\r\nadvances a number of reasons why the best men do not go in for politics,\r\nsuch as the want of a social and commercial capital, the residential\r\nqualification, the comparative dullness of politics, the attractiveness\r\nof other careers, &c, but Mr. Bradford declares that the one explanation\r\nwhich goes further than all these is the absorption of all the powers of\r\nthe government by the legislature, and the consequent suppression of\r\nindividuality. He writes:--\r\n\r\n     The voters are urged to send to Congress men of character, ability,\r\n     and public spirit. They might as well be asked to select men of\r\n     that quality to follow the profession of burglars, a comparison\r\n     which is not intended to convey any disrespect to the number of\r\n     honest and respectable men who constantly are sent to Congress.\r\n     Chosen as burglars, they would fail just the same in the\r\n     business.... It is the organization of Congress which offers every\r\n     facility to those who wish to buy and those who wish to be bought.\r\n\r\nAgain, as to the present character of parties, Mr. Bradford declares:--\r\n\r\n     The names of the two great parties, Republicans and Democrats, have\r\n     in themselves and at the present time no meaning at all.\r\n\r\nSimply because the basis of organization is corruption, and not\r\nquestions of public policy. For the same reason recent elections have\r\nbeen fought on popular \"crazes,\" such as the silver question. But Mr.\r\nBradford says:--\r\n\r\n     New parties cannot be formed on constantly changing issues, since\r\n     to have any strength they must have a certain degree of permanence.\r\n     The only two nations which have succeeded in forming great national\r\n     parties are Great Britain and the United States. In other European\r\n     countries the splitting into groups has almost made representative\r\n     government impossible.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Bradford has failed to appreciate is that the absolutely rigid\r\ndivision into two camps which prevails in America is founded on\r\ncorruption, and will disappear when corruption is abolished. In the\r\nUnited States such a thing as a Congressman deserting one party for the\r\nother is practically unknown. In Great Britain, on the contrary, party\r\nlines do continually change as new issues arise; and when they are\r\nfounded on questions of public policy it must be so. What gives them\r\npermanence is that certain principles underlie most questions, and men\r\nwho have the same political principles are likely to think the same on\r\nany single question; and further that a member would rather follow his\r\nparty and sacrifice his opinion on a single question than sacrifice most\r\nof his principles.\r\n\r\nTherefore, even if the Americans do succeed in purifying their politics,\r\nthey will be faced with the same difficulty as exists elsewhere--namely,\r\nsuch improved organization as will secure the return of representatives\r\non questions of general public policy only. The present system of\r\nsingle-membered electorates will not suffice. The only remedy lies in\r\nenlarged electorates with electoral machinery which will organize public\r\nopinion into two definite lines of policy, and will, by allowing\r\nindividual candidature merge the primary election into the actual\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nAll this involves a radical alteration, both in the Constitution and in\r\nthe methods of election. But the United States have the great advantage\r\nover France that it does not involve also a serious change in the\r\nnational character. It is not unlikely that some such reform must be\r\nbrought about before long.\r\n\r\nThe present position cannot last. The Republican party has so long\r\nidentified itself with Capital in all its forms, with the protected\r\nmonopolists, the trusts and the corporations, that the mass of Labour\r\nthreatens to support the Democrats; and as the latter party maintains\r\nthe doctrines of direct government and the infallibility of the\r\nmajority, the result will be such a financial crisis and such an\r\nindustrial revolution that the Americans will have at last to admit that\r\ntheir government needs total reconstruction.\r\n\r\n+Australia.+--On the first day of the nineteenth century the Union of\r\nthe Parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland was accomplished; on the\r\nfirst day of the twentieth century Britain's daughters in the southern\r\nseas will inaugurate, under her ægis, a new experiment in\r\ndemocracy--the Australian Commonwealth. The time is opportune, then, for\r\na review of the tendencies of Australian politics, and for a comparison\r\nwith the other great democracies. Thus only can we attempt to cast the\r\nhoroscope of the new nation.\r\n\r\nAustralia starts with many advantages over France and America. The\r\nscience of government is better understood now than when they started;\r\nthe folly of placing too many checks on the people is recognized; and\r\nthe British system of responsible leadership by a cabinet in the\r\nlegislature is fully developed. All these features are embodied in the\r\nConstitution, and it only remains for the people to prove their fitness\r\nto work it.\r\n\r\nApplying the same tests as we have used in the case of the great\r\ndemocracies to the present position of Australian politics, what is the\r\nresult? First, as regards organization, where do we stand? It must be\r\nconfessed that we are far behind Great Britain and America, though\r\ncertainly we are not in the same sad plight as France. Still there is\r\nthe fact that we are classed among the failures. Take the evidence of\r\nMr. E.L. Godkin in \"Unforeseen Tendencies of Democracy:\"--\r\n\r\n     In his Journals during a visit to Turin in 1850, Senior records a\r\n     conversation with Cesare Balbo, a member of the Chamber in the\r\n     first Piedmontese Parliament, in which Balbo said, after an\r\n     exciting financial debate:--\"We have not yet acquired parliamentary\r\n     discipline. Most of the members are more anxious about their own\r\n     crotchets or their own consistency than about the country. The\r\n     ministry has a large nominal majority, but every member of it is\r\n     ready to put them in a minority for any whim of his own.\" This was\r\n     probably true of every legislative body on the Continent, and it\r\n     continues true to this day in Italy, Greece, France, Austria,\r\n     Germany, and the new Australian democracies. (Pp. 102, 103.)\r\n\r\nHe adduces in support of the statement the fact that the three colonies\r\nof New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria have had respectively\r\ntwenty-eight, forty-two, and twenty-six ministries in forty years. Is\r\nthe prospect any brighter for the new Commonwealth? It is to be feared\r\nnot, if the present tendencies towards disintegration are allowed to\r\ngrow. For in the last decade a change has come over Australian politics\r\nwhich portends the gravest danger. We refer to the direct class\r\nrepresentation which, under the name of Labour parties, has spread all\r\nover the colonies. These so-called Labour \"parties\" are neither more nor\r\nless than class factions. Their policy is everywhere the same--viz., the\r\nuse of the \"balance system,\" which has proved so disastrous to France.\r\nThe worst effect is that they prevent the main parties from working out\r\ndefinite policies on public questions, and cause them also to degenerate\r\ninto factions. In Victoria we have actually had the ludicrous spectacle\r\nof the Opposition saving the Government time after time when deserted by\r\nits own followers. In New South Wales the individual member is sunk in\r\nthe party; he must vote as the majority decides. Mr. Reid's term of\r\noffice was ended by one such caucus. In Queensland, where the party is\r\nstrongest, it has now practically become one of the main parties, and\r\nthe whole colony is divided on class lines. Already an Intercolonial\r\nLabour Conference has been held, and a pledge drawn up which must be\r\nsigned by all candidates for the party support at Federal elections. The\r\ndanger of these tactics is not rightly apprehended in Australia. In\r\nreality they mark the first step towards social disruption. We may cite\r\nthe authority of Mr. James Bryce on this point. After pointing out in\r\n\"The American Commonwealth\" that since the Civil War combinations of\r\nStates have always acted through the national parties, he writes:--\r\n\r\n     This is an important security against disruption. And a similar\r\n     security against the risk of civil strife or revolution is to be\r\n     found in the fact that the parties are not based on or sensibly\r\n     affected by differences either of wealth or of social position.\r\n     Their cleavage is not horizontal, according to social strata, but\r\n     vertical. This would be less true if it were stated either of the\r\n     Northern States separately, or of the Southern States separately:\r\n     it is true of the Union taken as a whole. It might cease to be true\r\n     if the new Labour party were to grow till it absorbed or superseded\r\n     either of the existing parties. The same feature has characterized\r\n     English politics as compared with those of most European countries,\r\n     and has been a main cause of the stability of the English\r\n     government and of the good feeling between different classes in the\r\n     community. (Vol. ii., p. 38.)\r\n\r\nHow is it that the public conscience is not alive to the enormity of\r\nthis anti-social crime? Mainly, we think, because the true principles of\r\nrepresentation are not properly understood. It is almost universally\r\nassumed that there is no real distinction between direct and\r\nrepresentative government. Minorities are tacitly allowed to have as\r\nmuch right to representation as the minority, and the confusion of terms\r\nis passed over. The working classes are told by self-seeking demagogues\r\nthat they are in a majority; that the majority is entitled to rule; and\r\nthat they have only to organize to come into their heritage. These\r\nsycophants, who, as Aristotle of old pointed out, bear the greatest\r\nresemblance to the court favourite of the tyrant, ask the people to\r\nbelieve the silly paradox that the united wisdom of the whole people is\r\ngreater than that of the wisest part. The truth is that no people is fit\r\nto exercise equal political rights which is not sensible enough to\r\nchoose the wisest part to carry on the government, providing only they\r\nhave control over their selection, and can hold them responsible. Are\r\nthe working classes in Australia going to demonstrate that they are\r\nunfit for the exercise of political rights? Are they going to justify\r\nthe prognostications of the opponents of popular government? That is the\r\nreal question at issue. Unless public opinion be aroused to the iniquity\r\nof class delegation, the further degradation of Australian politics is\r\ninevitable. Let it not be thought that we are decrying the organization\r\nof the working classes for political purposes. On the contrary, we hold\r\nthat the organization of every class and every interest is necessary in\r\norder that it shall exert its just share of influence. But the only way\r\nin which every class can get its just share is by acting through the\r\ntwo main parties. A class which holds aloof can exert for a short time\r\nan undue share of influence, as a faction holding the balance of power,\r\nbut only at the expense of paralyzing the government.\r\n\r\nBut the working classes are hardly to be blamed in this matter, for it\r\nis a fact that before their action they were not able to exert their\r\njust share of influence. The government was such as to promote the rule\r\nof private interests instead of the general welfare, and, consequently,\r\ntheir interests were shamefully neglected. The real cause of the\r\nmischief was, as in America, the nominating system, which is inseparably\r\nconnected with the present method of election. The consideration of this\r\nquestion brings us to the second characteristic of Australian\r\npolitics--namely, the irresponsible leadership of the press.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how in America organization has been effected without\r\nresponsible leadership in Congress, only at the expense of the\r\nirresponsible leadership of the \"rings\" and \"bosses\" who control the\r\n\"machines.\" In Australia an analogous result has been brought about by\r\ndifferent causes. We have not had civil strife to teach us the necessity\r\nof organization, nor have we a spoils system available as a basis, but\r\nthe disorganized state of the legislatures and the consequent weakness\r\nof the executive have thrown a large share of leadership into the hands\r\nof the press. Both in America and in Australia the prevalence of the\r\nultra-democratic theory that representatives should follow and not lead\r\nthe people has been a powerful contributing cause. And yet it is as\r\nclear as possible that the choice lies between two alternatives. The\r\npeople must either submit to responsible leadership in Parliament or to\r\nirresponsible leadership outside. The ultra-democrats hold that\r\nresponsible leadership in Parliament is incompatible with popular\r\ngovernment. We believe that this is the fundamental error which is\r\nleading both the Australian and the American democracies astray. On the\r\ncontrary, it is the irresponsible despotism which is exercised by the\r\n\"bosses\" in America and the newspapers in Australia which is really\r\nincompatible with free government.\r\n\r\nThe source of the error lies in the failure to grasp the meaning of the\r\nterm \"responsible leadership.\" It is assumed that either the people must\r\nlead and the representatives follow, or the representatives must lead\r\nand the people follow. Bagehot may be taken as an exponent of the latter\r\nposition. He thought that cabinet government was only possible with a\r\ndeferential nation as opposed to a democratic nation. England he held to\r\nbe the type of deferential nations, because the people were content to\r\nleave the government to the \"great governing families\"--_i.e._, to defer\r\nto caste, which is in principle the same as deferring to a king, who is\r\nsupposed to rule by divine right. Mr. Bradford also gives a somewhat\r\nexaggerated idea of the importance of the force of personality when he\r\ndeclares that the mass of the people have no \"views\" on public\r\nquestions; all they want is to be well governed. The late Professor\r\nFreeman Snow, of Harvard University, U.S., was a supporter of the\r\nultra-democratic view. In the \"Annals of the American Academy of\r\nPolitical and Social Science\" for July, 1892, he declares:--\r\n\r\n     Mr. Bryce thinks that, \"like other crowds, a legislature must be\r\n     led and ruled.\" And he has formulated a theory which he believes to\r\n     be \"the essence of free or popular government, and the\r\n     justification for vesting power in numbers.\" \"Every question that\r\n     arises in the conduct of government,\" he asserts, \"is either a\r\n     question of ends or a question of means.\" And as the \"masses are\r\n     better judges of what will conduce to their happiness than are\r\n     the-classes placed above them, they must be allowed to determine\r\n     ends.\" But, assuming the end to be given, they--the masses--should\r\n     leave to their leaders--the trained statesmen--the choice of means.\r\n     The defect in this theory is that it depends for its successful\r\n     operation upon the continued \"deference of the multitude for the\r\n     classes placed above them ... upon the principle of _noblesse\r\n     oblige_,\" a principle, by the way, derived from feudal monarchy,\r\n     which has no existence in the United States, and which ought to be\r\n     considered a misfortune in any free country....\r\n\r\n     Mr. Bryce has made a step in advance of Mr Bagehot in trusting the\r\n     people to determine ends, whatever they may be; why not go one step\r\n     further, and trust them to determine all questions of policy?\r\n\r\nThese are the two opposite points of view. They are both equally wrong.\r\nThe first is simply irresponsible leadership, and the second amounts to\r\nthe same thing in practice, however much the people may appear to lead\r\nin theory. The true position is that the relation between the\r\nrepresentatives and the people is reciprocal. Both lead and both follow.\r\nThe people defer to the representatives, not on account of rank or\r\ncaste, nor upon the principle of _noblesse oblige_, but only in so far\r\nas the representatives are able to demonstrate their fitness to devise\r\nmeasures for the general welfare. The people, on the other hand, are the\r\nultimate judges, both of measures and of men. This mutual action and\r\nreaction constitutes the responsible leadership, which is one of the\r\nfundamental principles underlying the device of representation. To it we\r\nhave already traced the virtue of representation as a social force,\r\ncapable of moulding national character and of appealing to the higher\r\nnature of the people.\r\n\r\nAn elector who is unable or unwilling to decide grave questions of\r\npublic policy himself may be a very shrewd judge as to who is best\r\nfitted to decide them; and deference to ability is totally different in\r\nprinciple to deference to caste. In a country in the transitional stage\r\nbetween aristocracy and democracy, his judgment may be based partly on\r\nthe principle of _noblesse oblige_; but there is not the slightest\r\nreason why in a democratic country he should require the representative\r\nto defer to him. He will merely require a higher standard and a closer\r\nand a more constant demonstration that the measures proposed are\r\nconducive to the public well-being. Moreover, it is still necessary that\r\nthe representatives should be judged periodically on general lines of\r\npolicy, and that the elector should not have the power of exercising\r\ncontrol on single questions. Under these conditions the result of the\r\nmutual relation will be an improvement on both sides. But if, under the\r\ninfluence of irresponsible leadership outside Parliament, the people\r\ninsist on increasing control over their representatives, then not only\r\nis Parliament degraded, but progress towards government in the general\r\nwelfare is stopped.\r\n\r\nThis long digression as to the real meaning of responsible leadership is\r\nnecessary in order to gauge the drift of the prevailing tendency towards\r\nthe irresponsible leadership of the press in Australia. The evil exists\r\nin all the colonies, but it is perhaps worse in our own colony of\r\nVictoria than in any other country in the world, although it is said to\r\nbe very bad in Switzerland since the referendum was introduced. We have\r\ntwo morning newspapers in Melbourne, which take opposite sides on nearly\r\nevery question which arises. They admit into their columns no facts and\r\nno arguments which tell against the position they have taken up; nay,\r\nmore, they resort to downright misrepresentation to support it. It will\r\nbe said that this is only a form of the party game, but the danger lies\r\nin the fact that they circulate in different classes, and therefore\r\nthese classes see only one side of every question. Moreover, in their\r\ncompetition for the support of classes in which they desire to increase\r\ntheir circulation they use their influence to secure legislation which\r\nwill appeal to class prejudices, or even undertake a prolonged agitation\r\nto relieve special interests from legitimate charges. The _Age_ has for\r\na long time thrived by pandering to the prejudices of the working\r\nclasses, and especially of the artisans; the _Argus_ now seeks to get\r\neven by creating dissension between town and country.\r\n\r\nAll this interference with the functions of Parliament has a baneful\r\ninfluence on the working of the political machine. The party lines are\r\npractically decided by the newspaper contest. We have spoken of the\r\nresemblance to the \"machine\" control over American politics. One of the\r\nnewspapers is, in effect, managed by a \"ring,\" the other by a \"boss.\"\r\nThe despotism of David Syme in Melbourne is as unquestioned as that of\r\nRichard Croker in New York, or Matthew Quay in Pennsylvania. How close\r\nthe analogy is may be inferred from the fact that Mr. Syme has\r\nexercised, and still claims the right to exercise, control over\r\nnominations to Parliament. It is notorious that the ten delegates who\r\n\"represented\" Victoria at the Federation Convention were elected on the\r\n_Age_ \"ticket.\" Again, Mr. Syme is known as \"the father of protection,\"\r\nand has been able, by the force of his indomitable will, to impose on\r\nthe colony a tariff which can be compared only to the M'Kinley tariff\r\nin America, thus showing that irresponsible leadership in either form is\r\nmore favourable to the rule of private interests than to the general\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nWe have said enough to show that in internal affairs the influence of\r\nthe press, when it directly interferes with Parliament is an anti-social\r\nforce. In matters of foreign policy the case is still worse. The press\r\nis almost universally jingoistic, because it is financially interested\r\nin sensationalism. A war generally means a fortune to newspaper\r\nproprietors. In such matters, therefore, responsible leadership by\r\nParliament is still more urgently required.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the claim of those ultra-democrats who preach the\r\npoisonous doctrines of direct government and of unrestrained majority\r\nrule, that responsible leadership is incompatible with popular\r\ngovernment. This claim, is of course, supported by the radical press in\r\nAustralia. We have already quoted from Mr. Syme's work on\r\n\"Representative Government in England\" the extreme views in which he\r\nconfuses representation with delegation. \"Popular government,\" he\r\ndeclares, \"can only exist where the people can exercise control over\r\ntheir representatives at all times and under all circumstances.\" The\r\nmethod proposed to obtain this control is to give a majority of the\r\nconstituents power to dismiss a representative at any time, and is\r\nutterly impracticable. Imagine the position of a member elected by a\r\nmajority of one or two votes! The true way to prevent members abusing\r\ntheir trust is not to increase the direct control of the people, but to\r\nprevent the control of the press and all other irresponsible agencies\r\nover them; and so to ensure the return of better men.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking anomaly in Mr. Syme's position is that, while\r\nhe would confine the office of Parliament to expressing public opinion,\r\nhe declares in the same work that \"the press at once forms and expresses\r\npublic opinion.\"[2] Now, it is quite true that if Parliament is weak and\r\ndisorganized, or occupies itself in fighting for the spoils of office,\r\nthe power of forming public opinion is thrown into the hands of the\r\npress. But the more power is seized by the press, the more Parliament is\r\ndegraded, and the less is the chance of recovery. The situation presents\r\nlittle difficulty to Mr. Syme. Every newspaper reader, he declares,\r\n\"becomes, as it were, a member of that vast assembly, which may be said\r\nto embrace the whole nation, so widely are newspapers now read. Had we\r\nonly the machinery for recording the votes of that assembly, we might\r\neasily dispense with Parliament altogether.\"\r\n\r\nThese ideas are not of mere academic interest; they have dominated the\r\ntrend of Victorian politics for many years. The time has now arrived for\r\nthe people to consider whether it is better to keep a Parliament of weak\r\ndelegates to express the public opinion which is formed by the press\r\nthan to elect a Parliament of \"leaders of the people,\" highly-trained\r\nlegists, economists, and sociologists, to form and direct the public\r\nopinion which is expressed by the newspapers. Why should the principle\r\nof leadership, as exemplified in Mr. Syme's own career, be given full\r\nscope in the press, and entirely repressed in Parliament? As to the kind\r\nof influence we mean, no better description could be given than that of\r\nthe well-known Labour leader, Mr. H.H. Champion. In an open letter to\r\nMr. David Syme in the _Champion_ of 22nd June, 1895, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n     Yet, if you rose to-morrow morning with the resolve to dismiss the\r\n     ministry or to reverse the policy of the country, to stop\r\n     retrenchment or to recommence borrowing, that resolve would\r\n     infallibly translate itself into fact in a few weeks.\r\n\r\n     In no country that I know of has any organ in the press so much\r\n     influence as your paper. It is practically the sole source of\r\n     information for the majority of the people. It has no competitors.\r\n     It can make any person or policy popular or unpopular. It can fail\r\n     to report any man or thing, and for four-fifths of the citizens it\r\n     is as though that man or thing were not. It can misrepresent any\r\n     speech or movement, and the printed lie alone will reach the\r\n     electors. It could teach the people anything you choose. It has\r\n     ruled the country for a couple of decades. It rules the country\r\n     to-day.\r\n\r\nProfessor Jethro Brown shows himself alive to the danger of press\r\ndomination in Australia. In \"The New Democracy\" he writes:--\"The\r\n_prestige_ of Parliament is destroyed when its deliberations and\r\nconclusions cease to be the determining factor in legislation. The\r\ntransfer of the real responsibility for legislation to a new power\r\nimplies the discrediting of the old school for training leaders.\" And he\r\nquotes with approval the expression of opinion by the Honourable B.R.\r\nWise in the Federal Convention:--\r\n\r\n     There may be, as Mr. David Syme suggests, no risk involved in the\r\n     change of masters; but for my part I would sooner trust the\r\n     destinies of the country to the worst Parliament the people of\r\n     Australia would elect than to the best newspaper the mind of man\r\n     has ever imagined.\r\n\r\nIt is little use, therefore, for the press to further degrade Parliament\r\nin the eyes of the people by railing at it in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n     So it is that Parliament as a working machine is about the\r\n     clumsiest and least effective that can be conceived of. All our\r\n     Parliaments are modelled on the necessities of bygone centuries. We\r\n     want a working Parliament improved up to date; but we lack\r\n     political invention, and have to jog along with the old lumbering\r\n     machine--a sort of bullock dray trying to compete with an age of\r\n     electric railways and motor cars.[3]\r\n\r\nThe remedy lies with the press itself. Let it abandon all illegitimate\r\ninfluence, and use its power in a legitimate direction to give effect to\r\nthe principles of organization and responsible leadership in Parliament.\r\nBut just as the Labour faction cannot altogether be blamed for the\r\npresent disintegration of Parliament, so the press cannot be held\r\nresponsible for its degradation. In both eases cause and effect have\r\nbeen interrelated. The mistake which the press has made has been in not\r\nperceiving that the more it interferes with the legitimate functions of\r\nParliament, even although with the best intentions, the more it degrades\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nWe have now passed in review the two great dangers which assail the\r\nCommonwealth at the inception of federation. We have shown how\r\nintimately related they are to the two great principles underlying\r\nrepresentative government--organization and leadership. Nay, we have\r\nseen that all the varied phenomena presented by the great democracies of\r\nthe world can be expressed in terms of the same two principles.\r\n\r\nIt remains to show that to give effect to the expression of these two\r\nprinciples in a more perfect manner than ever yet attained is a problem\r\nof electoral machinery. This task we shall now undertake.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] \"Representative Government in England,\" p. 123.\r\n\r\n[3] _Age_, 28th June, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE REFORM: TRUE PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to give effect to the principles of organization and leadership in\r\nan electoral reform--that is the problem which we shall now attempt to\r\nsolve. We have already laid down the theoretical requirements, which are\r\n(1) proportional representation to the two parties--the majority and the\r\nminority, and (2) the election by each party separately of its most\r\npopular leaders; and we shall now have to consider also how these\r\nrequirements are modified by practical considerations.\r\n\r\n+Proportional Representation to the Two Parties, the Majority and the\r\nMinority.+--It will be as well to illustrate the method proposed by\r\nreference to the conditions imposed by an actual election, such as that\r\nfor the Federal Senate. The Commonwealth Bill provides that each State\r\nshall be polled as a single electorate, returning six senators. Suppose\r\nthat 120,000 electors vote on party lines in any State. It is clear that\r\na party which has the support of 20,000 electors is entitled to one\r\nsenator; also, that a party which has the support of 40,000 electors is\r\nentitled to two senators; of 60,000 electors to three senators, and so\r\non. Now, suppose that one party has the support of 50,000 electors, and\r\nthe other of 70,000 electors, then the minority is entitled to two and a\r\nhalf senators, and the majority to three and a half senators. But\r\nsenators are living units, and cannot be divided into fractions. The\r\nquestion therefore arises, Which is entitled to the odd senator, the\r\nmajority or the minority? And the answer is that they are both equally\r\nentitled to him; for it is as much a tie as if each party has the\r\nsupport of 10,000 electors in a single-seat electorate. But if the\r\nminority had the support of 49,999 electors, or one elector less, it\r\nwould be entitled to only two senators, and if it had the support of\r\n50,001 electors, or one elector more, it would be entitled to three\r\nsenators.\r\n\r\nFrom the above simple facts can be deduced general rules applicable to\r\nany particular case. It is evident that the result is not affected by\r\nthe number of votes allowed to each elector, providing only that each\r\nelector has the same number of votes. It is also quite irrespective of\r\nthe number of candidates nominated in the interests of each party. But\r\nit would never do to allow party organizations to control nominations.\r\nHow are we to combine individual candidature with party nomination? The\r\nonly way to do this is to require that each candidate shall declare,\r\neither when nominating or a few days before the election, on which side\r\nof the House he intends to sit, and be classified accordingly as\r\nMinisterialist or Oppositionist. To decide the relative strengths of the\r\ntwo parties, it is then only necessary to take the aggregate votes\r\npolled by all the candidates nominated for each party as a measure of\r\nthe amount of support which it receives.\r\n\r\nThe great advantages of this provision are at once apparent. There is no\r\nincentive to limit the number of candidates so as to prevent splitting\r\nthe votes. On the contrary, it is to the interest of each party to get\r\nas many strong candidates as possible to stand in its interests. There\r\nwill be no necessity to ask any candidate to retire for fear of losing a\r\nseat to the party. Thus the control of nominations, which leads to the\r\nworst abuses of the present system, will be entirely obviated.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose that in the instance we have already given each elector is\r\nallowed to vote for one candidate only, the total number of votes\r\nrecorded will be 120,000. Then the _unit of representation_ or number of\r\nvotes which entitle a party to one senator will be 20,000 votes; each\r\nparty will be entitled to one senator for every whole unit of\r\nrepresentation, and the odd senator will go to the party having the\r\nlarger remainder. For instance, if the aggregate votes polled by all the\r\nMinisterialist candidates be 72,000, and by the Oppositionist candidates\r\n48,000, the Ministerialists, having three units plus 12,000 remainder,\r\nare entitled to four senators, and the Opposition, having two units plus\r\n8,000, to two senators.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if each elector be allowed to vote for a number of\r\ncandidates, all these figures will be increased in proportion. For\r\nexample, if each elector has three votes, the unit of representation\r\nwould be 60,000 votes. The following general rules may therefore be\r\nstated:--\r\n\r\n     1. The unit of representation is equal to the total number of valid\r\n     votes cast at the election, divided by the number of seats.\r\n\r\n     2. Each party is entitled to one seat for every whole unit of\r\n     representation contained in the aggregate votes polled by all its\r\n     candidates, and the odd seat goes to the party which has the larger\r\n     remainder.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the last seat has to be assigned to the party which has\r\nthe larger remainder is sometimes advanced as an objection, but it is\r\nevidently the fairest possible division that the size of the electorate\r\nwill permit. Of course, the larger the electorate the more accurately\r\nproportioned will be the representation. Hence the representation would\r\nbe most accurate if the whole assembly were elected in one large\r\nelectorate. But if, for the sake of convenience, the assembly be elected\r\nin a large number of electorates in which the relative proportions of\r\ntwo parties vary the gains which a party makes in some electorates will\r\nbe balanced by losses in others, so that the final result would be\r\nalmost as accurate as if the whole country were polled as one\r\nelectorate. It must be remembered that the result in any electorate\r\ncannot be foreseen, and that it is a matter of chance which party gains\r\nthe advantage. Now, if the limits of variation comprise even a single\r\nunit of representation, each party will stand an equal chance of\r\ngaining, and therefore the laws of chance will ensure that the gains\r\nbalance the losses in the different electorates. Supposing a party which\r\naverages 40 per cent. in the whole country to vary between 30 per cent.\r\nand 50 per cent, in the different electorates (which may be taken as a\r\nfair assumption), the unit of representation should equal 20 per cent.,\r\nor one-fifth. Under these conditions the laws of chance will ensure\r\ncorrect representation, so long as the electorates do not contain less\r\nthan five seats.\r\n\r\nThe above facts furnish a complete answer to the arguments advanced by\r\nMr. J.W. M'Cay, ex-M.L.A., in a series of articles in the _Age_ against\r\nthe application of proportional representation to the Federal Senate.\r\nWhile apparently recognizing that it is utterly impossible for the\r\nminority to secure a majority of the representation, he based his\r\nobjection solely on the fact that a minority is able with electorates\r\ncontaining an even number of seats to secure one-half of the\r\nrepresentation, and thus lead to what he terms \"the minority block.\"\r\n\r\nThe force of the objection will entirely depend on the size of the\r\nminority which is able thus to thwart the will of the majority. The\r\nFederal Senate will consist of 36 senators, each of the original States\r\ncontributing six. No reasonable man would complain if the minority,\r\nbeing only entitled to 17 senators, actually returned 18, but Mr. M'Cay\r\npoints out that it is possible for a minority entitled to 15 senators to\r\nreturn 18. To bring about this result he makes the absurd assumption\r\nthat in each of the six States the minority polls exactly two whole\r\nunits of representation, and a bare majority of a third unit. It is safe\r\nto say that this would not happen once in a thousand years. If the\r\nrelative proportions of the two parties vary in the slightest in the\r\ndifferent States some must be under and some over the assumed\r\nproportion. It is most probable that it will be under it in three States\r\nand over it in the other three States; and, under these circumstances,\r\nthe party will return 15 senators, the exact number to which it is\r\nentitled. It may happen to be under the assumed proportion in only two\r\nof the States and over in the other four, and that the party will get\r\none more senator than it is entitled to; but it is extremely improbable\r\nthat it will get two more, and virtually impossible that it will get\r\nthree more senators than its just proportion. Mr. M'Cay's conclusion\r\nthat proportional representation can only be used in electorates\r\nreturning an odd number of representatives is shown to be entirely\r\nunwarranted. Equally fallacious is Professor Nanson's rebutting\r\nstatement that \"scientific proportionalists recommend odd electorates.\"\r\nWhile the number of States remains even, the mathematical chance of a\r\nminority securing one-half of the representation is precisely the same\r\nwhether the States return an odd or an even number of senators. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the danger of a minority securing one-half of the\r\nrepresentation is much greater at the intermediate elections for the\r\nSenate, when each State returns three senators, the reason being the\r\nsmaller field.\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt at some length on the preceding example, because it serves\r\nto refute another error into which some of the proportionalists have\r\nfallen. It is held that the unit of representation should be ascertained\r\nby dividing the total votes, not by the number of seats, but by the\r\nseats increased by one. This unit is generally known as the Droop quota,\r\nhaving been proposed in a work published by Mr. H.R. Droop in 1869.\r\nSince one vote more than one-half of the total votes is sufficient for\r\nelection in a single-seat electorate, it is argued that one vote more\r\nthan one-third suffices in a two-seat electorate, one vote more than\r\none-fourth in a three-seat electorate, and so on. The unit in a six-seat\r\nelectorate would be one-seventh of the votes instead of one-sixth, and\r\nit is pointed out that by this means the whole six seats would be filled\r\nby whole units, leaving an unrepresented residuum of one-seventh of the\r\nvotes divided between the two parties.\r\n\r\nThe error lies precisely as before in concentrating attention on one of\r\nthe electorates, and in neglecting the theory of probability. The Droop\r\nquota introduces the condition that each party must pay a certain\r\nminimum number of votes for each seat, and the real distinction is that,\r\ninstead of the minority and the majority having an equal chance of\r\nsecuring any advantage, the chances are in the same proportion as their\r\nrelative strengths. If the majority be twice as strong as the minority,\r\nit will have twice the chance of gaining the advantage. To prove this,\r\nconsider the position of a one-third minority in a number of five-seat\r\nelectorates. The Droop quota being one-sixth of the votes, the minority\r\nwill secure two seats or 40 per cent. in those electorates where it is\r\njust over one-third, and one seat or 20 per cent. where it is just\r\nunder. Since the mathematical chances are that it will be over in one\r\nhalf and under in the other half, it will, on the average, secure only\r\n30 per cent., although entitled to 33 per cent. Again, if the 670\r\nmembers of the House of Commons were elected in three to five-seat\r\nelectorates, and the Droop quota used as proposed by Sir John Lubbock,\r\nand if the Ministerialists were twice as strong as the Oppositionists,\r\nthey would, on the average, return 30 more members than the two-thirds\r\nto which they are entitled, and this would count 60 members on a\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nThe following table illustrates the erroneous result obtained by\r\napplying the Droop quota when a number of grouped-electorates are\r\nconcerned. It will be noticed that where parties are nearly equal it\r\nmakes very little difference which unit is used:--\r\n\r\n+-------------+--------------------------------------------+\r\n| STRENGTH OF |           AVERAGE REPRESENTATION.          |\r\n|             +----------------------+---------------------+\r\n|    PARTY    |Five-Seat Electorates.|Ten-Seat Electorates.|\r\n+-------------+----------------------+---------------------+\r\n| 10 per cent.|      2 per cent.     |     6 per cent.     |\r\n| 20  \"    \"  |     14  \"    \"       |    17  \"    \"       |\r\n| 30  \"    \"  |     26  \"    \"       |    28  \"    \"       |\r\n| 40  \"    \"  |     38  \"    \"       |    39  \"    \"       |\r\n| 50  \"    \"  |     50  \"    \"       |    50  \"    \"       |\r\n+-------------+----------------------+---------------------+\r\n\r\nThe Droop quota, therefore, gives, not proportional, but disproportional\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\n+Election by Each Party of its Most Popular Candidates.+--Still keeping\r\nin mind the six-seat electorate for the Federal Senate, we may note that\r\nthere are two rival systems in the field--the _scrutin de liste_ or\r\nBlock Vote, in which each elector votes for any six of the candidates,\r\nand the Hare system, which allows each elector an effective vote for one\r\ncandidate only. The adoption of either of these systems would be\r\nunfortunate. To force each elector to vote for six candidates is\r\nprobably to require him to vote for more than he is inclined to support,\r\nand certainly for more than his party is entitled to return; and, also,\r\nto put it in the power of the majority to return all six senators. To\r\nallow him to vote for one candidate only, on the other hand, is to break\r\nup both parties into factions by allowing the favourites of sections\r\nwithin the parties to be elected, instead of those most in general\r\nfavour with all sections composing each party. An intermediate position\r\nis therefore best. No elector should be required to vote for more than\r\nthree candidates, and no elector should be allowed to vote for less.\r\nBecause in the first place it is evident that each party will, on the\r\naverage, return three senators, and, secondly, it may be taken for\r\ngranted that even the minority will nominate at least three candidates.\r\nTwo alternative proposals may be submitted as fulfilling these\r\nconditions:--\r\n\r\n    _1. Each elector should vote for any three candidates, or\r\n\r\n    2. Each elector should have six votes, and have the option of giving\r\n    two votes to individual candidates._\r\n\r\nThe first plan is the simpler, but the second is probably the better, as\r\nit allows more discrimination without sacrificing any of the advantages.\r\nEither proposal is practically equivalent to applying the Block Vote to\r\neach party separately; and whatever may be the objections to applying\r\nthe Block Vote to two or more parties it is the simplest and best system\r\nto elect the candidates most in general favour when one party only is\r\nconcerned. It is true that the majority will return rather more than\r\none-half of the representatives and the minority rather less than\r\none-half, so that the minority will have more votes in proportion to its\r\nstrength. But with two parties of fairly equal but fluctuating strength\r\nthe fairest way is to require each elector to vote for at least one-half\r\nof the number of representatives. Besides, apart from the fact that it\r\nis not known before the election how many seats each party will obtain,\r\nit is absolutely necessary that each elector shall have the same number\r\nof votes in order that each party be allotted its just share of\r\nrepresentation. Moreover it is not proposed to limit the elector's\r\nfreedom of choice in the slightest by confining him to the candidates of\r\none party. The great majority of electors will vote on party lines,\r\nbecause every vote given to a candidate of the opposing party tells\r\nagainst the representation of their own party. The reason of this is\r\nthat every vote counts individually for the candidate and collectively\r\nfor the whole party. Any elector, therefore, who divides his voting\r\npower equally between the two parties practically wastes it as far as\r\nthe party representation is concerned. But it is neither necessary nor\r\ndesirable to bring about such a rigid party division as prevails in\r\nAmerica, for instance, where a man is born, lives, and dies Republican\r\nor Democrat. If electors were confined to the candidates of one party,\r\nan elector who wished to vote for an individual candidate of the\r\nopposing party would be placed in the dilemma of deserting either his\r\nfavourite or his party. The division into parties is really required in\r\nthe elected body, and not in the constituent body.\r\n\r\n+Rules for the Reform.+--We are now in a position to draw up a list of\r\nrules for the proposed reform, applicable to all legislatures in which\r\nparty government prevails:--\r\n\r\n1. Electorates to be grouped so as to contain at least three seats, and\r\npreferably not less than five seats nor more than twenty seats.\r\n\r\n2. Candidates to declare when nominating, or a few days before the\r\nelection, whether they are in favour of or opposed to the party in\r\npower, and to be classified accordingly as Ministerialists or\r\nOppositionists.\r\n\r\n3. Ballot papers to contain the names of all candidates nominated,\r\narranged in two parallel columns, one headed Ministerialists, and the\r\nother Oppositionists. The list of candidates under each heading to be\r\narranged in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n4. Each elector to have as many votes as there are seats, and to be\r\nallowed to give either one or two votes to any candidate. The votes to\r\nbe distributed as he pleases among all the candidates of both lists.\r\n\r\n5. The total number of valid votes cast at the election to be divided by\r\nthe number of seats; the quotient to be known as the \"unit of\r\nrepresentation.\"\r\n\r\n6. Each party to be allowed one seat for every whole unit of\r\nrepresentation contained in the aggregate votes polled by all its\r\ncandidates, and the last seat to go to the party which has the larger\r\nremainder.\r\n\r\n7. The candidates of each party having the highest number of votes to be\r\ndeclared elected to the number of seats to which each party is entitled\r\nin accordance with the preceding rule.\r\n\r\n8. In case of a tie between candidates or parties the lot decides.\r\n\r\nThe alternative plan for rule 4, which is somewhat simpler, would read\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n4. Each elector to vote for half the number of candidates that there are\r\nseats, _i.e._, three votes in a five or six-seat electorate, four votes\r\nin a seven or eight-seat electorate, &c. The votes to be distributed as\r\nhe pleases among all the candidates of both lists.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to dwell on the absolute simplicity of these rules.\r\nThey involve no radical departure from existing methods of voting or of\r\ncounting votes. Once the totals are added up, the calculations necessary\r\nto decide the successful candidates are within the reach of a school\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.--Take as an example 13 candidates in a six-seat electorate who\r\npoll as follows:--\r\n\r\n  MINISTERIALISTS.                    OPPOSITIONISTS.\r\nBROWN           83,000              YOUNG          53,000\r\nRYAN            74,000              BELL           51,000\r\nCOX             44,000              HUME           47,000\r\nWHITE           42,000              JONES          45,000\r\nPEEL            38,000              BLACK          34,000\r\nADAMS           35,000                            -------\r\nGREY            33,000                            230,000\r\nSWIFT           21,000\r\n               -------\r\n               370,000\r\n\r\nTotal votes = 370,000 + 230,000 = 600,000.\r\n\r\nUnit of representation = 600,000/6 = 100,000.\r\n\r\nMinisterialists: 3 units + 70,000 remainder = 4 seats.\r\n\r\nOppositionists: 2 units + 30,000 remainder = 2 seats.\r\n\r\nThe Ministerialists, having the larger remainder, secure the last seat.\r\nThe successful candidates are Brown, Ryan, Cox, and White (M.), Young\r\nand Bell (O.)\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that without the proportional principle the\r\nMinisterialists would have returned two members only, and the\r\nOppositionists four.\r\n\r\nIt is to be distinctly understood that the simpler plan of voting for\r\nhalf the number of candidates that there are seats is practically as\r\ngood as the other. In order to show, however, that the plan we have\r\nfavoured may be simplified, we illustrate by a sample ballot paper a\r\nmethod which has been used in Belgium. Two white spots are printed\r\nopposite each candidate's name. An ink pad and stamp are then provided\r\nat each polling booth, and the elector stamps out a white spot for each\r\nvote he wishes to give. In the paper illustrated two votes are given to\r\nBrown, two to Jones, one to Grey, and one to Swift. This elector has,\r\ntherefore, given two-thirds of his voting power to the Ministerial\r\nparty, and one-third to the Opposition, and has thus directly influenced\r\nboth policies. A further advantage of the proposal is the ease with\r\nwhich such a paper can be read by the returning officer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALLOT PAPER\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMinisterialists.

Your ballot paper will be invalid if you stamp out more or less than\r\nSix white spots.\r\n\r\n+Character of Parties.+--We must now prove that the methods proposed\r\nwill actually organize the people into two coherent parties. Let us\r\nsuppose either party to be composed of three sections. The problem is to\r\ninduce these three sections to work together, and to sink their petty\r\ndifferences in the general interest, in short to unite as a party,\r\naiming at the control of administration with a definite policy on public\r\nquestions. Let us further suppose the party entitled to three\r\nrepresentatives. Now, it is quite conceivable that exactly the same\r\nthree candidates would be elected if each elector had any number of\r\nvotes from one to three, and this would actually tend to be the case the\r\nmore united the party is. But herein lies the difference: that with one\r\nvote only any one section holding narrow and violent views can return an\r\nindependent delegate, and therefore has a direct inducement to do so,\r\nwhile with three votes it is forced to work with the other two sections,\r\nfor if it refuses to do so it is in their power to exclude its nominee.\r\nIt is this power to exclude independent factions which is the first\r\nrequisite to prevent the main parties degenerating into factions. Now,\r\nthe advocates of the Hare system declare that each elector should have\r\none effective vote only, no matter how many seats the party is entitled\r\nto. The elector would therefore only express his opinion as to the\r\ndelegate of his own section, and not as to the constitution of the whole\r\nparty, and there would be nothing whatever to prevent the election of\r\nthe favourites of sections, instead of the representatives most in\r\ngeneral favour with all sections.\r\n\r\nBut if there were only one party it would be impossible to make all the\r\nsections work together in this manner. Some of them would combine into a\r\nmajority of the party, and would exclude the minority. With two great\r\ncompeting parties, however, the case is quite different. So far from\r\neither party wishing to exclude any small minority, both will compete\r\nfor its support, providing only that it will fall into line with the\r\nother sections on the main questions of policy. Each section will\r\ntherefore support the party which will consent to embody the most\r\nfavourable compromise of its demands in its policy. If its demands are\r\nsuch that both parties refuse to entertain them, it will exercise no\r\ninfluence in the direction of furthering its own views. From this\r\nstatement it is evident that no system of independent direct\r\nproportional representation within the party can be recognized as a\r\nright to which the different sections are entitled, as it would\r\ninevitably break up the party, and lead to sectional delegation. The\r\nsections would then change in character, and become violent factions.\r\nBut, nevertheless, if the sections work together as described, every\r\nsection will be proportionately represented in the party policy, and\r\ntherefore by every representative of the party. Moreover, no section can\r\ndictate to either party, or obtain more than a fair compromise. For all\r\nthe sections are interdependent, and any section which attempts to exert\r\nmore than its just share of influence will sink in general favour, and\r\nwill find those who are inclined to support its pretensions rejected at\r\nthe election.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two stages of representation may now be\r\nclearly appreciated. In the first stage we have seen that the fear of\r\nthe aggression of the monarchy held all sections together in one party.\r\nIn the second stage, however, it has been abundantly demonstrated by\r\nexperience that the fear of each other will not hold the sections of the\r\ntwo parties together. The electoral machinery must, therefore, supply\r\nthe deficiency.\r\n\r\n+Party Lines.+--With the altered character of parties there is ground\r\nfor hope that the basis of division will become questions of general\r\npublic policy, and that all causes of factious dissension and of social\r\ndisruption will tend to be repressed. This improvement is indeed\r\nurgently needed. For if in any country party lines are decided by\r\ngeographical considerations, as town _v._ country; by class, as Capital\r\n_v._ Labour; by race as in South Africa; by religion as in Belgium; or\r\nby personal ambition for the spoils of office--in any of these cases the\r\nfuture of that country is open to the gravest doubt.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest danger which assails most democratic countries\r\nto-day is the risk of the working classes being persuaded by demagogues\r\nthat equal political rights have been extended to them in order that\r\nthey shall govern, instead of in order that they shall not be\r\nmisgoverned. If the general welfare is to be advanced, all classes must\r\ninfluence the policies of both parties. This condition is indispensable\r\nto bring about the ideal condition of two parties differing only as to\r\nwhat is best for all.\r\n\r\nEqually to be condemned is the narrow-minded and intolerant view of\r\nthose who can see no virtue in an opposing party; who define, for\r\ninstance, the distinction between parties as the party for things as\r\nthey are, and the party for things as they ought to be; the latter\r\nbeing, of course, their own party. This is one of the objectionable\r\nfeatures of Australian newspaper-made politics.\r\n\r\nA more rational view of the distinction which often underlies party\r\ndivisions is between those who desire change and those who oppose\r\nchange. J.S. Mill points out how the latter may often be useful in\r\npreventing progress in a wrong direction. There are times when such\r\nattitude is called for, but generally speaking we may say that the\r\nfundamental distinction between parties should be a difference of\r\nopinion as to the direction of progress. Nor is it inconsistent for a\r\nparty to change its opinion or alter its policy; on the contrary, it is\r\nessential to progress. The majority must often modify its policy in the\r\nlight of the criticism of the minority, and the minority must often drop\r\nthe unpopular proposals which have put it in a minority. These features\r\nare all essential to the working of the political machine.\r\n\r\n+The Character of Representatives.+--Granting that all sections of each\r\nparty can be induced to work together, the beneficial effect on the\r\ncharacter of representatives would be incalculable. Instead of being\r\nforced to pander to every small section for support, they would appeal\r\nto all sections. The enlarged electorates which are contemplated would\r\nbe arranged to embrace the widest diversity of interest, and a\r\nrepresentative would then be free to follow his own independent\r\njudgment, unfettered by the dictation of small cliques. His actions\r\nmight offend some sections who supported his election; but he has a wide\r\nfield, and may gain the support of other sections by them. Therefore, he\r\nmay actually improve his position by gaining more supporters than he\r\nloses. Contrast this with the present system, in which the\r\nrepresentatives are cooped up in single-membered electorates to denned\r\nsets of supporters. The very principle of community of interest on which\r\nthese electorates must be arranged in order to get a fair result is\r\ndestructive of the idea of representation. It is no wonder, then, that\r\nthe present system is tending towards delegation. Local delegation we\r\nhave always had, more or less, but we are now threatened by class\r\ndelegation also.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of Mr. Kent in \"The English Radicals\" may be quoted on\r\nthis point. He says:--\r\n\r\n     The question of the relationship of members to their constituents\r\n     is at the present time perplexed and undetermined; for though the\r\n     control of Parliament by the people is an indisputable fact, yet it\r\n     is maintained by means of quite another kind from those which the\r\n     early Radicals proposed. The result is somewhat paradoxical, for\r\n     while the system of pledges has been contemptuously rejected, yet\r\n     the theory that a member is a delegate tacitly prevails in English\r\n     politics. That members of the House of Commons have tended and do\r\n     tend to lose their independence it is impossible to doubt. A\r\n     distinguished French publicist, M. Boutmy, for instance, has\r\n     remarked the fact; and he thinks that in consequence a\r\n     deterioration of the tone of politicians is likely to recur. Mr.\r\n     E.L. Godkin, an American writer, whose judgments are entitled to\r\n     respect, has expressed much the same opinion; \"the delegate\r\n     theory,\" he says, \"has been gaining ground in England, and in\r\n     America has almost completely succeeded in asserting its sway, so\r\n     that we have seen many cases in which members of Congress have\r\n     openly declared their dissent from the measures for which they\r\n     voted in obedience to their constituents.\"\r\n\r\nIt is one of the greatest merits of the proposed reform that this vexed\r\nquestion of representation or delegation would be definitely settled.\r\nFor, although the area of independent action is enlarged, definite\r\nlimits are set to it.\r\n\r\n+Possible Objections.+--We may now reply to some objections which have\r\nbeen or might be urged. At the outset we would point out that the\r\ncritics nearly always base their objections on the conditions which have\r\nprevailed in the past or do exist in the present chaotic state of\r\nparties; and seldom appreciate the fact that they would lose force if a\r\nbetter condition could be brought about. Let us take the Melbourne\r\n_Argus_ report of Professor Nanson's objections:--\r\n\r\n     Professor Nanson pointed out that the scheme depended for its\r\n     efficacy on the existence of party government, which the Professor\r\n     was glad to say was being pushed more and more into the background.\r\n     He took a practical illustration from the defeat of the O'Loghlen\r\n     Government in 1883. In that case, after the election the Government\r\n     came back with a following of one-tenth. The other combined party\r\n     had nine-tenths, and of these a little more than half were Liberals\r\n     and a little less than half were Conservatives. He pointed out that\r\n     under Mr. Ashworth's system the Liberals would have got the whole\r\n     of the Opposition seats and the Conservatives none, whereas under\r\n     any intelligent modification of the Hare system the parties would\r\n     have been returned in the proportion of five Liberals, four\r\n     Conservatives, and one O'Loghlenite. The system contained the evils\r\n     of the _scrutin de liste_ doubled by being applied to two parties,\r\n     the evils of the Limited Vote, which had been condemned by all\r\n     leading statesmen, and it played into the hands of these who were\r\n     best able to organize.\r\n\r\nTake the latter statements first. The evil of the Block Vote or\r\n_scrutin de liste_ is that it gives all the representation to the\r\nmajority, and excludes the minority; its merit is that it prevents the\r\nformation of a number of minorities. How this evil will be doubled if it\r\nis entirely removed by allowing both majority and minority their just\r\nshare of representation we leave the Professor to explain. The statement\r\nthat the scheme would play into the hands of those who are best able to\r\norganize is absolutely without foundation. On the contrary, the\r\norganization is automatic. It would certainly encourage the formation of\r\norganizations to influence the policies of the parties, since every\r\norganization would be able to exert its proportionate influence, but\r\nthat is an advantage, not an evil. We will leave the statement about\r\nparty government alone, and now take the \"practical illustration.\" The\r\nProfessor here assumes three distinct parties, but it is quite evident\r\nthere are only two. It is not usual for Liberal Unionists and\r\nConservatives to fight one another at elections in Great Britain at\r\npresent. In the same way, if a section of Liberals and a section of\r\nConservatives unite to oppose a Government, they will work together and\r\nnot try to exclude one another. Moreover, they will have a common\r\npolicy, so that it matters little who are elected so long as they are\r\nthe best men to carry out the policy. Is it likely the Conservatives\r\nwould join the Liberals, if the latter were trying to get all the\r\nseats? Thus all the Professor's assumptions are incorrect. But even if\r\nthey were correct the conclusion is still wrong. The Liberal section\r\ncould not get all the seats if they tried. Imagine a ten-seat\r\nelectorate, in which the combined party is entitled to nine members. The\r\nelectors would not be required to vote for more than five candidates,\r\nwhereas the Professor has assumed that they would be forced to vote for\r\nnine. He has forgotten that the Block Vote becomes the Limited Vote\r\nunder the conditions named, and that the Limited Vote allows the\r\nminority a share of representation. Besides, in any case, these\r\nconditions would never arise in a country in a healthy state of\r\npolitical activity, because then parties would tend more nearly to\r\nequalize each other in strength.\r\n\r\nIt has also been objected that a Ministerialist candidate, say, might\r\nstand as an Oppositionist, if the votes of the Opposition candidates\r\nwere more split up and it was likely to require less votes for election\r\nin that party. This is a rather fantastic suggestion. The candidate in\r\nquestion would have to declare himself in favour of a number of things\r\nwhich he would oppose immediately he was elected. If not, he would have\r\nto openly declare his intention, but that could easily be made illegal.\r\nIn any case there would be very little gained, and there is further the\r\nrisk that, if defeated, all his votes would count to the Opposition.\r\n\r\nAnother possible objection is that too many candidates might stand,\r\nsince it is to the interest of each party to get all the support it can.\r\nBut candidates are not likely to stand to oblige the party or when there\r\nis no chance of being elected. It is quite possible that, in a country\r\nalready split up into numerous groups, the groups would refuse to act\r\ntogether, and that each group would nominate its own list. This is an\r\nextreme assumption, and certainly would not happen in British countries.\r\nAnd there would be a constant incentive to the groups to compromise,\r\nsince a combination can return its candidates.\r\n\r\nWe hope now to have at least established the fact that the organization\r\nof a democracy into two coherent parties--a majority and a minority--is\r\nvitally connected with the electoral machinery. We do not claim that the\r\nmethod we have proposed will induce a people to vote on true party lines\r\nall at once, for human nature cannot be changed in a day; but we do\r\nconfidently assert that it will greatly accelerate that desirable\r\nresult, and will tend to give effect to the principles of organization\r\nand responsible leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nHOW THE EVILS OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM WILL BE REMEDIED.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the inception of the representative system it has been usual to\r\nelect representatives in small districts, returning only one or two\r\nmembers, and the single-membered electorate is now almost universal. In\r\nthe early Parliaments, however, elections were not contested as they are\r\nnowadays. It was merely a choice of the most suitable men to represent a\r\ncorporate local community. Hence an indirect method of election was\r\ngenerally resorted to, the final choice being left to a small committee\r\nof the most important men. With the gradual rise of the party system the\r\nconditions entirely changed; and it is important to gain a clear idea of\r\nwhat is involved in the change.\r\n\r\nIn the first stage we have referred to it is not probable that there\r\nwere any candidates at all. The position of member of Parliament was not\r\nsought after; it was rather thrust upon the man selected as a duty he\r\nowed the community. The choice would usually be unanimous, since there\r\nwould be some men whose recognized influence and attainments would mark\r\nthem off as most fitted for the position. If there was any difference of\r\nopinion it would be merely as to who was best fitted to represent all,\r\nand therefore there would never be any excluded minority.\r\n\r\nThe essential difference in the second stage is that every election is\r\ncontested by two organized parties. The choice is now not of men only,\r\nbut of measures and of men as well. It is a contest in the first place\r\nwithin each party as to who is best fitted to represent the party, and\r\nin the second place between the two parties for the support of the\r\npeople. The party in a majority secures all the representation; the\r\nparty in a minority none. Now, the minority is certainly not represented\r\nby the choice of the majority; on the contrary, its views are exactly\r\nthe opposite. Hence the question arises: Is not this exclusion of the\r\nminority an injustice? Does it not amount to disfranchisement? The usual\r\nreply is either that the majority must rule or that the injustice done\r\nin some electorates is balanced in others, so that in the long run rough\r\njustice is obtained.\r\n\r\nAs to the first contention, it is the party which has the support of a\r\nmajority of the whole people which should rule; and the excluded\r\nminority in some of the electorates belongs to this party. The second\r\npractically amounts to the statement that two wrongs make a right.\r\n\r\nA practice prevails in the United States which will illustrate the\r\nposition. Each State sends a number of representatives to Congress\r\nproportional to its population, and the division into electorates is\r\nleft to the State. By manipulating the electoral boundaries the party\r\nwhich has a majority in each State is enabled to arrange that the\r\ninjustice done to itself is a minimum, and that the injustice done to\r\nthe opposing party is a maximum. By this iniquitous practice, which is\r\nknown as the gerrymander, the party in a minority in each State is\r\nallowed to get only about one-half or one-quarter of its proper share of\r\nrepresentation. But as the practice is universal in all the States, the\r\ninjustice done to a party in some States is balanced in others. Will\r\nthose who seek to excuse the injustice done to the minority in each\r\nelectorate by the present system of election seriously contend that the\r\nsame argument justifies the gerrymander?\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the present system has survived the passage from the\r\nfirst stage of representation into the second, not because it does\r\njustice to both parties, but because it has operated largely to prevent\r\nthe formation of more than two parties. It has, therefore, been a means\r\nof giving effect to the central feature of representation, viz.: the\r\norganization of public opinion into two definite lines of policy. But it\r\nis a comparatively ineffective means, and it no longer suffices to\r\nprevent sectional delegation in any of the democracies we have examined.\r\nBesides, it is accompanied by a series of other evils, which in so far\r\nas they lead to the suppression of responsible leadership, tend to the\r\ndegradation of public life. We propose now to consider the effect of the\r\nreform in remedying these defects of the present system.\r\n\r\n+Parties Not Represented in the Legislature in the Same Proportion as in\r\nthe Country.+--Representation under the present system is purely\r\narbitrary; the amount which each party secures is a matter of chance. If\r\na party with a majority in the whole country has a majority in each of\r\nthe electorates it will secure all the representation. On the other\r\nhand, if it splits up its votes in each electorate, or even only in\r\nthose electorates where it has a majority, it may secure none at all.\r\nTheoretically, then, any result is possible. The argument would lose its\r\nforce, however, if in practice the result usually came out about right.\r\nBut this seldom happens, and, speaking generally, two cases may be\r\ndistinguished: first, when parties are nearly equal, the minority is\r\nalmost as likely as the majority to return a majority of the\r\nrepresentatives, thus defeating the principle of majority rule; and,\r\nsecond, when one party has a substantial majority, it generally sweeps\r\nthe board and annihilates the minority. A few examples will illustrate\r\nthese facts.\r\n\r\nThe 1895 election for the Imperial Parliament is analyzed by Sir John\r\nLubbock in the _Proportional Representation Review_. He shows that out\r\nof 481 contested seats, the Liberals, with 1,800,000 votes were\r\nentitled to 242, and the Conservatives and Liberal Unionists, with\r\n1,775,000 to 239, a majority of three seats for the Liberals. But the\r\nConservatives and Unionists actually returned 279, and the Liberals only\r\n202, a majority of 77 seats. The Conservatives and Unionists obtained\r\nalso a majority of 75 of the uncontested seats, giving them a total\r\nmajority of 152, instead of the 72 to which they were entitled.\r\n\r\nRecent elections for the United States Congress are shown by Professor\r\nCommons to present striking inequalities. At the election for the 51st\r\nCongress, 1888, the Republicans polled 5,348,379, and the Democrats\r\n5,502,581. But the Republican minority actually secured 164 seats\r\nagainst 161, a majority of 3, and were enabled to carry the McKinley\r\ntariff law. For the 52nd Congress, 1890, the Republicans, with 4,217,266\r\nvotes, only elected 88, while the Democrats, with 4,974,450 votes,\r\nelected 235, and the Populists, with 354,217 votes, elected 9\r\nCongressmen. The Democratic majority should have been only 2, instead of\r\n138. Compared with the 51st Congress, their proportion of the popular\r\nvote increased only 1 per cent., but their proportion of the\r\nrepresentatives increased 21 per cent. It required 47,923 votes to elect\r\na Republican, 44,276 to elect a Populist, and only 21,078 to elect a\r\nDemocrat.\r\n\r\nTo come nearer home, did not Mr. Reid return to power at the 1898\r\nelection in New South Wales although the Opposition polled a majority of\r\n15,000 against him? The last election in Victoria illustrates nothing so\r\nmuch as the chaotic state of parties, brought about by newspaper\r\ninfluence in promoting false lines of division. No less than 30 seats,\r\nrepresenting 81,857 votes, were contested only by candidates who\r\nprofessed to be Ministerialists of various shades. Of 52 seats contested\r\nby Ministerial and Opposition candidates, each party secured 26; but the\r\nMinisterialists paid 59,255 votes for their seats as against 44,327 cast\r\nfor the Opposition. 13 seats were uncontested, 9 Ministerial and 4\r\nOpposition, giving a total of 65 members to the Ministerial party and 30\r\nmembers to the Opposition.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrary and haphazard character of these results is obvious. It\r\nwould be entirely removed by the reform. Every election would reflect\r\nthe true feeling of the country; the right of the majority to rule would\r\nbe rendered certain, and the right of the minority to a fair hearing\r\nwould be assured. Taking the country as a whole, the Ministerialists\r\nwould pay almost exactly the same number of votes for each seat as the\r\nOpposition. In each separate electorate the accuracy would not be so\r\ngreat, but the rectification of even this slight and unavoidable\r\ninequality would, instead of being arbitrary, be subject to the laws of\r\nchance.\r\n\r\n+Ineffective Votes.+--Under the present system, all votes cast for\r\nrejected candidates are ineffective; therefore nearly one-half of the\r\nelectors have no voice in the Government. A Liberal elector may live in\r\na Conservative constituency all his life without having the opportunity\r\nto cast an effective vote. The evil of popular indifference is largely\r\nto be explained by this fact. It is no answer to say that it affects\r\nboth parties equally. The trouble is that nearly one-half of the\r\nelectors of each party have no influence in deciding who are to\r\nrepresent the party, and therefore do not help to frame its policy.\r\n\r\nThis evil would also be entirely removed. Every vote cast would count to\r\none or the other party. It is not necessary that every vote should be\r\ncounted to some one candidate, as the advocates of the Hare system\r\nclaim. Votes given to rejected candidates would be in effect just as\r\nmuch transferred to the successful candidates as by the Hare system.\r\nMoreover, it is an important gain that the candidates of each party\r\nwould be ranged in order of favour, as the relative position of the\r\ncandidates would be an index of the feeling of each electorate, not only\r\nas regards men but also as regards measures. Therefore, even the votes\r\ngiven to rejected candidates would affect the framing of the party\r\npolicy, and show the progress of public opinion.\r\n\r\n+Uncontested Seats.+--At the 1895 election for the Imperial Parliament\r\nno less than 189 seats out of 670 were uncontested. Thus one-quarter of\r\nthe people had no opportunity of expressing any opinion. In Australia\r\nthe proportion is often quite as large. The present Legislative Council\r\nof Victoria is an extreme instance. One-third of the Council retires\r\nevery three years; and at the last election not a single seat was\r\ncontested. Only 4 out of the 48 sitting members have had to contest\r\nelection. Under these circumstances the holding of an election at all\r\nbecomes a farce. No doubt it is very convenient for the favoured\r\nindividuals; but as the primary object of elections is the ascertainment\r\nof public opinion, it is very desirable that every seat should be\r\ncontested.\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of this evil is that when one party is strong in an\r\nelectorate it is hopeless for the minority to contest it, unless the\r\nmajority nominates more than one candidate. On the other hand, the\r\nmajority knows that if it does split its votes the minority will\r\nprobably win the seat. The result is that the sitting member has a great\r\nadvantage, and is often tolerated even though he is acceptable to only a\r\nminority of his own party.\r\n\r\nWith the reform each electorate would become the scene of a contest\r\nbetween the two parties for their proportional share of representation.\r\nIt is very unlikely, indeed, that in any electorate no more candidates\r\nwould be nominated than are required to be elected.\r\n\r\n+Limitation of Choice.+--Even when seats are contested, the elector's\r\nchoice is very limited under the present system. Wherever party\r\ngovernment is strong, each party nominates only one candidate, owing to\r\nthe danger of splitting up its votes and so losing the seat. The elector\r\nhas then practically no choice. He may disapprove of the candidate\r\nstanding for his own party, but the only alternative is to stultify\r\nhimself by supporting the opposing candidate. If in disgust he abstains\r\nfrom voting altogether, it is the same as giving each candidate half his\r\nvote. Even when two or three candidates of his own party are nominated,\r\nand he supports the one whose views coincide most closely with his own,\r\nhe can exert very little direct influence on the party policy. Besides,\r\nhe will often think it wise to support the strongest candidate rather\r\nthan the one he favours most.\r\n\r\nThese considerations show what a very imperfect instrument the present\r\nsystem is for expressing public opinion. The test which should be\r\napplied to any system of election is whether it allows each elector to\r\nexpress his opinion on general policy, and from this point of view the\r\npresent system fails lamentably; all opinion which does not run in the\r\ndirect channel of party is excluded. Mr. Bryce has fixed on this defect\r\nas the weak point of the party system, but the fault really lies in the\r\nlimitation of choice connected with the present system of election. It\r\nis quite true that \"in every country voting for a man is an inadequate\r\nway of expressing one's views of policy, because the candidate is sure\r\nto differ in one or more questions from many of those who belong to the\r\nparty.\"[4] But if, in the first place, the incentive to limit the number\r\nof candidates be removed and the field of choice widened, and if, in the\r\nsecond place, each elector be allowed to vote for several candidates\r\ninstead of one only, the defect would be remedied. Now, the reform makes\r\nboth these provisions, and the importance of the improvement can hardly\r\nbe overrated. It means, first, that every elector will be not only\r\nallowed, but also induced, to express his opinion on general policy. He\r\nmay give his votes to candidates either for their general views or for\r\nsome particular view; or, if he lays less stress on measures than on\r\nmen, he may give them to men of high character or of great\r\nadministrative ability. It means, secondly, that every section of\r\nopinion composing each party will be fairly represented, and that none\r\nwill be excluded, because the candidates of each party will compete\r\namong themselves for the support of all sections, in order to decide\r\nthose most in general favour. Hence every section will directly help to\r\nframe and influence the party policy, and there will be not the\r\nslightest excuse for independent action outside the two main parties. In\r\nthe third place, it means the substitution of individual responsibility\r\nfor the corporate responsibility of parties, since the electors will\r\nhave the power to reject those who wish to modify party action in any\r\ndirection contrary to the general wish. It means, finally, that every\r\nelector's opinion, as expressed by his vote, will have equal influence\r\nin deciding the direction of party action.\r\n\r\n+Control of Nominations.+--There is a constant incentive with the\r\npresent system of election to limit the number of candidates to two, one\r\nrepresenting each party. For if either party splits up its votes on more\r\nthan one candidate it will risk losing the seat. But the necessity to\r\nlimit the candidates involves some control of the nominations, and this\r\nis perhaps the worst feature of the system. It means that, instead of\r\nthe electors being allowed to select their representative, he is chosen\r\nfor them by some irresponsible body. We have seen how in the United\r\nStates the nominating system is the source of the power of the \"boss\"\r\nand the \"machine;\" and the same result is only a matter of time in\r\nBritish countries. The registration of voters is not yet conducted in\r\nthe same rigid manner as in America, nor is the farce of holding a\r\nprimary election gone through; but whether the control be exercised by a\r\npolitical organization, a newspaper, a local committee, or a secret\r\nsociety, the principle is the same. Mr. Bryce has noticed the rapid\r\nchange in the practice of England on this point:--\"As late as the\r\ngeneral elections of 1868 and 1874 nearly all candidates offered\r\nthemselves to the constituency, though some professed to do so in\r\npursuance of requisitions emanating from the electors. In 1880 many--I\r\nthink most--Liberal candidates in boroughs and some in counties were\r\nchosen by the local party associations, and appealed to the Liberal\r\nelectors on the ground of having been so chosen. In 1885, and again in\r\n1892, all, or nearly all, new Liberal candidates were so chosen, and a\r\nman offering himself against the nominee of the association was\r\ndenounced as an interloper and traitor to the party. The same process\r\nhas been going on in the Tory party, though more slowly. The influence\r\nof the locally wealthy, and also that of the central party office, is\r\nsomewhat greater among the Tories, but in course of time choice by\r\nrepresentative associations will doubtless become the rule.\"[5] Is it to\r\nbe expected that this power will not be abused as in America? The\r\ntrouble is that no association can represent all the party electors, and\r\nthat the representative becomes responsible to the managers of the\r\nassociation, to whom he really owes his election. Any control of this\r\nkind is fatal to the principle of responsible leadership. And yet the\r\nonly alternative with the present method of election is the break-up of\r\nthe party system. This is the dilemma in which all modern democracies\r\nare placed. The evil will be completely obviated by the reform. Instead\r\nof limiting the candidates, it will be to the advantage of each party to\r\ninduce the strongest and most popular candidates to stand on its behalf,\r\nsince the number of seats it will obtain depends only on the aggregate\r\nvotes polled by all the candidates. With individual candidature there\r\ncan be no \"machine\" control of nominations. All are free to appeal\r\ndirectly to the people.\r\n\r\n+Localization of Politics.+--The local delegate is unfortunately the\r\nprevailing type of Australian politician. The value of a member is too\r\noften measured by the services he renders to his constituents\r\nindividually or the amount of money he can get the Government to spend\r\nin his constituency. Hence the nefarious practice of log-rolling in\r\nParliament. Is it any wonder that some of the colonies promise to rival\r\nFrance in the proportion of unreproductive works constructed out of loan\r\nmoney?\r\n\r\nHow few of our members approach the ideal expressed by Edmund Burke in\r\nhis address to the electors of Bristol:--\"Parliament is not a congress\r\nof ambassadors from different and hostile interests, which interests\r\neach must maintain, as an agent and advocate, against other agents and\r\nadvocates; but Parliament is a deliberative assembly of our nation, with\r\none interest--that of the whole--where not local purposes, not local\r\nprejudices, ought to guide, but the general good, resulting from the\r\ngeneral reason of the whole. You choose a member, indeed, but when you\r\nhave chosen him he is not a member of Bristol, but he is a member of\r\nParliament.\" It must be confessed, however, that Burke's ideal is rather\r\nexalted; it is the duty of a member to make known the requirements of\r\nhis district. It is the ministry which is specially charged with\r\nlooking after the interest of the whole and of resisting illegitimate\r\ndemands. But it cannot do so if its position is so insecure that it must\r\npurchase the support of the \"parish pump\" politician.\r\n\r\nThe only way to nationalize politics is to ensure that every electorate\r\nshall be contested on national issues by organized parties, and that\r\nevery locality shall be represented on both parties. The proposed system\r\nwill provide this remedy. In enlarged electorates each party will take\r\ngood care that its candidates are men of local influence in the most\r\nimportant divisions of the electorate; therefore, sectional and local\r\ninterests will be represented, but they will be subordinated to the\r\ninterests of the whole electorate; and where there are a few large\r\ndivisions the interests of each will more nearly coincide with national\r\ninterests than where there are a large number of small divisions.\r\nBesides, log-rolling will not be so easy between groups of\r\nrepresentatives as among single representatives.\r\n\r\n+Incentive to Bribery and Corruption.+--We now come to a class of evils\r\nwhich to a large extent result from the fact that a few votes in each\r\nelectorate decide whether a party gets all the representation or none at\r\nall. Candidates are impelled, in order to gain support from every\r\nfaction, to acts degrading to themselves and destructive to the moral\r\ntone of the people. Foremost among these evils is the great incentive to\r\nbribery and corruption; it is manifested not only in direct expenditure\r\nat the elections, but also in promises of patronage and class\r\nadvantages. Direct bribery is perhaps worst in America; Professor M.\r\nCook states, in a paper on \"The Alarming Proportion of Venal Voters\" in\r\nthe _Forum_ for September, 1892, that in twenty-one towns of Connecticut\r\n16 per cent, of the voters are venal. As Professor Commons remarks:--\"It\r\nis plain that the bribable voters themselves are adequate to hold the\r\nbalance of power between the parties. The single-membered district,\r\ntherefore, places a magnificent premium upon bribery.\" In England the\r\n_Corrupt Practices Act_ has done immense good: nothing reflects so much\r\nhonour on the Imperial Parliament as the voluntary transference of the\r\nduty of deciding cases to the judiciary. In Australia this much-needed\r\nreform has not yet been introduced, and direct bribery prevails to a\r\nmuch larger extent than would be supposed from the number of cases\r\ninvestigated. Members of Parliament are naturally loth to convict one of\r\ntheir own number, and the knowledge of this fact prevents petitions\r\nbeing lodged.\r\n\r\nThe mere existence of secret bribery is bad enough, but a greater danger\r\nis that acts of indirect bribery are openly practised, with the tacit\r\napproval of electors. \"There have been instances,\" says Mr. Lecky, in\r\nhis \"Democracy and Liberty,\" \"in which the political votes of the police\r\nforce, of the P.O. officials, of the civil service clerks have been\r\navowedly marshalled for the purpose of obtaining particular class\r\nadvantages--a disintegrated majority is strongly tempted to conciliate\r\nevery detached group of votes.\" In Australia this has become a regular\r\npractice; and a still worse feature is that Members of Parliament have\r\nfree access to public departments to promote class and local interests.\r\nClass legislation is frequently brought forward on the eve of an\r\nelection with the sole object of influencing votes. These conditions\r\nfavour the wire-pullers and mere self-seekers, and, in so far as they\r\nprevent the electors from voting on the political views and personal\r\nmerits of the candidates, they are inimical to the public interests. Mr.\r\nLecky has pointed out that a certain amount of moral compromise is\r\nnecessary in public life, and that a politician may indulge in\r\npopularity-hunting from honourable public motives; the danger is that\r\nunworthy politicians may screen themselves under shelter of this excuse.\r\n\r\nWe do not claim that the proposed system would abolish corruption, but\r\nwe are justified in hoping that it would mitigate it very much. Even if\r\nthe venal vote still held the balance of power between parties, parties\r\nare not so easily corrupted as individuals. But the most important gain\r\nis that it could only exert an influence proportional to its numbers; it\r\ncould not decide whether a party gets all the representation or none at\r\nall, as at present. In most cases it would be doubtful if it would\r\naffect a single candidate. Consider, again, the case of individual\r\ncandidates of the same party; any candidate resorting to bribery in\r\norder to increase his chance of election would do so partly at the\r\nexpense of the other candidates of his own party, who would immediately\r\ndenounce him. Instead of being forced to conciliate selfish factions,\r\nthe candidates would be free to appeal for the support of the unselfish\r\nsections.\r\n\r\n+Continual Change in Electoral Boundaries.+--The irregular growth of\r\npopulation necessitates a periodical revision of the electoral\r\nboundaries of single-membered electorates. Owing to the influence of\r\nvested interests, this is generally effected in an arbitrary manner; and\r\nthe glaring anomalies only are rectified. We have in Victoria at the\r\npresent day some country electorates with 6,000 electors on the rolls\r\nand others with only 1,500. An elector in the latter has four times the\r\nvoting power of an elector in the former. The process of alteration of\r\nthe boundaries offers great temptation to unfairness; and in American\r\npolitics the opportunity is taken full advantage of by a practice which\r\nhas received the name of the gerrymander. In his work on \"Proportional\r\nRepresentation\" Professor Commons writes:--\r\n\r\n     It is difficult to express the opprobrium rightly belonging to so\r\n     iniquitous a practice as the gerrymander; but its enormity is not\r\n     appreciated, just as brutal prize-fighting is not reprobated\r\n     providing it be fought according to the rules. Both political\r\n     parties practise it, and neither can condemn the other. They simply\r\n     do what is natural: make the most of their opportunities as far as\r\n     permitted by the constitution and system under which both are\r\n     working. The gerrymander is not produced by the iniquity of\r\n     parties, it is the outcome of the district system. If\r\n     representatives are elected in this way there must be some public\r\n     authority for outlining the districts. And who shall be the judge\r\n     to say where the line shall be drawn? Exact equality is impossible,\r\n     and who shall set the limit beyond which inequality shall not be\r\n     pressed? Every apportionment act that has been passed in this or\r\n     any other country has involved inequality; and it would be absurd\r\n     to ask a political party to pass such an act and give the advantage\r\n     of the inequality to the opposite party. Consequently, every\r\n     apportionment act involves more or less of the gerrymander. The\r\n     gerrymander is simply such a thoughtful construction of districts\r\n     as will economize the votes of the party in power by giving it\r\n     small majorities in a large number of districts, and coop up the\r\n     opposing party with overwhelming majorities in a large number of\r\n     districts. This may involve a very distortionate and uncomely\r\n     \"scientific\" boundary, and the joining together of distant and\r\n     unrelated localities into a single district; such was the case in\r\n     the famous original act of Governor Gerry, of Massachusetts, whence\r\n     the practice obtained its amphibian name.[6] But it is not always\r\n     necessary that districts be cut into distortionate shapes in order\r\n     to accomplish these unjust results. (pp. 49, 50.)\r\n\r\nHe illustrates a gerrymander which actually made one Democratic vote\r\nequal to five Republican votes. We have quoted this description of the\r\nmethods of the gerrymander not so much because the evil has attained any\r\nmagnitude in Australia as because it offers a warning of the probable\r\nresult of adopting the single-membered district system for our Federal\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nWith enlarged or grouped electorates the periodical revision of\r\nboundaries would be entirely obviated, because the size of the\r\nelectorate may be kept constant, and the number of representatives\r\nvaried. Under such a system all unfairness would disappear, and the\r\ngerrymander would be impossible. Representation would automatically\r\nfollow the movements of population.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Bryce, \"The American Commonwealth,\" vol ii, p 325\r\n\r\n[5] Bryce, \"The American Commonwealth,\" vol. ii., note on p. 81.\r\n\r\n[6] Governor Gerry contrived an electorate which resembled a salamander\r\nin shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE HARE SYSTEM OF PROPORTIONAL DELEGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe single transferable vote, generally known as the Hare system, was\r\nfirst invented by a Danish statesman, M. Andrae, and was used for the\r\nelection of a portion of the \"Rigsraad\" in 1855. In 1857 Mr. Thomas\r\nHare, barrister-at-law, published it independently in England in a\r\npamphlet on \"The Machinery of Representation.\" This formed the basis of\r\nthe scheme elaborated in his \"Election of Representatives,\" which\r\nappeared in 1859.\r\n\r\nHe proposed to abolish all geographical boundaries by constituting the\r\nwhole of the United Kingdom one electorate for the return of the 654\r\nmembers of the House of Commons. Each member was to be elected by an\r\nequal unanimous number of electors. The method of election was therefore\r\nso contrived as to allow the electors to group themselves into 654\r\nconstituencies, each group bound only by the tie of voluntary\r\nassociation, and gathered from every corner of the Kingdom. The total\r\nnumber of votes cast (about a million) was to be divided by 654, and the\r\nquotient, say about 1,500, would be the quota or number of votes\r\nrequired to elect a member. But some of the candidates would naturally\r\nreceive more votes than the quota, and a great many more would receive\r\nless. How were all the votes to be equally divided among 654 members so\r\nthat each should secure exactly the quota? The single transferable vote\r\nwas proposed to attain this result. Each elector's vote was to count for\r\none candidate only, but he was allowed to say in advance to whom he\r\nwould wish his vote transferred in case it could not be used for his\r\nfirst choice. Each ballot paper was, therefore, to contain the names of\r\na number of candidates in order of preference--1, 2, 3, &c. Then all the\r\ncandidates having more than a quota of first choices were to have the\r\nsurplus votes taken from them and transferred to the second choice on\r\nthe papers, or if the second choice already had enough votes, to the\r\nthird choice, and so on. When all the surpluses were distributed a\r\ncertain number of members would be declared elected, each with a quota\r\nof votes. The candidates who had received the least amount of support\r\nwere then to be gradually eliminated. The lowest candidate would be\r\nfirst rejected, and his votes transferred to the next available\r\npreference on his ballot papers; then the next lowest would be rejected,\r\nand so on till all the votes were equally distributed among the 654\r\nmembers. Such was the Hare system as propounded by its author. The\r\nelectors were to divide themselves into voluntary groups; then the\r\ngroups which were too large were to be cut down by transferring the\r\nsurplus votes, and the smaller groups were to be excluded and the votes\r\nalso transferred until the groups were reduced to 654 equal\r\nconstituencies. These two processes, transferring surplus votes and\r\ntransferring votes from excluded candidates, are the main features of\r\nthe system. Mr. Hare's rules for carrying them out are drawn up in the\r\nform of a proposed electoral law, and in the different editions of his\r\nwork the clauses vary somewhat. They are also complicated by an\r\nimpossible attempt to retain the local nomenclature of members. As\r\nregards surplus votes it was provided that the ballot papers which had\r\nthe most preferences expressed should be transferred; still a good deal\r\nwas left to chance or to the sweet will of the returning officer, and\r\nthis has always been admitted as a serious objection. The process of\r\nelimination is still more unsatisfactory. Mr. Hare was from the first\r\nstrongly opposed to the elimination of the candidate who had least first\r\npreferences, and he therefore proposed that, in order to decide which\r\ncandidate had least support, all expressed preferences should be\r\ncounted. This involved such enormous complication that in the 1861\r\nedition of his work he abandoned the process of elimination altogether\r\nin favour of a process of selection. He then proposed to distribute\r\nsurplus votes only, and to elect the highest of the remainder,\r\nregardless of the fact that they had less than a quota. He then\r\nwrote:--\"The reduction of the number of candidates remaining at this\r\nstage of the election may be effected by taking out the names of all\r\nthose who have the smallest number of actual votes--that is, who are\r\nnamed at the _head_ of the smallest number of voting papers, and\r\nappropriating each vote to the candidate standing _next_ in order on\r\neach paper. This process would be so arbitrary and inequitable in its\r\noperation as to be intolerable. It might have the effect of cancelling\r\nstep by step more votes given to one candidate than would be sufficient\r\nto return another.... Such a process disregards the legitimate rights\r\nboth of electors and of candidates.\" But the process of selection was\r\nnot proportional representation at all, being practically equivalent to\r\na single untransferable vote, and Mr. Hare finally adopted, in spite of\r\nits defects, the \"arbitrary and inequitable\" process of elimination in\r\nhis last edition in 1873. And all his recent disciples have been forced\r\nto do the same, because nothing better is known.\r\n\r\nMr. Hare's scheme has ceased to be of any practical interest, since it\r\nis now generally admitted that electorates should not return more than\r\nten or twenty members. Moreover, it is admitted that the electors would\r\ngroup themselves in very undesirable ways, and not as Mr. Hare expected.\r\nAnd yet the only effect of limiting the size of the electorates is to\r\nreduce the number of undesirable ways in which electors might group\r\nthemselves. Let us briefly note the different proposals which have been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n+1. Sir John Lubbock's Method.+--In his work on \"Representation,\" Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock says:--\"The full advantage of the single transferable vote\r\nwould require a system of large constituencies returning three or five\r\nmembers each, thus securing a true representation of opinion.\"\r\nThree-seat electorates are, however, too small to secure accurate\r\nproportional representation; with parties evenly balanced, for instance,\r\none must secure twice as much representation as the other.\r\n\r\nThe following rules are given to explain the working of the system:--\r\n\r\n(1) Each voter shall have one vote, but may vote in the alternative for\r\nas many of the candidates as he pleases by writing the figures 1, 2, 3,\r\n&c, opposite the names of those candidates in the order of his\r\npreference.\r\n\r\nCOUNTING VOTES.\r\n\r\n(2) The ballot papers, having been all mixed, shall be drawn out in\r\nsuccession and stamped with numbers so that no two shall bear the same\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n(3) The number obtained by dividing the whole number of good ballot\r\npapers tendered at the election by the number of members to be elected\r\nplus one, and increasing the quotient (or where it is fractional the\r\nintegral part of the quotient) by one, shall be called the quota.\r\n\r\n(4) Every candidate who has a number of first votes equal to or greater\r\nthan the quota shall be declared elected, and so many of the ballot\r\npapers containing those votes as shall be equal in number to the quota\r\n(being those stamped with the lowest numerals) shall be set aside as of\r\nno further use. On all ballot papers the name of the elected candidate\r\nshall be deemed to be cancelled, with the effect of raising by so much\r\nin the order of preference all votes given to other candidates after\r\nhim. This process shall be repeated until no candidate has more than a\r\nquota of first votes or votes deemed first.\r\n\r\n(5) Then the candidate or candidates having the fewest first votes, or\r\nvotes deemed first, shall be declared not to be elected, with the effect\r\nof raising by so much in the order of preference all votes given to\r\ncandidates after him or them, and rule 4 shall be again applied if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n(6) When by successive applications of rules 4 and 5 the number of\r\ncandidates is reduced to the number of members remaining to be elected,\r\nthe remaining candidates shall be declared elected.\r\n\r\nObjection is commonly taken to this method on account of the element of\r\nchance involved in the distribution of surplus votes. Suppose the quota\r\nto be 1,000, and a candidate to receive 1,100 votes, the 100 votes to be\r\ntransferred would be those stamped with the highest numerals. But if the\r\nhundred stamped with the lowest numerals or any other hundred had been\r\ntaken the second choices would be different.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, however, this is not a chance selection--it is an\r\narbitrary selection. The returning officer must transfer certain\r\ndefinite papers; if he were allowed to make a chance selection it would\r\nbe in his power to favour some of the candidates.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock points out that the element of chance might be\r\neliminated by distributing the second votes proportionally to the second\r\nchoices on the whole 1,100 papers, and that it might be desirable to\r\nleave any candidate the right to claim that this should be done if he\r\nthought it worth while.\r\n\r\n+2.--The Hare-Clark Method.+--The Hare system has been in actual use in\r\nTasmania for the last two elections. It is applied only in a six-seat\r\nelectorate at Hobart and a four-seat electorate at Launceston. The rules\r\nfor distributing surplus votes proportionally were drawn up by Mr. A.I.\r\nClark, late Attorney-General. The problem is not so simple as it appears\r\nat first sight. There is no difficulty with a surplus on the first\r\ncount; it is when surpluses are created in subsequent counts by\r\ntransferred votes that the conditions become complicated. Mr. Clark\r\nadopts a rule that in the latter case the transferred papers only are to\r\nbe taken into account in deciding the proportional distribution of the\r\nsurplus. Suppose, as before, the quota to be 1,000 votes, and a\r\ncandidate to have 1,100 votes, 550 of which are marked in the second\r\nplace to one of the other candidates. Then the latter is entitled to 50\r\nof the surplus votes, and a chance selection is made of the 550 papers.\r\nThe element of chance still remains, therefore, if this surplus\r\ncontributes to a fresh surplus.\r\n\r\n+3.--The Droop-Gregory Method.+--This method, advocated by Professor\r\nNanson, of the Melbourne University, is claimed to entirely eliminate\r\nthe element of chance. The Gregory plan of transferring surplus votes is\r\ndefined as a fractional method. If a candidate needs only nine-tenths of\r\nhis votes to make up his quota, instead of distributing the surplus of\r\none-tenth of the papers all the papers are distributed with one-tenth of\r\ntheir value. Reverting to our former example, if a candidate is marked\r\nsecond on 550 out of 1,100 votes, the quota being 1,000 and the surplus\r\n100, then instead of selecting 50 out of the 550 papers, the whole of\r\nthem would be transferred in a packet, the value of the packet being 50\r\nvotes, or, as Professor Nanson prefers to put it, the value of each\r\npaper in the packet being one-eleventh of a vote. Should this packet\r\ncontribute to a new surplus the third choices on the whole of the papers\r\nare available as a basis for the redistribution. The packet would be\r\ndivided into smaller packets, and each assigned its reduced value. It\r\nmight here be pointed out that the use of fractions is quite\r\nunnecessary, the value of each packet in votes being all that is\r\nrequired, and that the-same process may be used with the Hare-Clark\r\nmethod to avoid the chance selection of papers. The only real\r\ndifference is this: that when a surplus is created by transferred votes\r\nMr. Clark distributes it by reference to the next preference on all the\r\ntransferred papers, and Professor Nanson by reference to the last packet\r\nof transferred papers only--the packet which raises the candidate above\r\nthe quota.\r\n\r\nWhich of these methods is correct? Should we select the surplus from all\r\nvotes, original and transferred, as Sir John Lubbock proposes; from all\r\ntransferred votes only, with Mr. Clark; or from the last packet only of\r\ntransferred votes, with Professor Nanson? Consider a group of electors\r\nhaving somewhat more than a quota of votes at its disposal. If it\r\nnominates one candidate only every one of the electors will have a voice\r\nin the distribution of the surplus, but if it puts up three candidates,\r\ntwo of whom are excluded and the third elected, Mr. Clark would allow\r\nthose who supported the two excluded candidates to decide the\r\ndistribution of the surplus, and Professor Nanson only those who\r\nsupported the last candidate excluded. Both are clearly wrong, for the\r\nonly rational view to take is that when a candidate is excluded it is\r\nthe same as if he had never been nominated and the transferred votes had\r\nformed part of the original votes of those to whom they are transferred.\r\nWhenever a surplus is created it should therefore be distributed by\r\nreference to all votes, original and transferred. As regards these\r\nsurpluses, Mr. Clark and Professor Nanson have adopted an arbitrary\r\nbasis, which is no more than Sir John Lubbock has done; and they have\r\ntherefore eliminated the element of chance only for surpluses on the\r\nfirst count. It may be asked, Why cannot all surpluses be distributed by\r\nreference to all the papers, if that is the correct method? The answer\r\nis that the complication involved is enormous. Yet this was the plan\r\nfirst advocated by Professor Nanson, who wrote, in reply to a definite\r\ninquiry how the Gregory principle was applied:--\"I explain by an\r\nexample. A has 2,000 votes, the quota being 1,000. A then requires only\r\nhalf the value of each vote cast for him. Each paper cast for him is\r\nthen stamped as having lost one-half of its value, and the whole of A's\r\npapers are then transferred with diminished value to the second name\r\n(unelected, of course). The same principle applies all through. Whenever\r\nanyone has a surplus all the papers are passed to the next man with\r\ndiminished value.\" Now, the effect of this extraordinary proposal would\r\nbe that the whole of the papers would have to be kept in circulation\r\ntill the last candidate was elected, with diminishing compound\r\nfractional values. In a ten-seat electorate a large proportion would\r\npass through several transfers, and would towards the end of the count\r\nhave such a ridiculously small fractional value that it would take\r\nseveral millions of the ballot-papers to make a single vote! It is no\r\nwonder that this method was abandoned when the complications to which\r\nit would lead were realized.\r\n\r\nA simple method of avoiding this complexity would be to treat\r\ntransferred surplus papers as if the preferences were exhausted. It must\r\nbe remembered that in all transfers a certain number of papers are lost\r\nowing to the preferences being exhausted, and the additional loss would\r\nbe small. Thus at the first Hobart election 206 votes were wasted, and\r\nthis number would have been increased by two only. Every surplus would\r\nthen be transferred by reference to the next choice, wherever expressed,\r\non both original papers and papers transferred from excluded candidates.\r\n\r\nIt might be provided, however, for greater accuracy that all papers\r\ncontributing to surpluses on the first count only should be transferred\r\nin packets. Should these contribute to a new surplus, it should be\r\ndivided into two parts, proportional to (1) original votes and votes\r\ntransferred from excluded candidates, and (2) the value of the packet in\r\nvotes. Each part would then be distributed proportionally to the next\r\navailable preferences wherever expressed. To divide the packets into\r\nsub-packets is a useless complication. The loss involved in neglecting\r\nthem would usually be less than one-thousandth part of the loss due to\r\nexhausted papers.\r\n\r\nHaving now dealt with the main features of the different variations of\r\nthe Hare system, we may proceed to consider some details which are\r\ncommon to all of them. A difference of opinion exists, however, as\r\nregards the quota. Sir John Lubbock and Professor Nanson advocate the\r\nDroop quota, which we have shown to be a mathematical error; Miss Spence\r\nand Mr. Clark use the correct quota.\r\n\r\n+The Wrong Candidates are Liable to be Elected.+--The Hare system may be\r\ncriticised from two points of view; first, as applied to the conditions\r\nprevailing when it is introduced, and, secondly, as regards the new\r\nconditions it would bring about. Its advocates confine themselves to the\r\nfirst point of view, and invariably use illustrations based on the\r\nexistence of parties.\r\n\r\nWe readily grant that if the electors vote on party lines, and transfer\r\ntheir votes within the party as assumed, the Hare system would give\r\nproportional representation to the parties; but even then it would\r\nsacrifice the interests of individual candidates, for it affords no\r\nguarantee that the right candidates will be elected. The constant\r\ntendency is that favourites of factions within the party will be\r\npreferred to general favourites. This at the same time destroys party\r\ncohesion, and tends to split up parties. Nor can this result be wondered\r\nat, since the very foundation of the system is the separate\r\nrepresentation of a number of sections.\r\n\r\nOne reason why the wrong candidates are liable to be elected is that the\r\nelectors will not record their honest preferences if the one vote only\r\nis effective. They will give their vote to the candidate who is thought\r\nto need it most, and the best men will go to the wall because they are\r\nthought to be safe. Mr. R.M. Johnston, Government Statistician of\r\nTasmania, confirms this view when he declares--\"The aggregate of all\r\ncounts, whether effective or not, would seem to be the truer index of\r\nthe general favour in which each candidate stands, because the numbers\r\npolled at the first count may be greatly disturbed by the action of\r\nthose who are interested in the success of two or more favourites who\r\nmay be pretty well assured of success, but whose order of preference\r\nmight by some be altered if sudden rumour suggested fears for any one of\r\nthe favoured group. This accidental action would tend to conceal the\r\ntrue exact measure of favour in the first count.\" If this statement\r\nmeans anything it is that the three preferences which are required to be\r\nexpressed should have been all counted as effective votes at the Hobart\r\nelection instead of one only; and this is exactly what we advocate. It\r\nis also admitted that when two candidates ran together at the first\r\nLaunceston election the more popular candidate was defeated; and again\r\nthe _Argus_ correspondent writes of the recent Hobart election:--\"The\r\ndefeat of Mr. Nicholls was doubtless due to the fact of his supporters'\r\nover-confidence--nothing else explains it. Many people gave him No. 2\r\nvotes who would have given him No. 1 votes had they not felt assured of\r\nhis success.\"\r\n\r\nA second reason why the wrong candidates are liable to be elected is\r\nthat the process of elimination adopted by all the Hare methods has no\r\nmathematical justification. The candidate who is first excluded has one\r\npreference only taken account of, while others have many preferences\r\ngiven effect to. We have shown that this glaring injustice was\r\nrecognized by Mr. Hare, and only adopted as a last resort. Professor\r\nNanson admits that \"the process of elimination which has been adopted by\r\nall the exponents of Hare's system is not satisfactory,\" and adds--\"I do\r\nnot know a scientific solution of the difficulty.\" To bring home the\r\ninequity of the process, consider a party which nominates six\r\ncandidates, A, B, C, D, E, and F, and whose numbers entitle it to three\r\nseats, and suppose the electors to vote in the proportions and order\r\nshown below on the first count.\r\n\r\n           FIRST     SECOND    THIRD    FOURTH\r\n           COUNT.    COUNT.    COUNT.   COUNT.\r\n7-vote     ADEFBC    ADEBC     AEBC     ABC\r\n6-vote     EFDACB    EDACB     EACB     ACB\r\n5-vote     CEBDFA    CEBDA     CEBA     CBA\r\n4-vote     BDFACE    BDACE     BACE     BAC\r\n4-vote     DCEFBA    DCEBA     CEBA     CBA\r\n3-vote     FBAECD    BAECD     BAEC     BAC\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that F, having fewest first votes, is eliminated from\r\nthe second count, D from the third count, and E from the fourth. A has\r\nthen 13 votes, B 7, and C 9. If the quota be 9 votes, A's surplus would\r\nbe passed on to B, and A, B, and C would be declared elected. But D, E,\r\nand F are the candidates most in general favour, and ought to have been\r\nelected. For if any one of the rejected candidates be compared with any\r\none of the successful candidates it will be found that in every case the\r\nrejected candidate is higher in order of favour on a majority of the\r\npapers. Again, if the Block Vote be applied, by counting three effective\r\nvotes, the result would be--A 10 votes, B 12, C 9, D 21, E 22, and F 13.\r\nD, E, and F would therefore be elected. Thus we see that A, B, and C,\r\nthe favourites of sections within the party, are elected, and D, E, and\r\nF, the candidates most in general favour--those who represent a\r\ncompromise among the sections--are rejected.\r\n\r\nIn practice, then, the Hare system discourages compromise among parties,\r\nand among sections of parties; and therefore tends to obliterate party\r\nlines. This has already happened in Tasmania, where all experience goes\r\nto show that the Hare system is equivalent to compulsory plumping. In\r\nevery election the result would have been exactly the same if each\r\nelector voted for one candidate only. The theory that it does not matter\r\nhow many candidates stand for each party, since votes will be\r\ntransferred within the party, has been completely disproved. Votes are\r\nactually transferred almost indiscriminately. The candidates have not\r\nbeen slow to grasp this fact, and at the last election handbills were\r\ndistributed giving \"explicit reasons why the electors should give their\r\nNo. 1 to Mr. So-and-so, and their No. 2 to any other person they\r\nchose.\"[7] Three out of every four first preferences are found to be\r\neffective, but only one out of every five second preferences, and one\r\nout of fifty third preferences. The first preferences, therefore, decide\r\nthe election.\r\n\r\nThe actual result is that, in the long run, the Hare system is\r\npractically the same as the single untransferable vote. The whole of the\r\nelaborate machinery for recording preferences and transferring votes\r\nmight just as well be entirely dispensed with. The \"automatic\r\norganization\" which it was to provide exists only in the calculations of\r\nmathematicians.\r\n\r\n+A Number of Votes are Wasted.+--It is claimed for the Hare system that\r\nevery vote cast is effective, because it counts for some one candidate.\r\nBut unless every elector places all the candidates in order of\r\npreference some votes are wasted because the preferences become\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nWhen a paper to be transferred has no further available preferences\r\nexpressed it is lost. In order to reduce this waste, a vote is held to\r\nbe informal in the six-seat electorate at Hobart unless at least three\r\npreferences are given. Notwithstanding this, the number of such votes\r\nwasted was 7 per cent, at the first election and 10 per cent, at the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this waste is that some of the candidates are elected\r\nwith less than the quota. At the last Hobart election only three out of\r\nsix members were elected on full quotas, and at Launceston only one out\r\nof four. The result is to favour small, compact minorities, and to lead\r\nsections to scheme to get representation on the lowest possible terms.\r\n\r\nThe Droop quota, being smaller than the Tasmanian quota, would have the\r\neffect of electing more members on full quotas, and it is often\r\nrecommended on that account. Indeed, Professor Nanson declares:--\"In no\r\ncircumstances is any candidate elected on less than a quota of votes.\r\nThe seats for which a quota has not been obtained are filled one after\r\nthe other, each by a candidate elected by an absolute majority of the\r\nwhole of the voters. For the seats to be filled in this way all\r\ncandidates as yet unelected enter into competition. The matter is\r\nsettled by a reference to the whole of the voting papers. If any\r\nunelected candidate now stands first on an absolute majority of all\r\nthese papers he is elected. But if not, then the weeding-out process is\r\napplied until an absolute majority is obtained. The candidate who gets\r\nthe absolute majority is elected. Should there be another seat, the same\r\nprocess is repeated. If an absolute majority of the whole of the voters\r\ncannot be obtained for any candidate, then the candidate who comes\r\nnearest to the absolute majority is elected.\" It will be seen that\r\nProfessor Nanson proposes to bring to life again all the eliminated\r\ncandidates, in order to compete against those who have less than the\r\nquota. The proportional principle is then to be entirely abandoned, and\r\nthe seats practically given to the stronger party, although the minority\r\nmay be clearly entitled to them. The vaunted \"one vote one value\" is\r\nalso to be violated, because those who supported the elected candidates\r\nare to have an equal voice with those still unrepresented. And finally,\r\nthe evil is not cured, it is only aggravated, if an eliminated candidate\r\nis elected.\r\n\r\n+The Hare System is not Preferential.+--The idea is sedulously fostered\r\nthat the Hare system is a form of preferential voting, and many people\r\nare misled thereby. The act of voting is exalted into an end in itself.\r\nThe most elaborate provisions are now suggested by Professor Nanson to\r\nallow the elector to express his opinion only as far as he likes. The\r\nsimple and practical method in use in Tasmania of requiring each elector\r\nto place a definite number of candidates in order of preference is\r\ndenounced as an infringement of the elector's freedom. Why force him to\r\nexpress preferences where he does not feel any? The Professor has\r\ntherefore invented \"the principle of the bracket.\" If the elector cannot\r\ndiscriminate between the merits of a number of candidates he may bracket\r\nthem all equal in order of favour. Indeed, where he does not indicate\r\nany preference at all, the names unmarked are deemed equal. Therefore,\r\nif he does not wish his vote transferred to any candidate, he must\r\nstrike out his name. It is pointed out that a ballot paper can thus be\r\nused if there is any kind of preference expressed at all, and the risk\r\nof informality is reduced to a minimum. All the bracket papers are to be\r\nput into a separate parcel, and do not become \"definite\" till all the\r\ncandidates bracketed, except one, are either elected or rejected; the\r\nvote is then transferred to that candidate. And as bracketed candidates\r\nwill occur in original papers, surplus papers, and excluded candidates'\r\npapers at every stage of the count, the degree of complication in store\r\nfor the unhappy returning officer can be imagined.\r\n\r\nThe whole of these intricate provisions are founded on a patent fallacy.\r\nPreferences are not expressed in the Hare system, as in true\r\npreferential voting, that they may be given effect to in deciding the\r\nelection, but simply in order to allow the elector to say in advance to\r\nwhom he would wish his vote transferred if it cannot be used for his\r\nfirst choice. The elector is allowed to express his opinion about a\r\nnumber of candidates, certainly, but after being put to this trouble\r\nonly one of his preferences is used. And which one is used depends\r\nentirely on the vagaries of the system. The principle of the bracket\r\nillustrates this fact; if the elector has no preference the system\r\ndecides for him. If his first choice just receives the quota the other\r\npreferences are not even looked at. Again, of all the electors who vote\r\nfor rejected candidates, those who are fortunate enough to vote for the\r\nworst (who are first excluded) have their second or third preferences\r\ngiven effect to, and few of their votes are wasted; but the votes of\r\nthose who support the best of them (who are last excluded) are either\r\nwasted or given to their remote preferences. In Mr. Hare's original\r\nscheme, for instance, the votes of the last 50 candidates excluded would\r\nhave been nearly all wasted, unless some hundreds of preferences were\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\nAnother claim on which great stress is laid is that by the process of\r\ntransferring votes every vote counts to some one candidate. This means\r\nnothing more than that the votes of rejected candidates are transferred\r\nto the successful candidates. Where is the necessity for this? So long\r\nas each party secures its just share of representation and elects its\r\nmost favoured candidates, there is no advantage gained by transferring\r\nthe votes. Miss Spence even declares that \"every Senator elected in this\r\nway will represent an equal number of votes, and will rightly have equal\r\nweight in the House. According to the block system, there is often a\r\nwide disparity between the number of votes for the highest and the\r\nlowest man elected.\" Surely the mere fact of transferring votes till\r\nthey are equally distributed does not make all the successful candidates\r\nequally popular! On the contrary, it is very desirable to know which\r\ncandidates are most in favour with each party.\r\n\r\n+Ballot Papers Must be Brought Together for Counting.+--This is a\r\npractical objection to the Hare system, which puts it out of court for\r\nlarge electorates. If the whole of Victoria were constituted one\r\nelectorate, as at the Federal Convention election, the transference of\r\nvotes could not be commenced till all the ballot papers had come in from\r\nthe remote parts of the colony, two or three weeks after the election.\r\nOn this point Professor Nanson writes:--\"In an actual election in\r\nVictoria this 'first state of the poll' could be arrived at with the\r\nsame rapidity as was the result of the recent poll on the Commonwealth\r\nBill. In both cases but one fact is to be gleaned from each voting\r\npaper. The results from all parts of the colony would be posted in\r\nCollins-street on election day. These results would show exactly how the\r\ncat was going to jump. The final results as regards parties would be\r\nobvious to all observers, although the result as regards individual\r\ncandidates would be far from clear. But this, although of vast\r\nimportance to the candidates themselves, would be a matter of small\r\nconcern to the great mass of the people.\" These remarks are based on the\r\nassumption that the electors vote on strictly party lines, which a\r\nreference to Tasmanian returns will show is not usually the case. Few\r\nwill be disposed to agree that a knowledge of the successful candidates\r\nis a matter of small moment.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[7] _Hobart Mercury_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFREE LIST SYSTEM OF PROPORTIONAL DELEGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Liste Libre_, or Free List system, is a far simpler and more\r\npractical method of proportional representation than the Hare system.\r\nThe distinctive feature is that it applies the proportional principle\r\nnot to individual candidates but to parties. But, like the Hare system,\r\nit places no restriction on the number of parties. It is therefore\r\nparticularly adapted to the circumstances of the countries on the\r\nContinent of Europe, which, having already a number of strong party\r\norganizations, wish to retain them and to do justice to each.\r\nAccordingly we find that nearly all experiments in proportional\r\nrepresentation to the present time have been confined to those\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the very earliest attempt to apply the proportional principle\r\nwas that of Mr. Thomas Gilpin, in a pamphlet, \"On the Representation of\r\nMinorities of Electors to act with the Majority in Elected Assemblies,\"\r\npublished at Philadelphia in 1844. He proposed that electorates should\r\nbe enlarged, and that each party should nominate a list of candidates\r\nequal to the number required to be elected, and should place them in\r\norder of preference. Each elector could then vote for one of these\r\nlists; and each party would be allotted a number of representatives\r\nproportional to the amount of support it received. The highest on each\r\nlist, to the number allotted, would be elected. It will be seen that\r\nthis is really a system of double election; for the order of favour of\r\nthe candidates of any party would have to be decided before the\r\nnominations were made.\r\n\r\nOnly two years afterwards M. Victor Considerant published a similar\r\nscheme at Geneva, Switzerland. Each elector was to vote first for a\r\nparty and then for any number of candidates on the party list whom he\r\npreferred. The party votes were to decide the number of members allotted\r\nto each list, and the individual votes the successful candidates.\r\n\r\nThe little republic of Switzerland has been the scene of nearly all\r\nsubsequent improvement. In 1867 Professor Ernest Naville founded the\r\n_Association Réformiste_ at Geneva to advocate the principle of\r\nproportional representation. In 1871 the Association adopted the _Liste\r\nLibre_ system, invented by M. Borely, of Nimes, France, in which each\r\nelector was to place all the candidates of his party in order of\r\npreference. But as this allows the electors little direct influence on\r\ntheir own candidates and none outside of them, a combination of the\r\ncumulative vote and the _Liste Libre_ was adopted in 1875. Each elector\r\nwas to have as many votes as there were seats to be filled, but he\r\ncould not only give them to any candidates on any list, but he could\r\nalso give as many votes as he liked to any one candidate. Thus if there\r\nwere ten seats to be filled the elector could give ten votes to one\r\ncandidate, or one vote to each of ten candidates, or five votes to one\r\ncandidate and divide the remaining five among others, and so on. The\r\nonly condition necessary was that his votes added up to ten. The\r\naggregate votes given to all the candidates of each party were then to\r\nbe taken as the basis of proportional distribution among the parties and\r\nthe highest on each list to the number decided were to be elected.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the year 1890 that this scheme was actually put into\r\npractice. The election of 1889 had resulted so unjustly to the Liberal\r\nparty in the canton of Ticino that an insurrection broke out. This\r\nforced the hand of the Federal Government, which had to quell the\r\ndisturbance, and proportional representation was recommended and\r\nadopted. Several other cantons followed suit, and it is expected that\r\nthe whole of Switzerland will soon adopt the reform.\r\n\r\nA modification of this plan has lately been adopted by the Swiss\r\nAssociation. In this later plan electors can give a single vote only to\r\nindividual candidates, but if they do not use all their votes in this\r\nway they may cumulate the balance on any one party list by marking at\r\nthe head of the list. Thus if the elector in a ten-seat electorate gives\r\nfive votes to individual candidates, and places a mark at the head of\r\none of the lists, the balance of five votes will count to that list. The\r\naggregate votes given to individual candidates on any list, plus the\r\nvotes placed at the head of the list, will form the basis of\r\nproportional distribution among the lists. This is the plan adopted by\r\nthe American Proportional Representation League as most nearly suited to\r\nAmerican habits, and recommended by Professor Commons in his book on\r\n\"Proportional Representation.\"\r\n\r\nBelgium has also quite recently adopted a scheme of proportional\r\nrepresentation. As in Switzerland, its advent was hastened by political\r\ndisturbances. The Catholic party, not satisfied with exerting a\r\npreponderating influence in the country districts, wished to obtain also\r\nits proportionate share of representation in the cities, and proposed a\r\nscheme of proportional representation for them only. This caused such\r\nill feeling that riots took place in the streets of Brussels. Finally,\r\nproportional representation was promised all round, and became law for\r\nboth the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate at the latter end of\r\n1899. In Brussels, where there are 18 seats to be filled, a trial\r\nelection had already been held in 1893 with satisfactory results. Six\r\nlists were nominated, the largest being that of the Socialists, who\r\nnominated ten candidates; and over 12,000 electors voted. Each elector\r\nwas allowed 18 votes, and the methods in which he could distribute them\r\nwere somewhat complicated. He might (1) mark at the head of a list, (2)\r\nmark at the head of a list and also opposite one or more candidates on\r\nthe same list, (3) mark opposite the names of not more than 18\r\ncandidates on any list. In the first case his 18 votes counted to the\r\nlist marked, in the second case one vote was counted to each of the\r\nindividual candidates marked and the balance counted for the list; in\r\nthe third case one vote was counted to each candidate marked. The\r\naggregate of votes marked at the head of each list, plus the individual\r\nvotes on the list, was then taken as the basis of proportional\r\ndistribution. So many of the votes were cumulated on lists that only\r\nabout one-fifth of the votes cast were operative in the selection of\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\nIn the bill which has recently become law a new method has therefore\r\nbeen adopted, which gives more power to the party committees, but allows\r\nthe electors to modify their choice. For this purpose the party\r\norganization nominates the candidates in order of preference. The\r\nelector may then accept this order by marking at the head of the list,\r\nor he may give his vote to any one candidate on the list. If all the\r\nelectors of a party vote in the first way, those nominated highest on\r\nthe list, to the number to which the party becomes entitled, are\r\nelected. But if all the electors vote in the second way, those with the\r\nhighest single votes are elected. The actual result will usually be a\r\ncompromise between the two, and it is evidently the interest of the\r\nparty organization to place the candidates in their real order of\r\nfavour, in order that the electors may accept the list. For if an\r\nunpopular candidate were placed at the head of the list few would accept\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe first election under this system has just taken place, and the\r\nresult was, as expected, to reduce the Clerical representation\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nIn all the above variations of the Free List system the distribution of\r\nseats is effected by dividing the aggregate votes polled by each party\r\nby a unit of representation, but three different methods of determining\r\nthis unit are in use. The first is obtained by simply dividing the total\r\nnumber of votes by the number of seats.\r\n\r\nThe objection to this unit is that when there are several parties, part\r\nof the seats only can be allotted on full units, and the rest have to be\r\nallotted to those parties which have the highest remainders or fractions\r\nof a unit, and this unduly favours small parties, who do not poll even a\r\nsingle unit. The rule to divide the total votes by the number of seats\r\nincreased by one, which was first proposed by Mr. H.R. Droop, reduces\r\nslightly the number of seats allotted on remainders, and was adopted by\r\nthe canton of Soluthern in 1895. In Belgium a third plan, devised by\r\nProfessor D'Hondt, of Brussels, is used, which is designed to prevent\r\nany seats being allotted on remainders. This unit is evidently smaller\r\nthan either of the others, and is to be found by trial. It is only\r\nnecessary that the sum of the quotients obtained by dividing it into\r\neach of the lists shall be equal to the number of seats to be filled.\r\n\r\nSuppose a five-seat electorate in which 6,000 votes are divided among\r\nfour parties, who poll 2,500, 1,850, 900, and 750 votes respectively.\r\nThen if we take one-fifth, or 1,200 votes, as the unit, the result would\r\nbe the following:--\r\n\r\n(1) 2,500 = 2 units of representation + 100 remainder = 2 seats.\r\n\r\n(2) 1,850 = 1 unit of representation + 650 remainder = 1 seat.\r\n\r\n(3) 900 = unit of representation + 900 remainder = 1 seat.\r\n\r\n(4) 750 = unit of representation + 750 remainder = 1 seat.\r\n\r\nIf the Droop unit of one-sixth, or 1,000 votes, be used, the result will\r\nbe different:--\r\n\r\n(1) 2,500 = 2 units of representation + 500 remainder = 2 seats.\r\n\r\n(2) 1,850 = 1 unit of representation + 850 remainder = 2 seats.\r\n\r\n(3) 900 = unit of representation + 900 remainder = 1 seat.\r\n\r\n(4) 750 = unit of representation + 750 remainder = seat.\r\n\r\nBy the third method any number of votes between 834 and 900 will be\r\nfound to comply with Professor D'Hondt's condition, and the result\r\nwould, in this instance, be the same as by the Droop method. Although\r\nthe highest number was at first used, the lower limit has been adopted\r\nin the new bill.\r\n\r\nIn no case can the proportional distribution be considered satisfactory.\r\nIf the electorates are small, and the number of parties large, accurate\r\nproportional representation is quite out of the question. In\r\nSwitzerland, however, the electorates are made to contain sometimes as\r\nmany as 30 seats. The effect of such large electorates must be in time\r\nto encourage the formation of a great number of small factions. At the\r\nsame time there is not so much incentive to split up the parties as by\r\nthe Hare system.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the selection of party candidates, none of the methods\r\ncan be said to ensure the election of those most in general favour. When\r\nelectors are allowed to cumulate on individual candidates, the\r\nfavourites of sections within the party will be elected. If, on the\r\nother hand, they are allowed to cumulate on party lists, all votes thus\r\ngiven are ineffective in the selection of the successful candidates. It\r\nmay be noted that although the nomination of candidates in lists by\r\nparty organizations is less in accordance with the practice of British\r\ncountries than the individual candidature of the Hare system, there is\r\nnothing to prevent one candidate being nominated to stand in the place\r\nof a party.\r\n\r\nA word of warning must be added as to the danger of holding up Belgium\r\nand Switzerland as examples of true electoral justice to Australia. The\r\ndirect government of the people which Switzerland has adopted bears not\r\nthe slightest resemblance to the representative institutions of British\r\ncountries. Both the referendum and proportional delegation are suited to\r\ndirect government and are destructive to party responsible government.\r\nThe Swiss adopted the referendum to save themselves from the lobbying\r\nand plutocratic character of their legislatures. The initiative and\r\nproportional delegation have followed because they are complementary\r\nreforms. The consequence is that the legislators have been degraded to\r\nmere agents for drawing up measures, and leadership has been transferred\r\nto the press. It is the peculiar conditions of Switzerland which enable\r\nit to tolerate unrestrained majority rule. It is a small country,\r\nsurrounded by powerful neighbours, whose strength lies in its weakness.\r\nMoreover, the people are very conservative. In Zurich, for instance,\r\nwhich is largely devoted to manufactures, a proposal to limit the hours\r\nof work in factories to twelve hours a day was rejected by the people.\r\nNor is direct government proving a success; the tyranny of the majority\r\nis already apparent. The first federal initiative demanded a measure to\r\nprevent the slaughter of animals by bleeding, designed to interfere\r\nwith the religious rites of the Jews. Despite the fact that it was\r\nopposed by the Federal Council, as contrary to the right of religious\r\nliberty guaranteed by the Constitution, it was carried by the\r\nreferendum. Belgium, again, can hardly be taken as a model of\r\nconstitutional liberty. Surely we in Australia do not want the factious\r\nstrife of religious, racial, and class sections, which so nearly brought\r\non a revolution last year. Yet this is exactly what proportional\r\ndelegation to sections would bring about. Belgium has a hard task to\r\nreconcile two races so differently constituted as the Walloons and\r\nFlemings, and has been able to avoid instability of the ministry so far\r\nonly because the Clerical party, which is mostly Flemish, still has a\r\nmajority. The new system has only consecrated the sectional principle,\r\nand will do nothing to restore harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPREFERENTIAL VOTING, THE BLOCK VOTE, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Preferential Voting.+--Laplace, the great mathematician, to whom we owe\r\nso much of the theory of probability, showed more than a century ago\r\nthat although individual electors may have very different views as to\r\nthe relative merits of a number of candidates for any office, still the\r\nexpression of the degree of favour in which the candidates are held by\r\nthe whole body of electors will be the same if each elector be assumed\r\nto have a uniform gradation of preference. Suppose that there are ten\r\ncandidates, and it is required to place them in order of general favour.\r\nEach elector should be required to place the whole ten in the order of\r\nhis preference, 1, 2, 3, &c. Let the maximum degree of merit be denoted\r\nby ten marks, so that every first preference will count as ten marks.\r\nThen, although an individual elector might be disposed to give his\r\nsecond preference only five marks, and the rest of his preferences, say,\r\ntwo marks, Laplace demonstrated that it is most probable that the total\r\nresult would be the same if each elector be assumed to give his second\r\npreference nine marks, his third preference eight marks, and so on.\r\nTherefore, if all first preferences be multiplied by ten, second\r\npreferences by nine, and so on in regular order down to last preferences\r\nmultiplied by one, the total number of marks will be an index of the\r\norder in general favour. If there is one office to be filled, the\r\ncandidate with the highest number of marks should be elected; if there\r\nare two offices, the two highest candidates, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut the assumed condition must be rigidly complied with; each elector\r\nmust express his honest preferences. Whether he will do so or not\r\ndepends upon the circumstances. Laplace recognized this element of human\r\nnature, and declared that if electors are swayed by other considerations\r\nindependent of the merit of the candidates the system would not apply.\r\nFor instance, if the candidates are the nominees of a number of\r\nindependent sections, each of which is anxious only to secure the return\r\nof its own candidate, and to defeat those who stand most in his way, the\r\ntendency will be general to place the more popular candidates, those\r\nwhose success is most feared, at the bottom of the list, so as to give\r\nthem as few marks as possible. The result would be to favour mediocre\r\nmen, or even in extreme cases the most inferior.\r\n\r\nPractically, therefore, the system is not applicable where any of the\r\nelectors are personally interested in the result. If a number of judges\r\nwere called on to decide the relative merits of several essays or prize\r\ndesigns, and the competitors' names were not known to them, the system\r\nmight be used. But even in such a case a simpler method is available;\r\nfor, although it may be difficult to pick out the best, it is generally\r\neasy to agree upon the worst. It is usual, then, to gradually eliminate\r\nthe worst, and when the number is reduced to two to take the decision of\r\nthe majority.\r\n\r\nThis process of elimination may be, however, combined with the\r\npreferential system, and the result is more accurate than if one count\r\nonly be made. At the first count the candidate with the fewest marks\r\nwould be eliminated and his name struck out on all the papers. All those\r\nunder him on each paper would then go up one point in order of favour,\r\nand further counts would be held, eliminating the lowest candidate each\r\ntime till the candidates were reduced to the number desired. This method\r\nis very complicated, and involves a great amount of trouble.\r\n\r\nConsider now the case of a voluntary association of individuals, such as\r\na club or society; and suppose that it is required to elect a president\r\nor committee. The condition is clearly that he or they should be most in\r\ngeneral favour with all the members; and the question whether\r\nPreferential Voting is applicable will depend on how united the members\r\nare. Now, clubs are not usually, nor should they be, divided into\r\ncliques or parties; indeed, if a serious split does take place it\r\ngenerally results in the resignation of part of the club and the\r\nformation of a separate organization. But in a live club it is\r\nimpossible to prevent slight differences of opinion; and an\r\nofficer-bearer who has the interests of the club at heart must often\r\noffend small sections who want to exert undue influence. In an election\r\nfor president this office-bearer would stand no chance of election if\r\nthere are several candidates and any small section likes to put him at\r\nthe bottom of the list, so as to give him as many bad marks as possible.\r\nThis is the weak point in Preferential Voting; any small section can\r\nensure the rejection of a general favourite. The greater the number of\r\ncandidates the smaller the minority which is able to do this; dummy\r\ncandidates may therefore be introduced to make it more certain. The risk\r\nwould, however, be very much lessened if the process of gradual\r\nelimination we have described were adopted.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the election of representatives to a legislature it is\r\nevident at once that Preferential Voting is not applicable at all. We\r\nhave shown that the true condition required is not the return of\r\ncandidates most in general favour with both parties, but the return of\r\nthe candidates most in general favour with each party separately.\r\nPreferential Voting would therefore only be applicable if the electors\r\nof each party voted separately for its own candidates; and even then it\r\nwould be open to the objection we have already urged. If it were applied\r\nto the two parties voting together the electors would certainly not be\r\ninfluenced only by the merit of the candidates. They might record their\r\nhonest preferences as regards the candidates of their own party, but\r\nthey would naturally place the candidates of the opposing party in\r\ninverse order of merit. The candidates most in general favour would be\r\nthose who represented neither party. Suppose there are three candidates\r\nfor a single seat, two representing large parties of 49 per cent, each,\r\nand the third a small party of 2 per cent. The electors of the large\r\nparties would be more afraid of one another than of the small party, and\r\nwould give their second preferences to its candidate. This candidate,\r\nrepresenting one-fiftieth of the electors, would then actually be\r\nelected; he would receive 202 marks, and neither of the others could\r\npossibly secure more than 200. Moreover, he would still be elected if\r\nthe process of elimination were adopted, since on the second count he\r\nwould beat either of the other candidates separately by 51 votes to 49.\r\n\r\nThese plain facts are indisputable. What is to be thought, then, of the\r\nclaim made by Professor Nanson that Preferential Voting, with the\r\nprocess of elimination, is the most perfect system known for\r\nsingle-membered electorates.\r\n\r\n+The Block Vote.+--The Block Vote, General Ticket, or _scrutin de\r\nliste_, is in general use when there is more than one seat to be filled.\r\nEach elector has as many votes as there are members to be elected, and\r\nthe highest on the list, to the number of representatives required, are\r\nsuccessful. Dealing first with elections to a legislative body, the\r\nsystem is eminently unjust to parties. A rigid control of nominations is\r\nnecessary in the first place, because any party which splits up its\r\nvotes spoils its chance. Each party will therefore nominate only as many\r\ncandidates as there are seats, and the stronger of two parties, or the\r\nstrongest of a number of parties, will elect the entire list. A minority\r\nmight in the latter case secure all the representation, but the\r\npractical effect of the Block Vote is to force the electors to group\r\nthemselves into two parties only. It therefore has the same beneficial\r\neffect as the single electorate of confining representation to the two\r\nmain parties. This is apparently nob recognized by Professor Nanson, who\r\nwrites, in his pamphlet on the Hare system:--\"Contrast with this the\r\nresults of the Block system. With strict party voting, which has been\r\nassumed throughout, each of the five parties would put forward seven\r\ncandidates. The seven seats would all be secured by Form, with 44 votes\r\nout of a total of 125, and the remaining 81, or more than two-thirds of\r\nthe voters, would be wholly unrepresented.\" Does the Professor really\r\nthink that the 81 (who, by the way, are _less_ than two-thirds) would be\r\nso foolish as not to combine and secure all the seats?\r\n\r\nThe exclusion of the minority in a single-membered electorate excites\r\nonly a feeling of hopelessness, but when it fails to secure a single\r\nrepresentative in an electorate returning several members, a spirit of\r\nrankling injustice is aroused. The Block Vote has, therefore, never been\r\ntolerated for long in large electorates. In the early history of the\r\nUnited States many of the States adopted it, and sent to Congress a\r\nsolid delegation of one party or the other. This proved so unjust, and\r\noperated so adversely to the federal spirit in promoting combinations of\r\nStates, that Congress, in 1842, made the single-membered electorate\r\nobligatory on all the States.\r\n\r\nIn France it was adopted at the election for the Chamber of Deputies in\r\n1885. The result as regards parties was about as good as with the single\r\nelectorate system. The Republicans and Conservative-Monarchists, whose\r\nnumbers entitled them to 311 and 257 seats respectively, actually\r\nsecured 366 and 202. But it was abandoned after a trial at this one\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nThe Block Vote was adopted in Australia for the election of ten\r\ndelegates from each colony to the Federal Convention. This was a work in\r\nwhich all parties might fairly have joined together; and in most\r\ncolonies the people did select the best men, regardless of party. In\r\nVictoria, however, the newspapers took on the _rôle_ of the \"machine,\"\r\nand the ten candidates nominated by the _Age_ were elected. Many of the\r\nsupporters of the defeated candidates voted for some on the successful\r\nlist who just defeated their own favourites. Had this been foreseen they\r\nwould have thrown away these votes by giving them to those sure to be\r\nelected or to those least likely to be elected. The injustice of forcing\r\neach elector to vote for the whole ten is thus brought home. We are now\r\nthreatened with the adoption of the Block Vote for the Federal Senate,\r\nand in some of the States for the House of Representatives as well; and\r\nit is in the hope of preventing this wrong that the present book is\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nSo far we have been considering the Block Vote as applied to the\r\nelection of a legislature with two or more parties; we now propose to\r\nconsider it as applied to one party only. It is a matter of common\r\nknowledge that the Block Vote, when used for such an election as that of\r\nthe committee of a club, works very well, and results in the return of\r\nthe candidates most in general favour with all sections. The reason is,\r\nof course, that all sections work together, and members vote for the\r\nbest men, regardless of sectional lines. We will go further and say that\r\nthe Block Vote is by far the best method for such purposes, and is\r\nsuperior even to Preferential Voting. In the first place it is free from\r\nthe defect that a small section can ensure the rejection of a general\r\nfavourite; and in the second place it rests on at least as secure a\r\ntheoretical basis. To fix our ideas, suppose there are ten candidates\r\nfor five members of a committee. Laplace assumed (1) that each member\r\nwould have a knowledge of the merits of all the ten candidates, (2) that\r\nhis estimate of the respective candidates would vary arbitrarily\r\nbetween nothing and a maximum degree of merit, (3) that each member\r\nwould express his honest preferences. The Block Vote, on the other hand,\r\nassumes (1) that each member can pick out the five best candidates, and\r\ntherefore express his opinion as to how the committee should be\r\nconstituted, (2) that he will be inclined to place these five candidates\r\non one plane of favour and the other five on one plane of non-favour. We\r\nsubmit that the latter assumptions agree more closely with the actual\r\nstate of affairs. The members can distinguish between candidates who\r\nhave merit and those who have no merit or of whose merit they are\r\nignorant; to force them, therefore, to place all the candidates in order\r\nof preference is to make them express preferences where none exist.[8]\r\nOn the whole, then, the Block Vote is more likely to place the\r\ncandidates in their real order of favour.\r\n\r\nBut some reservation must be made. The Block Vote works best when the\r\nnumber of candidates does not exceed two or three times the number of\r\nvacancies. Suppose, first, that the candidates present in the final\r\nresult a fairly regular order of favour from lowest to highest. Each of\r\nthe successful candidates will then be supported by at least an absolute\r\nmajority of the members, providing the number of candidates be not\r\ngreater than twice the number of vacancies. But if there are four or\r\nfive times as many candidates as vacancies, none of the successful\r\ncandidates will have the support of a majority of the members. On the\r\nother hand, however, the candidates do not usually present a regular\r\norder of favour from lowest to highest when there are a large number of\r\ncandidates, for there may be a long \"tail\" of candidates who receive\r\nvery few votes. The following general rule may therefore be laid\r\ndown:--The Block Vote works best when the total votes given to rejected\r\ncandidates do not exceed the total votes given to successful candidates.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties indicated above were met by the Australian Natives'\r\nAssociation by a plan which provided that no candidate should be elected\r\nexcept by an absolute majority of the voters. The Block Vote is used\r\nthroughout; and if at the first ballot the required number of candidates\r\ndo not obtain an absolute majority a second ballot is held, from which\r\nthose at the bottom of the poll and those who have been elected are\r\neliminated. This process is continued till all the vacancies are filled.\r\nFour or five ballots are sometimes required, and the proceedings become\r\nvery irksome. A sub-committee was recently appointed to investigate the\r\nsubject, and reported in favour of the Preferential System with one\r\ncount only. The process of elimination was considered too complicated to\r\nbe practicable. Now, the conditions presented by these elections, in\r\nwhich a very large number of candidates are generally nominated, are\r\nprecisely those in which Preferential Voting lends itself most easily to\r\nabuse. An insignificant minority may defeat a candidate who should be\r\nelected, by placing him at the bottom of their lists.\r\n\r\nA variation of the Block Vote may be suggested which is much simpler and\r\nbetter. The preferential ballot papers should be used, and two counts\r\nshould be made. At the first count the primary half of the preferences\r\nshould be counted as effective votes, and the candidates should be\r\nreduced to twice the number of vacancies. A second count should then be\r\nmade of the ballot papers, using the Block Vote. All or nearly all the\r\ncandidates would then obtain an absolute majority, and it is practically\r\nimpossible that any candidate should be eliminated by the first count\r\nwho would have had any chance of election in the second.\r\n\r\nThis plan is far superior to the original method. It is right that\r\nmembers who vote for candidates who are hopelessly out of it should be\r\nallowed to transfer their votes; but it is not right that members who\r\nfirst help to elect some candidates at one ballot should have the same\r\nvoting power as others at subsequent ballots.\r\n\r\nThe Hare system is sometimes advocated for clubs on account of its\r\nsupposed just principle. Any live club which adopts it runs the risk of\r\ndisruption. It merely encourages the formation of cliques and sections;\r\nany slight split would be accentuated and rendered permanent.\r\n\r\n+The Limited Vote.+--The injustice of the Block Vote led to the\r\nintroduction of the Limited Vote, which allows the minority some share\r\nof the representation. We have seen that the Block Vote forces each\r\nparty to try to return all the representation, and of course one party\r\nonly can succeed. But if neither party be forced to try to return more\r\nthan it is entitled to each party will get its correct share of\r\nrepresentation, providing both parties are equally organized. This leads\r\nto the Limited Vote, in which each elector has a number of votes\r\nsomewhat less than the number of seats.\r\n\r\nThe Limited Vote was used in England for a number of three-seat\r\nelectorates, which were created by the Reform Bill of 1867, each elector\r\nbeing allowed to vote for two candidates only. By this means the\r\nmajority would usually return two candidates and the minority one. Thus\r\nthe Limited Vote has the same advantage as the Block Vote and the single\r\nelectorate system, that it tends to confine representation to the two\r\nmain parties, but it creates an artificial proportion of representation\r\nbetween them. Moreover, it renders strict party organization even more\r\nnecessary, since each party must arrange to use its voting resources to\r\nthe best advantage. Consider the three-seat electorate, for instance.\r\nThe minority will, if it is wise, nominate two candidates only; and the\r\nmajority may nominate either two or three. But if the majority does\r\ndivide its votes among three candidates it runs the risk of securing one\r\nonly. It can do so safely when two conditions are fulfilled: first, it\r\nmust be sure of polling more than three-fifths of the votes; and,\r\nsecond, it must arrange to distribute all its votes equally among the\r\nthree candidates. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that the\r\nLimited Vote was responsible for introducing \"machine\" tactics into\r\nEngland. In Birmingham, when Mr. Joseph Chamberlain organized the\r\nLiberals and succeeded in carrying all three seats, the electors in each\r\nward were directed how to vote so that as few votes as possible might be\r\nwasted. These three-cornered constituencies were abolished by the\r\n_Redistribution Act_ of 1884; and Sir John Lubbock, reviewing the\r\nexperiment, declared--\"On the whole, it cannot be denied that under the\r\nLimited Vote the views of the electors have been fairly represented.\"\r\n\r\nThe system has also been tried to a smaller extent in the United States.\r\nIn New York 32 of the delegates to a constitutional convention were\r\nelected from the State polled as one electorate, each elector being\r\nallowed to vote for 16 candidates. Both parties were afraid to split\r\ntheir votes, and the result was that each returned 16. The rest of the\r\ndelegates were elected in single-membered electorates, and of these the\r\nRepublicans secured 81 and the Democrats 47. It might here be pointed\r\nout that the Republicans might have secured more than 16 of the\r\ndelegates from the State at large if they had nominated 20 candidates\r\nand allowed the laws of chance to regulate their organization. Each\r\nelector might have been directed to put the twenty names into his hat,\r\nand to reject the first four he pulled out. The same evil is apparent in\r\nBoston, where twelve aldermen are elected at large, each elector being\r\nallowed seven votes. Each party nominates seven candidates only; and the\r\nmajority invariably elects seven and the minority five.\r\n\r\nThe Limited Vote is therefore not a satisfactory solution of the problem\r\nof representation. It gives an artificial instead of proportional\r\nrepresentation, and it necessitates strict party organization and\r\ncontrol of nominations. At the same time it will generally give a very\r\nfair representation if parties are not strictly organized, and might\r\nwell have been adopted for the Federal Convention, five or six votes\r\nbeing allowed instead of ten. Newspaper domination would thus have been\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\n+Election of the Candidate Most in General Favour.+--It is often\r\nrequired to ascertain the candidate most in general favour where one\r\nparty only is concerned, such as an election for leader of the\r\nOpposition or president of a club; and the methods in general use are\r\nvery defective. We do not refer to the theoretical difficulty, which\r\nperplexes some persons, of giving effect to the actual degree of favour\r\nin which the candidates stand in the electors' minds, but to the simple\r\nproblem of finding out who is preferred most by the bulk of the\r\nelectors. Thus it is universally recognised that when two candidates\r\nstand the candidate who has the support of an absolute majority of the\r\nelectors is entitled to election. Yet it is possible that the rejected\r\ncandidate may be nearly twice as popular. This might happen if the\r\nmajority held that there was little to choose between the two\r\ncandidates, while the minority thought they could not be compared. But\r\nit is quite evident that such distinctions cannot be recognized; the\r\ncandidate who is preferred by an absolute majority must be elected. It\r\nis when there are more than two candidates that the difficulty arises.\r\nTo elect the candidate who has most first preferences is open to very\r\nserious objection; he may have a small minority of the total votes, and\r\neach of the other candidates might be able to beat him single-handed.\r\n\r\nThe best way to overcome the difficulty is undoubtedly by some process\r\nof gradually eliminating the least popular candidates till the number is\r\nreduced to two; the candidate with the absolute majority is then\r\nelected. We propose to consider the different ways in which elimination\r\nmight be made. We assume, in the first place, that each elector has cast\r\nan advance vote--_i.e._, that he has placed all the candidates in order\r\nof preference. The most primitive method is to eliminate at each\r\nsuccessive count the candidate who has least first preferences. This is\r\nthe method adopted in the Hare system, and we have already shown that\r\nit is very defective; in fact, it is no improvement at all. The\r\neliminated candidate might be most in general favour, and might be able\r\nto beat each of the other candidates single-handed. A second method is\r\nto use Preferential Voting to decide which candidate should be\r\neliminated at each successive count. This is far superior, but it is\r\nextremely complicated, and is open to the objection that when there are\r\na large number of candidates a small section may cause the rejection of\r\nthe general favourite. We propose to describe a method based on the\r\nBlock Vote which is much simpler, and which does not lend itself to\r\nabuse. We have shown that the Block Vote works best when the candidates\r\ncan be divided into two equal sections of favour and non-favour. Suppose\r\nthere are four candidates, the first two preferences should therefore be\r\ncounted as effective votes, instead of the first preference only. The\r\neliminated candidate will then be the least in general favour. A second\r\ncount is then made of the three candidates left, and the first\r\npreferences and half of the second preferences are counted as effective,\r\nand the lowest again eliminated. The candidate who has an absolute\r\nmajority is then elected. The method may be indefinitely extended; if\r\nthere are five candidates the first two preferences and one-half of the\r\nthird preferences are counted, and so on. But when there are a great\r\nmany candidates more than one might be eliminated. Any number up to\r\neight could be safely reduced to four at the first count.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[8] The bracket principle introduced by Professor Nanson into the Hare\r\nsystem involves a partial recognition of this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE THE PRESENT SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Double Election.+--In the preceding chapter we have strongly\r\ninsisted that the different methods considered for ensuring the return\r\nof the candidate acceptable to all sections are not applicable to the\r\nelection of legislators. The true principles of political representation\r\nrequire, not the election of the candidate most in general favour with\r\nboth parties, but the election by each party separately of its own most\r\nfavoured candidates. But as it is impossible for both parties to be\r\nrepresented in a single-membered electorate, the best alternative is\r\nthat both should contest the seat and one be represented. The present\r\nsystem of election has largely tended to realize this alternative,\r\nespecially in those countries in which party government was strong, such\r\nas England and the United States; and representation has in consequence\r\nbeen confined to the two main parties. In England, where the party\r\nsystem was gradually developed, this result was attained without any\r\nrigid control of nominations, because the true party spirit prevailed\r\nand personal ambition was subordinated to political principle; and in\r\nthe United States it was only brought about at the cost of \"machine\"\r\ncontrol of nominations. But on the Continent of Europe, where party\r\ngovernment was transplanted from England, it has never really taken\r\nroot. Each small group nominated its own candidates, and the successful\r\ncandidate represented only a plurality, and not a majority, of the\r\nelectors. Instead of a contest between two organized parties there was a\r\nscramble among numerous factions.\r\n\r\nIn France, Belgium, Italy, and Germany an attempt has been made to check\r\nthis evil by the double election. If at the first election no candidate\r\nsecures an absolute majority of the votes, a second election is held,\r\nfor which only the two candidates who head the poll at the first\r\nelection are allowed to compete. One must then get an absolute majority.\r\nThe double election has undoubtedly tended to prevent a further\r\nsplitting up into groups, but the Continental countries offer such poor\r\nsoil for the growth of party government that it has only restricted the\r\ncontest to two factions in each electorate; and, of course, the dominant\r\nfactions are not the same in the various electorates.\r\n\r\n+The Advance Vote.+--In Australia the same evil has become increasingly\r\nevident, and it is now no uncommon thing for a candidate to be elected\r\nby less than one-third or one-quarter of the total votes. In Queensland\r\na plan has been introduced to meet the evil, under the name of the\r\nAdvance Vote, which is designed to secure the advantages of the French\r\nplan without the trouble and expense of a second election. The electors\r\nsimply declare in advance at the first election how they would vote at\r\nthe second election. All that is necessary is that they place the\r\ncandidates in order of preference, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. Then, instead of\r\nholding a second election between the two who have the greatest number\r\nof first preferences, it is merely necessary for the returning officer\r\nto consult each ballot paper and see which of these two candidates is\r\nhigher in order of favour. Thus if one is marked 3 and the other 4, the\r\nvote is counted to the candidate marked 3. This device is assumed to\r\ngive exactly the same result as the French plan, providing only that the\r\nsame electors vote at both elections, and do not change their views\r\nbetween the two elections.\r\n\r\nBut in reality it possesses hardly any of the advantages of the French\r\nplan. It is another instance of the danger of neglecting the factor of\r\nhuman nature. The French do not go to the trouble and expense of a\r\nsecond election for nothing. Their plan is far the better. First of all,\r\nconsider the candidates. They know well beforehand that unless one of\r\nthem gets an absolute majority of the votes at the first election they\r\nwill be put to the expense and delay of a second election, therefore it\r\nis to their interest that the number of candidates be restricted. This\r\ntends to keep down the representation to two sections. Next, consider\r\nthe electors. They know also that unless they give a majority of votes\r\nto one of the candidates they will be put to the trouble of voting a\r\nsecond time, therefore they will take good care the votes are not split\r\nup, even if the candidates wanted it. What is the result? Simply that in\r\nthe vast majority of cases one of the candidates gets a majority at the\r\nfirst election, and no second election is necessary; and, most important\r\nof all, the tendency to split up is counteracted.\r\n\r\nNow take the Queensland system. None of these checks operate. The\r\nsplitting up into groups is actually encouraged, and it is to the\r\ninterest of each group to see as many more groups as possible formed, in\r\norder to increase its own relative importance, for the delegates of the\r\ntwo strongest groups have a chance of election instead of the strongest\r\ngroup only.\r\n\r\nIn practice the plan threatens to break down, owing to a practical point\r\nbeing overlooked. It is evident that the success of the Advance Vote\r\ndepends on the electors marking all the preferences. The ballot paper\r\nshould be made informal unless all the preferences are given. In\r\nQueensland this has not been done, and the consequence is that a large\r\nproportion of the electors refuse to give more than one preference. No\r\nmore conclusive evidence is needed that the scheme has promoted the\r\ngrowth of factions. These electors voluntarily disfranchise themselves\r\nrather than vote for any of the other candidates, and of course the very\r\nobject of the scheme is defeated; the successful candidate cannot secure\r\na majority of the votes cast.\r\n\r\n+The Exhaustive Ballot.+--A bill has just been introduced into the\r\nLegislative Assembly of Victoria, providing for a further extension of\r\nthe principle of the Advance Vote. The plan is favoured by Professor\r\nNanson, and professes to be an improvement on the Queensland plan,\r\nalthough it is only an \"instalment of reform\" in view of the ultimate\r\nadoption of the more perfect Preferential Voting. The Queensland plan is\r\nobjected to because all but the two highest candidates are thrown out.\r\nSuppose, for instance, two candidates stand for the weaker party and\r\nthree for the stronger party, it is quite likely that all the candidates\r\nof the stronger party will be thrown out. Therefore the lowest candidate\r\nonly of the five should be thrown out. All his papers should be\r\ntransferred to the candidate who is marked 2 on them; and those below\r\nhim on all the papers should go up one point in order of favour. If he\r\nstood 3 on a paper, the candidate who was 4 would now become 3. Another\r\ncount of first preferences should then be made, and the lowest again\r\nthrown out; and so on till one candidate gets an absolute majority. It\r\nis pointed out triumphantly that this plan, which is known as the\r\nExhaustive Ballot, actually saves in this instance all the trouble and\r\nexpense of no less than three separate elections. The process of\r\nelimination is the same as that adopted in the Hare system, and is\r\nlittle, if at all, better than the Queensland plan in securing the\r\nelection of the right candidate, while as regards the formation of\r\ngroups it is worse. For this plan actually encourages the groups to\r\nsplit up, since if one candidate nominated by a group is thrown out his\r\nvote will be transferred to the others. Therefore the double election is\r\nmuch better than either form of the Advance Vote. They would do nothing\r\ntowards restoring the one redeeming merit of the single electorate, of\r\nconfining representation to the two main parties. And all other\r\nmathematical schemes founded on the _a priori_ assumption that the\r\ncandidate most favoured by all sections is entitled to the seat are just\r\nas objectionable.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion that must be reached from all these considerations is\r\nthat, except when there is a single candidate standing in the interests\r\nof each of the two main parties, it is impossible to say with the\r\npresent system who ought to be elected. The difficulty is one of\r\nfundamental principle. The only way to do justice to both parties is to\r\nenlarge the electorates so that each can get its proportionate share of\r\nrepresentation, and then to provide such machinery as will allow each\r\nparty separately to elect its most favoured candidates. In no other way\r\ncan the people be induced to organize into two coherent parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION OF THE REFORM TO AUSTRALIAN LEGISLATURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Federal Legislatures.+--The keynote of the Australian Federal\r\nConstitution, as expressed in the Commonwealth Bill, is full and\r\nunreserved trust in the people. This is in direct contrast with the\r\nAmerican Constitution, which seeks to place checks on the people by\r\ndividing power among the President, the Senate, and the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and assigning to each separate functions. Do we fully\r\nrealize the dangers as well as the glorious possibilities of unfettered\r\naction? Do we sufficiently feel the weight of the responsibility we have\r\nundertaken? In reality we have declared to the world the fitness of the\r\nAustralian democracy to work a Constitution from which the most advanced\r\nof the other nations would shrink! We do not hesitate to avow our firm\r\nbelief that there is only one thing that can save the situation. Unless\r\nAustralia is to show to the world a warning instead of an example, all\r\nher energies must be bent on the formation of two coherent organized\r\nparties, dividing each State on national issues, and competing for the\r\nsupport of all classes and all interests in every electorate throughout\r\nthe Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThat is the lesson we have endeavoured to inculcate throughout this\r\nbook, and we are tempted to quote in support of it the opinion of an\r\nAmerican author, Professor Paul S. Reinsch, in a work just published on\r\n\"World Politics.\" He says:--\r\n\r\n     The political experience of the last two centuries has proved that\r\n     free government and party government are almost convertible terms.\r\n     It is still as true as when Burke wrote his famous defence of\r\n     party, in his _Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents_,\r\n     that, for the realization of political freedom, the organization of\r\n     the electorate into regular and permanent parties is necessary.\r\n     Parliamentary government has attained its highest success only in\r\n     those countries where political power is held alternately by two\r\n     great national parties. As soon as factional interests become\r\n     predominant; as soon as the stability of government depends upon\r\n     the artificial grouping of minor conflicting interests; as soon as\r\n     the nation lacks the tonic effect of the mutual criticisms of great\r\n     organizations, the highest form of free government becomes\r\n     unattainable. (pp. 327, 328.)\r\n\r\nThe greatest strain on the Constitution will probably be felt at the\r\noutset. Both people and politicians are suddenly called upon to rise to\r\na higher plane of political thought and action. The idea that each State\r\nis to send representatives to fight for its own interests must first be\r\ngot rid of. The only way in which all interests can be reconciled is by\r\neach State acting through the national parties. The greatest danger\r\nwhich assails the Commonwealth is the risk of combinations of States\r\ndominating party lines; and it is the more imminent that divergent\r\nopinions between the larger and the smaller States were already apparent\r\nat the Convention. The four smaller States, Western Australia, South\r\nAustralia, Queensland, and Tasmania, with about one-third of the\r\npopulation, will have two-thirds of the representation in the Senate;\r\nwhile the two large States, Victoria and New South Wales, will have\r\nabout two-thirds of the representation in the House of Representatives.\r\nAt the Convention the fear was expressed that the former, representing a\r\nmajority of the States, and the latter, representing a majority of the\r\npeople, might come into conflict, and that a deadlock would ensue. It\r\nwas on this issue that the great struggle at the Convention took place,\r\nresulting in the adoption of a double dissolution and a subsequent joint\r\nsitting of the two Houses if necessary. By this machinery all disputes\r\nwill be finally settled. But what will happen if some of the States\r\nconsider themselves unjustly treated? Even apart from conflicts between\r\nthe two Houses, if only one State stood aloof from the main parties it\r\ncould paralyze government, just as Ireland did in the Imperial\r\nParliament. It is evident, then, that the very existence of the Union is\r\nbound up in the immediate formation of national parties.\r\n\r\nIn the United States this lesson was not learned till the Civil War had\r\ndemonstrated the danger of combinations of States. Since then two great\r\nparties have been maintained, even though their existence involves the\r\nspoils system and machine organization. In Switzerland, too, the federal\r\ntie was not drawn close till after the revolution in 1847, in which the\r\nCatholic cantons attempted to secede.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, another cause of dissension menaces the Commonwealth. We\r\nallude to the class representation which we have already animadverted\r\nupon. The separate representation of sections or classes within the\r\nStates is just as much to be dreaded as the separate representation of\r\nStates, and bodes as much ill. It seems not unlikely that the fate of\r\nthe first Federal ministry will be in the hands of the Labour party,\r\nwhich will be able to dictate its policy. It is utterly inconsistent\r\nwith the democratic theory that a small minority should have this power;\r\nand it is to be hoped that in the wider field of federal politics its\r\ntrue character will be recognized. It is only by the mutual action of\r\ntwo great national parties that the true direction of progress, favoured\r\nby the people, can be worked out; a small minority studying only its own\r\ninterests is sure to be a bad guide. A steady pressure maintained\r\nthrough the two national parties will ensure the recognition of all just\r\ndemands; such extreme and ill-considered demands as that for the\r\ninitiative and national referendum can only provoke opposition and cause\r\nreaction. Even those who sympathize with the ultimate objects of the\r\nLabour unions must see the folly of their present unpatriotic and\r\nsuicidal tactics.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter for hope that in the wider sphere of federal politics the\r\nirresponsible leadership of the press is not likely to be the power for\r\nharm that it is in some of the individual States at present. But while\r\nit may not dominate the Federal Parliament as a whole to the same\r\nextent, its control over nominations in the States will be quite as\r\ngreat, and immeasurably greater if the Block Vote is adopted. Nor are\r\nsigns wanting of a union of some of the larger newspaper ventures in the\r\nprincipal States, with a view to increase their power.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief review of the outlook. The great requisites essential\r\nfor progress are the organization of two national parties and\r\nresponsible leadership in the Federal Parliament. The dangers to the\r\nCommonwealth may be summed up under the two heads of lack of\r\norganization and irresponsible leadership outside Parliament. Is it\r\npossible that the dangers may be avoided and the requisites secured by a\r\nchange in electoral machinery? Those who have no conception of the\r\nworking of social forces, and who do not trace the law of causation into\r\nthe realm of mind, will be inclined to scoff at the suggestion. To them\r\nthe only hope of improvement lies in appealing to the people to elect\r\nbetter men. They ignore entirely the reciprocal relation of the\r\nParliament and the people, and while recognizing the influence of the\r\npeople on the character of Parliament, they deny the influence of\r\nParliament on the character of the people. They declare that the people\r\nare \"free agents\" and will have better government when they make up\r\ntheir minds to get it; and no electoral machinery or parliamentary\r\nmachinery can influence the result. Such is the passive attitude which\r\nconsciously or unconsciously is almost universally assumed. Yet who can\r\nstudy the history of the British Constitution without being impressed\r\nwith the fact that every step in the evolution of its machinery was a\r\ntrue sociological invention and had the effect of directing the people's\r\nwill, which is the motive force, into channels conducive to the general\r\nwelfare? Take away the responsible leadership of the Cabinet in the\r\nBritish Parliament, and it would become a sink of corruption like the\r\nUnited States Congress; take away its organization into two national\r\nparties, and it would become a rabble like the French Chambers. Now, is\r\nnot the electoral machinery the connecting link between the people and\r\nParliament, and therefore a vital part in the machinery of government?\r\nDoes it not actually decide the constitution of Parliament? If this be\r\ngranted, it follows that unless the electoral machinery be adapted to\r\ngive effect to these two great principles, parliaments will inevitably\r\ndecline; and that the present method of election is a very inadequate\r\nmeans of giving effect to them few will deny.\r\n\r\nOur claim for the application of the electoral reform set forth in the\r\npreceding pages rests simply on the fact that it will give effect to\r\nthese principles under conditions in which the present system would\r\nfail. We press especially for its application to the Federal House of\r\nRepresentatives, which will be the most important Australian\r\nrepresentative assembly; for it it there that organization and\r\nresponsible leadership are most urgently needed. That they will not be\r\nobtained if the present schemes of dividing the States into\r\nsingle-membered electorates are adopted is morally certain; and the\r\nresult can only be disaster and bitter disappointment. If the\r\nmathematical devices described in the last chapter are added, the\r\ndisorganization will be still more complete. And as for the scheme for\r\nallowing separate delegation to a number of sections, which is advocated\r\nunder the name of the Hare system, it would be absolutely fatal. Who can\r\nbelieve that if Mr. Hare's wild scheme to divide the British people into\r\nseveral hundred sections had been adopted 40 years ago the Imperial\r\nParliament would now be an organized assembly?\r\n\r\nTake the conditions presented by the first elections for the Federal\r\nParliament, to be held early next year. In some respects it is fortunate\r\nthat a definite issue is available as a basis of party organization; for\r\nthere is a general consensus of opinion that all other considerations\r\nmust be subordinated to a pronouncement on the tariff issue. In an\r\narticle on \"The Liberal Outlook\" in _United Australia_, the Hon. Alfred\r\nDeakin writes:--\"By the very circumstances of the case the tariff issue\r\ncannot but dominate the first election, and determine the fate of the\r\nfirst ministry of the Commonwealth. There will be no time for second\r\nthoughts or for suspense of judgment. The first choice of the people\r\nwill be final on this head. The first Parliament must be either\r\nProtectionist or anti-Protectionist, and its first great work an\r\nAustralian tariff. That is the clear-cut issue. The risk is that a\r\nproportion of the representatives may be returned upon other grounds, as\r\nthe electors as a whole may not realize all that is at stake or make the\r\nnecessary sacrifices of opinions and preferences to express themselves\r\nemphatically on this point.\" Now, the only way to avoid the risk\r\nindicated is to take this one definite issue as the basis of\r\nproportional representation. Each State should be divided on it, and\r\nshould elect its proportional number of Freetrade and Protectionist\r\nrepresentatives. Tasmania and Western Australia could conveniently be\r\npolled for this purpose each as one electorate; South Australia might be\r\ndivided into two electorates, Queensland into three, and Victoria and\r\nNew South Wales into four or five.\r\n\r\nIt is very desirable that the first election be contested on definite\r\npolicies advanced by the prospective party leaders; the suggestion that\r\nthe first ministry should be merely a provisional ministry, to act till\r\nthe first responsible ministry is formed after the election, is\r\ntherefore open to serious objection. The leader of the Freetrade party\r\nor the leader of the Protectionist party should be chosen as first\r\nFederal Premier, and the first election should decide which policy is to\r\nbe adopted.\r\n\r\nContrast this scheme with the proposals now under consideration. In\r\nVictoria, New South Wales, and Queensland bills have been introduced\r\ndividing the States into single-membered electorates, and some of the\r\nsmaller States are inclined to use the Block Vote. In Victoria a bad\r\nprecedent has been established by giving the party in power the duty of\r\ndetermining boundaries. From time to time it will be necessary to\r\nrearrange the boundaries, not only on account of movements of population\r\nwithin the State, but also because the number of representatives which\r\nthe State is entitled to will vary. Look forward to the time when the\r\nState becomes entitled to one more representative; every one of the 23\r\nelectorates, in which vested interests will have been created, will have\r\nto be altered These are precisely the conditions which have led to the\r\ngrowth of the gerrymander in the United States.\r\n\r\nAlready the first scheme submitted to the Assembly has been defeated by\r\na combination of country members, who held that Melbourne was allotted a\r\nlarger share of representation than it now has in the local Parliament.\r\nWhatever may be the arguments by which the disparity between the size\r\nof town and country electorates be supported in local affairs, surely\r\nthey cannot apply where national issues only are at stake. The principle\r\nof equal electorates is recognized in the Commonwealth Bill by the rules\r\nfor allotting representation to the States. Why not, then, for the\r\ndivisions of each State? It is said that a larger proportion of the\r\nelectors vote in the town, but it is not those only who vote who are\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nIn dividing a State into electorates for the purpose of the reform, the\r\nnumber of electors in each division should therefore form the basis of\r\nproportional distribution. The unit of representation would be the total\r\nnumber of electors in the State divided by the number of seats. One\r\nrepresentative would be allowed to each division of the State for each\r\nunit of representation, and the remaining seats, if any, would go to\r\nthose divisions with the largest remainders.\r\n\r\nComing now to the Federal Senate, the bill provides that every State,\r\nexcept Queensland, must be polled as one electorate for the election of\r\nsix senators at the first election and in case of a double dissolution;\r\nat intermediate elections three senators only will be elected, as they\r\nretire in rotation. This equal representation of the States might be\r\ntaken to imply that the Senate is intended to represent State rights,\r\nand the provision that each State is to be polled as one electorate\r\nwould seem to support that view. On the other hand, the senators are not\r\nrequired to vote according to States, for it is provided that \"each\r\nsenator shall have one vote;\" the vote of a State may therefore be\r\nneutralized by its representatives. And again, the Senate is to be\r\nelected directly by the people and not by the State legislatures, as at\r\nfirst proposed. To some extent, therefore, the Federal Senate as now\r\nconstituted presents a new problem in representation, on which it is not\r\nadvisable to dogmatize. Personal considerations will probably have more\r\nweight than in the selection of representatives; but when we reflect\r\nthat it is really little more than a revising assembly, elected by the\r\nsame voters as the House of Representatives to deal with the same\r\nquestions, and having no special functions of its own, the conclusion\r\nseems irresistible that the election must be contested by the same\r\nnational parties, and that the same method of election should be\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nUntil the Parliament of the Commonwealth prescribes a uniform method of\r\nchoosing senators, the duty is to be left to the State parliaments; and\r\nit is to be regretted that the States have taken no steps to secure\r\nuniform action at the first election. In Victoria a fierce newspaper\r\ncontest is being waged over the Block Vote and the Hare system, and the\r\narguments, being mutually destructive, only go to prove that both are\r\nequally objectionable. The _Age_ naturally wishes to have the privilege\r\nof electing six senators as it did ten delegates to the Federal\r\nConvention, and contends that the majority should elect all the\r\nsenators; the _Argus_ rushes to the other extreme in declaring that six\r\nseparate minorities ought to be represented, and ignores the risk that\r\nthese minorities would be formed on a class or religious basis. The\r\nmiddle position advocated in this book--namely, that majority and\r\nminority should each return its proportional share of representation--is\r\nfree from the objections to both these extreme views.\r\n\r\n+State Legislatures.+--Even after federation the State Houses will still\r\ncontinue to touch at most points the daily lives of the people; they\r\nwill merely be shorn of some of their powers and drained of some of\r\ntheir best leaders. The fiscal issue, which has had great influence in\r\ndeciding party lines in the past, will be removed from the arena of\r\nstrife, leaving no other than an indefinite line of division into\r\nLiberals and Conservatives, which in practice tends to become a division\r\ninto lower and upper classes. This is the danger ahead; and it can only\r\nbe avoided by the formation of strong party organizations appealing to\r\nall classes to work together for the general welfare. Party government\r\nis just as necessary in State politics as in national politics.\r\n\r\nThe present position is intolerable; the disintegration of parties is so\r\ncomplete that there is not a responsible ministry in Australia worthy of\r\nthe name. Among the causes which have led to this deplorable state of\r\naffairs the present method of election is undoubtedly the most potent;\r\nit frequently happens that four or five candidates, representing as\r\nmany groups, contest a single seat. In Victoria, where the state of\r\nchaos is perhaps worst, the influence of the press, the existence of a\r\nstrong Labour section in the Lower House, and the class character of the\r\nUpper House, representing property and capital, have been the principal\r\ncontributing causes.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of federation a revision of the State constitution is\r\nwidely demanded, and is likely to be conceded. One of the first steps\r\nnecessary to restore harmony must be reform of the Upper House by a\r\ngradual extension of the franchise and a lowering of the qualification,\r\nso as to ensure that elections are freely contested; it is its present\r\nunrepresentative character which gives force to the appeals of the\r\nradical press and intensifies class divisions.\r\n\r\nThe relation of State parties to the national parties is an important\r\nsubject. In the article from which we have already quoted, in _United\r\nAustralia_, Mr. Deakin writes:--\"There cannot be a series of Liberal\r\nparties, one Federal and the others in the States, each going its own\r\nway. There must be but one party, with one programme, to which effect\r\nwill require to be given continuously in both the States and the\r\nCommonwealth.\" He therefore deplores that the Liberal party, together\r\nwith its \"left wing,\" the Labour class, will be split on the fiscal\r\nissue. \"It is this apparently unavoidable rupture in the party,\" he\r\ndeclares, \"which endangers its prospects and presents an opportunity to\r\nthe Conservative classes of either seizing or sharing an authority to\r\nwhich they could not otherwise aspire.\" If this means that the \"Liberal\"\r\nand Labour classes are entitled by reason of their numbers to a\r\nperpetual lease of power in both domains, there can be no more dangerous\r\ndoctrine. Parties should be decided by questions of progress and\r\nfinancial policy, and not on class lines; and since the State and\r\nFederal legislatures have separate spheres of action, parties should be\r\nseparate also, unless, indeed, they are to be founded on corruption, as\r\nin the United States, where the same two parties control not only\r\nnational and State politics, but city government also.\r\n\r\nIn the consolidation of public opinion into two definite lines of policy\r\nbased on the questions to be dealt with lies the only hope, then, of the\r\nprogress of the individual States within their own range; and in\r\npromoting this desirable result the reform advocated in these pages\r\nfinds its true application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Agent of Progress.+--If the analysis made in the preceding pages of\r\nthe principles underlying political representation comes to be regarded\r\nas correct, the science of sociology must be profoundly affected: for it\r\nis a fact that not only the importance but the very existence of the\r\nprinciples involved has been completely missed by speculators in that\r\nfield. The view we have taken is that representation is the most\r\nimportant sociological invention which has been made in the whole\r\nhistory of the human race; that the successive steps taken in the\r\nevolution of the British Constitution mark a series of inventions\r\nscarcely less important, and that the resulting institution of party and\r\nresponsible government is the indispensable agent of democratic\r\nprogress. We have traced throughout the electoral and parliamentary\r\nmachinery on which the institution is based the action of two great\r\nprinciples--organization and responsible leadership--and we have shown\r\nthat these are the mainsprings of the whole mechanism. Yet we find even\r\nsuch an authority as Mr. Herbert Spencer objecting to the party system,\r\non the ground that it lends itself to a one-man or a one-party\r\ntyranny.[9] The fact is that it is only when representative government\r\nis weak, and approaches direct government, that such a result can\r\nhappen, and the distinction is so little recognized that a brief\r\nrecapitulation may be permitted.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental error is in conceiving representation as merely a means\r\nof registering the popular will; many even go so far as to regard it as\r\nan imperfect means of ensuring that each single question will be decided\r\naccording to the will of the majority. All such conceptions really\r\namount to direct government, and where they are given effect to, whether\r\nby the referendum or sectional delegation, society is not organized for\r\nconsistent progress. Indeed, if the lessons of history can be trusted,\r\nsuch a state of society is bound to be wrecked from within by\r\nanti-social influences; political power becomes the object of factious\r\nstrife, and the rule of the majority degenerates into the tyranny of the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nWe have endeavoured to show that the true conception of representative\r\ngovernment involves a recognition of the principles of organization and\r\nleadership, and that representation is in consequence a means not only\r\nof registering the popular will, but also of organizing and guiding it.\r\nIn both cases, therefore, the popular will is the ultimate motive force,\r\nbut in the one case the desires of the people clash, while in the other\r\nthey are directed into channels conducive to the general welfare. We\r\nhave regarded it as an essential condition of representative government\r\nthat the popular will be expressed only as to the direction of progress,\r\nthat is to say on general policy and not on single questions, and that\r\ncomplete control of progress be then left to the representative body. In\r\nno other way can the people be saved from their anti-social tendencies,\r\nand induced to express their opinion as to what is best for all. We have\r\nseen how the electoral machinery is adapted to organize this expression\r\nof the popular will into two alternative directions of progress; how\r\nthis is effected by the fact of two parties competing for the support of\r\nthe people on policies expressing these lines of progress; and how the\r\nparliamentary machinery allows the stronger of these two parties for the\r\ntime being complete control of administration and of the direction of\r\nprogress. The effect of this organization is that the popular will is\r\nreduced to effective action in one direction at a time--a result which\r\nis not possible with direct government.\r\n\r\nNor is the principle of responsible leadership which is involved in the\r\nreciprocal relation of the representative body and the people any less\r\nimportant. Society cannot progress faster than the individual units\r\ncomposing it. True progress lies therefore in raising the standard of\r\npublic opinion, and it is this principle which ensures that result by\r\nreacting upon and moulding individual character. Hence we find that in\r\ncountries like England, where the principle is operative, progress is\r\neffected without supervision and undue interference in the affairs of\r\nthe individual by the State, while in countries where the principle is\r\nnot operative, such as the Continental countries of Europe and some of\r\nthe Australian colonies, the contrary is the case. Legislation should\r\ntherefore be directed to changing the nature of the individual, and\r\nshould not be too far in advance of public opinion. This is what Mr.\r\nLester F. Ward, in his work on \"Outlines of Sociology,\" calls attractive\r\nlegislation. He writes:--\r\n\r\n     The principle involved in attraction, when applied to social\r\n     affairs, is simply that of _inducing_ men to act for the good of\r\n     society. It is that of harmonizing the interests of the individual\r\n     with those of society, of making it advantageous to the individual\r\n     to do that which is socially beneficial; not merely in a negative\r\n     form as an alternative of two evils, as is done when a penalty is\r\n     attached to an action, but positively, in such a manner that he\r\n     will exert himself to do those things that society most needs to\r\n     have done. The sociologist and the statesman should co-operate in\r\n     discovering the laws of society and the methods of utilizing them,\r\n     so as to let the social forces flow freely and strongly,\r\n     untrammelled by penal statutes, mandatory laws, irritating\r\n     prohibitions, and annoying obstacles. (p. 274.)\r\n\r\nNow, we submit that this attractive legislation is possible only when\r\nthere is no oppressed minority, and is therefore the peculiar province\r\nof representative government; for we have shown that the whole machinery\r\nis adapted to induce the people to desire only what is best in the\r\ninterests of society.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly examine the bearing of the view that representative\r\nmachinery is the agent of progress on previous theories of social\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n+Professor Huxley.+--No one has more clearly laid down the conditions of\r\nsocial progress than the late Professor Huxley in his essay on\r\n_Evolution and Ethics_. The gradual strengthening of the social bond by\r\nthe practise of self-restraint in the interests of society he called the\r\nethical process, and he showed that social progress means a checking of\r\nthe cosmic process at every step and the substitution of this ethical\r\nprocess. This action he compares to that of a gardener in clearing a\r\npatch of waste ground. If he relaxes his efforts to maintain the state\r\nof art within the garden, weeds will overrun it and the state of nature\r\nwill return. So the human race is doomed to a constant struggle to\r\nmaintain the state of art of an organized polity in opposition to the\r\nstate of nature; to substitute as far as possible social progress for\r\ncosmic evolution. He says:--\r\n\r\n     Let us understand, once for all, that the ethical progress of\r\n     society depends, not on imitating the cosmic process, still less in\r\n     running away from it, but in combating it. It may seem an audacious\r\n     proposal thus to pit the microcosm against the macrocosm, and to\r\n     set man to subdue nature to his higher ends; but I venture to think\r\n     that the great intellectual difference between the ancient times\r\n     with which we have been occupied and our day, lies in the solid\r\n     foundation we have acquired for the hope that such an enterprise\r\n     may meet with a certain measure of success....[10]\r\n\r\n     Moreover, the cosmic nature born with us, and to a large extent\r\n     necessary for our maintenance, is the outcome of millions of years\r\n     of severe training, and it would be folly to imagine that a few\r\n     centuries will suffice to subdue its masterfulness to purely\r\n     ethical ends. Ethical nature may count upon having to reckon with a\r\n     tenacious and powerful enemy as long as the world lasts. But, on\r\n     the other hand, I see no limit to the extent to which intelligence\r\n     and will, guided by sound principles of investigation, and\r\n     organized in common effort, may modify the conditions of existence\r\n     for a period longer than that now covered by history. And much may\r\n     be done to change the nature of man himself. The intelligence which\r\n     has converted the brother of the wolf into the faithful guardian of\r\n     the flock ought to be able to do something towards curbing the\r\n     instincts of savagery in civilized men.[11]\r\n\r\nBut Huxley never realized that the real cause of the better prospects of\r\nsuccess in modern as contrasted with ancient times is the discovery of\r\nrepresentative machinery. \"The business,\" he declared, \"of the sovereign\r\nauthority--which is, or ought to be, simply a delegation of the people\r\nappointed to act for its good--appears to me to be not only to enforce\r\nthe renunciation of the anti-social desires, but wherever it may be\r\nnecessary to promote the satisfaction of those which are conducive to\r\nprogress.\"[12] There is no conception here of the principles of\r\norganization and responsible leadership, so necessary in constituting\r\nthis \"delegation.\"\r\n\r\n+Herbert Spencer.+--By a great many sociologists it is denied that man\r\nhas his destiny in his own hands, or can by common effort modify the\r\nconditions of existence so as to promote progress. The conception which\r\nis held to justify this view is that there is an exact correspondence\r\nbetween the progress of human society and the growth of an organism.\r\nForemost among those who take this view is Mr. Herbert Spencer. The\r\nclose analogy which the progress of the assumed social organism bears to\r\nthe growth of the physiological organism is worked out in great detail\r\nthroughout the \"Synthetic Philosophy,\" and is taken to establish \"that\r\nBiology and Sociology will more or less interpret each other.\" The\r\npractical conclusion which is drawn is that the growth of society must\r\nnot be interfered with; if the State goes beyond the duty of protection,\r\nit becomes an aggressor. So Mr. Spencer is a most uncompromising\r\nopponent of State action, even education and public sanitation coming in\r\nfor his condemnation. Moreover, he holds that if the social organism be\r\nlet alone it will tend to a future state of society in which social\r\naltruism will be so developed that the individual will voluntarily\r\nsacrifice himself in the interests of society.\r\n\r\nIn an essay on _The Social Organism_ (\"Essays,\" Second Series), he\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n     Strange as the assertion will be thought, our Houses of Parliament\r\n     discharge in the social economy functions that are, in sundry\r\n     respects, comparable to those discharged by the cerebral masses in\r\n     a vertebrate animal.... We may describe the office of the brain as\r\n     that of _averaging_ the interests of life, physical, intellectual,\r\n     moral, social; and a good brain is one in which the desires\r\n     answering to their respective interests are so balanced that the\r\n     conduct they jointly dictate sacrifices none of them. Similarly we\r\n     may describe the office of Parliament as that of _averaging_ the\r\n     interests of the various classes in a community; and a good\r\n     Parliament is one in which the parties answering to these\r\n     respective interests are so balanced that their united legislation\r\n     concedes to each class as much as consists with the claims of the\r\n     rest.\r\n\r\nThe error of regarding society merely as an aggregate is here clearly\r\nshown, for if the \"parties\" in Parliament were based on class\r\ndelegation, as assumed, social progress would be blocked. The only real\r\nfoundation for the resemblance between society and an organism is this:\r\nthat unless the individual units composing society reduce themselves to\r\nunity of action in a definite direction, society as a whole cannot\r\nprogress; or, in other words, that the principles of organization and\r\nleadership are essential to progress. Yet Mr. Spencer denies that there\r\nis any sphere of collective action for the operation of these\r\nprinciples!\r\n\r\n+Benjamin Kidd.+--The \"social organism\" theory is also the foundation of\r\nthe theory of social progress with which Mr. Benjamin Kidd startled the\r\nscientific world a few years ago in \"Social Evolution.\" While\r\nappreciating the importance of the factor of individual reason, he\r\ncontended that self-restraint by the individual in the interests of\r\nsociety is impossible without an ultra-rational sanction; that, in\r\nfact, without this the reason is the most anti-social and\r\nanti-evolutionary of all human qualities. The central fact therefore\r\nwith which we are confronted in our progressive societies is stated as\r\nfollows:--\"_The interests of the social organism and those of the\r\nindividuals comprising it at any particular time are actually\r\nantagonistic; they can never be reconciled; they are inherently and\r\nessentially irreconcilable._\" What becomes of this extraordinary\r\nproposition if it is clearly established that the amount of\r\nreconciliation depends on the extent to which the principles of\r\norganization and responsible leadership are given effect to by\r\nrepresentative machinery?\r\n\r\n+Past Progress.+--The question will naturally be raised: If a\r\nrepresentative body is now the indispensable agent of social progress,\r\nhow can progress previous to the introduction of representation be\r\nexplained? The answer is that the same principles were operative, but in\r\ndifferent forms, more suited to the stage of social development. Indeed,\r\nwe may say that, from the time that man emerged from the brute stage and\r\nbecame a social animal, the types of society which have survived in the\r\nstruggle for existence with the state of nature and with other types\r\nhave been those in which the principles of organization and leadership\r\nhave been most active. Even the lowest types of savages, such as the\r\nnative tribes studied by Professor Baldwin Spencer and Mr. Gillen in\r\nCentral Australia, have a complicated system of organization, the\r\npeculiar feature of which is totemism, or group marriage; but this is\r\nmore the result of development than of conscious effort. Leadership also\r\nis rudimentary, for, although the old men have control of the elaborate\r\nceremonies described, they conform almost entirely to custom and\r\ntradition. Out of this savage stage there grew in favoured countries the\r\nsecond type of human society--the patriarchal, in which leadership\r\nbecomes personal, and centred in a chief who exercises despotic\r\nauthority. Patriarchal society grew out of the necessities of a pastoral\r\nexistence; indeed, it was the discovery of the domestication of animals\r\nwhich gave rise to it. Among other interesting features which were\r\ndeveloped are permanent marriage, slavery, and ancestor worship. There\r\ncan be no doubt that the latter played an important part in binding the\r\ntribe into one organization, and in inducing all the tribe to submit to\r\nthe leadership of the chief. There is a second stage of patriarchal\r\nsociety in which the large tribes break up into clans and become less\r\nnomadic. Professor Jenks has shown, in his \"Short History of Politics,\"\r\nhow this stage originated in the adoption of agriculture. We begin now\r\nto have the village community, bound by the tie of kinship, and\r\nsubmitting to the leadership of a lord; and are already on the threshold\r\nof modern political society, in which all these ancient barriers are\r\nbroken down and the individual becomes the social unit. The cause of\r\nthis momentous change is development of the art of warfare. But before\r\nwe reach the modern State there is an intermediate stage, namely,\r\nfeudalism. The feudal chief is simply the successful warrior--the leader\r\nof a band of adventurers who get control of a definite territory and\r\nexact military allegiance from its inhabitants. Out of the consolidation\r\nof these bands, or by conquest, modern States were founded. Leadership\r\nwas now vested in an irresponsible despot--the king; and the trouble was\r\nto render this new institution permanent, and to induce the people to\r\nsubmit to it. The former result was attained by making the kingship\r\nhereditary, but the latter has always been a difficult task. It is\r\ndoubtful if it would ever have been accomplished but for a significant\r\nalliance--that of Church and State. The convenient fiction of the divine\r\nright of kings was invented, and religion was used to bolster up the\r\ninstitution and to provide a sanction for submission to absolutism. In\r\nother words, irresponsible leadership was tolerated because\r\nresponsibility was supposed to exist to a Higher Power. So we find that\r\nall the great religious movements--Christianity, Mohammedanism, and even\r\nBuddhism--have been associated with the establishment of mighty\r\nkingdoms. Moreover, the only two kingdoms in Europe in which absolutism\r\nstill holds out are Russia and Turkey, in which the head of the State is\r\nalso head of the Church. But military despotism, which was based solely\r\non the exploitation of weaker communities, of which ancient Rome was\r\nthe culminating type, wanted the elements of permanent progress, and was\r\nbound to disappear before a new type which rested on the development of\r\ninternal resources. Militarism must therefore be looked on as a real\r\nstage of progress; for in contrast with patriarchal society it was\r\ncompetitive, and it broke down many ancient barriers, and prepared the\r\nway for industrial co-operation. Thus we arrive at the conditions\r\nfavourable to the rise of representative institutions. For when the cost\r\nof wars had to be raised out of the national resources kings found it\r\nconvenient to get the consent of the people to taxation. Hence the great\r\nmovement throughout Western Europe for the establishment of parliaments\r\nin the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Why is it that in England alone\r\nthis movement was successful? Partly no doubt because its isolated\r\nposition was favourable to internal progress, but mainly because it was\r\nthe only State in which the principles of organization and responsible\r\nleadership were continuously given effect to. So it is that in England\r\nthere was developed that wonderful machinery of representative\r\ngovernment which has enabled the people to substitute responsible for\r\nirresponsible leadership, and has made the national character what it\r\nis. This machinery has now been adopted nearly all over the world,\r\nwherever it has been desired to make the popular will felt, but in no\r\ncase has it sufficed to give effect to the underlying principles to the\r\nsame extent; and success has been attained only in so far as they have\r\nbeen effective. The lesson of the last century has been that the\r\nmachinery which proved sufficient in England, where progress was uniform\r\nthrough several centuries, breaks down when the pace of progress is\r\nincreased. An extreme instance is the recent attempt to introduce party\r\ngovernment into Japan, a country just emerging from the feudal stage, an\r\ninteresting account of which is given in the _Nineteenth Century_ for\r\nJuly, 1899. The experiment failed because the clans could not be divided\r\non questions of political principle. In a greater or less degree that is\r\nthe fundamental source of difficulty everywhere; if the representative\r\nmachinery produces only sectional delegation the tendency is back\r\nthrough anarchy to absolutism. Is it not an extraordinary fact, then,\r\nthat the vital distinction between representation and delegation is so\r\nuniversally ignored?\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief outline of the evolution of human society; however\r\ninadequate it may be, it at least serves to illustrate the truth that\r\nsocial progress has never been made in the past except when the\r\nprinciples of organization and leadership have been operative.\r\n\r\n+Future Progress.+--As to the ultimate tendency of future progress it\r\nwould be pedantry to dogmatize; our task has been the humbler one of\r\npointing out the means by which progress is to be attained. We have\r\nassumed, however, that there is a separate sphere of collective action\r\nin which government is an instrument for the positive amelioration of\r\nsocial conditions. We are aware that this conclusion is at variance with\r\nthe two extreme schools of modern thought; on the one hand, with the\r\nindividualists, who hold that government should only be used for mutual\r\nprotection and to keep order; and on the other hand, with the\r\nsocialists, who would leave nothing to individual action. Professor\r\nHuxley has reduced the claims of these two schools to absurdity and\r\nimpossibility respectively; and we believe that the problem of the\r\nfuture is to find out that middle course between the anarchy of the one\r\nand the despotism of the other which makes for progress. It seems likely\r\nthat the state of society we are approaching will be one in which, while\r\nnatural inequalities will be recognized, neither the artificial\r\ninequalities of fanatical individualism nor the artificial equalities of\r\nregimental socialism will be tolerated, and every man will enter the\r\nrivalry of life on terms of an equality of opportunity. This is the\r\nstate foreshadowed by Mr. Lester Ward in his \"Outlines of Sociology\" and\r\ncalled by him _Sociocracy_. Such ideals, however, serve only to refute\r\nfalse conceptions and offer little practical guidance. What is wanted is\r\na clear recognition of the fact that _progress depends on collective\r\neffort acting through representative machinery, the efficiency of which\r\ndepends on the extent to which the principles of organization and\r\nresponsible leadership are operative._ The question with which\r\ndemocratic countries are faced to-day is this: Must it be acknowledged\r\nthat the people are unfit for self-government, or is the representative\r\nmachinery defective? We have supported the view that the latter is the\r\ncase as regards English-speaking-countries at all events; and we have\r\nshown that in British countries the remedy lies in improved electoral\r\nmachinery, while in the United States both electoral and parliamentary\r\nmachinery are at fault.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] \"Principles of Ethics.\"\r\n\r\n[10] \"Collected Essays,\" vol. ix., p. 83.\r\n\r\n[11] _Ibid._, p. 85.\r\n\r\n[12] \"Collected Essays,\" vol. i., pp. 275-276.",
