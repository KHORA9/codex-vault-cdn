Haynes, of Los Angeles, very generously purchased\r\nfrom the publishers the plates and copyright of this book, in\r\norder to make possible the issuing of this edition. I asked\r\nDr. Haynes if he would let me make acknowledgment to him in\r\nthe book, and he answered: \"Dedicate the book to those unknown\r\nones, who by their dimes and quarters keep the Socialist\r\nmovement going; to the poor and obscure people who sacrifice\r\nthemselves in order to bring about a better world, which they\r\nmay never live to see. Write this as eloquently as you can,\r\nand it will be the best possible dedication to 'The Cry for\r\nJustice'.\"\r\n\r\nI decided, after thinking it over, to combine my own idea with\r\nthe idea of Dr. Haynes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Copyright, 1915, by\r\n                    THE JOHN C. WINSTON CO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction by Jack London\r\n\r\n\r\nThis anthology, I take it, is the first edition, the first\r\ngathering together of the body of the literature and art of the\r\nhumanist thinkers of the world. As well done as it has been\r\ndone, it will be better done in the future. There will be much\r\nadding, there will be a little subtracting, in the succeeding\r\neditions that are bound to come. The result will be a monument\r\nof the ages, and there will be none fairer.\r\n\r\nSince reading of the Bible, the Koran, and the Talmud has\r\nenabled countless devout and earnest right-seeking souls to be\r\nstirred and uplifted to higher and finer planes of thought and\r\naction, then the reading of this humanist Holy Book cannot fail\r\nsimilarly to serve the needs of groping, yearning humans who\r\nseek to discern truth and justice amid the dazzle and murk of\r\nthe thought-chaos of the present-day world.\r\n\r\nNo person, no matter how soft and secluded his own life has\r\nbeen, can read this Holy Book and not be aware that the\r\nworld is filled with a vast mass of unfairness, cruelty, and\r\nsuffering. He will find that it has been observed, during\r\nall the ages, by the thinkers, the seers, the poets, and the\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nAnd such person will learn, possibly, that this fair world\r\nso brutally unfair, is not decreed by the will of God nor by\r\nany iron law of Nature. He will learn that the world can be\r\nfashioned a fair world indeed by the humans who inhabit it, by\r\nthe very simple, and yet most difficult process of coming to\r\nan understanding of the world. Understanding, after all, is\r\nmerely sympathy in its fine correct sense. And such sympathy,\r\nin its genuineness, makes toward unselfishness. Unselfishness\r\ninevitably connotes service. And service is the solution of\r\nthe entire vexatious problem of man.\r\n\r\nHe, who by understanding becomes converted to the gospel of\r\nservice, will serve truth to confute liars and make of them\r\ntruth-tellers; will serve kindness so that brutality will\r\nperish; will serve beauty to the erasement of all that is not\r\nbeautiful. And he who is strong will serve the weak that they\r\nmay become strong. He will devote his strength, not to the\r\ndebasement and defilement of his weaker fellows, but to the\r\nmaking of opportunity for them to make themselves into men\r\nrather than into slaves and beasts.\r\n\r\nOne has but to read the names of the men and women whose\r\nwords burn in these pages, and to recall that by far more\r\nthan average intelligence have they won to their place in\r\nthe world's eye and in the world's brain long after the dust\r\nof them has vanished, to realize that due credence must be\r\nplaced in their report of the world herein recorded. They were\r\nnot tyrants and wastrels, hypocrites and liars, brewers and\r\ngamblers, market-riggers and stock-brokers. They were givers\r\nand servers, and seers and humanists. They were unselfish. They\r\nconceived of life, not in terms of profit, but of service.\r\n\r\nLife tore at them with its heart-break. They could not escape\r\nthe hurt of it by selfish refuge in the gluttonies of brain\r\nand body. They saw, and steeled themselves to see, clear-eyed\r\nand unafraid. Nor were they afflicted by some strange myopia.\r\nThey all saw the same thing. They are all agreed upon what they\r\nsaw. The totality of their evidence proves this with unswerving\r\nconsistency. They have brought the report, these commissioners\r\nof humanity. It is here in these pages. It is a true report.\r\n\r\nBut not merely have they reported the human ills. They have\r\nproposed the remedy. And their remedy is of no part of all\r\nthe jangling sects. It has nothing to do with the complicated\r\nmetaphysical processes by which one may win to other worlds\r\nand imagined gains beyond the sky. It is a remedy for this\r\nworld, since worlds must be taken one at a time. And yet, that\r\nnot even the jangling sects should receive hurt by the making\r\nfairer of this world for this own world's sake, it is well, for\r\nall future worlds of them that need future worlds, that their\r\nsplendor be not tarnished by the vileness and ugliness of this\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt is so simple a remedy, merely service. Not one ignoble\r\nthought or act is demanded of any one of all men and women in\r\nthe world to make fair the world. The call is for nobility of\r\nthinking, nobility of doing. The call is for service, and, such\r\nis the wholesomeness of it, he who serves all, best serves\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nTimes change, and men's minds with them. Down the past,\r\ncivilizations have exposited themselves in terms of power, of\r\nworld-power or of other-world power. No civilization has yet\r\nexposited itself in terms of love-of-man. The humanists have no\r\nquarrel with the previous civilizations. They were necessary\r\nin the development of man. But their purpose is fulfilled, and\r\nthey may well pass, leaving man to build the new and higher\r\ncivilization that will exposit itself in terms of love and\r\nservice and brotherhood.\r\n\r\nTo see gathered here together this great body of human beauty\r\nand fineness and nobleness is to realize what glorious humans\r\nhave already existed, do exist, and will continue increasingly\r\nto exist until all the world beautiful be made over in their\r\nimage. We know how gods are made. Comes now the time to make a\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n HONOLULU, March 6, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\r\n\r\nThe editor has used his best efforts to ascertain what material\r\nin the present volume is protected by copyright.

There exist small collections of Socialist songs\r\nfor singing, but apparently this is the first effort that has\r\nbeen made to cover the whole field of the literature of social\r\nprotest, both in prose and poetry, and from all languages and\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe reader's first inquiry will be as to the qualifications of\r\nthe editor. Let me say that I gave nine years of my life to a\r\nstudy of literature under academic guidance, and then, emerging\r\nfrom a great endowed university, discovered the modern movement\r\nof proletarian revolt, and have given fifteen years to the\r\nstudy and interpretation of that. The present volume is thus\r\na blending of two points of view. I have reread the favorites\r\nof my youth, choosing from them what now seemed most vital;\r\nand I have sought to test the writers of my own time by the\r\ntouchstone of the old standards.\r\n\r\nThe size of the task I did not realize until I had gone too\r\nfar to retreat. It meant not merely the rereading of the\r\nclassics and the standard anthologies; it meant going through a\r\nsmall library of volumes by living writers, the files of many\r\nmagazines, and a dozen or more scrap-books and collections of\r\nfugitive verse. At the end of this labor I found myself with\r\na pile of typewritten manuscript a foot high; and the task of\r\nelimination was the most difficult of all.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent, of course, the selection was\r\nself-determined. No anthology of social protest could omit\r\n\"The Song of the Shirt,\" and \"The Cry of the Children,\"\r\nand \"A Man's a Man for A' That\"; neither could it omit the\r\n\"Marseillaise\" and the \"Internationale.\" Equally inevitable\r\nwere selections from Shelley and Swinburne, Ruskin, Carlyle\r\nand Morris, Whitman, Tolstoy and Zola. The same was true of\r\nWells and Shaw and Kropotkin, Hauptmann and Maeterlinck, Romain\r\nRolland and Anatole France. When it came to the newer writers,\r\nI sought first their own judgment as to their best work; and\r\nlater I submitted the manuscript to several friends, the best\r\nqualified men and women I knew. Thus the final version was the\r\nproduct of a number of minds; and the collection may be said\r\nto represent, not its editor, but a whole movement, made and\r\nsustained by the master-spirits of all ages.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I may without suspicion of egotism say what I\r\nthink about the volume. It was significant to me that several\r\npersons reading the manuscript and writing quite independently,\r\nreferred to it as \"a new Bible.\" I believe that it is, quite\r\nliterally and simply, what the old Bible was--a selection\r\nby the living minds of a living time of the best and truest\r\nwritings known to them. It is a Bible of the future, a Gospel\r\nof the new hope of the race. It is a book for the apostles of a\r\nnew dispensation to carry about with them; a book to cheer the\r\ndiscouraged and console the wounded in humanity's last war of\r\nliberation.\r\n\r\nThe standards of the book are those of literature. If there has\r\nbeen any letting down, it has been in the case of old writings,\r\nwhich have an interest apart from that of style. It brings us\r\na thrill of wonder to find, in an ancient Egyptian parchment,\r\na father setting forth to his son how easy is the life of the\r\nlawyer, and what a dog's life is that of the farmer. It amuses\r\nus to read a play, produced in Athens two thousand, two hundred\r\nand twenty-three years ago, in which is elaborately propounded\r\nthe question which thousands of Socialist \"soap-boxers\" are\r\nanswering every night: \"Who will do the dirty work?\" It makes\r\nus shudder, perhaps, to find a Spaniard of the thirteenth\r\ncentury analyzing the evil devices of tyrants, and expounding\r\nin detail the labor-policy of some present-day great\r\ncorporations in America.\r\n\r\nLet me add that I have not considered it my function to act\r\nas censor to the process of social evolution. Every aspect of\r\nthe revolutionary movement has found a voice in this book.\r\nTwo questions have been asked of each writer: Have you had\r\nsomething vital to say? and Have you said it with some special\r\neffectiveness? The reader will find, for example, one or two\r\nof the hymns of the \"Christian Socialists\"; he will also find\r\none of the parodies on Christian hymns which are sung by the\r\nIndustrial Workers of the World in their \"jungles\" in the Far\r\nWest. The Anarchists and the apostles of insurrection are also\r\nrepresented; and if some of the things seem to the reader the\r\nmere unchaining of furies, I would say, let him not blame the\r\nfaithful anthologist, let him not blame even the writer--let\r\nhim blame himself, who has acquiesced in the existence of\r\nconditions which have driven his fellow-men to the extremes of\r\nmadness and despair.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this work I have placed myself under\r\nobligation to so many people that it would take much space to\r\nmake complete acknowledgments. I must thank those friends who\r\nwent through the bulky manuscript, and gave me the benefit of\r\ntheir detailed criticism: George Sterling, Max Eastman, Floyd\r\nDell, Clement Wood, Louis Untermeyer, and my wife. I am under\r\nobligation to a number of people, some of them strangers, who\r\nwent to the trouble of sending me scrap-books which represented\r\nyears and even decades of collecting: Elizabeth Balch,\r\nElizabeth Magie Phillips, Frank B. Norman, Frank Stuhlman, J.\r\nM. Maddox, Edward J. O'Brien, and Clement Wood. Among those\r\nwho helped me with valuable suggestions were: Edwin Björkman,\r\nReginald Wright Kauffman, Thomas Seltzer, Jack London, Rose\r\nPastor Stokes, May Beals, Elizabeth Freeman, Arthur W.\r\nCalhoun, Frank Shay, Alexander Berkman, Joseph F. Gould, Louis\r\nUntermeyer, Harold Monro, Morris Hillquit, Peter Kropotkin, Dr.\r\nJames P. Warbasse, and the Baroness von Blomberg. The fullness\r\nof the section devoted to ancient writings is in part due to\r\nthe advice of a number of scholars: Dr. Paul Carus, Professor\r\nCrawford H. Toy, Professor William Cranston Lawton, Professor\r\nCharles Burton Gulick, Professor Thomas D. Goodell, Professor\r\nWalton Brooks McDaniels, Rev. John Haynes Holmes, Professor\r\nGeorge F. Moore, Prof. Walter Rauschenbusch, and Professor\r\nCharles R. Lanman.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the illustrations in the volume, I endeavored\r\nto repeat in the field of art what had been done in the field\r\nof literature: to obtain the best material, both old and new,\r\nand select the most interesting and vital. I have to record\r\nmy indebtedness to a number of friends who made suggestions\r\nin this field--Ryan Walker, Art Young, John Mowbray-Clarke,\r\nMartin Birnbaum, Odon Por, and Walter Crane. Also I must thank\r\nMr. Frank Weitenkampf and Dr. Herman Rosenthal of the New\r\nYork Public Library, and Dr. Clifford of the Library of the\r\nMetropolitan Museum of Art. To the artists whose copyrighted\r\nwork I have used I owe my thanks for their permission: as\r\nlikewise to the many writers whose copyrighted books I have\r\nquoted. Elsewhere in the volume I have made acknowledgments to\r\npublishers for the rights they have kindly granted. Let me here\r\nadd this general caution: _The copyrighted passages used have\r\nbeen used by permission, and any one who desires to reprint\r\nthem must obtain similar permission._\r\n\r\nOne or two hundred contemporary authors responded to my\r\ninvitation and sent me specimens of their writings. Of these\r\nauthors, probably three-fourths will not find their work\r\nincluded--for which seeming discourtesy I can only offer the\r\nsincere plea of the limitations of space which were imposed\r\nupon me. I am not being diplomatic, but am stating a fact\r\nwhen I say that I had to leave out much that I thought was of\r\nexcellent quality.\r\n\r\nWhat was chosen will now speak for itself. Let my last word be\r\nof the hope, which has been with me constantly, that the book\r\nmay be to others what it has been to me. I have spent with\r\nit the happiest year of my lifetime: the happiest, because\r\noccupied with beauty of the greatest and truest sort. If the\r\nmaterial in this volume means to you, the reader, what it has\r\nmeant to me, you will live with it, love it, sometimes weep\r\nwith it, many times pray with it, yearn and hunger with it,\r\nand, above all, resolve with it. You will carry it with you\r\nabout your daily tasks, you will be utterly possessed by it;\r\nand again and again you will be led to dedicate yourself to the\r\ngreatest hope, the most wondrous vision which has ever thrilled\r\nthe soul of humanity. In this spirit and to this end the book\r\nis offered to you. If you will read it through consecutively,\r\nskipping nothing, you will find that it has a form. You will\r\nbe led from one passage to the next, and when you reach the\r\nend you will be a wiser, a humbler, and a more tender-hearted\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Consecration\r\n\r\nBY JOHN MASEFIELD\r\n\r\n\r\n    Not of the princes and prelates with periwigged charioteers\r\n    Riding triumphantly laurelled to lap the fat of the years,\r\n    Rather the scorned--the rejected--the men hemmed in with the spears;\r\n\r\n    The men of the tattered battalion which fights till it dies,\r\n    Dazed with the dust of the battle, the din and the cries,\r\n    The men with the broken heads and the blood running into their eyes.\r\n\r\n    Not the be-medalled Commander, beloved of the throne,\r\n    Riding cock-horse to parade when the bugles are blown,\r\n    But the lads who carried the koppie and cannot be known.\r\n\r\n    Not the ruler for me, but the ranker, the tramp of the road,\r\n    The slave with the sack on his shoulders pricked on with the goad,\r\n    The man with too weighty a burden, too weary a load.\r\n\r\n    The sailor, the stoker of steamers, the man with the clout,\r\n    The chantyman bent at the halliards putting a tune to the shout,\r\n    The drowsy man at the wheel and the tired lookout.\r\n\r\n    Others may sing of the wine and the wealth and the mirth,\r\n    The portly presence of potentates goodly in girth;--\r\n    Mine be the dirt and the dross, the dust and scum of the earth!\r\n\r\n    Theirs be the music, the color, the glory, the gold;\r\n    Mine be a handful of ashes, a mouthful of mould.\r\n    Of the maimed, of the halt and the blind in the rain and the cold--\r\n\r\n    Of these shall my songs be fashioned, my tale be told.\r\n                                                    AMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\n_Toil_\r\n\r\nThe dignity and tragedy of labor; pictures of the actual\r\nconditions under which men and women work in mills and\r\nfactories, fields and mines.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man With the Hoe[A]\r\n\r\n[A] By permission of Doubleday, Page & Co.\r\n\r\nBY EDWIN MARKHAM\r\n\r\n (This poem, which was written after seeing Millet's world-famous\r\n painting, was published in 1899 by a California school-principal, and\r\n made a profound impression.

Never was such a\r\nlong winter.\r\n\r\nOne morning a laboring man came to the door with a spade,\r\nand asked if he could dig the garden, or try to, at the risk\r\nof breaking the tool in the ground. He was starving; he had\r\nhad no work for six months, he said, since the first frost\r\nstarted the winter. Nature and the earth and the gods did not\r\ntrouble about him, you see. Another aged man came once a week\r\nregularly; white as the snow through which he walked. In summer\r\nhe worked; since the winter began he had had no employment, but\r\nsupported himself by going round to the farms in rotation. He\r\nhad no home of any kind. Why did he not go into the workhouse?\r\n\"I be afeared if I goes in there they'll put me with the rough\r\n'uns, and very likely I should get some of my clothes stole.\"\r\nRather than go into the workhouse, he would totter round in\r\nthe face of the blasts that might cover his weak old limbs\r\nwith drift. There was a sense of dignity and manhood left\r\nstill; his clothes were worn, but clean and decent; he was\r\nno companion of rogues; the snow and frost, the straw of the\r\nouthouses, was better than that. He was struggling against age,\r\nagainst nature, against circumstances; the entire weight of\r\nsociety, law and order pressed upon him to force him to lose\r\nhis self-respect and liberty. He would rather risk his life in\r\nthe snow-drift. Nature, earth and the gods did not help him;\r\nsun and stars, where were they? He knocked at the doors of the\r\nfarms and found good in man only--not in Law or Order, but in\r\nindividual man alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarm Laborers\r\n\r\nBY JAMES MATTHEW BARRIE\r\n\r\n(English poet, playwright and novelist, born 1860)\r\n\r\nGrand, patient, long-suffering fellows these men were, up at\r\nfive, summer and winter, foddering their horses, maybe, hours\r\nbefore there would be food for themselves, miserably paid,\r\nhoused like cattle, and when rheumatism seized them, liable\r\nto be flung aside like a broken graip. As hard was the life\r\nof the women: coarse food, chaff beds, damp clothes their\r\nportion, their sweethearts in the service of masters who were\r\nloath to fee a married man. Is it to be wondered that these\r\nlads who could be faithful unto death drank soddenly on their\r\none free day; that these girls, starved of opportunities for\r\nwomanliness, of which they could make as much as the finest\r\nlady, sometimes woke after a holiday to wish that they might\r\nwake no more?\r\n\r\n\r\nHelotage\r\n\r\n(_From \"Sartor Resartus\"_)\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS CARLYLE\r\n\r\n(One of the most famous of British essayists, 1795-1881;\r\nhistorian of the French Revolution, and master of a vivid and\r\npicturesque prose-style)\r\n\r\nIt is not because of his toils that I lament for the poor: we\r\nmust all toil, or steal (howsoever we name our stealing), which\r\nis worse; no faithful workman finds his task a pastime. The\r\npoor is hungry and athirst; but for him also there is food\r\nand drink: he is heavy-laden and weary; but for him also the\r\nHeavens send sleep, and of the deepest; in his smoky cribs, a\r\nclear dewy haven of rest envelops him, and fitful glitterings\r\nof cloud-skirted dreams. But what I do mourn over is, that\r\nthe lamp of his soul should go out; that no ray of heavenly,\r\nor even of earthly, knowledge should visit him; but only, in\r\nthe haggard darkness, like two spectres, Fear and Indignation\r\nbear him company. Alas, while the body stands so broad and\r\nbrawny, must the soul lie blinded, dwarfed, stupefied, almost\r\nannihilated!, Alas, was this too a Breath of God; bestowed in\r\nheaven, but on earth never to be unfolded!--That there should\r\none Man die ignorant who had capacity for Knowledge, this I\r\ncall a tragedy, were it to happen more than twenty times in the\r\nminute, as by some computations it does.

Born 1873, his narrative\r\n poems of humble life made him famous almost over night)\r\n\r\n    Then came the cry of \"Call all hands on deck!\"\r\n    The Dauber knew its meaning; it was come:\r\n    Cape Horn, that tramples beauty into wreck,\r\n    And crumples steel and smites the strong man dumb.\r\n    Down clattered flying kites and staysails: some\r\n    Sang out in quick, high calls: the fair-leads skirled,\r\n    And from the south-west came the end of the world....\r\n\r\n    \"Lay out!\" the Bosun yelled. The Dauber laid\r\n    Out on the yard, gripping the yard, and feeling\r\n    Sick at the mighty space of air displayed\r\n    Below his feet, where mewing birds were wheeling.\r\n    A giddy fear was on him; he was reeling.\r\n    He bit his lip half through, clutching the jack.\r\n    A cold sweat glued the shirt upon his back.\r\n\r\n    The yard was shaking, for a brace was loose.\r\n    He felt that he would fall; he clutched, he bent,\r\n    Clammy with natural terror to the shoes\r\n    While idiotic promptings came and went.\r\n    Snow fluttered on a wind-flaw and was spent;\r\n    He saw the water darken. Someone yelled,\r\n    \"Frap it; don't stay to furl! Hold on!\" He held.\r\n\r\n    Darkness came down--half darkness--in a whirl;\r\n    The sky went out, the waters disappeared.\r\n    He felt a shocking pressure of blowing hurl\r\n    The ship upon her side. The darkness speared\r\n    At her with wind; she staggered, she careered,\r\n    Then down she lay. The Dauber felt her go;\r\n    He saw her yard tilt downwards. Then the snow\r\n\r\n    Whirled all about--dense, multitudinous, cold--\r\n    Mixed with the wind's one devilish thrust and shriek,\r\n    Which whiffled out men's tears, defeated, took hold,\r\n    Flattening the flying drift against the cheek.\r\n    The yards buckled and bent, man could not speak.\r\n    The ship lay on her broadside; the wind's sound\r\n    Had devilish malice at having got her downed....\r\n\r\n    How long the gale had blown he could not tell,\r\n    Only the world had changed, his life had died.\r\n    A moment now was everlasting hell.\r\n    Nature an onslaught from the weather side,\r\n    A withering rush of death, a frost that cried,\r\n    Shrieked, till he withered at the heart; a hail\r\n    Plastered his oilskins with an icy mail....\r\n\r\n    \"Up!\" yelled the Bosun; \"up and clear the wreck!\"\r\n    The Dauber followed where he led; below\r\n    He caught one giddy glimpsing of the deck\r\n    Filled with white water, as though heaped with snow.\r\n    He saw the streamers of the rigging blow\r\n    Straight out like pennons from the splintered mast,\r\n    Then, all sense dimmed, all was an icy blast\r\n\r\n    Roaring from nether hell and filled with ice,\r\n    Roaring and crashing on the jerking stage,\r\n    An utter bridle given to utter vice,\r\n    Limitless power mad with endless rage\r\n    Withering the soul; a minute seemed an age.\r\n    He clutched and hacked at ropes, at rags of sail,\r\n    Thinking that comfort was a fairy-tale\r\n\r\n    Told long ago--long, long ago--long since\r\n    Heard of in other lives--imagined, dreamed--\r\n    There where the basest beggar was a prince.\r\n    To him in torment where the tempest screamed,\r\n    Comfort and warmth and ease no longer seemed\r\n    Things that a man could know; soul, body, brain,\r\n    Knew nothing but the wind, the cold, the pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsouciance in Storm\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Cry of Youth\"_)\r\n\r\nBY HARRY KEMP\r\n\r\n(A young American poet who has wandered over the world as\r\nsailor, harvest hand and tramp; born 1883)\r\n\r\n    Deep in an ore-boat's hold\r\n      Where great-bulked boilers loom\r\n    And yawning mouths of fire\r\n      Irradiate the gloom,\r\n\r\n    I saw half-naked men\r\n      Made thralls to flame and steam,\r\n    Whose bodies, dripping sweat,\r\n      Shone with an oily gleam.\r\n\r\n    There, all the sullen night,\r\n      While waves boomed overhead\r\n    And smote the lurching ship,\r\n      The ravenous fires they fed;\r\n\r\n    They did not think it brave:\r\n      They even dared to joke!\r\n    I saw them light their pipes\r\n      And puff calm rings of smoke!\r\n\r\n    I saw a Passer sprawl\r\n      Over his load of coal--\r\n    At which a Fireman laughed\r\n      Until it shook his soul:\r\n\r\n    _All this in a hollow shell\r\n      Whose half-submerged form\r\n    On Lake Superior tossed\r\n      'Mid rushing hills of storm!_\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE SAILORS' CATECHISM\r\n\r\n    Six days shalt thou labor and do all thou art able,\r\n    The seventh, holystone the deck and scrub the cable.\r\n\r\n\r\nStokers[A]\r\n\r\n[A] By permission of the Macmillan Co.\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Harbor\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ERNEST POOLE\r\n\r\n(American playwright and novelist, born 1880)\r\n\r\nWe crawled down a short ladder and through low passageways,\r\ndripping wet, and so came into the stokehole.\r\n\r\nThis was a long narrow chamber with a row of glowing furnace\r\ndoors. Wet coal and coal-dust lay on the floor. At either end a\r\nsmall steel door opened into bunkers that ran along the sides\r\nof the ship, deep down near the bottom, containing thousands of\r\ntons of soft coal. In the stokehole the fires were not yet up,\r\nbut by the time the ship was at sea the furnace mouths would\r\nbe white hot and the men at work half naked. They not only\r\nshovelled coal into the flames, they had to spread it as well,\r\nand at intervals rake out the \"clinkers\" in fiery masses on the\r\nfloor. On these a stream of water played, filling the chamber\r\nwith clouds of steam. In older ships, like this one, a \"lead\r\nstoker\" stood at the head of the line and set the pace for the\r\nothers to follow. He was paid more to keep up the pace. But on\r\nthe big new liners this pacer was replaced by a gong.\r\n\r\n\"And at each stroke of the gong you shovel,\" said Joe. \"You do\r\nthis till you forget your name. Every time the boat pitches the\r\nfloor heaves you forward, the fire spurts at you out of the\r\ndoors, and the gong keeps on like a sledge-hammer coming down\r\non top of your mind. And all you think of is your bunk and the\r\ntime when you're to tumble in.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the stokers' quarters presently there came a burst of\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\n\"Now let's go back,\" he ended, \"and see how they're getting\r\nready for this.\"\r\n\r\nAs we crawled back, the noise increased, and swelled to a roar\r\nas we entered. The place was pandemonium. Those groups I had\r\nnoticed around the bags had been getting out the liquor, and\r\nnow at eight o'clock in the morning half the crew were already\r\nwell soused. Some moved restlessly about. One huge bull of\r\na creature with limpid shining eyes stopped suddenly with a\r\npuzzled stare, and then leaned back on a bunk and laughed\r\nuproariously. From there he lurched over the shoulder of a\r\nthin, wiry, sober man who, sitting on the edge of a bunk, was\r\nslowly spelling out the words of a newspaper aeroplane story.\r\nThe big man laughed again and spit, and the thin man jumped\r\nhalf up and snarled.\r\n\r\nLouder rose the singing. Half the crew was crowded close around\r\na little red-faced cockney. He was the modern \"chanty man.\"\r\nWith sweat pouring down his cheeks and the muscles of his neck\r\ndrawn taut, he was jerking out verse after verse about women.\r\nHe sang to an old \"chanty\" tune, one that I remembered well.\r\nBut he was not singing out under the stars, he was screaming at\r\nsteel walls down here in the bottom of the ship. And although\r\nhe kept speeding up his song, the crowd were too drunk to wait\r\nfor the chorus; their voices kept tumbling in over his, and\r\nsoon it was only a frenzy of sound, a roar with yells rising\r\nout of it. The singers kept pounding each other's backs or\r\nwaving bottles over their heads. Two bottles smashed together\r\nand brought a still higher burst of glee.\r\n\r\n\"I'm tired!\" Joe shouted. \"Let's get out!\"\r\n\r\nI caught a glimpse of his strained frowning face. Again it came\r\nover me in a flash, the years he had spent in holes like this,\r\nin this hideous rotten world of his, while I had lived joyously\r\nin mine. And as though he had read the thought in my disturbed\r\nand troubled eyes, \"Let's go up where _you_ belong,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI followed him up and away from his friends. As we climbed\r\nladder after ladder, fainter and fainter on our ears rose that\r\nyelling from below. Suddenly we came out on deck and slammed an\r\niron door behind us. And I was where _I_ belonged.\r\n\r\nI was in dazzling sunshine and keen, frosty autumn air. I\r\nwas among gay throngs of people. Dainty women brushed me by.\r\nI felt the softness of their furs, I breathed the fragrant\r\nscent of them and of the flowers that they wore, I saw their\r\ntrim, fresh, immaculate clothes. I heard the joyous tumult of\r\ntheir talking and their laughing to the regular crash of the\r\nband--all the life of the ship I had known so well.\r\n\r\nAnd I walked through it all as though in a dream. On the dock\r\nI watched it spell-bound--until with handkerchiefs waving and\r\nvoices calling down good-byes, that throng of happy travellers\r\nmoved slowly out into midstream.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew that deep below all this, down in the bottom of the\r\nship, the stokers were still singing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaliban in the Coal Mines\r\n\r\n(_From \"Challenge\"_)\r\n\r\nBY LOUIS UNTERMEYER\r\n\r\n(American poet, born 1885)\r\n\r\n    God, we don't like to complain--\r\n      We know that the mine is no lark--\r\n    But--there's the pools from the rain;\r\n      But--there's the cold and the dark.\r\n\r\n    God, You don't know what it is--\r\n      You, in Your well-lighted sky,\r\n    Watching the meteors whizz;\r\n      Warm, with the sun always by.\r\n\r\n    God, if You had but the moon\r\n      Stuck in Your cap for a lamp,\r\n    Even You'd tire of it soon,\r\n      Down in the dark and the damp.\r\n\r\n    Nothing but blackness above,\r\n      And nothing that moves but the cars--\r\n    God, if You wish for our love,\r\n      Fling us a handful of stars!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fertilizer Man\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Jungle\"_)\r\n\r\nBY UPTON SINCLAIR\r\n\r\n(A novel portraying the lives of the workers in the Chicago\r\nstockyards; published in 1906)\r\n\r\nHis labor took him about one minute to learn. Before him was\r\none of the vents of the mill in which the fertilizer was being\r\nground--rushing forth in a great brown river, with a spray of\r\nthe finest dust floating forth in clouds. Jurgis was given a\r\nshovel, and along with half a dozen others it was his task to\r\nshovel this fertilizer into carts. That others were at work he\r\nknew by the sound, and by the fact that he sometimes collided\r\nwith them; otherwise they might as well not have been there,\r\nfor in the blinding dust-storm a man could not see six feet in\r\nfront of his face. When he had filled one cart he had to grope\r\naround him until another came, and if there was none on hand he\r\ncontinued to grope till one arrived. In five minutes he was,\r\nof course, a mass of fertilizer from head to feet; they gave\r\nhim a sponge to tie over his mouth, so that he could breathe,\r\nbut the sponge did not prevent his lips and eyelids from caking\r\nup with it and his ears from filling solid. He looked like a\r\nbrown ghost at twilight--from hair to shoes he became the color\r\nof the building and of everything in it, and for that matter\r\na hundred yards outside it. The building had to be left open,\r\nand when the wind blew Durham and Company lost a great deal of\r\nfertilizer.\r\n\r\nWorking in his shirt-sleeves, and with the thermometer at over\r\na hundred, the phosphates soaked in through every pore of\r\nJurgis' skin, and in five minutes he had a headache, and in\r\nfifteen was almost dazed. The blood was pounding in his brain\r\nlike an engine's throbbing; there was a frightful pain in\r\nthe top of his skull, and he could hardly control his hands.\r\nStill, with the memory of his four jobless months behind him,\r\nhe fought on, in a frenzy of determination; and half an hour\r\nlater he began to vomit--he vomited until it seemed as if his\r\ninwards must be torn into shreds. A man could get used to the\r\nfertilizer-mill, the boss had said, if he would only make up\r\nhis mind to it; but Jurgis now began to see that it was a\r\nquestion of making up his stomach.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that day of horror, he could scarcely stand. He\r\nhad to catch himself now and then, and lean against a building\r\nand get his bearings. Most of the men, when they came out,\r\nmade straight for a saloon--they seemed to place fertilizer\r\nand rattlesnake poison in one class. But Jurgis was too ill to\r\nthink of drinking--he could only make his way to the street\r\nand stagger on to a car. He had a sense of humor, and later\r\non, when he became an old hand, he used to think it fun to\r\nboard a street-car and see what happened. Now, however, he was\r\ntoo ill to notice it--how the people in the car began to gasp\r\nand sputter, to put their handkerchiefs to their noses, and\r\ntransfix him with furious glances. Jurgis only knew that a man\r\nin front of him immediately got up and gave him a seat; and\r\nthat half a minute later the two people on each side of him\r\ngot up; and that in a full minute the crowded car was nearly\r\nempty--those passengers who could not get room on the platform\r\nhaving gotten out to walk.\r\n\r\nOf course Jurgis had made his home a miniature fertilizer-mill\r\na minute after entering. The stuff was half an inch deep in his\r\nskin--his whole system was full of it, and it would have taken\r\na week not merely of scrubbing, but of vigorous exercise, to\r\nget it out of him. As it was, he could be compared with nothing\r\nknown to man, save that newest discovery of the savants, a\r\nsubstance which emits energy for an unlimited time, without\r\nbeing itself in the least diminished in power. He smelt so that\r\nhe made all the food at the table taste, and set the whole\r\nfamily to vomiting; for himself it was three days before he\r\ncould keep anything upon his stomach--he might wash his hands,\r\nand use a knife and fork, but were not his mouth and throat\r\nfilled with the poison?\r\n\r\nAnd still Jurgis stuck it out! In spite of splitting headaches\r\nhe would stagger down to the plant and take up his stand once\r\nmore, and begin to shovel in the blinding clouds of dust. And\r\nso at the end of the week he was a fertilizer-man for life--he\r\nwas able to eat again, and though his head never stopped\r\naching, it ceased to be so bad that he could not work.\r\n\r\n\r\nPittsburgh\r\n\r\nBY JAMES OPPENHEIM\r\n\r\n(American poet and novelist; born 1882)\r\n\r\n    Over his face his gray hair drifting hides his Labor-glory in smoke,\r\n    Strange through his breath the soot is sifting, his feet are buried\r\n  in coal and coke.\r\n    By night hands twisted and lurid in fires, by day hands blackened\r\n  with grime and oil,\r\n    He toils at the foundries and never tires, and ever and ever his\r\n  lot is toil.\r\n\r\n    He speeds his soul till his body wrestles with terrible tonnage\r\nand terrible time,\r\n    Out through the yards and over the trestles the flat-cars clank\r\nand the engines chime,\r\n    His mills through windows seem eaten with fire, his high cranes\r\ntravel, his ingots roll,\r\n    And billet and wheel and whistle and wire shriek with the\r\nspeeding up of his soul.\r\n\r\n    Lanterns with reds and greens a-glisten wave the way and the\r\nhead-light glares,\r\n    The back-bent laborers glance and listen and out through the\r\nnight the tail-light flares--\r\n    Deep in the mills like a tipping cradle the huge converter\r\nturns on its wheel\r\n    And sizzling spills in the ten-ton ladle a golden water of\r\nmolten steel.\r\n\r\n    Yet screwed with toil his low face searches shadow-edged fires\r\nand whited pits,\r\n    Gripping his levers his body lurches, grappling his irons he\r\nprods and hits,\r\n    And deaf with the roll and clangor and rattle with its sharp\r\nescaping staccato of steam,\r\n    And blind with flame and worn with battle, into his tonnage he\r\nturns his dream.\r\n\r\n    The world he has builded rises around us, our wonder-cities and\r\nweaving rails,\r\n    Over his wires a marvel has found us, a glory rides in our\r\nwheeled mails,\r\n    For the Earth grows small with strong Steel woven, and they\r\ncome together who plotted apart--\r\n    But he who has wrought this thing in his oven knows only toil\r\nand the tired heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Navvy[A]\r\n\r\n[A] By permission of E. P. Dutton & Co.\r\n\r\n(_From \"Children of the Dead End\"_)\r\n\r\nBY PATRICK MACGILL\r\n\r\n(See page 32)\r\n\r\nAt that time there were thousands of navvies working at\r\nKinlochleven waterworks. We spoke of waterworks, but only the\r\ncontractors knew what the work was intended for. We did not\r\nknow, and we did not care. We never asked questions concerning\r\nthe ultimate issue of our labors, and we were not supposed to\r\nask questions. If a man throws red muck over a wall today and\r\nthrows it back again tomorrow, what the devil is it to him if\r\nhe keeps throwing that same muck over the wall for the rest\r\nof his life, knowing not why nor wherefore, provided he gets\r\npaid sixpence an hour for his labor? There were so many tons\r\nof earth to be lifted and thrown somewhere else; we lifted\r\nthem and threw them somewhere else; so many cubic yards of\r\niron-hard rocks to be blasted and carried away; we blasted and\r\ncarried them away, but never asked questions and never knew\r\nwhat results we were laboring to bring about. We turned the\r\nHighlands into a cinder-heap, and were as wise at the beginning\r\nas at the end of the task. Only when we completed the job, and\r\nreturned to the town, did we learn from the newspapers that we\r\nhad been employed on the construction of the biggest aluminium\r\nfactory in the kingdom. All that we knew was that we had gutted\r\nwhole mountains and hills in the operations....\r\n\r\nAbove and over all, the mystery of the night and the desert\r\nplaces hovered inscrutable and implacable. All around the\r\nancient mountains sat like brooding witches, dreaming on their\r\nown story of which they knew neither the beginning nor the end.\r\nNaked to the four winds of heaven and all the rains of the\r\nworld, they had stood there for countless ages in all their\r\nsinister strength, undefied and unconquered, until man, with\r\npuny hands and little tools of labor, came to break the spirit\r\nof their ancient mightiness.\r\n\r\nAnd we, the men who braved this task, were outcasts of the\r\nworld. A blind fate, a vast merciless mechanism, cut and shaped\r\nthe fabric of our existence. We were men despised when we were\r\nmost useful, rejected when we were not needed, and forgotten\r\nwhen our troubles weighed upon us heavily. We were the men\r\nsent out to fight the spirit of the wastes, rob it of all its\r\nprimeval horrors, and batter down the barriers of its world-old\r\ndefences. Where we were working a new town would spring up some\r\nday; it was already springing up, and then, if one of us walked\r\nthere, \"a man with no fixed address,\" he would be taken up and\r\ntried as a loiterer and vagrant.\r\n\r\nEven as I thought of these things a shoulder of jagged rock\r\nfell into a cutting far below. There was the sound of a scream\r\nin the distance, and a song died away in the throat of some\r\nrude singer. Then out of the pit I saw men, red with the muck\r\nof the deep earth and redder still with the blood of a stricken\r\nmate, come forth, bearing between them a silent figure. Another\r\nof the pioneers of civilization had given up his life for the\r\nsake of society....\r\n\r\nThe plaintive sunset waned into a sickly haze one evening, and\r\nwhen the night slipped upwards to the mountain peaks never a\r\nstar came out into the vastness of the high heavens. Next\r\nmorning we had to thaw the door of our shack out of the muck\r\ninto which it was frozen during the night. Outside the snow\r\nhad fallen heavily on the ground, and the virgin granaries of\r\nwinter had been emptied on the face of the world.\r\n\r\nUnkempt, ragged, and dispirited, we slunk to our toil, the\r\nsnow falling on our shoulders and forcing its way insistently\r\nthrough our worn and battered bluchers. The cuttings were full\r\nof slush to the brim, and we had to grope through them with our\r\nhands until we found the jumpers and hammers at the bottom.\r\nThese we held under our coats until the heat of our bodies\r\nwarmed them, then we went on with our toil.\r\n\r\nAt intervals during the day the winds of the mountain put their\r\nheads together and swept a whirlstorm of snow down upon us,\r\nwetting each man to the pelt. Our tools froze until the hands\r\nthat gripped them were scarred as if by red-hot spits. We\r\nshook uncertain over our toil, our sodden clothes scalding and\r\nitching the skin with every movement of the swinging hammers.\r\nNear at hand the lean derrick jibs whirled on their pivots\r\nlike spectres of some ghoulish carnival, and the muck-barrows\r\ncrunched backwards and forwards, all their dirt and rust hidden\r\nin woolly mantles of snow. Hither and thither the little black\r\nfigures of the workers moved across the waste of whiteness like\r\nshadows on a lime-washed wall. Their breath steamed out on the\r\nair and disappeared in space like the evanescent and fragile\r\nvapor of frying mushrooms....\r\n\r\nWhen night came on we crouched around the hot-plate and told\r\nstories of bygone winters, when men dropped frozen stiff in the\r\ntrenches where they labored. A few tried to gamble near the\r\ndoor, but the wind that cut through the chinks of the walls\r\nchased them to the fire.\r\n\r\nOutside the winds of the night scampered madly, whistling\r\nthrough every crevice of the shack and threatening to smash all\r\nits timbers to pieces. We bent closer over the hot-plate, and\r\nthe many who could not draw near to the heat scrambled into\r\nbed and sought warmth under the meagre blankets. Suddenly the\r\nlamp went out, and a darkness crept into the corners of the\r\ndwelling, causing the figures of my mates to assume fantastic\r\nshapes in the gloom. The circle around the hot-plate drew\r\ncloser, and long lean arms were stretched out towards the\r\nflames and the redness. Seldom may a man have the chance to\r\nlook on hands like those of my mates. Fingers were missing from\r\nmany, scraggy scars seaming along the wrists or across the\r\npalms of others told of accidents which had taken place on many\r\nprecarious shifts. The faces near me were those of ghouls worn\r\nout in some unholy midnight revel. Sunken eyes glared balefully\r\nin the dim unearthly light of the fire, and as I looked at them\r\na moment's terror settled on my soul. For a second I lived in\r\nan early age, and my mates were the cave-dwellers of an older\r\nworld than mine. In the darkness, near the door, a pipe glowed\r\nbrightly for a moment, then the light went suddenly out and the\r\ngloom settled again.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Song of the Wage Slave\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Spell of the Yukon\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT W. SERVICE\r\n\r\n(Canadian poet, born 1876. His poems of Alaska and the great\r\nNorthwest have attained wide popularity)\r\n\r\n    When the long, long day is over, and the Big Boss gives me my pay,\r\n    I hope that it won't be hell-fire, as some of the parsons say.\r\n    And I hope that it won't be heaven, with some of the parsons I've met--\r\n    All I want is just quiet, just to rest and forget.\r\n    Look at my face, toil-furrowed; look at my calloused hands;\r\n    Master, I've done Thy bidding, wrought in Thy many lands--\r\n    Wrought for the little masters, big-bellied they be, and rich;\r\n    I've done their desire for a daily hire, and I die like a dog\r\nin a ditch....\r\n    I, the primitive toiler, half naked and grimed to the eyes,\r\n    Sweating it deep in their ditches, swining it stark in their styes;\r\n    Hurling down forests before me, spanning tumultuous streams;\r\n    Down in the ditch building o'er me palaces fairer than dreams;\r\n    Boring the rock to the ore-bed, driving the road through the fen,\r\n    Resolute, dumb, uncomplaining, a man in a world of men.\r\n    Master, I've filled my contract, wrought in Thy many lands;\r\n    Not by my sins wilt Thou judge me, but by the work of my hands.\r\n    Master, I've done Thy bidding, and the light is low in the west,\r\n    And the long, long shift is over.... Master, I've earned it--Rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nManhattan\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES HANSON TOWNE\r\n\r\n(American poet, born 1877)\r\n\r\n    Here in the furnace City, in the humid air they faint,\r\n      God's pallid poor, His people, with scarcely space for breath;\r\n    So foul their teeming houses, so full of shame and taint,\r\n      They cannot crowd within them for the frightful fear of Death.\r\n\r\n    Yet somewhere, Lord, Thine open seas are singing with the rain,\r\n      And somewhere underneath Thy stars the cool waves crash and beat;\r\n    Why is it here, and only here, are huddled Death and Pain,\r\n      And here the form of Horror stalks, a menace in the street!\r\n\r\n    The burning flagstones gleam like glass at morning and at noon,\r\n      The giant walls shut out the breeze--if any breeze should blow;\r\n    And high above the smothering town at midnight hangs the moon,\r\n      A red medallion in the sky, a monster cameo.\r\n\r\n    Yet somewhere, God, drenched roses bloom by fountains draped with mist\r\n      In old, lost gardens of the earth made lyrical with rain;\r\n    Why is it here a million brows by hungry Death are kissed,\r\n      And here is packed, one Summer night, a whole world's fiery pain!\r\n\r\n\r\nA Department-Store Clerk\r\n\r\n(_From \"The House of Bondage\"_)\r\n\r\nBY REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN\r\n\r\n(American novelist, born 1877)\r\n\r\nKatie Flanagan arrived at the Lennox department store every\r\nmorning at a quarter to eight o'clock. She passed through the\r\nemployees' dark entrance, a unit in a horde of other workers,\r\nand registered the instant of her arrival on a time-machine\r\nthat could in no wise be suborned to perjury. She hung up\r\nher wraps in a subterranean cloak-room, and, hurrying to the\r\ncounter to which she was assigned, first helped in \"laying\r\nout the stock,\" and then stood behind her wares, exhibiting,\r\ncajoling, selling, until an hour before noon. At that time\r\nshe was permitted to run away for exactly forty-five minutes\r\nfor the glass of milk and two pieces of bread and jam that\r\ncomposed her luncheon. This repast disposed of, she returned to\r\nthe counter and remained behind it, standing like a war-worn\r\nwatcher on the ramparts of a beleaguered city, till the store\r\nclosed at six, when there remained to her at least fifteen\r\nminutes more of work before her sales-book was balanced and\r\nthe wares covered up for the night. There were times, indeed,\r\nwhen she did not leave the store until seven o'clock, but those\r\ntimes were caused rather by customers than by the management of\r\nthe store, which could prevent new shoppers from entering the\r\ndoors after six, but could hardly turn out those already inside.\r\n\r\nThe automatic time-machine and a score of more annoying, and\r\nequally automatic, human beings kept watch upon all that she\r\ndid. The former, in addition to the floor-walker in her section\r\nof the store, recorded her every going and coming, the latter\r\nreported every movement not prescribed by the regulations\r\nof the establishment; and the result upon Katie and her\r\nfellow-workers was much the result observable upon condemned\r\nassassins under the unwinking surveillance of the Death Watch.\r\n\r\nIf Katie was late, she was fined ten cents for each offense.\r\nShe was reprimanded if her portion of the counter was\r\ndisordered after a mauling by careless customers. She was\r\nfined for all mistakes she made in the matter of prices and\r\nthe additions on her salesbook; and she was fined if, having\r\nasked the floor-walker for three or five minutes to leave the\r\nfloor in order to tidy her hair and hands, in constant need of\r\nattention through the rapidity of her work and the handling of\r\nher dyed wares, she exceeded her time limit by so much as a few\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nThere were no seats behind the counters, and Katie, whatever\r\nher physical condition, remained on her feet all day long,\r\nunless she could arrange for relief by a fellow-worker during\r\nthat worker's luncheon time. There was no place for rest\r\nsave a damp, ill-lighted \"Recreation Room\" in the basement,\r\nfurnished with a piano that nobody had time to play, magazines\r\nthat nobody had time to read, and wicker chairs in which\r\nnobody had time to sit. All that one might do was to serve the\r\nwhims and accept the scoldings of women customers who knew too\r\nill, or too well, what they wanted to buy; keep a tight rein\r\nupon one's indignation at strolling men who did not intend to\r\nbuy anything that the shop advertised; be servilely smiling\r\nunder the innuendoes of the high-collared floor-walkers, in\r\norder to escape their wrath; maintain a sharp outlook for the\r\n\"spotters,\" or paid spies of the establishment; thwart, if\r\npossible, those pretending customers who were scouts sent from\r\nother stores, and watch for shop-lifters on the one hand and\r\nthe firm's detectives on the other.\r\n\r\n\"It ain't a cinch, by no means\"--thus ran the departing Cora\r\nCostigan's advice to her successor--\"but it ain't nothin'\r\nnow to what it will be in the holidays. I'd rather be dead\r\nthan work in the toy-department in December--I wonder if the\r\nkids guess how we that sells 'em hates the sight of their\r\nplaythings?--and I'd rather be dead _an'_ damned than work in\r\nthe accounting department. A girl friend of mine worked there\r\nlast year,--only it was over to Malcare's store--an' didn't get\r\nthrough her Christmas Eve work till two on Christmas morning,\r\nan' she lived over on Staten Island. She overslept on the\r\ntwenty-sixth, an' they docked her a half-week's pay.\r\n\r\n\"An' don't never,\" concluded Cora, \"don't never let 'em\r\ntransfer you to the exchange department. The people that\r\nexchange things all belong in the psychopathic ward at\r\nBellevue--them that don't belong in Sing Sing. Half the goods\r\nthey bring back have been used for days, an' when the store\r\nties a tag on a sent-on-approval opera cloak, the women wriggle\r\nthe tag inside, an' wear it to the theatre with a scarf draped\r\nover the string. Thank God, I'm goin' to be married!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA Cry from the Ghetto\r\n\r\n(_From the Yiddish of Morris Rosenfeld_)\r\n\r\n (The poet of the East Side Jews of New York City, born 1861. His poems\r\n appeared in Yiddish newspapers and leaflets, and are the genuine voice\r\n of the sweat-shop workers. The following translation is by Charles\r\n Weber Linn)\r\n\r\n    The roaring of the wheels has filled my ears,\r\n      The clashing and the clamor shut me in;\r\n    Myself, my soul, in chaos disappears,\r\n      I cannot think or feel amid the din.\r\n    Toiling and toiling and toiling--endless toil.\r\n      For whom? For what? Why should the work be done?\r\n    I do not ask, or know. I only toil.\r\n      I work until the day and night are one.\r\n\r\n    The clock above me ticks away the day,\r\n      Its hands are spinning, spinning, like the wheels.\r\n    It cannot sleep or for a moment stay,\r\n      It is a thing like me, and does not feel.\r\n    It throbs as tho' my heart were beating there--\r\n      A heart? My heart? I know not what it means.\r\n    The clock ticks, and below I strive and stare.\r\n      And so we lose the hour. We are machines.\r\n\r\n    Noon calls a truce, an ending to the sound,\r\n      As if a battle had one moment stayed--\r\n    A bloody field! The dead lie all around;\r\n      Their wounds cry out until I grow afraid.\r\n    It comes--the signal! See, the dead men rise,\r\n      They fight again, amid the roar they fight.\r\n    Blindly, and knowing not for whom, or why,\r\n      They fight, they fall, they sink into the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrousers[A]\r\n\r\n[A] By permission of Charles Scribner's Sons.\r\n\r\n(_From \"A Motley\"_)\r\n\r\nBY JOHN GALSWORTHY\r\n\r\n(English novelist and dramatist, born 1867)\r\n\r\nShe held in one hand a threaded needle, in the other a pair\r\nof trousers, to which she had been adding the accessories\r\ndemanded by our civilization. One had never seen her without a\r\npair of trousers in her hand, because she could only manage to\r\nsupply them with decency at the rate of seven or eight pairs\r\na day, working twelve hours. For each pair she received seven\r\nfarthings, and used nearly one farthing's worth of cotton;\r\nand this gave her an income, in good times, of six to seven\r\nshillings a week. But some weeks there were no trousers to be\r\nhad and then it was necessary to live on the memory of those\r\nwhich had been, together with a little sum put by from weeks\r\nwhen trousers were more plentiful. Deducting two shillings\r\nand threepence for rent of the little back room, there was\r\ntherefore, on an average, about two shillings and ninepence\r\nleft for the sustenance of herself and husband, who was\r\nfortunately a cripple, and somewhat indifferent whether he\r\nate or not. And looking at her face, so furrowed, and at her\r\nfigure, of which there was not much, one could well understand\r\nthat she, too, had long established within her such internal\r\neconomy as was suitable to one who had been \"in trousers\"\r\ntwenty-seven years, and, since her husband's accident fifteen\r\nyears before, in trousers only, finding her own cotton.... He\r\nwas a man with a round, white face, a little grey mustache\r\ncurving down like a parrot's beak, and round whitish eyes. In\r\nhis aged and unbuttoned suit of grey, with his head held rather\r\nto one side, he looked like a parrot--a bird clinging to its\r\nperch, with one grey leg shortened and crumpled against the\r\nother. He talked, too, in a toneless, equable voice, looking\r\nsideways at the fire, above the rims of dim spectacles, and now\r\nand then smiling with a peculiar disenchanted patience.\r\n\r\nNo--he said--it was no use to complain; did no good! Things\r\nhad been like this for years, and so, he had no doubt, they\r\nalways would be. There had never been much in trousers; not\r\nthis common sort that anybody'd wear, as you might say. Though\r\nhe'd never seen anybody wearing such things; and where they\r\nwent to he didn't know--out of England, he should think. Yes,\r\nhe had been a carman; ran over by a dray. Oh! yes, they had\r\ngiven him something--four bob a week; but the old man had died\r\nand the four bob had died too. Still, there he was, sixty years\r\nold--not so very bad for his age....\r\n\r\nThey were talking, he had heard said, about doing something for\r\ntrousers. But what could you do for things like these, at half\r\na crown a pair? People must have 'em, so you'd got to make 'em.\r\nThere you were, and there you would be! _She_ went and heard\r\nthem talk. They talked very well, she said. It was intellectual\r\nfor her to go. He couldn't go himself owing to his leg. He'd\r\nlike to hear them talk. Oh, yes! and he was silent, staring\r\nsideways at the fire as though in the thin crackle of the\r\nflames attacking the fresh piece of wood, he were hearing the\r\necho of that talk from which he was cut off. \"Lor' bless you!\"\r\nhe said suddenly. \"They'll do nothing! Can't!\" And, stretching\r\nout his dirty hand he took from his wife's lap a pair of\r\ntrousers, and held it up. \"Look at 'em! Why you can see right\r\nthrou' 'em, linings and all. Who's goin' to pay more than 'alf\r\na crown for that? Where they go to I can't think. Who wears\r\n'em? Some institution I should say. They talk, but dear me,\r\nthey'll never do anything so long as there's thousands like us,\r\nglad to work for what we can get. Best not to think about it, I\r\nsays.\"\r\n\r\nAnd laying the trousers back on his wife's lap he resumed his\r\nsidelong stare into the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Song of the Shirt\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS HOOD\r\n\r\n(Popular English poet and humorist; 1799-1845)\r\n\r\n    With fingers weary and worn,\r\n      With eyelids heavy and red,\r\n    A woman sat, in unwomanly rags,\r\n      Plying her needle and thread,--\r\n        Stitch! stitch! stitch!\r\n      In poverty, hunger, and dirt;\r\n    And still with a voice of dolorous pitch\r\n      She sang the \"Song of the Shirt!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Work! work! work!\r\n      While the cock is crowing aloof!\r\n    And work--work--work\r\n      Till the stars shine through the roof!\r\n    It's O! to be a slave\r\n      Along with the barbarous Turk,\r\n    Where woman has never a soul to save,\r\n      If this is Christian work!\r\n\r\n    \"Work--work--work\r\n      Till the brain begins to swim!\r\n    Work--work--work\r\n      Till the eyes are heavy and dim!\r\n    Seam, and gusset, and band,\r\n      Band, and gusset, and seam,--\r\n    Till over the buttons I fall asleep,\r\n      And sew them on in a dream!\r\n\r\n    \"O Men, with sisters dear!\r\n      O Men, with mothers and wives!\r\n    It is not linen you're wearing out,\r\n      But human creatures' lives!\r\n        Stitch--stitch--stitch\r\n      In poverty, hunger, and dirt,--\r\n    Sewing at once, with a double thread,\r\n      A shroud as well as a Shirt!\r\n\r\n    \"But why do I talk of Death--\r\n      That phantom of grisly bone?\r\n    I hardly fear his terrible shape,\r\n      It seems so like my own--\r\n    It seems so like my own\r\n      Because of the fasts I keep;\r\n    O God! that bread should be so dear,\r\n      And flesh and blood so cheap!\r\n\r\n    \"Work--work--work!\r\n      My labor never flags;\r\n    And what are its wages?

The story of his\r\nlife will be found on p. 732. For the work here quoted London\r\nlived among the people whose misery he describes)\r\n\r\nA spawn of children cluttered the slimy pavement, for all the\r\nworld like tadpoles just turned frogs on the bottom of a dry\r\npond. In a narrow doorway, so narrow that perforce we stepped\r\nover her, sat a woman with a young babe, nursing at breasts\r\ngrossly naked and libelling all the sacredness of motherhood.\r\nIn the black and narrow hall behind her we waded through a\r\nmess of young life, and essayed an even narrower and fouler\r\nstairway. Up we went, three flights, each landing two feet by\r\nthree in area, and heaped with filth and refuse.\r\n\r\nThere were seven rooms in this abomination called a house.\r\nIn six of the rooms, twenty-odd people, of both sexes and\r\nall ages, cooked, ate, slept, and worked. In size the rooms\r\naveraged eight feet by eight, or possibly nine. The seventh\r\nroom we entered. It was the den in which five men sweated. It\r\nwas seven feet wide by eight long, and the table at which the\r\nwork was performed took up the major portion of the space.\r\nOn this table were five lasts, and there was barely room for\r\nthe men to stand to their work, for the rest of the space was\r\nheaped with cardboard, leather, bundles of shoe uppers, and a\r\nmiscellaneous assortment of materials used in attaching the\r\nuppers of shoes to their soles.\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining room lived a woman and six children. In\r\nanother vile hole lived a widow, with an only son of sixteen\r\nwho was dying of consumption. The woman hawked sweetmeats on\r\nthe street, I was told, and more often failed than not to\r\nsupply her son with the three quarts of milk he daily required.\r\nFurther, this son, weak and dying, did not taste meat oftener\r\nthan once a week; and the kind and quality of this meat cannot\r\npossibly be imagined by people who have never watched human\r\nswine eat.\r\n\r\n\"The w'y 'e coughs is somethin' terrible,\" volunteered my\r\nsweated friend, referring to the dying boy. \"We 'ear 'im 'ere,\r\nw'ile we're workin', an' it's terrible, I say, terrible!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, what of the coughing and the sweetmeats, I found another\r\nmenace added to the hostile environment of the children of the\r\nslums.\r\n\r\nMy sweated friend, when work was to be had, toiled with\r\nfour other men in his eight-by-seven room. In the winter a\r\nlamp burned nearly all the day and added its fumes to the\r\nover-loaded air, which was breathed, and breathed, and breathed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIn good times, when there was a rush of work, this man told\r\nme that he could earn as high as \"thirty bob a week.\"--\"Thirty\r\nshillings! Seven dollars and a half!\r\n\r\n\"But it's only the best of us can do it,\" he qualified. \"An'\r\nthen we work twelve, thirteen, and fourteen hours a day, just\r\nas fast as we can. An' you should see us sweat! Just runnin'\r\nfrom us! If you could see us, it'd dazzle your eyes--tacks\r\nflyin' out of mouth like from a machine. Look at my mouth.\"\r\n\r\nI looked. The teeth were worn down by the constant friction of\r\nthe metallic brads, while they were coal-black and rotten.\r\n\r\n\"I clean my teeth,\" he added, \"else they'd be worse.\"\r\n\r\nAfter he had told me that the workers had to furnish their own\r\ntools, brads, \"grindery,\" cardboard, rent, light, and what not,\r\nit was plain that his thirty bob was a diminishing quantity.\r\n\r\n\"But how long does the rush season last, in which you receive\r\nthis high wage of thirty bob?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Four months,\" was the answer; and for the rest of the year,\r\nhe informed me, they average from \"half a quid\" to a \"quid,\"\r\na week, which is equivalent to from two dollars and a half to\r\nfive dollars. The present week was half gone, and he had earned\r\nfour bob, or one dollar. And yet I was given to understand that\r\nthis was one of the better grades of sweating.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Hop-pickers_\r\n\r\nSo far has the divorcement of the worker from the soil\r\nproceeded, that the farming districts, the civilized world\r\nover, are dependent upon the cities for the gathering of the\r\nharvests. Then it is, when the land is spilling its ripe wealth\r\nto waste, that the street folk, who have been driven away from\r\nthe soil, are called back to it again. But in England they\r\nreturn, not as prodigals, but as outcasts still, as vagrants\r\nand pariahs, to be doubted and flouted by their country\r\nbrethren, to sleep in jails or casual wards, or under the\r\nhedges, and to live the Lord knows how.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that Kent alone requires eighty thousand of the\r\nstreet people to pick her hops. And out they come, obedient\r\nto the call, which is the call of their bellies and of the\r\nlingering dregs of adventure-lust still in them. Slums, stews,\r\nand ghetto pour them forth, and the festering contents of\r\nslums, stews, and ghetto are undiminished. Yet they overrun\r\nthe country like an army of ghouls, and the country does not\r\nwant them. They are out of place. As they drag their squat,\r\nmisshapen bodies along the highways and byways, they resemble\r\nsome vile spawn from underground. Their very presence, the fact\r\nof their existence, is an outrage to the fresh, bright sun\r\nand the green and growing things. The clean, upstanding trees\r\ncry shame upon them and their withered crookedness, and their\r\nrottenness is a slimy desecration of the sweetness and purity\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nIs the picture overdrawn? It all depends. For one who sees and\r\nthinks life in terms of shares and coupons, it is certainly\r\noverdrawn. But for one who sees and thinks life in terms of\r\nmanhood and womanhood, it cannot be overdrawn. Such hordes\r\nof beastly wretchedness and inarticulate misery are no\r\ncompensation for a millionaire brewer who lives in a West End\r\npalace, sates himself with the sensuous delights of London's\r\ngolden theatres, hobnobs with lordlings and princelings, and is\r\nknighted by the king. Wins his spurs--God forbid! In old time\r\nthe great blonde beasts rode in the battle's van and won their\r\nspurs by cleaving men from pate to chin. And, after all, it is\r\nfiner to kill a strong man with a clean-slicing blow of singing\r\nsteel than to make a beast of him, and of his seed through the\r\ngenerations, by the artful and spidery manipulation of industry\r\nand politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment\r\n\r\n(_From \"Merrie England\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT BLATCHFORD\r\n\r\n (This book is probably the most widely-circulated of Socialist books\r\n in English.

The author is the editor of the\r\n London _Clarion_; born 1851)\r\n\r\nSome years ago a certain writer, much esteemed for his graceful\r\nstyle of saying silly things, informed us that the poor remain\r\npoor because they show no efficient desire to be anything else.\r\nIs that true?

Come with me and I will\r\nshow you where men and women work from morning till night,\r\nfrom week to week, from year to year, at the full stretch of\r\ntheir powers, in dim and fetid dens, and yet are poor--aye,\r\ndestitute--have for their wages a crust of bread and rags.\r\nI will show you where men work in dirt and heat, using the\r\nstrength of brutes, for a dozen hours a day, and sleep at\r\nnight in styes, until brain and muscle are exhausted, and\r\nfresh slaves are yoked to the golden car of commerce, and the\r\nbroken drudges filter through the poor-house or the prison to\r\na felon's or a pauper's grave! I will show you how men and\r\nwomen thus work and suffer and faint and die, generation after\r\ngeneration; and I will show you how the longer and the harder\r\nthese wretches toil the worse their lot becomes; and I will\r\nshow you the graves, and find witnesses to the histories of\r\nbrave and noble and industrious poor men whose lives were lives\r\nof toil, _and_ poverty, and whose deaths were tragedies.\r\n\r\nAnd all these things are due to sin--but it is to the sin of\r\nthe smug hypocrites who grow rich upon the robbery and the ruin\r\nof their fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork and Pray\r\n\r\nBY GEORG HERWEGH\r\n\r\n(German poet, 1817-1875; took part in the attempt at revolution\r\nin Baden in 1848)\r\n\r\n    Pray and work! proclaims the world;\r\n    Briefly pray, for Time is gold.\r\n    On the door there knocketh dread--\r\n    Briefly pray, for Time is bread.\r\n\r\n    And ye plow and plant to grow.\r\n    And ye rivet and ye sow.\r\n    And ye hammer and ye spin--\r\n    Say, my people, what ye win.\r\n\r\n    Weave at loom both day and night,\r\n    Mine the coal to mountain height;\r\n    Fill right full the harvest horn--\r\n    Full to brim with wine and corn.\r\n\r\n    Yet where is thy meal prepared?\r\n    Yet where is thy rest-hour shared?\r\n    Yet where is thy warm hearth-fire?\r\n    Where is thy sharp sword of ire?\r\n\r\n\r\nConventional Lies of Our Civilization\r\n\r\nBY MAX NORDAU\r\n\r\n(A Hungarian Jewish physician, born 1849, whose work,\r\n\"Degeneration,\" won an international audience)\r\n\r\nThe modern day laborer is more wretched than the slave of\r\nformer times, for he is fed by no master nor any one else, and\r\nif his position is one of more liberty than the slave, it is\r\nprincipally the liberty of dying of hunger. He is by no means\r\nso well off as the outlaw of the Middle Ages, for he has none\r\nof the gay independence of the free-lance. He seldom rebels\r\nagainst society, and has neither means nor opportunity to take\r\nby violence or treachery what is denied him by the existing\r\nconditions of life. The rich is thus richer, the poor poorer\r\nthan ever before since the beginnings of history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Failure of Civilization\r\n\r\nBY FREDERIC HARRISON\r\n\r\n(English essayist and philosopher, born 1831; President of the\r\nPositivist Society)\r\n\r\nI cannot myself understand how any one who knows what the\r\npresent manner is can think that it is satisfactory. To me, at\r\nleast, it would be enough to condemn modern society as hardly\r\nan advance on slavery or serfdom, if the permanent condition\r\nof industry were to be that which we behold; that ninety per\r\ncent of the actual producers of wealth have no home that they\r\ncan call their own beyond the end of the week; have no bit of\r\nsoil, or so much as a room that belongs to them; have nothing\r\nof value of any kind, except as much old furniture as will go\r\nin a cart; have the precarious chance of weekly wages, which\r\nbarely suffice to keep them in health; are housed for the\r\nmost part in places that no man thinks fit for his horse; are\r\nseparated by so narrow a margin from destitution that a month\r\nof bad trade, sickness or unexpected loss brings them face\r\nto face with hunger and pauperism. In cities, the increasing\r\norganization of factory work makes life more and more crowded,\r\nand work more and more a monotonous routine; in the country,\r\nthe increasing pressure makes rural life continually less\r\nfree, healthful and cheerful; whilst the prizes and hopes of\r\nbetterment are now reduced to a minimum. This is the normal\r\nstate of the average workman in town or country, to which we\r\nmust add the record of preventable disease, accident, suffering\r\nand social oppression with its immense yearly roll of death\r\nand misery. But below this normal state of the average workman\r\nthere is found the great band of the destitute outcasts--the\r\ncamp-followers of the army of industry, at least one-tenth of\r\nthe whole proletarian population, whose normal condition is\r\none of sickening wretchedness. If this is to be the permanent\r\narrangement of modern society, civilization must be held to\r\nbring a curse on the great majority of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n_The Chasm_\r\n\r\nThe contrast between riches and poverty; the protest of common\r\nsense against a condition of society where one-tenth of the\r\npeople own nine-tenths of the wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWat Tyler\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT SOUTHEY\r\n\r\n (One of the so-called \"Lake School\" of English poets, which included\r\n Wordsworth and Coleridge; 1774-1843.

There was a Loft above (attainable by a ladder), upon\r\nwhich the inmates slept; and the space below was divided by\r\na hurdle into two apartments; the one for their cow and pig,\r\nthe other for themselves and guests. On entering the house we\r\ndiscovered the family, eleven in number, at dinner; the father\r\nsitting at the top, the mother at the bottom, the children on\r\neach side, of a large oaken Board, which was scooped out in\r\nthe middle, like a trough, to receive the contents of their\r\nPot of Potatoes. Little holes were cut at equal distances to\r\ncontain Salt; and a bowl of Milk stood on the table; all the\r\nluxuries of meat and beer, bread, knives and dishes, were\r\ndispensed with.\" The Poor-Slave himself our Traveller found,\r\nas he says, broad-backed, black-browed, of great personal\r\nstrength, and mouth from ear to ear. His Wife was a sun-browned\r\nbut well-featured woman; and his young ones, bare and chubby,\r\nhad the appetite of ravens. Of their Philosophical or Religious\r\ntenets or observances, no notice or hint.\r\n\r\nBut now, secondly, of the _Dandiacal Household_:\r\n\r\n\"A Dressing-room splendidly furnished; violet-colored curtains,\r\nchairs and ottomans of the same hue. Two full-length Mirrors\r\nare placed, one on each side of a table, which supports the\r\nluxuries of the Toilet. Several Bottles of Perfume, arranged\r\nin a peculiar fashion, stand upon a smaller table of\r\nmother-of-pearl; opposite to these are placed the appurtenances\r\nof Lavation richly wrought in frosted silver. A Wardrobe of\r\nBuhl is on the left; the doors of which, being partly open,\r\ndiscover a profusion of Clothes; Shoes of a singularly small\r\nsize monopolize the lower shelves. Fronting the wardrobe a door\r\najar gives some slight glimpse of the Bathroom. Folding-doors\r\nin the background.--\"Enter the Author,\" our Theogonist in\r\nperson, \"obsequiously preceded by a French Valet, in white silk\r\nJacket and cambric Apron.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch are the two sects which, at this moment, divide the more\r\nunsettled portion of the British People; and agitate that\r\never-vexed country. To the eye of the political Seer, their\r\nmutual relation, pregnant with the elements of discord and\r\nhostility, is far from consoling. These two principles of\r\nDandiacal Self-worship or Demon-worship, and Poor-Slavish or\r\nDrudgical Earth-worship, or whatever that same Drudgism may\r\nbe, do as yet indeed manifest themselves under distant and\r\nnowise considerable shapes: nevertheless, in their roots and\r\nsubterranean ramifications, they extend through the entire\r\nstructure of Society, and work unweariedly in the secret depths\r\nof English national Existence; striving to separate and isolate\r\nit into two contradictory, uncommunicating masses.\r\n\r\nIn numbers, and even individual strength, the Poor-Slaves or\r\nDrudges, it would seem, are hourly increasing. The Dandiacal,\r\nagain, is by nature no proselytizing Sect; but it boasts of\r\ngreat hereditary resources, and is strong by union; whereas the\r\nDrudges, split into parties, have as yet no rallying-point;\r\nor at best only co-operate by means of partial secret\r\naffiliations. If, indeed, there were to arise a _Communion\r\nof Drudges_, as there is already a Communion of Saints, what\r\nstrangest effects would follow therefrom! Dandyism as yet\r\naffects to look down on Drudgism; but perhaps the hour of\r\ntrial, when it will be practically seen which ought to look\r\ndown, and which up, is not so distant.\r\n\r\nTo me it seems probable that the two Sects will one day\r\npart England between them; each recruiting itself from the\r\nintermediate ranks, till there be none left to enlist on either\r\nside. These Dandiacal Manicheans, with the host of Dandyizing\r\nChristians, will form one body; the Drudges, gathering round\r\nthem whosoever is Drudgical, be he Christian or Infidel Pagan;\r\nsweeping-up likewise all manner of Utilitarians, Radicals,\r\nrefractory Potwallopers, and so forth, into their general mass,\r\nwill form another. I could liken Dandyism and Drudgism to two\r\nbottomless boiling Whirlpools that had broken-out on opposite\r\nquarters of the firm land; as yet they appear only disquieted,\r\nfoolishly bubbling wells, which man's art might cover-in;\r\nyet mark them, their diameter is daily widening; they are\r\nhollow Cones that boil-up from the infinite Deep, over which\r\nyour firm land is but a thin crust or rind! Thus daily is the\r\nintermediate land crumbling-in, daily the empire of the two\r\nBuchan-Bullers extending; till now there is but a foot-plank,\r\na mere film of Land between them; this too is washed away; and\r\nthen--we have the true Hell of Waters, and Noah's Deluge is\r\noutdeluged!\r\n\r\nOr better, I might call them two boundless, and indeed\r\nunexampled Electric Machines (turned by the \"Machinery of\r\nSociety\"), with batteries of opposite quality; Drudgism the\r\nNegative, Dandyism the Positive; one attracts hourly towards it\r\nand appropriates all the Positive Electricity of the nation\r\n(namely, the Money thereof); the other is equally busy with the\r\nNegative (that is to say the Hunger) which is equally potent.\r\nHitherto you see only partial transient sparkles and sputters;\r\nbut wait a little, till the entire nation is in an electric\r\nstate; till your whole vital Electricity, no longer healthfully\r\nNeutral, is cut into two isolated portions of Positive and\r\nNegative (of Money and of Hunger); and stands there bottled-up\r\nin two World-Batteries! The stirring of a child's finger\r\nbrings the two together; and then--What then? The Earth is but\r\nshivered into impalpable smoke by that Doom's-thunderpeal; the\r\nSun misses one of his Planets in Space, and thenceforth there\r\nare no eclipses of the Moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES MAURICE DE TALLEYRAND\r\n\r\n(French bishop and statesman, 1754-1838)\r\n\r\nSociety is divided into two classes; the shearers and the\r\nshorn.

In the scene here quoted, a young University man\r\n is taken by a game-keeper to see the degradation of English village\r\n life)\r\n\r\n\"Can't they read? Can't they practice light and interesting\r\nhandicrafts at home, as the German peasantry do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who'll teach 'em, sir? From the plough-tail to the\r\nreaping-hook, and back again, is all they know. Besides, sir,\r\nthey are not like us Cornish; they are a stupid pig-headed\r\ngeneration at the best, these south countrymen. They're\r\ngrown-up babies who want the parson and the squire to be\r\nleading them, and preaching to them, and spurring them on, and\r\ncoaxing them up, every moment. And as for scholarship, sir,\r\na boy leaves school at nine or ten to follow the horses; and\r\nbetween that time and his wedding-day he forgets every word\r\nhe ever learnt, and becomes, for the most part, as thorough a\r\nheathen savage at heart as those wild Indians in the Brazils\r\nused to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then we call them civilized Englishmen!\" said Lancelot.\r\n\"We can see that your Indian is a savage, because he wears\r\nskins and feathers; but your Irish cotter or your English\r\nlaborer, because he happens to wear a coat and trousers, is to\r\nbe considered a civilized man.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the way of the world, sir,\" said Tregarva, \"judging\r\ncarnal judgment, according to the sight of its own eyes; always\r\nlooking at the outsides of things and men, sir, and never much\r\ndeeper. But as for reading, sir, it's all very well for me,\r\nwho have been a keeper and dawdled about like a gentleman with\r\na gun over my arm; but did you ever do a good day's farm-work\r\nin your life? If you had, man or boy, you wouldn't have been\r\ngame for much reading when you got home; you'd do just what\r\nthese poor fellows do--tumble into bed at eight o'clock, hardly\r\nwaiting to take your clothes off, knowing that you must turn\r\nup again at five o'clock the next morning to get a breakfast\r\nof bread, and, perhaps, a dab of the squire's dripping, and\r\nthen back to work again; and so on, day after day, sir, week\r\nafter week, year after year, without a hope or chance of being\r\nanything but what you are, and only too thankful if you can\r\nget work to break your back, and catch the rheumatism over.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you mean to say that their labor is so severe and\r\nincessant?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only God's blessing if it is incessant, sir, for if it\r\nstops, they starve, or go to the house to be worse fed than\r\nthe thieves in gaol. And as for its being severe, there's many\r\na boy, as their mothers will tell you, comes home night after\r\nnight, too tired to eat their suppers, and tumble, fasting, to\r\nbed in the same foul shirt which they've been working in all\r\nthe day, never changing their rag of calico from week's end to\r\nweek's end, or washing the skin that's under it once in seven\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder,\" said Lancelot, \"that such a life of drudgery makes\r\nthem brutal and reckless.\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder, indeed, sir: they've no time to think; they're born\r\nto be machines, and machines they must be; and I think, sir,\"\r\nhe added bitterly, \"it's God's mercy that they daren't think.\r\nIt's God's mercy that they don't feel. Men that write books\r\nand talk at elections call this a free country, and say that\r\nthe poorest and meanest has a free opening to rise and become\r\nprime minister, if he can. But you see, sir, the misfortune is,\r\nthat in practice he can't; for one who gets into a gentleman's\r\nfamily, or into a little shop, and so saves a few pounds, fifty\r\nknow that they've no chance before them, but day-laborer born,\r\nday-laborer live, from hand to mouth, scraping and pinching to\r\nget not meat and beer even, but bread and potatoes; and then,\r\nat the end of it all, for a worthy reward, half-a-crown-a-week\r\nof parish pay--or the work-house. That's a lively hopeful\r\nprospect for a Christian man!\" ...\r\n\r\nInto the booth they turned; and as soon as Lancelot's eyes\r\nwere accustomed to the reeking atmosphere, he saw seated at\r\ntwo long temporary tables of board, fifty or sixty of \"My\r\nbrethren,\" as clergymen call them in their sermons, wrangling,\r\nstupid, beery, with sodden eyes and drooping lips--interspersed\r\nwith more girls and brazen-faced women, with dirty flowers in\r\ntheir caps, whose sole business seemed to be to cast jealous\r\nlooks at each other, and defend themselves from the coarse\r\novertures of their swains.\r\n\r\nLancelot had been already perfectly astonished at the foulness\r\nof language which prevailed; and the utter absence of anything\r\nlike chivalrous respect, almost of common decency, towards\r\nwomen. But lo! the language of the elder women was quite as\r\ndisgusting as that of the men, if not worse. He whispered a\r\nremark on the point to Tregarva, who shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"It's the field-work, sir--the field-work, that does it all.\r\nThey get accustomed there from their childhood to hear words\r\nwhose very meanings they shouldn't know; and the elder teach\r\nthe younger ones, and the married ones are worst of all. It\r\nwears them out in body, sir, that field-work, and makes them\r\nbrutes in soul and in manners....\"\r\n\r\nSadder and sadder, Lancelot tried to listen to the conversation\r\nof the men round him. To his astonishment he hardly understood\r\na word of it. It was half articulate, nasal, guttural, made up\r\nalmost entirely of vowels, like the speech of savages. He had\r\nnever before been struck with the significant contrast between\r\nthe sharp, clearly defined articulation, the vivid and varied\r\ntones of the gentleman, or even of the London street-boy, when\r\ncompared with the coarse, half-formed growls, as of a company\r\nof seals, which he heard round him. That single fact struck\r\nhim, perhaps, more deeply than any; it connected itself with\r\nmany of his physiological fancies; it was the parent of many\r\nthoughts and plans of his after-life. Here and there he could\r\ndistinguish a half sentence. An old shrunken man opposite him\r\nwas drawing figures in the spilt beer with his pipe-stem, and\r\ndiscoursing of the glorious times before the great war, \"when\r\nthere was more food than there were mouths, and more work than\r\nthere were hands.\" \"Poor human nature!\" thought Lancelot, as he\r\ntried to follow one of those unintelligible discussions about\r\nthe relative prices of the loaf and the bushel of flour, which\r\nended, as usual, in more swearing, and more quarrelling, and\r\nmore beer to make it up--\"Poor human nature! always looking\r\nback, as the German sage says, to some fancied golden age,\r\nnever looking forward to the real one which is coming!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I say, vather,\" drawled out some one, \"they say there's\r\na sight more money in England now, than there was afore the\r\nwar-time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eees, booy,\" said the old man; \"_but it's got into too few\r\nhands_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" thought Lancelot, \"there's a glimpse of practical\r\nsense, at least.\" And a pedler who sat next him, a bold,\r\nblack-whiskered bully from the Potteries, hazarded a joke--\r\n\r\n\"It's all along of this new sky-and-tough-it farming. They used\r\nto spread the money broad cast, but now they drills it all in\r\none place, like bone-dust under their fancy plants, and we poor\r\nself-sown chaps gets none.\"\r\n\r\nThis garland of fancies was received with great applause;\r\nwhereat the pedler, emboldened, proceeded to observe,\r\nmysteriously, that \"donkeys took a beating, but horses kicked\r\nat it; and that they'd found out that in Staffordshire long\r\nago. You want a good Chartist lecturer down here, my covies, to\r\nshow you donkeys of laboring men that you have got iron on your\r\nheels, if you only knowed how to use it....\"\r\n\r\nBlackbird was by this time prevailed on to sing, and burst out\r\nas melodious as ever, while all heads were cocked on one side\r\nin delighted attention.\r\n\r\n    \"I zeed a vire o' Monday night,\r\n      A vire both great and high;\r\n    But I wool not tell you where, my boys,\r\n      Nor wool not tell you why.\r\n    The varmer he comes screeching out,\r\n      To zave 'uns new brood mare;\r\n    Zays I, 'You and your stock may roast,\r\n      Vor aught us poor chaps care.'\r\n\r\n\"Coorus, boys, coorus!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the chorus burst out--\r\n\r\n    \"Then here's a curse on varmers all\r\n      As rob and grind the poor;\r\n    To re'p the fruit of all their works\r\n      In ---- for evermoor-r-r-r.\r\n\r\n    \"A blind owld dame come to the vire,\r\n      Zo near as she could get;\r\n    Zays, 'Here's a luck I warn't asleep,\r\n      To lose this blessed hett.\r\n    They robs us of our turfing rights\r\n      Our bits of chips and sticks,\r\n    Till poor folks now can't warm their hands,\r\n      Except by varmers' ricks.'\r\n\r\n            \"Then, etc.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again the boy's delicate voice rang out the ferocious\r\nchorus, with something, Lancelot fancied, of fiendish\r\nexultation, and every worn face lighted up with a coarse laugh,\r\nthat indicated no malice--but also no mercy....\r\n\r\nLancelot almost ran out into the night--into a triad of fights,\r\ntwo drunken men, two jealous wives, and a brute who struck\r\na poor, thin, worn-out woman, for trying to coax him home.\r\nLancelot rushed up to interfere, but a man seized his uplifted\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\"He'll only beat her all the more when he getteth home.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has stood that every Saturday night for the last seven\r\nyears, to my knowledge,\" said Tregarva; \"and worse, too, at\r\ntimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God! is there no escape for her from her tyrant?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. It's only you gentlefolks who can afford such\r\nluxuries; your poor man may be tied to a harlot, or your poor\r\nwoman to a ruffian, but once done, done for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" thought Lancelot, \"we English have a characteristic\r\nway of proving the holiness of the marriage tie.

Its author was an American school-teacher,\r\n1850-1898)\r\n\r\nBy way of attempting to give the reader some general impression\r\nof the way people lived together in those days, and especially\r\nof the relations of the rich and poor to one another, perhaps\r\nI cannot do better than compare society as it then was to a\r\nprodigious coach which the masses of humanity were harnessed to\r\nand dragged toilsomely along a very hilly and sandy road. The\r\ndriver was hunger, and permitted no lagging, though the pace\r\nwas necessarily very slow. Despite the difficulty of drawing\r\nthe coach at all along so hard a road, the top was covered with\r\npassengers who never got down, even at the steepest ascents.\r\nThe seats on top were very breezy and comfortable. Well up out\r\nof the dust their occupants could enjoy the scenery at their\r\nleisure, or critically discuss the merits of the straining\r\nteam. Naturally such places were in great demand and the\r\ncompetition for them was keen, every one seeking as the first\r\nend in life to secure a seat on the coach for himself and to\r\nleave it to his child after him. By the rule of the coach a\r\nman could leave his seat to whom he wished, but on the other\r\nhand there were many accidents by which it might at any time\r\nbe wholly lost. For all that they were so easy, the seats were\r\nvery insecure, and at every sudden jolt of the coach persons\r\nwere slipping out of them and falling to the ground, where they\r\nwere instantly compelled to take hold of the rope and help to\r\ndrag the coach on which they had before ridden so pleasantly.\r\nIt was naturally regarded as a terrible misfortune to lose\r\none's seat, and the apprehension that this might happen to them\r\nor their friends was a constant cloud upon the happiness of\r\nthose who rode.\r\n\r\nBut did they think only of themselves? you ask. Was not their\r\nvery luxury rendered intolerable to them by comparison with\r\nthe lot of their brothers and sisters in the harness, and\r\nthe knowledge that their own weight added to their toil! Had\r\nthey no compassion for fellow beings from whom fortune only\r\ndistinguished them? Oh, yes; commiseration was frequently\r\nexpressed by those who rode for those who had to pull the\r\ncoach, especially when the vehicle came to a bad place in\r\nthe road, as it was constantly doing, or to a particularly\r\nsteep hill. At such times, the desperate straining of the\r\nteam, their agonized leaping and plunging under the pitiless\r\nlashing of hunger, the many who fainted at the rope and were\r\ntrampled in the mire, made a very distressing spectacle, which\r\noften called forth highly creditable displays of feeling on\r\nthe top of the coach. At such times the passengers would call\r\ndown encouragingly to the toilers of the rope, exhorting them\r\nto patience, and holding out hopes of possible compensation\r\nin another world for the hardness of their lot, while others\r\ncontributed to buy salves and liniments for the crippled and\r\ninjured. It was agreed that it was a great pity that the coach\r\nshould be so hard to pull, and there was a sense of general\r\nrelief when the specially bad piece of road was gotten over.\r\nThis relief was not, indeed, wholly on account of the team, for\r\nthere was always some danger at these bad places of a general\r\noverturn in which all would lose their seats.\r\n\r\nIt must in truth be admitted that the main effect of the\r\nspectacle of the misery of the toilers at the rope was to\r\nenhance the passengers' sense of the value of their seats\r\nupon the coach, and to cause them to hold on to them more\r\ndesperately than before. If the passengers could only have\r\nfelt assured that neither they nor their friends would ever\r\nfall from the top, it is probable that, beyond contributing to\r\nthe funds for liniments and bandages, they would have troubled\r\nthemselves extremely little about those who dragged the coach.\r\n\r\n\r\nRich and Poor\r\n\r\nBY LEO TOLSTOY\r\n\r\n(Russian novelist and reformer, 1828-1910)\r\n\r\nThe present position which we, the educated and well-to-do\r\nclasses, occupy, is that of the Old Man of the Sea, riding on\r\nthe poor man's back; only, unlike the Old Man of the Sea, we\r\nare very sorry for the poor man, very sorry; and we will do\r\nalmost anything for the poor man's relief. We will not only\r\nsupply him with food sufficient to keep him on his legs, but we\r\nwill teach and instruct him and point out to him the beauties\r\nof the landscape; we will discourse sweet music to him and give\r\nhim abundance of good advice.\r\n\r\nYes, we will do almost anything for the poor man, anything but\r\nget off his back.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Tale of Two Cities\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES DICKENS\r\n\r\n(Celebrated English novelist, 1812-1870. The novel here quoted\r\ndeals with the French Revolution, and the scene narrates how\r\none of Monseigneur's guests drives away from the palace)\r\n\r\nNot many people had talked with him at the reception; he had\r\nstood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been\r\nwarmer in his manner. It appeared under the circumstances,\r\nrather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed\r\nbefore his horses, and often barely escaping from being run\r\ndown. His man drove as if he were charging an enemy, and the\r\nfurious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face,\r\nor to the lips, of the master. The complaint had sometimes made\r\nitself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age, that,\r\nin the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician\r\ncustom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in\r\na barbarous manner. But few cared enough for that to think of\r\nit a second time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the\r\ncommon wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as\r\nthey could.\r\n\r\nWith a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment\r\nof consideration not easy to be understood in these days,\r\nthe carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners,\r\nwith women screaming before it, and men clutching each other\r\nand clutching children out of its way. At last, swooping at\r\na street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels came to a\r\nsickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number\r\nof voices, and the horses reared and plunged.\r\n\r\nBut for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would\r\nnot have stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and\r\nleave their wounded behind, and why not? But the frightened\r\nvalet had got down in a hurry, and there were twenty hands at\r\nthe horses' bridles.\r\n\r\n\"What has gone wrong?\" said Monsieur, calmly looking out.\r\n\r\nA tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the\r\nfeet of the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the\r\nfountain, and was down in the mud and wet, howling over it like\r\na wild animal.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!\" said a ragged and submissive\r\nman, \"it is a child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.\"\r\n\r\nThe fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where\r\nit was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the\r\ntall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at\r\nthe carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an\r\ninstant on his sword-hilt.\r\n\r\n\"Killed!\" shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both\r\narms at their length above his head, and staring at him. \"Dead!\"\r\n\r\nThe people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis.\r\nThere was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him\r\nbut watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing\r\nor anger. Neither did the people say anything; after the first\r\ncry, they had been silent, and they remained so. The voice of\r\nthe submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its\r\nextreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them\r\nall, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.\r\n\r\nHe took out his purse.\r\n\r\n\"It is extraordinary to me,\" said he, \"that you people cannot\r\ntake care of yourselves and your children. One or the other of\r\nyou is for ever in the way. How do I know what injury you have\r\ndone my horses. See! Give him that.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the\r\nheads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as\r\nit fell. The tall man called out again with a most unearthly\r\ncry, \"Dead!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nParis\r\n\r\nBY ÉMILE ZOLA\r\n\r\n (French novelist, 1840-1902, founder of the school of \"Naturalism.\"\r\n The present is one of his later works, in which he indicates his hope\r\n of the regeneration of French society. The hero is a Catholic priest\r\n who first attempts to reform the Church, and then leaves it)\r\n\r\nPierre remembered that frightful house in the Rue des Saules,\r\nwhere so much want and suffering were heaped up. He saw again\r\nthe yard filthy like a quagmire, the evil-smelling staircases,\r\nthe sordid, bare, icy rooms, the families fighting for messes\r\nwhich even stray dogs would not have eaten; the mothers, with\r\nexhausted breasts, carrying screaming children to and fro; the\r\nold men who fell in corners like brute beasts, and died of\r\nhunger amidst filth. And then came his other hours with the\r\nmagnificence or the quietude or the gaiety of the _salons_\r\nthrough which he had passed, the whole insolent display of\r\nfinancial Paris, and political Paris, and society Paris. And\r\nat last he came to the dusk, and to that Paris-Sodom and\r\nParis-Gomorrah before him, which was lighting itself up for the\r\nnight, for the abominations of that accomplice night which,\r\nlike fine dust, was little by little submerging the expanse\r\nof roofs. And the hateful monstrosity of it all howled aloud\r\nunder the pale sky where the first pure, twinkling stars were\r\ngleaming.\r\n\r\nA great shudder came upon Pierre as he thought of all that\r\nmass of iniquity and suffering, of all that went on below amid\r\nwealth and vice. The _bourgeoisie_, wielding power, would\r\nrelinquish naught of the sovereignty which it had conquered,\r\nwholly stolen; while the people, the eternal dupe, silent so\r\nlong, clenched its fists and growled, claiming its legitimate\r\nshare. And it was that frightful injustice which filled the\r\ngrowing gloom with anger. From what dark-breasted cloud would\r\nthe thunderbolt fall? For years he had been waiting for that\r\nthunderbolt, which low rumbles announced on all points of the\r\nhorizon. And if he had written a book full of candour and hope,\r\nif he had gone in all innocence to Rome, it was to avert that\r\nthunderbolt and its frightful consequences. But all hope of\r\nthe kind was dead within him; he felt that the thunderbolt was\r\ninevitable, that nothing henceforth could stay the catastrophe.\r\nAnd never before had he felt it to be so near, amidst the happy\r\nimpudence of some, and the exasperated distress of others. It\r\nwas gathering, and it would surely fall over that Paris, all\r\nlust and bravado, which, when evening came, thus stirred up its\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HAND OF FATE\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BALFOUR KER\r\n\r\n(_Contemporary American illustrator_)\r\n\r\n_Copyright by J.

In this\r\n grim symbolical drama is voiced the despair of Russia's intellectuals\r\n after the tragic failure of the Revolution. In the first scene King\r\n Hunger is shown inciting the starving factory-slaves to revolt; in the\r\n second, he presides over a gathering of the outcasts of society, who\r\n meet in a cellar to discuss projects of ferocious vengeance upon the\r\n idlers in the ball-room over their heads, but break up in a drunken\r\n brawl instead. In the present scene, King Hunger turns traitor to\r\n his victims, and presides as a judge passing sentence upon them.\r\n The leisure class attend as spectators in the court-room, the women\r\n in evening gowns and jewels, \"the men in dress coats and surtouts,\r\n carefully shaven and dressed at the wig-makers\")\r\n\r\nKING HUNGER:--Show in the first starveling.\r\n\r\n(_The first starveling, a ragged old man with lacerated feet,\r\nis conducted into the court-room.

They shun daylight the\r\nmore anxiously, the more cruelly their wretchedness contrasts\r\nwith the pride of wealth which glitters everywhere; only Hunger\r\nsometimes drives them at noonday from their dens, and then they\r\nstand with silent, speaking eyes, staring beseechingly at the\r\nrich merchant who hurries along, busy and jingling gold, or at\r\nthe lazy lord who, like a surfeited god, rides by on his high\r\nhorse, casting now and then an aristocratically indifferent\r\nglance at the mob below, as though they were swarming ants, or,\r\nat all events, a mass of baser beings, whose joys and sorrows\r\nhave nothing in common with his feelings....\r\n\r\nPoor Poverty! how agonizing must thy hunger be where others\r\nswell in scornful superfluity! And when some one casts with\r\nindifferent hand a crust into thy lap, how bitter must the\r\ntears be wherewith thou moistenest it! Thou poisonest thyself\r\nwith thine own tears. Well art thou in the right when thou\r\nalliest thyself to Vice and Crime. Outlawed criminals often\r\nbear more humanity in their hearts than those cold, blameless\r\ncitizens of virtue, in whose white hearts the power of evil\r\nis quenched; but also the power of good.

In this novel a young American, hungering for success and about\r\n to marry the daughter a great captain of industry, is taken by a\r\n strange man, \"the bearded Anarch,\" and shown the horrors of American\r\n industrialism)\r\n\r\nAnd thus this strange pilgrimage, like another descent into\r\npurgatory and even unto hell, continued,--the shabby bearded\r\nAnarch leading his companion from factory, warehouse, and mill\r\nto mine and railroad and shop, teaching him by the sight of his\r\nown eyes what life means to the silent multitude upon whose\r\nbent shoulders the fabric of society rests,--what that \"life,\r\nliberty and the pursuit of happiness\"--brave aspirations of\r\nthe forefathers--has brought to the common man in this land of\r\ndestiny and desire.\r\n\r\nThe wanderer breathed the deadly fumes of smelter and glass\r\nworks, saw where men were burned in great converters, or torn\r\nlimb from limb upon the whirling teeth of swift machines,--done\r\nto death in this way and that, or maimed and cast useless upon\r\nthe rubbish heap of humanity,--waste product of the process.\r\n\r\n\"For,\" as his guide repeated, \"in this country, where Property\r\nis sacred, nothing is cheaper than human life. For, remember,\r\nthe supply of raw labor is inexhaustible.\"\r\n\r\nHe recalled the words of a sleek and comfortable man of\r\nbusiness, at the end of the day, with his good dinner\r\ncomfortably in his belly and a fat cigar between his lips:\r\n\"There's too much sentimentalism in the air. Some religion less\r\neffeminate than Christ's is needed to fit the facts of life.\r\nIn the struggle the weak must go under, and it is a crime to\r\ninterfere with natural law.\" The weak must go under! Surely if\r\nthat were the law, any religion that would offer an anodyne to\r\nthe hopeless were a blessing. But again and again the question\r\nrose unanswered to his lips,--who are the weak? And the sleek\r\none with his cigar said, \"Those who go under!\" ...\r\n\r\nSo they passed on their way through squalid factory towns\r\nreeking with human vice and disease, through the network of\r\nrailroad terminals crowded with laden cars rolling forth to\r\nsatisfy desires. They loitered in busy city stores, in dim\r\nbasement holes where bread and clothes were making, in filthy\r\nslaughter-houses where beasts were slain by beasts....\r\n\r\nAt sunset of a glowing day the two sat upon an upper ridge of\r\nthe hills. All the imperial colors of the firmament dyed the\r\nwestern heavens among the broken peaks of the mountains. Below\r\nin the lonely valleys were the excoriations of the mines, the\r\nrefuse, the smudged stains of the rough surface of the earth.\r\nThe guide pointed into the distance where the huge smelter of\r\nSenator Dexter's mine sent a yellow cloud upward.\r\n\r\n\"Near that is the charred debris where the miners blew up the\r\nold works. Below the brow of yonder hills lies that stockade\r\nwhere miners, with their women and children, were penned for\r\nweeks like wild animals, guarded by the troops of the nation.\r\nBeyond is the edge of the great desert, into whose waterless\r\nwaste others were driven to their death. Of these I was one\r\nthat escaped. Men were shot and women raped. But I tell over\r\nold tales known to all. In this place it has been truly a life\r\nfor a life according to the primitive text--but more honest\r\nthan the cunning and hidden ways of the law. Here the eaten is\r\nface to face, at least, with the eater.\"\r\n\r\nThe twilight came down like a curtain, hiding the scars of\r\nman's dominion over the earth. The two sat in silent thought.\r\nThis was the apex of their journey together, and the end.\r\nBehind this lofty table-land of the continent began the grim\r\ndesert, not yet subdued by man, and beyond came other fertile\r\nvalleys and other mountains, and finally another ocean. Thither\r\nhad been carried the same civilization, the same spirit of\r\nconquest and greed, and that noble aspiration after \"life,\r\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" bore the same fruit in\r\nthe blood of man. Wherever the victorious race had forced its\r\nway, it sowed the seeds of hate and industrial crime. And the\r\nflower must bloom, early or late, upon the lonely cattle ranch,\r\nin the primeval forest, the soft southern grove, or the virgin\r\nvalley of the \"promised land.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke the Anarch.\r\n\r\nIn the glimmering twilight the fierce eyes of the bearded one\r\nrested upon the wanderer.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough! God knows.\"\r\n\r\n\"So at last you understand the meaning of it all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet!\" And from the depth of his being there flashed the\r\ndemand, \"Why have you shown me the sore surface of life? What\r\nhave you to do with it? And what have I?\"\r\n\r\nHis guide replied, \"So you still long for the smooth paths\r\nof prosperity? You would like to shield your eyes from the\r\ndisagreeable aspects of a world that is good to you? You would\r\nstill have your comfort and your heart's desire? Your ambitious\r\nfancy still turns to the daughter of privilege, dainty and\r\nlovely and sweet to the eyes?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(The young man returns to the rich woman whom he had meant to\r\nmarry.)\r\n\r\nHe knelt and taking the hem of her garment held it in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"See!\" He crushed the soft fabric in his hand. \"Silk with\r\nthread of gold. It is the tears! See!\" He touched her girdle\r\nwith his hands. \"Gold and precious stones. They are the groans!\r\nSee!\" He put his fingers upon the golden hair. \"A wreath of\r\npure gold! Tears and groans and bloody sweat! You are a tissue\r\nof the lives of others, from feet to the crown upon your\r\nhair.... See!\" His hot hands crushed the orchids at her breast.\r\n\"Even the flower at your breast is stained with blood.... I see\r\nthe tears of others on your robe. I hear their sighs in your\r\nvoice. I see defeated desires in the light of your eyes.

He figures the world's toilers as the \"Sons of\r\n Martha,\" who, because their mother \"was rude to the Lord, her Guest,\"\r\n are condemned forever to unrequited toil. \"It is their care in all the\r\n ages to take the buffet and cushion the shock.\" The poem goes on to\r\n tell of the ignorance and torment in which they live--while the Sons\r\n of Mary, who \"have inherited that good part,\" live in ease upon their\r\n toil.)\r\n\r\n    \"They sit at the Feet--and they hear the Word--they see how\r\ntruly the promise runs.\r\n    They have cast their burdens upon the Lord, and--the Lord He\r\nlays them on Martha's sons.\"\r\n\r\n On the other hand the sons of Martha have to face reality.\r\n\r\n    \"They do not preach that their God will rouse them an hour\r\nbefore the nuts work loose,\r\n    They do not teach that His pity allows them to leave their work\r\nwhen they damn-well choose.\"\r\n\r\n The entire poem may be found in the 1918 Collected Edition of Mr.\r\n Kipling's poems.\r\n\r\n\r\nReflections Upon Poverty\r\n\r\n(_From \"The New Grub Street\"_)\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE GISSING\r\n\r\n (Novelist of English middle-class life, 1857-1903. Few have ever\r\n equalled him in the portrayal of the sordid, every-day realities of\r\n poverty. The story of his own tragic life is told in a novel called\r\n \"The Private Life of Henry Maitland,\" by Morley Roberts)\r\n\r\nAs there was sunshine Amy accompanied her husband for his walk\r\nin the afternoon; it was long since they had been out together.\r\nAn open carriage that passed, followed by two young girls on\r\nhorseback, gave a familiar direction to Reardon's thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"If one were as rich as those people. They pass so close to\r\nus; they see us, and we see them; but the distance between\r\nis infinity. They don't belong to the same world as we poor\r\nwretches. They see everything in a different light; they have\r\npowers which would seem supernatural if we were suddenly\r\nendowed with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" assented his companion with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Just fancy, if one got up in the morning with the thought that\r\nno reasonable desire that occurred to one throughout the day\r\nneed remain ungratified! And that it would be the same, any day\r\nand every day, to the end of one's life! Look at those houses;\r\nevery detail, within and without, luxurious. To have such a\r\nhome as that!\"\r\n\r\n\"And they are empty creatures who live there.\"\r\n\r\n\"They do _live_, Amy, at all events. Whatever may be their\r\nfaculties, they all have free scope. I have often stood staring\r\nat houses like these until I couldn't believe that the people\r\nowning them were mere human beings like myself. The power of\r\nmoney is so hard to realize, one who has never had it marvels\r\nat the completeness with which it transforms every detail of\r\nlife. Compare what we call our home with that of rich people;\r\nit moves one to scornful laughter. I have no sympathy with the\r\nstoical point of view; between wealth and poverty is just the\r\ndifference between the whole man and the maimed. If my lower\r\nlimbs are paralyzed I may still be able to think, but then\r\nthere is no such thing in life as walking. As a poor devil I\r\nmay live nobly; but one happens to be made with faculties of\r\nenjoyment, and those have to fall into atrophy. To be sure,\r\nmost rich people don't understand their happiness; if they did,\r\nthey would move and talk like gods--which indeed they are.\"\r\n\r\nAmy's brow was shadowed. A wise man, in Reardon's position,\r\nwould not have chosen this subject to dilate upon.\r\n\r\n\"The difference,\" he went on, \"between the man with money and\r\nthe man without is simply this: the one thinks, 'How shall I\r\nuse my life?' and the other, 'How shall I keep myself alive?'\r\nA physiologist ought to be able to discover some curious\r\ndistinction between the brain of a person who has never given\r\na thought to the means of subsistence, and that of one who has\r\nnever known a day free from such cares. There must be some\r\nspecial cerebral development representing the mental anguish\r\nkept up by poverty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say,\" put in Amy, \"that it affects every function of\r\nthe brain. It isn't a special point of suffering, but a misery\r\nthat colors every thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. Can I think of a single object in all the sphere of my\r\nexperience without the consciousness that I see it through the\r\nmedium of poverty? I have no enjoyment which isn't tainted\r\nby that thought, and I can suffer no pain which it doesn't\r\nincrease. The curse of poverty is to the modern world just what\r\nthat of slavery was to the ancient. Rich and destitute stand\r\nto each other as free man and bond. You remember the line of\r\nHomer I have often quoted about the demoralizing effect of\r\nenslavement; poverty degrades in the same way.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has had its effect upon me--I know that too well,\" said\r\nAmy, with bitter frankness.\r\n\r\nReardon glanced at her, and wished to make some reply, but he\r\ncould not say what was in his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Veins of Wealth\r\n\r\nBY JOHN RUSKIN\r\n\r\n(English art critic and university professor, 1819-1900; author\r\nof many works upon social questions, and master of perhaps the\r\ngreatest English prose style)\r\n\r\nPrimarily, which is very notable and curious, I observe that\r\nmen of business rarely know the meaning of the word \"rich.\" At\r\nleast if they know, they do not in their reasonings allow for\r\nthe fact, that it is a relative word, implying its opposite\r\n\"poor\" as positively as the word \"north\" implies its opposite\r\n\"south.\" Men nearly always speak and write as if riches were\r\nabsolute, and it were possible, by following certain scientific\r\nprecepts, for everybody to be rich. Whereas riches are a power\r\nlike that of electricity, acting only through inequalities\r\nor negations of itself. The force of the guinea you have in\r\nyour pocket depends wholly on the default of a guinea in your\r\nneighbor's pocket. If he did not want it, it would be of no\r\nuse to you; the degree of power it possesses depends accurately\r\nupon the need or desire he has for it,--and the art of making\r\nyourself rich, in the ordinary mercantile economist's sense,\r\nis therefore equally and necessarily the art of keeping your\r\nneighbor poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nLynggaard & Co.\r\n\r\nBY HJALMAR BERGSTRÖM\r\n\r\n (Contemporary Danish dramatist, born 1868. The present play deals with\r\n the modern industrial struggle. The wife of a great manufacturer has\r\n become the victim of melancholia after a strike)\r\n\r\nMRS. LYNGGAARD (_absorbed in her memories_):--I shall never\r\nforget the day when the people went back to work. I was\r\nwatching them from my bedroom window. For four months they had\r\nbeen starving--starving, do you understand?--they and theirs.\r\nThen they turned up again one winter morning before daylight,\r\nand there they stood and shivered in the yards. They had no\r\nover-clothes, of course, and they were shaking both from cold\r\nand from weakness. And then their faces were all covered with\r\nbeards, so that one couldn't recognize them. There they stood\r\nand waited a long time, a very long time.... At last Heymann\r\n[the manager] appeared in the doorway and read something from a\r\npaper. It was the conditions of surrender, I suppose. None of\r\nthem looked up. Then, as they were about to walk in and begin\r\nworking, Heymann stopped them by holding up his hand, and he\r\nsaid something I couldn't hear. But after a little while I saw\r\nOlsen [the strike-leader] standing all by himself in a cleared\r\nplace. (_A shiver runs through her at the recollection._) Once\r\nI saw a picture of an execution in a prison yard.... It lasted\r\nonly a few seconds. Then Olsen said a few words to his comrades\r\nand walked away, looking white as a ghost. The crowd opened up\r\nto let him pass through. Then the rest stood there for a while\r\nlooking so strangely depressed and not knowing what to do. And\r\nat last they went in, one by one, bent and broken.\r\n\r\nMIKKELSEN:--Olsen wasn't allowed to go back to work?\r\n\r\nMRS. LYNGGAARD:--It was he who had been their leader, and it\r\nwas his fault that they had held out as long as they did. And\r\nthen Olsen began to look for work elsewhere, but none of the\r\nother companies would have anything to do with him.\r\n\r\nMIKKELSEN (_shrugging his shoulders_):--War is war.\r\n\r\nMRS. LYNGGAARD:--A few months later, as I was taking a walk,\r\nI was stopped on the street by Olsen's wife. I tell you, the\r\nway she looked made my heart shrink within me. Her husband\r\nwas completely broken down, she told me. And on top of it all\r\nhe had taken to drink. Everything she and the children could\r\nscrape together, he spent on whiskey. She herself was so far\r\ngone with her eighth child that she would soon have to quit\r\nwork.... Then I went home to my husband and begged and prayed\r\nhim to take Olsen back and make a man of him again. It was the\r\nfirst time during our marriage that I saw him beside himself\r\nwith rage. There came into his eyes such an evil expression\r\nthat I wish I had never seen it, for I have never since been\r\nable to forget it entirely. But, of course, I guessed who was\r\nback of it. (_With emphasis._) Then I did the most humiliating\r\nthing I have ever done: I went in secret to Heymann and pleaded\r\nfor that discharged workman.\r\n\r\nMIKKELSEN:--Well, and Heymann?\r\n\r\nMRS. LYNGGAARD:--Since that moment I hate Heymann. There I was,\r\nhumbling myself before him. And he measured me with cold eyes\r\nand said: \"If I am to be in charge of this plant, madam, I must\r\nask once for all and absolutely, that no outsiders interfere\r\nwith the running of it.\"\r\n\r\nMIKKELSEN:--I don't see that he could have done anything else.\r\n\r\nMRS. LYNGGAARD:--What I cannot forgive myself is that I let\r\nmyself be imposed upon by that man. I behaved like a coward. At\r\nthat moment I should have gone to my husband and said: \"This is\r\nwhat has happened--now you must choose between Heymann and me!\"\r\nBut I was so cowardly, that I didn't even tell my husband what\r\nI had done.\r\n\r\nMIKKELSEN:--Nor was it proper for you to go behind your\r\nhusband's back like that.\r\n\r\nMRS. LYNGGAARD (_with an expression of abject horror in her\r\nfixed gaze_):--A little afterwards this thing happened. It was\r\none of the first warm summer days, and I was walking in the\r\ngarden with Jacob. At that time a splendid old chestnut tree\r\nwas growing in one corner. And there, in the midst of green\r\nleaves, and singing birds, Olsen was hanging, cold and dead.\r\nAnd the flies were crawling in and out of his face.... (_She\r\ntrembles visibly._)\r\n\r\nMIKKELSEN:--Yes, life is cruel.\r\n\r\nMRS. LYNGGAARD:--And there I perceived for the first time how\r\nutterly poor a human being may become. Anything so pitiful\r\nand miserable I had never seen before. There was no sign of\r\nunderclothing between his trousers and the vest. And I don't\r\nknow why, but it seemed almost as if this was what hurt me\r\nmost--much more than that he had hanged himself.... And since\r\nthat day I haven't known a single hour of happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Religion\r\n\r\nBY LEO TOLSTOY\r\n\r\n(From an essay in which the Russian novelist and reformer,\r\n1828-1910, has set forth the creed by which he lived)\r\n\r\nWhat is the law of nature? Is it to know that my security\r\nand that of my family, all my amusements and pleasures, are\r\npurchased at the expense of misery, deprivation, and suffering\r\nto thousands of human beings--by the terror of the gallows; by\r\nthe misfortune of thousands stifling within prison walls; by\r\nthe fears inspired by millions of soldiers and guardians of\r\ncivilization, torn from their homes and besotted by discipline,\r\nto protect our pleasures with loaded revolvers against the\r\npossible interference of the famishing! Is it to purchase every\r\nfragment of bread that I put in my mouth and the mouths of my\r\nchildren by the numberless privations that are necessary to\r\nprocure my abundance? Or is it to be certain that my piece of\r\nbread only belongs to me when I know that everyone else has a\r\nshare, and that no one starves while I eat?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Octopus[A]\r\n\r\n[A] By permission of Doubleday, Page & Co.\r\n\r\nBY FRANK NORRIS\r\n\r\n (The young American novelist, 1870-1902, planned this as the first\r\n of a trilogy of novels, the \"Epic of the Wheat.\" The second volume,\r\n \"The Pit,\" was written, but his death interrupted the third. The\r\n present story narrates the long struggle between the farmers of the\r\n San Joaquin valley and the railroad \"octopus.\" The farmers have been\r\n beaten, and several of them killed while resisting eviction from their\r\n homes. The hero is at a dinner party in San Francisco, at the same\r\n time that the widow and child of one of the victims are wandering the\r\n streets outside)\r\n\r\nAll around the table conversations were going forward gayly.\r\nThe good wines had broken up the slight restraint of the\r\nearly part of the evening and a spirit of good humor and good\r\nfellowship prevailed. Young Lambery and Mr. Gerard were deep\r\nin reminiscences of certain mutual duck-shooting expeditions.\r\nMrs. Gerard and Mrs. Cedarquist discussed a novel--a strange\r\nmingling of psychology, degeneracy, and analysis of erotic\r\nconditions--which had just been translated from the Italian.\r\nStephen Lambert and Beatrice disputed over the merits of a\r\nScotch collie just given to the young lady. The scene was gay,\r\nthe electric bulbs sparkled, the wine flashing back the light.\r\nThe entire table was a vague glow of white napery, delicate\r\nchina, and glass as brilliant as crystal. Behind the guests the\r\nserving-men came and went, filling the glasses continually,\r\nchanging the covers, serving the entrées, managing the dinner\r\nwithout interruption, confusion, or the slightest unnecessary\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nBut Presley could find no enjoyment in the occasion. From that\r\npicture of feasting, that scene of luxury, that atmosphere of\r\ndecorous, well-bred refinement, his thoughts went back to Los\r\nMuertos and Quien Sabe and the irrigating ditch at Hooven's.\r\nHe saw them fall, one by one, Harran, Annixter, Osterman,\r\nBroderson, Hooven. The clink of the wine glasses was drowned\r\nin the explosion of revolvers. The Railroad might indeed be a\r\nforce only, which no man could control and for which no man\r\nwas responsible, but his friends had been killed, but years\r\nof extortion and oppression had wrung money from all the San\r\nJoaquin, money that had made possible this very scene in which\r\nhe found himself. Because Magnus had been beggared, Gerard had\r\nbecome Railroad King; because the farmers of the valley were\r\npoor, these men were rich.\r\n\r\nThe fancy grew big in his mind, distorted, caricatured,\r\nterrible. Because the farmers had been killed at the irrigating\r\nditch, these others, Gerard and his family, fed full. They\r\nfattened on the blood of the People, on the blood of the men\r\nwho had been killed at the ditch. It was a half-ludicrous,\r\nhalf-horrible \"dog eat dog,\" an unspeakable cannibalism.\r\nHarran, Annixter, and Hooven were being devoured there under\r\nhis eyes. These dainty women, his cousin Beatrice and little\r\nMiss Gerard, frail, delicate; all these fine ladies with their\r\nsmall fingers and slender necks, suddenly were transfigured in\r\nhis tortured mind into harpies tearing human flesh. His head\r\nswam with the horror of it, the terror of it. Yes, the People\r\n_would_ turn some day, and, turning, rend those who now preyed\r\nupon them. It would be \"dog eat dog\" again, with positions\r\nreversed, and he saw for an instant of time that splendid house\r\nsacked to its foundations, the tables overturned, the pictures\r\ntorn, the hangings blazing, and Liberty, the red-handed Man\r\nin the Street, grimed with powder smoke, foul with the gutter,\r\nrush yelling, torch in hand, through every door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock Mrs. Hooven fell.\r\n\r\nLuckily she was leading Hilda by the hand at the time and the\r\nlittle girl was not hurt. In vain had Mrs. Hooven, hour after\r\nhour, walked the streets. After a while she no longer made any\r\nattempt to beg; nobody was stirring, nor did she even try to\r\nhunt for food with the stray dogs and cats. She had made up her\r\nmind to return to the park in order to sit upon the benches\r\nthere, but she had mistaken the direction, and, following up\r\nSacramento Street, had come out at length, not upon the park,\r\nbut upon a great vacant lot at the very top of the Clay Street\r\nhill. The ground was unfenced and rose above her to form the\r\ncap of the hill, all overgrown with bushes and a few stunted\r\nlive-oaks. It was in trying to cross this piece of ground that\r\nshe fell....\r\n\r\n\"You going to sleep, mammy?\" inquired Hilda, touching her face.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooven roused herself a little.\r\n\r\n\"Hey? Vat you say? Asleep? Yais, I guess I wass asleep.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice trailed unintelligibly to silence again. She was not,\r\nhowever, asleep. Her eyes were open. A grateful numbness had\r\nbegun to creep over her, a pleasing semi-insensibility. She no\r\nlonger felt the pain and cramps of her stomach, even the hunger\r\nwas ceasing to bite.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"These stuffed artichokes are delicious, Mrs. Gerard, murmured\r\nyoung Lambert, wiping his lips with a corner of his napkin.\r\n\"Pardon me for mentioning it, but your dinner must be my\r\nexcuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this asparagus--since Mr. Lambert has set the bad\r\nexample,\" observed Mrs. Cedarquist, \"so delicate, such an\r\nexquisite flavor. How _do_ you manage?\"\r\n\r\n\"We get all our asparagus from the southern part of the State,\r\nfrom one particular ranch,\" explained Mrs. Gerard. \"We order it\r\nby wire and get it only twenty hours after cutting. My husband\r\nsees to it that it is put on a special train. It stops at this\r\nranch just to take on our asparagus. Extravagant, isn't it, but\r\nI simply can not eat asparagus that has been cut more than a\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" exclaimed Julian Lambert, who posed as an epicure. \"I\r\ncan tell to an hour just how long asparagus has been picked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fancy eating ordinary market asparagus,\" said Mrs. Gerard,\r\n\"that has been fingered by Heaven knows how many hands.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Mammy, mammy, wake up,\" cried Hilda, trying to push open Mrs.\r\nHooven's eyelids, at last closed. \"Mammy, don't. You're just\r\ntrying to frighten me.\"\r\n\r\nFeebly Hilda shook her by the shoulder. At last Mrs. Hooven's\r\nlips stirred. Putting her head down, Hilda distinguished the\r\nwhispered words:\r\n\r\n\"I'm sick. Go to schleep.... Sick.... Noddings to eat.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dessert was a wonderful preparation of alternate layers of\r\nbiscuit, glacés, ice cream, and candied chestnuts.\r\n\r\n\"Delicious, is it not?\" observed Julian Lambert, partly\r\nto himself, partly to Miss Cedarquist. \"This _Moscovite\r\nfouetté_--upon my word, I have never tasted its equal.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you should know, shouldn't you?\" returned the young lady.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Mammy, mammy, wake up,\" cried Hilda. \"Don't sleep so. I'm\r\nfrightened.\"\r\n\r\nRepeatedly she shook her; repeatedly she tried to raise the\r\ninert eyelids with the point of her finger. But her mother no\r\nlonger stirred. The gaunt, lean body, with its bony face and\r\nsunken eye-sockets, lay back, prone upon the ground, the feet\r\nupturned and showing the ragged, worn soles of the shoes, the\r\nforehead and gray hair beaded with fog, the poor, faded bonnet\r\nawry, the poor, faded dress soiled and torn.\r\n\r\nHilda drew close to her mother, kissing her face, twining\r\nher arms around her neck. For a long time she lay that way,\r\nalternately sobbing and sleeping. Then, after a long time,\r\nthere was a stir. She woke from a doze to find a police officer\r\nand two or three other men bending over her. Some one carried a\r\nlantern. Terrified, smitten dumb, she was unable to answer the\r\nquestions put to her. Then a woman, evidently the mistress of\r\nthe house on the top of the hill, arrived and took Hilda in her\r\narms and cried over her.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take the little girl,\" she said to the police officer.\r\n\"But the mother, can you save her? Is she too far gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've sent for a doctor,\" replied the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJust before the ladies left the table, young Lambert raised\r\nhis glass of Madeira. Turning towards the wife of the Railroad\r\nKing, he said:\r\n\r\n\"My best compliments for a delightful dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who had been bending over Mrs. Hooven, rose.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use,\" he said; \"she has been dead some\r\ntime--exhaustion from starvation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBY ANATOLE FRANCE\r\n\r\nThe law in its majestic equality forbids the rich as well as\r\nthe poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets and to\r\nsteal bread.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress and Poverty\r\n\r\nBY HENRY GEORGE\r\n\r\n (One of the most widely-read treatises upon economics ever published,\r\n this book was the fountain head of the single-tax movement. The writer\r\n was a California journalist, 1839-1897, who devoted all his life to\r\n the propaganda of economic justice)\r\n\r\nUnpleasant as it may be to admit it, it is at last becoming\r\nevident that the enormous increase in productive power which\r\nhas marked the present century and is still going on with\r\naccelerating ratio, has no tendency to extirpate poverty or\r\nto lighten the burdens of those compelled to toil. It simply\r\nwidens the gulf between Dives and Lazarus, and makes the\r\nstruggle for existence more intense. The march of invention\r\nhas clothed mankind with powers of which a century ago the\r\nboldest imagination could not have dreamed. But in factories\r\nwhere labor-saving machinery has reached its most wonderful\r\ndevelopment, little children are at work; wherever the new\r\nforces are anything like fully utilized, large classes\r\nare maintained by charity or live on the verge of recourse\r\nto it; amid the greatest accumulations of wealth, men die\r\nof starvation, and puny infants suckle dry breasts; while\r\neverywhere the greed of gain, the worship of wealth, shows the\r\nforce of the fear of want. The promised land flies before us\r\nlike the mirage. The fruits of the tree of knowledge turn, as\r\nwe grasp them, to apples of Sodom that crumble at the touch....\r\n\r\nThis association of poverty with progress is the great enigma\r\nof our times. It is the central fact from which spring\r\nindustrial, social, and political difficulties that perplex\r\nthe world, and with which statesmanship and philanthropy\r\nand education grapple in vain. From it come the clouds that\r\noverhang the future of the most progressive and self-reliant\r\nnations. It is the riddle which the Sphinx of Fate puts to\r\nour civilization, and which not to answer is to be destroyed.\r\nSo long as all the increased wealth which modern progress\r\nbrings goes but to build up great fortunes, to increase\r\nluxury and make sharper the contrast between the House of\r\nHave and the House of Want, progress is not real and cannot\r\nbe permanent. The reaction must come. The tower leans from\r\nits foundations, and every new story but hastens the final\r\ncatastrophe. To educate men who must be condemned to poverty,\r\nis but to make them restive; to base on a state of most glaring\r\nsocial inequality political institutions under which men are\r\ntheoretically equal, is to stand a pyramid on its apex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n_The Outcast_\r\n\r\n The life of the underworld, of those thrown upon the scrap-heap of the\r\n modern industrial machine; vivid and powerful passages portraying the\r\n lives of tramps, criminals and prostitutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot Guilty\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT BLATCHFORD\r\n\r\n(See page 66)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn defending the Bottom Dog I do not deal with hard science\r\nonly; but with the dearest faiths, the oldest wrongs and the\r\nmost awful relationships of the great human family, for whose\r\ngood I strive and to whose judgment I appeal. Knowing, as I do,\r\nhow the hard-working and hard-playing public shun laborious\r\nthinking and serious writing, and how they hate to have their\r\nease disturbed or their prejudices handled rudely, I still make\r\nbold to undertake this task, because of the vital nature of the\r\nproblems I shall probe.\r\n\r\nThe case for the Bottom Dog should touch the public heart\r\nto the quick, for it affects the truth of our religions,\r\nthe justice of our laws and the destinies of our children\r\nand our children's children. Much golden eloquence has been\r\nsquandered in praise of the successful and the good; much stern\r\ncondemnation has been vented upon the wicked. I venture now\r\nto plead for those of our poor brothers and sisters who are\r\naccursed of Christ and rejected of men.\r\n\r\nHitherto all the love, all the honors, all the applause of this\r\nworld, and all the rewards of heaven, have been lavished on the\r\nfortunate and the strong; and the portion of the unfriended\r\nBottom Dog, in his adversity and weakness, has been curses,\r\nblows, chains, the gallows and everlasting damnation. I shall\r\nplead, then, for those who are loathed and tortured and branded\r\nas the sinful and unclean; for those who have hated us and\r\nwronged us, and have been wronged and hated by us. I shall\r\ndefend them for right's sake, for pity's sake and for the\r\nbenefit of society and the race. For these also are of our\r\nflesh, these also have erred and gone astray, these also are\r\nvictims of an inscrutable and relentless Fate.\r\n\r\nIf it concerns us that the religions of the world are childish\r\ndreams or nightmares; if it concerns us that our penal laws and\r\nmoral codes are survivals of barbarism and fear; if it concerns\r\nus that our most cherished and venerable ideas of our relations\r\nto God and to each other are illogical and savage, then the\r\ncase for the Bottom Dog concerns us nearly.\r\n\r\nIf it moves us to learn that disease may be prevented, that\r\nruin may be averted, that broken hearts and broken lives may\r\nbe made whole; if it inspires us to hear how beauty may be\r\nconjured out of loathsomeness and glory out of shame; how\r\nwaste may be turned to wealth and death to life, and despair\r\nto happiness, then the case for the Bottom Dog is a case to be\r\nwell and truly tried.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoleskin Joe[A]\r\n\r\n[A] By permission of E.

Here today, gone tomorrow; always waiting for a good\r\ntime comin' and knowin' that it will never come. We work with\r\none mate this evenin', we beg for crumbs with another on the\r\nmornin' after. It's a bad life, ours, and a poor one, when I\r\ncome to think of it, Flynn.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all that,\" I assented heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Look at me!\" said Joe, clenching his fists and squaring his\r\nshoulders. \"I must be close on forty years, maybe on the\r\ngraveyard side of it, for all I know. I've horsed it ever since\r\nI can mind; I've worked like a mule for years, and what have I\r\nto show for it all today, matey? Not the price of an ounce of\r\ntobacco! A midsummer scarecrow wouldn't wear the duds that I've\r\nto wrap around my hide! A cockle-picker that has no property\r\nonly when the tide is out is as rich as I am. Not the price of\r\nan ounce of tobacco! There is something wrong with men like\r\nus, surely, when we're treated like swine in a sty for all the\r\nyears of our life. It's not so bad here, but it's in the big\r\ntowns that a man can feel it most. No person cares for the\r\nlike of us, Flynn. I've worked nearly ev'rywhere; I've helped\r\nto build bridges, dams, houses, ay, and towns! When they were\r\nfinished, what happened? Was it for us--the men who did the\r\nbuildin'--to live in the homes that we built, or walk through\r\nthe streets that we laid down? No earthly chance of that! It\r\nwas always, 'Slide! we don't need you any more,' and then a man\r\nlike me, as helped to build a thousand houses big as castles,\r\nwas hellish glad to get the shelter of a ten-acre field and\r\na shut-gate between me and the winds of night. I've spent all\r\nmy money, have I? It's bloomin' easy to spend all that fellows\r\nlike us can earn. When I was in London I saw a lady spend as\r\nmuch on fur to decorate her carcase with as would keep me in\r\nbeer and tobacco for all the rest of my life. And that same\r\nlady would decorate a dog in ribbons and fol-the-dols, and she\r\nwouldn't give me the smell of a crust when I asked her for a\r\nmouthful of bread. What could you expect from a woman who wears\r\nthe furry hide of some animal round her neck, anyhow? We are\r\nnot thought as much of as dogs, Flynn. By God! them rich buckos\r\ndo eat an awful lot. Many a time I crept up to a window just to\r\nsee them gorgin' themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have looked in at windows too,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Most men do,\" answered Joe. \"You've heard of old Moses goin'\r\nup the hill to have a bit peep at the Promist Land. He was just\r\nlike me and you, Flynn, wantin' to have a peep at the things\r\nwhich he'd never lay his claws on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those women who sit half-naked at the table have big\r\nappetites,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"They're all gab and guts, like young crows,\" said Moleskin.\r\n\"And they think more of their dogs than they do of men like me\r\nand you. I'm an Antichrist!\"\r\n\r\n\"A what?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of them sort of fellows as throws bombs at kings.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean an Anarchist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, whatever they are, I'm one. What is the good of kings,\r\nof fine-feathered ladies, of churches, of anything in the\r\ncountry, to men like me and you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carter and the Carpenter[A]\r\n\r\n[A] By permission of the Macmillan Co.\r\n\r\n(_From \"The People of the Abyss\"_)\r\n\r\nBY JACK LONDON\r\n\r\n(See page 62)\r\n\r\nThe Carter, with his clean-cut face, chin beard, and shaved\r\nupper lip, I should have taken in the United States for\r\nanything from a master workman to a well-to-do farmer. The\r\nCarpenter--well, I should have taken him for a carpenter. He\r\nlooked it, lean and wiry, with shrewd, observant eyes, and\r\nhands that had grown twisted to the handles of tools through\r\nforty-seven years' work at the trade. The chief difficulty with\r\nthese men was that they were old, and that their children,\r\ninstead of growing up to take care of them, had died. Their\r\nyears had told on them, and they had been forced out of the\r\nwhirl of industry by the younger and stronger competitors who\r\nhad taken their places.\r\n\r\nThese two men, turned away from the casual ward of Whitechapel\r\nWorkhouse, were bound with me for Poplar Workhouse. Not much of\r\na show, they thought, but to chance it was all that remained\r\nto us. It was Poplar, or the streets and night. Both men were\r\nanxious for a bed, for they were \"about gone,\" as they phrased\r\nit. The Carter, fifty-eight years of age, had spent the last\r\nthree nights without shelter or sleep, while the Carpenter,\r\nsixty-five years of age, had been out five nights.\r\n\r\nBut, O dear, soft people, full of meat and blood, with white\r\nbeds and airy rooms waiting you each night, how can I make you\r\nknow what it is to suffer as you would suffer if you spent a\r\nweary night on London's streets? Believe me, you would think\r\na thousand centuries had come and gone before the east paled\r\ninto dawn; you would shiver till you were ready to cry aloud\r\nwith the pain of each aching muscle; and you would marvel that\r\nyou could endure so much and live. Should you rest upon a\r\nbench, and your tired eyes close, depend upon it the policeman\r\nwould rouse you and gruffly order you to \"move on.\" You may\r\nrest upon the bench, and benches are few and far between; but\r\nif rest means sleep, on you must go, dragging your tired body\r\nthrough the endless streets. Should you, in desperate slyness,\r\nseek some forlorn alley, or dark passage-way, and lie down, the\r\nomnipresent policeman will rout you out just the same. It is\r\nhis business to rout you out. It is a law of the powers that be\r\nthat you shall be routed out.\r\n\r\nBut when the dawn came, the nightmare over, you would hale you\r\nhome to refresh yourself, and until you died you would tell the\r\nstory of your adventure to groups of admiring friends. It would\r\ngrow into a mighty story. Your little eight-hour night would\r\nbecome an Odyssey and you a Homer.\r\n\r\nNot so with these homeless ones who walked to Poplar Workhouse\r\nwith me. And there are thirty-five thousand of them, men and\r\nwomen, in London Town this night. Please don't remember it as\r\nyou go to bed; if you are as soft as you ought to be you may\r\nnot rest so well as usual. But for old men of sixty, seventy,\r\nand eighty, ill-fed, with neither meat nor blood, to greet the\r\ndawn unrefreshed, and to stagger through the day in mad search\r\nfor crusts, with relentless night rushing down upon them again,\r\nand to do this five nights and days--O dear, soft people, full\r\nof meat and blood, how can you ever understand?\r\n\r\nI walked up Mile End Road between the Carter and the Carpenter.\r\nMile End Road is a wide thoroughfare, cutting the heart of East\r\nLondon, and there are tens of thousands of people abroad on it.\r\nI tell you this so that you may fully appreciate what I shall\r\ndescribe in the next paragraph. As I say, we walked along, and\r\nwhen they grew bitter and cursed the land, I cursed with them,\r\ncursed as an American waif would curse, stranded in a strange\r\nand terrible land. And, as I tried to lead them to believe, and\r\nsucceeded in making them believe, they took me for a \"seafaring\r\nman,\" who had spent his money in riotous living, lost his\r\nclothes (no unusual occurrence with seafaring men ashore), and\r\nwas temporarily broke while looking for a ship. This accounted\r\nfor my ignorance of English ways in general and casual wards in\r\nparticular, and my curiosity concerning the same.\r\n\r\nThe Carter was hard put to keep the pace at which we walked (he\r\ntold me that he had eaten nothing that day), but the Carpenter,\r\nlean and hungry, his grey and ragged overcoat flapping\r\nmournfully in the breeze, swung on in a lone and tireless\r\nstride which reminded me strongly of the plains wolf or coyote.\r\nBoth kept their eyes upon the pavement as they walked and\r\ntalked, and every now and then one or the other would stoop\r\nand pick something up, never missing his stride the while. I\r\nthought it was cigar and cigarette stumps they were collecting,\r\nand for some time took no notice. Then I did notice.\r\n\r\n_From the slimy, spittle-drenched sidewalk, they were picking\r\nup bits of orange peel, apple skin, and grape stems, and they\r\nwere eating them. The pits of greengage plums they cracked\r\nbetween their teeth for the kernels inside. They picked up\r\nstray crumbs of bread the size of peas, apple cores so black\r\nand dirty one would not take them to be apple cores, and these\r\nthings these two men took into their mouths, and chewed them,\r\nand swallowed them; and this, between six and seven o'clock in\r\nthe evening of August 20, year of our Lord 1902, in the heart\r\nof the greatest, wealthiest, and most powerful empire the world\r\nhas ever seen._\r\n\r\nThese two men talked. They were not fools, they were merely\r\nold. And, naturally, their guts a-reek with pavement offal,\r\nthey talked of bloody revolution. They talked as anarchists,\r\nfanatics, and madmen would talk. And who shall blame them?\r\nIn spite of my three good meals that day, and the snug bed I\r\ncould occupy if I wished, and my social philosophy, and my\r\nevolutionary belief in the slow development and metamorphosis\r\nof things--in spite of all this, I say, I felt impelled to talk\r\nrot with them or hold my tongue. Poor fools! Not of their sort\r\nare revolutions bred. And when they are dead and dust, which\r\nwill be shortly, other fools will talk bloody revolution as\r\nthey gather offal from the spittle-drenched sidewalk along Mile\r\nEnd Road to Poplar Workhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\n(American editor, 1811-1872; prominent abolitionist)\r\n\r\nMorality and religion are but words to him who fishes in\r\ngutters for the means of sustaining life, and crouches behind\r\nbarrels in the street for shelter from the cutting blasts of a\r\nwinter night.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hunt for the Job\r\n\r\n(_From \"Pay Envelopes\"_)\r\n\r\nBY JAMES OPPENHEIM\r\n\r\n(See page 45)\r\n\r\nThe Hunt began early next morning--the Hunt for the Job. The\r\nhunter, however, is really the hunted. Now and then he bares\r\nhis skin to the unthinking blows of the world, and runs off to\r\nhide himself in the crowd. You may see him bobbing along the\r\nturbulent man-currents of Broadway, a tide-tossed derelict in\r\nthe thousand-foot shadows of the sky-scrapers. The mob about\r\nhim is lusty with purpose, each unit making his appointed\r\nplace, the morning rush to work bearing the stenographer to\r\nher machine, the broker to his ticker, the ironworker to his\r\nsky-dangling beam. In the mighty machine of the city each\r\nhas his place, each is provided for, each gets the glow of\r\nsharing in the world's work. The morning rush, splashed at\r\nstreet crossings with the gold of the Eastern sun, is rippled\r\nwith fresh eyes and busy lips. They are all in the machine.\r\nBut our young man crouching in a corner of the crowded car\r\nis not of these; slinking down Broadway he is aware that the\r\nmachine has thrown him out and he cannot get in. He is an exile\r\nin the midst of his own people. The sense of loneliness and\r\ninferiority eats the heart out of the breast; the good of life\r\nis gone; the blackness soaks across the city and into his home,\r\nhis love, his soul.\r\n\r\nSome go bitter and are for throwing bombs; some despair and\r\nare for wiping themselves away; some--the rank and file--are\r\nfor fighting to the last ditch. Peter pendulated between all\r\nthree of these moods. In ordinary times he would have been\r\nall fight; in these hard times, drenched with the broadcast\r\nhopelessness of men, he knew he was foredoomed to defeat. Only\r\na miracle could save him.\r\n\r\nTrudging up Seventy-ninth Street to Third Avenue, fresh with\r\nAnnie's kiss and the baby's pranks, he had the last bit of\r\ndaring dashed out of him by a strange throng of men. Before\r\na small Hebrew synagogue, packed in the deep area were forty\r\nunemployed workers, jammed crowd-thick against the windows and\r\ngate. It was fresh weather, not cold, yet the men shivered.\r\nTheir bodies had for long been unwarmed by sufficient food\r\nor clothing; there was a grayness about them as of famished\r\nwolves; their lips and fingers were blue; they were unshaved\r\nand frowzy with some vile sleeping place. Hard times had\r\nblotched the city with a myriad of such groups. And as Peter\r\nstopped and imagined himself driven at last among them, he\r\nsaw a burly fellow emerge from the house and begin handing\r\nout charity bowls of hot coffee and charity bread. Peter,\r\nindependent American workman, was stung at the sight; the souls\r\nof these workers were somehow being outraged; they were eating\r\nout of the hands of the comfortable, like so many gutter dogs.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the morning Peter dared now and then to present\r\nhimself at an office to ask work. At some places he tried\r\nboldness, at others meekness, and at last he begged, \"For\r\nGod's sake, I have a wife and baby--\" He met with various\r\nreceptions at the hands of clerks, office boys, and bosses. A\r\nfew were sorry, some turned their backs, the rest hurried him\r\nout. Each refusal, each \"not wanted in the scheme of things,\"\r\nshot him out into the streets, stripped of another bit of\r\nself-reliance. In spite of himself, he began to feel his poor\r\nappearance, his drooping lip, his broken purpose. He was a\r\nfailure and the world could not use him. He hardly dared to\r\nlook a man in the eyes, to lift his voice above a whisper, to\r\nmake a demand, to dare a refusal. He slunk home at last like a\r\ncowed and beaten animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unemployable\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Workers\"_)\r\n\r\nBY WALTER A. WYCKOFF\r\n\r\n(A professor in Princeton University who went out and lived\r\nfor long periods as a laborer, in order to know the facts of\r\nindustry at first hand)\r\n\r\nMany of the men were so weakened by the want and hardship of\r\nthe winter that they were no longer in condition for effective\r\nlabor. Some of the bosses who were in need of added hands\r\nwere obliged to turn men away because of physical incapacity.\r\nOne instance of this I shall not soon forget. It was when I\r\noverheard, early one morning, at a factory gate, an interview\r\nbetween a would-be laborer and the boss. I knew the applicant\r\nfor a Russian Jew, who had at home an old mother and a wife\r\nand two young children to support. He had had intermittent\r\nemployment throughout the winter in a sweater's den, barely\r\nenough to keep them all alive, and, after the hardships of the\r\ncold season, he was again in desperate straits for work.\r\n\r\nThe boss had all but agreed to take him on for some sort of\r\nunskilled labor, when, struck by the cadaverous look of the\r\nman, he told him to bare his arm. Up went the sleeve of his\r\ncoat and his ragged flannel shirt, exposing a naked arm with\r\nthe muscles nearly gone, and the blue-white transparent skin\r\nstretched over sinews and the outline of the bones. Pitiful\r\nbeyond words were his efforts to give a semblance of strength\r\nto the biceps which rose faintly to the upward movement of\r\nthe forearm. But the boss sent him off with an oath and a\r\ncontemptuous laugh, and I watched the fellow as he turned\r\ndown the street, facing the fact of his starving family with\r\na despair at his heart which only mortal man can feel and no\r\nmortal tongue can speak.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bread Line\r\n\r\nBY BERTON BRALEY\r\n\r\n(Contemporary American poet)\r\n\r\n    Well, here they are--they stand and stamp and shiver\r\n      Waiting their food from some kind stranger hand,\r\n    Their weary limbs with eagerness a-quiver\r\n      Hungry and heartsick in a bounteous land.\r\n\r\n    \"Beggars and bums?\" Perhaps, and largely worthless.\r\n      Shaky with drink, unlovely, craven, low,\r\n    With obscene tongues and hollow laughter mirthless;\r\n      But who shall give them scorn for being so?\r\n\r\n    Yes, here they are--with gaunt and pallid faces,\r\n      With limbs ill-clad and fingers stiff and blued,\r\n    Shuffling and stamping on their pavement places,\r\n      Waiting and watching for their bit of food.\r\n\r\n    We boast of vast achievements and of power,\r\n      Of human progress knowing no defeat,\r\n    Of strange new marvels every day and hour--\r\n      And here's the bread line in the wintry street!\r\n\r\n    Ten thousand years of war and peace and glory,\r\n      Of hope and work and deeds and golden schemes,\r\n    Of mighty voices raised in song and story,\r\n      Of huge inventions and of splendid dreams;\r\n\r\n    Ten thousand years replete with every wonder,\r\n      Of empires risen and of empires dead;\r\n    Yet still, while wasters roll in swollen plunder,\r\n      These broken men must stand in line--for bread!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unemployed Problem\r\n\r\n(_From \"Past and Present\"_)\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS CARLYLE\r\n\r\n(See pages 31, 74)\r\n\r\nAnd truly this first practical form of the Sphinx-question,\r\ninarticulately and so audibly put there, is one of the most\r\nimpressive ever asked in the world. \"Behold us here, so many\r\nthousands, millions, and increasing at the rate of fifty every\r\nhour.

Within this compartment,\r\nand leaving but a narrow circumscribing border, was a sort\r\nof cattle-pen, into which the paupers crushed, awaiting amid\r\ndiscomfort and universal jabber the divine moment. The single\r\njet of gas-light depending from the ceiling flared upon the\r\nstrange simian faces, and touched them into a grotesque\r\npicturesqueness that would have delighted Doré.\r\n\r\nThey felt hungry, these picturesque people; their near and\r\ndear ones were hungering at home. Voluptuously savoring\r\nin imagination the operation of the soup, they forgot its\r\noperation as a dole in aid of wages; were unconscious of the\r\ngrave economical possibilities of pauperization and the rest,\r\nand quite willing to swallow their independence with the soup.\r\nEven Esther, who had read much, and was sensitive, accepted\r\nunquestioningly the theory of the universe that was held by\r\nmost people about her, that human beings were distinguished\r\nfrom animals in having to toil terribly for a meagre crust,\r\nbut that their lot was lightened by the existence of a small\r\nand semi-divine class called _Takeefim_, or rich people, who\r\ngave away what they didn't want. How these rich people came\r\nto be, Esther did not inquire; they were as much a part of the\r\nconstitution of things as clouds and horses. The semi-celestial\r\nvariety was rarely to be met with. It lived far away from\r\nthe Ghetto, and a small family of it was said to occupy a\r\nwhole house. Representatives of it, clad in rustling silks or\r\nimpressive broad-cloth, and radiating an indefinable aroma of\r\nsuper-humanity, sometimes came to the school, preceded by the\r\nbeaming Head Mistress; and then all the little girls rose and\r\ncurtseyed, and the best of them, passing as average members\r\nof the class, astonished the semi-divine persons by their\r\nintimate acquaintance with the topography of the Pyrenees and\r\nthe disagreements of Saul and David, the intercourse of the two\r\nspecies ending in effusive smiles and general satisfaction. But\r\nthe dullest of the girls was alive to the comedy, and had a\r\ngood-humored contempt for the unworldliness of the semi-divine\r\npersons, who spoke to them as if they were not going to\r\nrecommence squabbling, and pulling one another's hair, and\r\ncopying one another's sums, and stealing one another's needles,\r\nthe moment the semi-celestial backs were turned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WITHOUT A KENNEL\r\n\r\nRYAN WALKER\r\n\r\n(_American Socialist cartoonist, born 1870_)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WHITE SLAVE\r\n\r\nABASTENIA ST.

Now it is three stages of man--no more: man gushing,\r\nconfiding, uplifted, as he feels the effect of the lighter\r\nfumes; disputatious, quarrelsome, as the heavier mount in a\r\nsecond brew of hell; raging with wrath and hate, as the very\r\ndregs send their emanations to the tortured brain.\r\n\r\nThe embrace, the wrangle, and the blow--this is the order\r\nof succession. Till one--to mark it by the clock--we sing,\r\n\"'Art to 'art an' 'and to 'and.\" At about one forty-five you\r\nmay expect the tribal row between the gangs, who prey on one\r\nanother for recreation, and on society for a living. Our brutes\r\nread the current gospel of the survival of the fittest in\r\ntheir own way, and they dimly apprehend that mankind is still\r\norganized as a predatory horde. The ever-open door brings us\r\nmuch trouble from the outside. The unlighted staircase is a\r\nplace of rendezvous, and, not unfrequently, of deadly quarrel,\r\nin undertones of concentrated fury, between wretches who seek\r\nseclusion for the work of manslaughter. Our latest returning\r\ninmate, the other night, stumbled over the body of a woman\r\nnot known at No. 5. She had been kicked to death within sight\r\nand sound of lodgers who, believing it to be a matrimonial\r\ndifference, held interference to be no business of theirs.\r\n\r\nThe first thud of war between the \"Hooligans\" is generally for\r\ntwo sharp. The seconds set to, along with their principals,\r\nas in the older duel. For mark that in most things we are as\r\nour betters were just so many centuries ago, and are simply\r\nbelated with our flint age. And now our shapelier waves of\r\nsound break into a mere foam of oath and shriek. At times there\r\nis an interval of silence more awful than the tumult; and you\r\nmay know that the knife is at its silent work, and that the\r\nwhole meaner conflict is suspended for an episode of tragedy.\r\nIf it is a hospital case, it closes the celebration. If it is\r\nnot, the entertainment probably dies out in a slanging match\r\nbetween two of the fair; and the unnamable in invective and\r\nvituperation rises, as in blackest vapor, from our pit to the\r\nsky. At this, every room that holds a remnant of decency closes\r\nits window, and all withdraw, except, perhaps, the little boys\r\nand girls, who are beginning to pair according to the laws of\r\nthe ooze and of the slime....\r\n\r\n\r\nNight in the Slums[A]\r\n\r\n[A] By permission of the Macmillan Co.\r\n\r\n(_From \"The People of the Abyss\"_)\r\n\r\nBY JACK LONDON\r\n\r\n(See pages 62, 125)\r\n\r\nI was glad the keepers were there, for I did not have on my\r\n\"seafaring\" clothes, and I was what is called a \"mark\" for\r\nthe creatures of prey that prowled up and down. At times,\r\nbetween keepers, these males looked at me sharply, hungrily,\r\ngutter-wolves that they were, and I was afraid of their hands,\r\nof their naked hands, as one may be afraid of the paws of a\r\ngorilla. They reminded me of gorillas. Their bodies were small,\r\nill-shaped, and squat. There were no swelling muscles, no\r\nabundant thews and wide-spreading shoulders. They exhibited,\r\nrather, an elemental economy of nature, such as the cave-men\r\nmust have exhibited. But there was strength in those meagre\r\nbodies, the ferocious, primordial strength to clutch and tear\r\nand gripe and rend. When they spring upon their human prey they\r\nare known even to bend the victim backward and double its body\r\ntill the back is broken. They possess neither conscience nor\r\nsentiment, and they will kill for half a sovereign, without\r\nfear or favor....\r\n\r\nThe dear soft people of the golden theatres and wonder-mansions\r\nof the West End do not see these creatures, do not dream that\r\nthey exist. But they are here, alive, very much alive in their\r\njungle. And woe the day when England is fighting in her last\r\ntrench, and her able-bodied men are on the firing line! For\r\non that day they will crawl out of their dens and lairs, and\r\nthe people of the West End will see them, as the dear soft\r\naristocrats of Feudal France saw them and asked one another,\r\n\"Whence come they?\" \"Are they men?\"\r\n\r\nBut they were not the only beasts that ranged the menagerie.\r\nThey were only here and there, lurking in dark courts and\r\npassing like grey shadows along the walls; but the women from\r\nwhose rotten loins they spring were everywhere. They whined\r\ninsolently, and in maudlin tones begged me for pennies, and\r\nworse. They held carouse in every boozing den, slatternly,\r\nunkempt, bleary-eyed, and tousled, leering and gibbering,\r\noverspilling with foulness and corruption, and, gone in\r\ndebauch, sprawling across benches and bars, unspeakably\r\nrepulsive, fearful to look upon.\r\n\r\nAnd there were others, strange, weird faces and forms and\r\ntwisted monstrosities that shouldered me on every side,\r\ninconceivable types of sodden ugliness, the wrecks of society,\r\nthe perambulating carcasses, the living deaths--women, blasted\r\nby disease and drink till their shame brought not tuppence\r\nin the open mart; and men, in fantastic rags, wrenched by\r\nhardship and exposure out of all semblance of men, their faces\r\nin a perpetual writhe of pain, grinning idiotically, shambling\r\nlike apes, dying with every step they took and every breath\r\nthey drew. And there were young girls, of eighteen and twenty,\r\nwith trim bodies and faces yet untouched with twist and bloat,\r\nwho had fetched the bottom of the Abyss plump, in one swift\r\nfall. And I remember a lad of fourteen, and one of six or\r\nseven, white-faced and sickly, homeless, the pair of them, who\r\nsat upon the pavement with their backs against a railing and\r\nwatched it all....\r\n\r\nThe unfit and the unneeded! The miserable and despised\r\nand forgotten, dying in the social shambles. The progeny\r\nof prostitution--of the prostitution of men and women and\r\nchildren, of flesh and blood, and sparkle and spirit; in\r\nbrief, the prostitution of labor. If this is the best that\r\ncivilization can do for the human, then give us howling and\r\nnaked savagery. Far better to be a people of the wilderness\r\nand desert, of the cave and the squatting place, than to be a\r\npeople of the machine and the Abyss.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Night's Lodging\r\n\r\nBY MAXIM GORKY\r\n\r\n (A true voice of the Russian masses, born 1868; by turns peddler,\r\n scullery-boy, baker's assistant and tramp, he became all at once the\r\n most widely known of Russian writers. In this play he has portrayed\r\n the misery of the outcasts of his country. The scene is in the cellar\r\n of an inn, the haunt of thieves and tramps. Luka, the aged pilgrim, is\r\n talking to a young girl)\r\n\r\nLUKA:--Treat everyone with friendliness--injure no one.\r\n\r\nNATASHA:--How good you are, grandfather! How is it that you are\r\nso good?\r\n\r\nLUKA:--I am good, you say. Nyah--if it is true, all right. But\r\nyou see, my girl--there must be some one to be good. We must\r\nhave pity on mankind. Christ, remember, had pity for us all and\r\nso taught us. Have pity when there is still time, believe me,\r\nthat is right. I was once, for example, employed as a watchman,\r\nat a country place which belonged to an engineer, not far from\r\nthe city of Tomsk, in Siberia. The house stood in the middle\r\nof the forest, an out-of-the-way location; and it was winter\r\nand I was all alone in the country house. It was beautiful\r\nthere--magnificent! And once--I heard them scrambling up!\r\n\r\nNATASHA:--Thieves?\r\n\r\nLUKA:--Yes. They crept higher, and I took my rifle and went\r\noutside. I looked up--two men, opening a window, and so busy\r\nthat they did not see anything of me at all. I cried to them:\r\nHey, there, get out of that! And would you think it, they fell\r\non me with a hand ax! I warned them. Halt, I cried, or else I\r\nfire! Then I aimed first at one and then at the other. They\r\nfell on their knees saying, Pardon us! I was pretty hot--on\r\naccount of the hand ax, you remember. You devils, I cried, I\r\ntold you to clear out and you didn't! And now, I said, one of\r\nyou go into the brush and get a switch. It was done. And now,\r\nI commanded, one of you stretch out on the ground, and the\r\nother thrash him. And so they whipped each other at my command.\r\nAnd when they had each had a sound beating, they said to me:\r\nGrandfather, said they, for the sake of Christ give us a piece\r\nof bread. We haven't a bite in our bodies. They, my daughter,\r\nwere the thieves who had fallen upon me with the hand ax.\r\nYes, they were a pair of splendid fellows. I said to them, If\r\nyou had asked for bread! Then they answered: We had gotten\r\npast that. We had asked and asked, and nobody would give us\r\nanything. Endurance was worn out. Nyah--and so they remained\r\nwith me the whole winter. One of them, Stephen by name, liked\r\nto take the rifle and go into the woods. And the other,\r\nJakoff, was constantly ill, always coughing. The three of us\r\nwatched the place, and when spring came, they said, Farewell,\r\ngrandfather, and went away--to Russia.\r\n\r\nNATASHA:--Were they convicts, escaping?\r\n\r\nLUKA:--They were fugitives--they had left their colony. A pair\r\nof splendid fellows. If I had not had pity on them--who knows\r\nwhat would have happened? They might have killed me. Then they\r\nwould be taken to court again, put in prison, sent back to\r\nSiberia--why all that? You can learn nothing good in prison,\r\nnor in Siberia. But a man, what can he not learn!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Menagerie\r\n\r\n(_Night in a County Workhouse_)\r\n\r\nBY UPTON SINCLAIR\r\n\r\n    Oh come, ye lords and ladies of the realm,\r\n    Come from your couches soft, your perfumed halls,\r\n    Come watch with me throughout the weary hours.\r\n    Here are there sounds to thrill your jaded nerves,\r\n    Such as the cave-men, your forefathers, heard,\r\n    Crouching in forests of primeval night;\r\n    Here tier on tier in steel-barred cages pent\r\n    The beasts ye breed and hunt throughout the world.\r\n    Hark to that snore--some beast that slumbers deep;\r\n    Hark to that roar--some beast that dreams of blood;\r\n    Hark to that moan--some beast that wakes and weeps;\r\n    And then in sudden stillness mark the sound--\r\n    Some beast that rasps his vermin-haunted hide!\r\n\r\n    Oh come, ye lords and ladies of the realm,\r\n    Come keep the watch with me; this show is yours.\r\n    Behold the source of all your joy and pride,\r\n    The beasts ye harness fast and set to draw\r\n    The chariots of your pageantry and pomp!\r\n    It is their blood ye shed to make your feasts,\r\n    It is their treadmill that moves all your world.\r\n    Come gather now, and think how it will be\r\n    When God shall send his flaming angel down\r\n    And break these bars--so hath he done of yore,\r\n    So doeth he to lords and ladies grand--\r\n    And loose these beasts to raven in your streets!\r\n\r\n\r\nA Sentiment on Social Reform\r\n\r\nBY EUGENE V. DEBS\r\n\r\n(American locomotive engineer; born 1855; president of his\r\nunion, and later the best known of American Socialist lecturers)\r\n\r\n    While there is a lower class, I am in it.\r\n    While there is a criminal element, I am of it.\r\n    While there is a soul in jail, I am not free.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Solitary\"\r\n\r\n(_From \"My Life in Prison\"_)\r\n\r\nBY DONALD LOWRIE\r\n\r\n(The writer of this picture of prison life, after serving a\r\nsentence of fifteen years in San Quentin, has become one of the\r\nleaders in the prison reform movement in California)\r\n\r\nHe was a thin young man of medium height, with long, straggly\r\nblonde hair and beard. He was garbed in a ragged suit of dirty\r\nstripes. His steel-gray eyes blinked as though the light hurt\r\nthem, and yet they were very alert, and there was a defiance,\r\nan indomitableness in their depths. They protruded slightly,\r\nas the eyes of persons who have suffered so frequently do.\r\nThe lines radiating from the corners bespoke mental as well\r\nas physical distress, as did the spasmodic twitching of his\r\nmouth. His skin was akin to the color of a thirsty road and\r\nhis garments looked as though he had not had them off for\r\nmonths--the knees and elbows bulged and the frayed edges of the\r\ncoat curled under. I was conscious of a warring within me. I\r\nhad not yet learned who he was, and still I knew I was gazing\r\nat a human creature who had been through hell....\r\n\r\n\"Treat Morrell right,\" admonished the lieutenant as he withdrew\r\nfrom the room and left us together.\r\n\r\nMorrell! The notorious \"Ed\" Morrell, about whom I had heard so\r\nmuch, and who had been confined in the \"incorrigibles\" for five\r\nyears!\r\n\r\nThe majority of the prisoners, as well as the freemen, believed\r\nhim innocent of the offence with which he had been charged and\r\nfor which he had been subjected to such awful punishment. So\r\nthis man was Ed Morrell! No wonder I had been agitated....\r\n\r\nHe arose from the chair and stood dejectedly while I took the\r\nnecessary measurements, and then I led the way to the back\r\nroom, where the bathtub was located. I started to return to\r\nthe front room for the purpose of marking his clothes, but he\r\nstopped me.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" he urged. \"Wait and see what a man looks like\r\nafter five years in hell. I was a husky when I went up there,\r\nhard as nails and full of red blood, but look at me now.\"\r\n\r\nWhile speaking, he had dropped off the outer rags, and a\r\nmoment after stood nude beside the tub of warm water. The\r\nenormity of what he had suffered could not have been more\r\nforcibly demonstrated. His limbs were horribly emaciated, the\r\nknee, elbow, and shoulder bones stood out like huge knots\r\nthrough the drawn and yellow skin, while his ribs reminded\r\nme of the carcass of a sheep hanging in front of a butcher's\r\nestablishment. The hollows between them were deep and dark.\r\nI thought of the picture I had seen of the famine-stricken\r\nwretches of India....\r\n\r\n\"What are those scars on your back?\" I asked as he sank onto\r\nhis knees in the water.\r\n\r\n\"Scars,\" he laughed, sardonically. \"Scars? Those ain't scars.\r\nThey're only the marks where the devil prodded me. I was in the\r\njacket, cinched up so that I was breathing from my throat when\r\nhe came and tried to make me 'come through,' and when I sneered\r\nat him he kicked me over the kidneys. I don't know how many\r\ntimes he kicked; the first kick took my breath away and I saw\r\nblack, but after they took me out of the sack I couldn't get\r\nup, and I had running sores down here for months afterwards.\r\nI ain't right down there now; I've got a bad rupture, and\r\nsometimes it feels as if there was a knife being twisted around\r\ninside of me. It wouldn't be so bad if they'd got me right, but\r\nto give a man a deal like that dead wrong is hell, let me tell\r\nyou....\"\r\n\r\nAs we stepped into the barber shop there was a noticeable air\r\nof expectancy. The word had passed through the prison that the\r\nnew warden had released \"Ed\" Morrell from \"solitary.\" All but\r\none of the half dozen barbers were strangers to Morrell. They\r\nhad been committed to the prison after his siege of solitary\r\nconfinement had begun. The one exception was old Frank, a lifer\r\nwith twenty years' service behind him....\r\n\r\nHe took a step backward and a hush fell over the little group.\r\n\r\n\"With all due respect, Ed, you're the finest living picture of\r\nJesus Christ that I've ever seen, so help me God. And, Ed,\" he\r\nadded, hastily, his voice breaking, \"we're all Jesus Christs,\r\nif we'd only remember it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPrisons\r\n\r\nBY EMMA GOLDMAN\r\n\r\n(Anarchist lecturer and writer; born in Russia, 1869)\r\n\r\nYear after year the gates of prison hells return to the world\r\nan emaciated, deformed, will-less shipwrecked crew of humanity,\r\nwith the Cain mark on their foreheads, their hopes crushed,\r\nall their natural inclinations thwarted. With nothing but\r\nhunger and inhumanity to greet them, these victims soon sink\r\nback into crime as the only possibility of existence. It is\r\nnot at all an unusual thing to find men and women who have\r\nspent half their lives--nay, almost their entire existence--in\r\nprison. I know a woman on Blackwell's Island, who has been in\r\nand out thirty-eight times; and through a friend I learn that\r\na young boy of seventeen, whom he had nursed and cared for in\r\nthe Pittsburgh penitentiary, had never known the meaning of\r\nliberty. From the reformatory to the penitentiary had been\r\nthe path of this boy's life, until, broken in body, he died\r\na victim of social revenge. These personal experiences are\r\nsubstantiated by extensive data giving overwhelming proof of\r\nthe futility of prisons as a means of deterrence or reform.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prison System\r\n\r\n(_From \"Resurrection\"_)\r\n\r\nBY LEO TOLSTOY\r\n\r\n(See pages 88, 110)\r\n\r\n\"It is just as if a problem had been set: to find the best,\r\nthe surest means, of depraving the greatest number of people!\"\r\nthought Nehlúdof, while getting an insight into the deeds that\r\nwere being done in the prisons and halting-stations. Every year\r\nhundreds of thousands were brought to the highest pitch of\r\ndepravity, and when completely depraved they were liberated to\r\nspread broadcast the moral disease they had caught in prison.\r\n\r\nIn the prisons of Tumén, Ekáterinburg, Tomsk, and at the\r\nhalting-stations, Nehlúdof saw how successfully the object\r\nsociety seemed to have set itself was attained. Ordinary simple\r\nmen holding the Russian peasant social and Christian morality\r\nlost this conception, and formed a new, prison, one founded\r\nchiefly on the idea that any outrage to or violation of human\r\nbeings is justifiable, if it seems profitable. After living in\r\nprison these people became conscious with the whole of their\r\nbeing that, judging by what was happening to themselves, all\r\nthose moral laws of respect and sympathy for others which\r\nthe Church and the moral teachers preach, were set aside in\r\nreal life, and that therefore they, too, need not keep these\r\nlaws. Nehlúdof noticed this effect of prison life in all the\r\nprisoners he knew. He learnt, during his journey, that tramps\r\nwho escape into the marshes will persuade comrades to escape\r\nwith them, and will then kill them and feed on their flesh.\r\nHe saw a living man who was accused of this, and acknowledged\r\nthe act. And the most terrible thing was, that this was\r\nnot a solitary case of cannibalism, but that the thing was\r\ncontinually recurring.\r\n\r\nOnly by a special cultivation of vice such as was carried\r\non in these establishments, could a Russian be brought to\r\nthe state of these tramps, who excelled Nietzsche's newest\r\nteaching, holding everything allowable and nothing forbidden,\r\nand spreading this teaching, first among the convicts and then\r\namong the people in general.\r\n\r\nThe only explanation of what was being done was that it aimed\r\nat the prevention of crime, at inspiring awe, at correcting\r\noffenders, and at dealing out to them \"lawful vengeance,\" as\r\nthe books said. But in reality nothing in the least resembling\r\nthese results came to pass. Instead of vice being put a stop\r\nto, it only spread farther; instead of being frightened, the\r\ncriminals were encouraged (many a tramp returned to prison of\r\nhis own free will); instead of correction, every kind of vice\r\nwas systematically instilled; while the desire for vengeance,\r\nfar from being weakened by the measures of Government, was\r\ninstilled into the people to whom it was not natural.\r\n\r\n\"Then why is it done?\" Nehlúdof asked himself, and could find\r\nno answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE PSALMS\r\n\r\nHe hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary ... to\r\nhear the sighing of the prisoner; to loose those that are\r\nappointed to death.\r\n\r\n\r\nBallade of Misery and Iron\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE CARTER\r\n\r\n (Some years ago the _Century Magazine_ received several poems from\r\n an inmate of the State penitentiary of Minnesota.

VAGRET:--Or that it will admit some extenuating\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nVAGRET:--No. I urged them too emphatically against this. Was I\r\nnot ardent enough, my God! violent enough?\r\n\r\nMME. VAGRET:--That's true. Why should you have developed your\r\nargument with so much passion?\r\n\r\nVAGRET:--Ah! why! why! Long before the session, it was so well\r\nunderstood by everyone that the accused was the culprit! And\r\nthen, everyone was trying to rouse my dander, trying to make\r\nme drunk! I was the spokesman for humanity, I had to reassure\r\nthe country, bring peace to the family--I don't know what all\r\nelse! My first demands were comparatively moderate. But when I\r\nsaw that famous advocate make the jury weep, I thought I was\r\nlost; I felt that the case was getting away from me. Contrary\r\nto my custom, I made a reply. When I stood up again, I was\r\nlike a combattant who goes to meet defeat, and who fights with\r\ndesperation. From that moment, Etchepare no longer existed, so\r\nto speak. I no longer had the care to defend society, or to\r\nmaintain the accusation--I was fighting against that advocate;\r\nit was a tourney of orators, a contest of actors; I had to\r\ncome out the conqueror at all hazards. I had to convince the\r\njury, to seize it and tear from it the \"Yes\" of a verdict.\r\nIt was no longer a question of Etchepare, I tell you; it was\r\na question of myself, of my vanity, of my reputation, of my\r\nhonor, of my future. It's shameful, I repeat, it's shameful!\r\nAt any cost, I wanted to avoid the acquittal which I felt was\r\ncertain. And I was possessed by such a fear of not succeeding,\r\nthat I employed all the arguments, good and bad--even those\r\nwhich consisted in representing to those frightened men their\r\nhomes in flames, their loved ones assassinated. I spoke of\r\nthe vengeance of God upon judges who had no severity. And all\r\nthat in good faith--or rather without consciousness, in a fit\r\nof passion, in a fit of passion against the advocate whom I\r\nhated with all my forces.... The success was even greater than\r\nI could have wished; the jury is ready to obey me, and for\r\nmyself, my dear--I let myself be congratulated, and I pressed\r\nthe hands which were held out to me.--That's what it is to be a\r\nprosecutor!\r\n\r\nMME. VAGRET:--Console yourself. There are perhaps not ten men\r\nin France who would have acted otherwise.\r\n\r\nVAGRET:--You are right. Only--if one reflects, it is precisely\r\nthat which is frightful.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY KENKŌ HOSHI\r\n\r\n(See pages 135, 151)\r\n\r\nThe governing class should stop their luxurious expenditures in\r\norder to help the governed class.

Gaol\"_)\r\n\r\nBY OSCAR WILDE\r\n\r\n (English poet and dramatist, 1856-1900, leader of the so-called\r\n \"esthetes.\" The poem from which these extracts are taken was the fruit\r\n of his long imprisonment, and is one of the most moving and terrible\r\n narratives in English poetry)\r\n\r\n    With slouch and swing around the ring\r\n      We trod the Fools' Parade;\r\n    We did not care; we knew we were\r\n      The Devil's Own Brigade:\r\n    And shaven head and feet of lead\r\n      Make a merry masquerade.\r\n\r\n    We tore the tarry rope to shreds\r\n      With blunt and bleeding nails;\r\n    We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,\r\n      And cleaned the shining rails:\r\n    And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,\r\n      And clattered with the pails.\r\n\r\n    We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,\r\n      We turned the dusty drill:\r\n    We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,\r\n      And sweated on the mill:\r\n    But in the heart of every man\r\n      Terror was lying still.\r\n\r\n    So still it lay that every day\r\n      Crawled like a weed-clogged wave;\r\n    And we forgot the bitter lot\r\n      That waits for fool and knave,\r\n    Till once, as we tramped in from work,\r\n      We passed an open grave.\r\n\r\n    With yawning mouth the yellow hole\r\n      Gaped for a living thing;\r\n    The very mud cried out for blood\r\n      To the thirsty asphalt ring:\r\n    And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair\r\n      Some prisoner had to swing.\r\n\r\n    Right in we went, with soul intent\r\n      On Death and Dread and Doom:\r\n    The hangman, with his little bag,\r\n      Went shuffling through the gloom:\r\n    And each man trembled as he crept\r\n      Into his numbered tomb.\r\n\r\n    That night the empty corridors\r\n      Were full of forms of Fear,\r\n    And up and down the iron town\r\n      Stole feet we could not hear,\r\n    And through the bars that hide the stars\r\n      White faces seemed to peer....\r\n\r\n    We were as men who through a fen\r\n      Of filthy darkness grope:\r\n    We did not dare to breathe a prayer,\r\n      Or to give our anguish scope:\r\n    Something was dead in each of us,\r\n      And what was dead was Hope.\r\n\r\n    For Man's grim Justice goes its way,\r\n      And will not swerve aside:\r\n    It slays the weak, it slays the strong,\r\n      It has a deadly stride:\r\n    With iron heel it slays the strong,\r\n      The monstrous parricide\r\n\r\n    We waited for the stroke of eight:\r\n      Each tongue was thick with thirst:\r\n    For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\r\n      That makes a man accursed,\r\n    And Fate will use a running noose\r\n      For the best man and the worst\r\n\r\n    We had no other thing to do,\r\n      Save to wait for the sign to come:\r\n    So, like things of stone in a valley lone,\r\n      Quiet we sat and dumb:\r\n    But each man's heart beat thick and quick\r\n      Like a madman on a drum!\r\n\r\n    With sudden shock the prison-clock\r\n      Smote on the shivering air,\r\n    And from all the gaol rose up a wail\r\n      Of impotent despair,\r\n    Like the sound that frightened marshes hear\r\n      From some leper in his lair.\r\n\r\n    And as one sees most fearful things\r\n      In the crystal of a dream,\r\n    We saw the greasy hempen rope\r\n      Hooked to the blackened beam,\r\n    And heard the prayer the hangman's snare\r\n      Strangled into a scream.\r\n\r\n    And all the woe that moved him so\r\n      That he gave that bitter cry,\r\n    And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\r\n      None knew so well as I:\r\n    For he who lives more lives than one\r\n      More deaths than one must die.\r\n\r\n    There is no chapel on the day\r\n      On which they hang a man:\r\n    The Chaplain's heart is far too sick,\r\n      Or his face is far too wan,\r\n    Or there is that written in his eyes\r\n      Which none should look upon.\r\n\r\n    So they kept us close till nigh on noon,\r\n      And then they rang the bell,\r\n    And the Warders with their jingling keys\r\n      Opened each listening cell,\r\n    And down the iron stairs we tramped,\r\n      Each from his separate Hell.\r\n\r\n    Out into God's sweet air we went,\r\n      But not in wonted way,\r\n    For this man's face was white with fear,\r\n      And that man's face was grey,\r\n    And I never saw sad men who looked\r\n      So wistfully at the day.\r\n\r\n    I never saw sad men who looked\r\n      With such a wistful eye\r\n    Upon that little tent of blue\r\n      We prisoners call the sky,\r\n    And at every careless cloud that passed\r\n      In happy freedom by....\r\n\r\n    The Warders strutted up and down,\r\n      And kept their herd of brutes,\r\n    Their uniforms were spick and span,\r\n      And they were their Sunday suits,\r\n    But we knew the work they had been at\r\n      By the quicklime on their boots.\r\n\r\n    For where a grave had opened wide\r\n      There was no grave at all:\r\n    Only a stretch of mud and sand\r\n      By the hideous prison-wall,\r\n    And a little heap of burning lime,\r\n      That the man should have his pall.\r\n\r\n    For he has a pall, this wretched man,\r\n      Such as few men can claim;\r\n    Deep down below a prison-yard,\r\n      Naked for greater shame,\r\n    He lies, with fetters on each foot,\r\n      Wrapt in a sheet of flame!...\r\n\r\n    I know not whether Laws be right,\r\n      Or whether Laws be wrong;\r\n    All that we know who lie in jail\r\n      Is that the wall is strong;\r\n    And that each day is like a year,\r\n      A year whose days are long.\r\n\r\n    But this I know, that every Law\r\n      That men have made for Man,\r\n    Since first Man took his brother's life,\r\n      And the sad world began,\r\n    But straws the wheat and saves the chaff\r\n      With a most evil fan.\r\n\r\n    This too I know--and wise it were\r\n      If each could know the same--\r\n    That every prison that men build\r\n      Is built with bricks of shame,\r\n    And bound with bars lest Christ should see\r\n      How men their brothers maim.\r\n\r\n    With bars they blur the gracious moon,\r\n      And blind the goodly sun:\r\n    And they do well to hide their Hell,\r\n      For in it things are done\r\n    That Son of God nor son of Man\r\n      Ever should look upon!\r\n\r\n    The vilest deeds like poison weeds\r\n      Bloom well in prison-air:\r\n    It is only what is good in Man\r\n      That wastes and withers there:\r\n    Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\r\n      And the Warder is Despair.\r\n\r\n    For they starve the little frightened child\r\n      Till it weeps both night and day:\r\n    And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,\r\n      And gibe the old and grey,\r\n    And some grow mad, and all grow bad,\r\n      And none a word may say.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Punishment of Thieves\r\n\r\n(_From \"Utopia\"_)\r\n\r\nBY

The present novel is the\r\n life-story of Archie Koerner, a boy of the tenements, who is driven to\r\n crime by the evil forces of society)\r\n\r\n\"All ready, Archie.\"\r\n\r\nJimmy Ball touched him on the shoulder. He glanced toward the\r\nopen grated door, thence across the flagging to the other door,\r\nand tried to take a step. Out there he could see one or two\r\nfaces thrust forward suddenly; they peered in, then hastily\r\nwithdrew. He tried again to take a step, but one leg had gone\r\nto sleep, it prickled, and as he bore his weight upon it,\r\nit seemed to swell suddenly to elephantine proportions. And\r\nhe seemed to have no knees at all; if he stood up he would\r\ncollapse. How was he ever to walk that distance?\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" said Ball. \"Get on that other side of him, Warden.\"\r\n\r\nThen they started. The Reverend Mr. Hoerr, waiting by the door,\r\nhad begun to read something in a strange, unnatural voice, out\r\nof a little red book he held at his breast in both his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, Archie!\" they called from behind, and he turned,\r\nswayed a little, and looked back over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, boys,\" he said. He had a glimpse of their faces; they\r\nlooked gray and ugly, worse even than they had that evening--or\r\nwas it that evening when with sudden fear he had seen them\r\ncrouching there behind him?\r\n\r\nPerhaps just at the last minute the governor would change\r\nhis mind. They were walking the long way to the door, six\r\nyards off. The flagging was cold to his bare feet; his slit\r\ntrouser-legs flapped miserably, revealing his white calves.\r\nWalking had suddenly become laborious; he had to lift each leg\r\nseparately and manage it; he walked much as that man in the\r\nrear rank of Company 21 walked. He would have liked to stop and\r\nrest an instant, but Ball and the warden walked beside him,\r\nurged him resistlessly along, each gripping him at the wrist\r\nand upper arm.\r\n\r\nIn the room outside, Archie recognized the reporters standing\r\nin the sawdust. What they were to write that night would be\r\nin the newspapers the next morning, but he would not read it.\r\nHe heard Beck lock the door of the death chamber, locking it\r\nhurriedly, so that he could be in time to look on. Archie had\r\nno friend in the group of men that waited in silence, glancing\r\ncuriously at him, their faces white as the whitewashed wall.\r\nThe doctors held their watches in their hands. And there before\r\nhim was the chair, its oil-cloth cover now removed, its cane\r\nbottom exposed. But he would have to step up on the little\r\nplatform to get to it.\r\n\r\n\"No--yes, there you are, Archie, my boy!\" whispered Ball.\r\n\"There!\"\r\n\r\nHe was in it, at last. He leaned back; then, as his back\r\ntouched the back of the chair, he started violently. But there\r\nwere hands on his shoulders pressing him down, until he could\r\nfeel his back touch the chair from his shoulders down to the\r\nvery end of his spine. Some one had seized his legs, turned\r\nback the slit trousers from his calves.\r\n\r\n\"Be quick!\" he heard the warden say in a scared voice. He was\r\nat his right where the switch and the indicator were.\r\n\r\nThere were hands, too, at his head, at his arms--hands all\r\nover him. He took one last look. Had the governor--? Then\r\nthe leather mask was strapped over his eyes and it was dark.\r\nHe could only feel and hear now--feel the cold metal on his\r\nlegs, feel the moist sponge on the top of his head where the\r\nbarber had shaved him, feel the leather straps binding his legs\r\nand arms to the legs and the arms of the chair, binding them\r\ntightly, so that they gave him pain, and he could not move.\r\nHelpless he lay there, and waited. He heard the loud ticking\r\nof a watch; then on the other side of him the loud ticking of\r\nanother watch; fingers were at his wrists. There was no sound\r\nbut the mumble of Mr. Hoerr's voice. Then some one said:\r\n\r\n\"All ready.\"\r\n\r\nHe waited a second, or an age, then, suddenly, it seemed as\r\nif he must leap from the chair, his body was swelling to\r\nsome monstrous, impossible, unhuman shape; his muscles were\r\nstretched, millions of hot and dreadful needles were piercing\r\nand pricking him, a stupendous roaring was in his ears, then a\r\nmillion colors, colors he had never seen or imagined before,\r\ncolors beyond the range of the spectra, new, undiscovered,\r\nsummoned by some mysterious agency from distant corners of the\r\nuniverse, played before his eyes. Suddenly they were shattered\r\nby a terrific explosion in his brain--then darkness.\r\n\r\nBut no, there was still sensation; a dull purple color slowly\r\nspread before him, gradually grew lighter, expanded, and\r\nwith a mighty pain he struggled, groping his way in torture\r\nand torment over fearful obstacles from some far distance,\r\nremote as black stars in the cold abyss of the universe; he\r\nstruggled back to life--then an appalling confusion, a grasp at\r\nconsciousness; he heard the ticking of the two watches--then,\r\nthrough his brain there slowly trickled a thread of thought\r\nthat squirmed and glowed like a white-hot wire....\r\n\r\nA faint groan escaped the pale lips below the black leather\r\nmask, a tremor ran through the form in the chair, then it\r\nrelaxed and was still.\r\n\r\n\"It's all over.\" The doctor, lifting his fingers from Archie's\r\nwrist, tried to smile, and wiped the perspiration from his face\r\nwith a handkerchief.\r\n\r\nSome one flung up a window, and a draught of cool air\r\nsucked through the room. On the draught was borne from the\r\ndeath-chamber the stale odor of Russian cigarettes. And then\r\na demoniacal roar shook the cell-house. The convicts had been\r\nawake.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Police-Court Reporter\r\n\r\n(_From \"Midstream\"_)\r\n\r\nBY WILL LEVINGTON COMFORT\r\n\r\n(American novelist and war-correspondent, born 1878)\r\n\r\nWhen I think of prisons; of the men who send other men there;\r\nof chairs of death and hangings, and of all that bring these\r\nthings about--it comes to me that the City is organized hell;\r\nthat there is no end to our cruelty and stupidity. I bought\r\nfrom door to door in city streets the stuff that makes murder;\r\nI sat in the forenoon under the corrective forces, which were\r\nquite as blindly stupid and cruel.\r\n\r\nThe women I passed in the night, appeared often in the morning.\r\nI talked to them in the nights, and heard them weep in the\r\ndays; I saw them in the nights with the men who judged them\r\nin the days. Out of all that evil, there was no voice; out of\r\nall the corrective force there was no voice. The City covered\r\nus all. I was one and the other. The women thought themselves\r\nbeasts; the men thought themselves men--and, voiceless between\r\nthem, the City stood.\r\n\r\nThe most tragic sentence I ever heard, was from the lips\r\nof one of these women.... I talked with her through the\r\nnight. She called it her work; she had an ideal about her\r\nwork. Every turning in her life had been man-directed. She\r\nconfessed that she had begun with an unabatable passion; that\r\nmen had found her sensuousness very attractive when it was\r\nfresh. She had preserved a certain sweetness; through such\r\nstresses that the upper world would never credit. Thousands\r\nof men had come to her; all perversions, all obsessions, all\r\nmadness, and drunkenness, to her alone in this little room.\r\nShe told of nights when twenty came. Yet there was something\r\ninextinguishable about her--something patient and optimistic.\r\nIn the midst of it all, it was like a little girl speaking:\r\n\r\n\"_I wake up in the morning, and find a man beside me. I am\r\nalways frightened, even yet,--until I remember. I remember\r\nwho I am and what I am.... Then I try to think what he is\r\nlike--what his companions called him--what he said to me. I try\r\nto remember how he looked--because you know in the morning, his\r\nface is always turned away._\"\r\n\r\nDoes it help you to see that we are all one?... Yet I couldn't\r\nhave seen then, trained by men and the City. I belonged to the\r\nranks of the corrective forces in the eyes of the City--and\r\nshe, to the destructive.... She would have gone to the pen, I\r\nsitting opposite waiting for something more important to make\r\na news bulletin.... From the City's point of view, I was at\r\nlarge, safe and sane....\r\n\r\nThe extreme seriousness with which men regard themselves as\r\nmunicipal correctives--as soldiers, lovers, monopolists--has\r\nrisen for me into one of the most remarkable facts of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Straight Road\r\n\r\nBY PAUL HANNA\r\n\r\n(Contemporary American poet)\r\n\r\n    They got y', kid: they got y'--just like I said they would.\r\n      You tried to walk the narrow path,\r\n      You tried, and got an awful laugh;\r\n    And laughs are all y' did get, kid--they got y' good!\r\n\r\n    They never knew the little kid--the kid I used to know;\r\n      The little bare-legged girl back home,\r\n      The little kid that played alone--\r\n    They don't know half the things I know, kid, ain't it so?\r\n\r\n    They got y', kid, they got y'--you know they got y' right;\r\n      They waited till they saw y' limp,\r\n      Then introduced y' to the pimp--\r\n    Ah, you were down then, kid, and couldn't fight!\r\n\r\n    I guess y' know what some don't know, and others know damn well--\r\n      That sweatshops don't grow angels' wings,\r\n      That workin' girls is easy things,\r\n    And poverty's the straightest road t' Hell!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Cadet\"\r\n\r\n(_From \"The House of Bondage\"_)\r\n\r\nBY REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN\r\n\r\n(See page 53)\r\n\r\nWherever there is squalor seeking ease, he is there.

He is at the door of the factory when\r\nit releases its white-faced women for a breath of night air;\r\nhe is at the cheap lunch-room where the stenographers bolt\r\nunwholesome noonday food handed about by underpaid waitresses;\r\nhe lurks around the corner for the servant and the shop-clerk.\r\nHe remembers that these are girls too tired to do household\r\nwork in their evenings, too untaught to find continued solace\r\nin books; that they must go out, that they must move about;\r\nand so he passes his own nights at the restaurants and\r\ntheaters, the moving-picture shows, the dancing academies,\r\nthe dance-halls.

LECKY\r\n\r\n(English historian and philosopher, 1838-1903. The following\r\nmuch quoted passage may be said to represent the Victorian view\r\nof its subject)\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, there has arisen in society a figure\r\nwhich is certainly the most mournful, and in some respects\r\nthe most awful, upon which the eye of the moralist can dwell.\r\nThat unhappy being whose very name is a shame to speak; who\r\ncounterfeits with a cold heart the transports of affection,\r\nand submits herself as the passive instrument of lust; who is\r\nscorned and insulted as the vilest of her sex, and doomed, for\r\nthe most part, to disease and abject wretchedness and an early\r\ndeath, appears in every age as the perpetual symbol of the\r\ndegradation and sinfulness of man. Herself the supreme type of\r\nvice, she is ultimately the most efficient guardian of virtue.\r\nBut for her, the unchallenged purity of countless happy homes\r\nwould be polluted, and not a few who, in the pride of their\r\nuntempted chastity, think of her with an indignant shudder,\r\nwould have known the agony of remorse and despair. On that one\r\ndegraded and ignoble form are concentrated the passions that\r\nmight have filled the world with shame.

Fierce\r\nand cunning, and false and vile. Ghastly of visage under her\r\npaint and grease. A creature debased below the level of the\r\nbrute, with the hate of a devil in her soul and the fire of\r\nhell in her eyes. Lewd of gesture, strident of voice, wanton\r\nof gaze, using language so foul as to shock the pot-house\r\nruffian, and laughter whose sound makes the blood run cold. A\r\ndreadful spectre, shameless, heartless, reckless, and horrible.\r\nA creature whose touch is contamination, whose words burn like\r\na flame, whose leers and ogles make the soul sick. A creature\r\nliving in drunkenness and filth. A moral blight. A beast of\r\nprey who has cast down many wounded, whose victims fill the\r\nlunatic ward and the morgue; a thief, a liar, a hopeless, lost,\r\ndegraded wretch, of whom it has been well said, \"Her feet take\r\nhold of hell; her house is the way to the grave, going down to\r\nthe chamber of death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Strand\r\n\r\nBY ARTHUR SYMONS\r\n\r\n(English poet and critic, born 1865)\r\n\r\n    With eyes and hands and voice convulsively\r\n    She craves the bestial wages. In her face\r\n    What now is left of woman? whose lost place\r\n    Is filled with greed's last eating agony.\r\n    She lives to be rejected and abhorred,\r\n    Like a dread thing forgotten. One by one\r\n    She hails the passers, whispers blindly; none\r\n    Heeds now the voice that had not once implored\r\n    Those alms in vain. The hour has struck for her,\r\n    And now damnation is scarce possible\r\n    Here on the earth; it waits for her in hell.\r\n    God! to be spurned of the last wayfarer\r\n    That haunts a dark street after midnight! Now\r\n    Shame's last disgrace is hot upon her brow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bridge of Sighs\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS HOOD\r\n\r\n(See page 59)\r\n\r\n    One more Unfortunate\r\n      Weary of breath,\r\n    Rashly importunate,\r\n      Gone to her death!\r\n\r\n    Take her up tenderly,\r\n      Lift her with care;\r\n    Fashion'd so slenderly,\r\n      Young, and so fair!\r\n\r\n    Look at her garments\r\n    Clinging like cerements;\r\n      Whilst the wave constantly\r\n    Drips from her clothing;\r\n      Take her up instantly,\r\n    Loving, not loathing.\r\n\r\n    Touch her not scornfully;\r\n    Think of her mournfully,\r\n      Gently and humanly;\r\n    Not of the stains of her--\r\n    All that remains of her\r\n      Now is pure womanly.\r\n\r\n    Make no deep scrutiny\r\n    Into her mutiny\r\n      Rash and undutiful:\r\n    Past all dishonor,\r\n    Death has left on her\r\n      Only the beautiful.\r\n\r\n    Still, for all slips of hers,\r\n      One of Eve's family--\r\n    Wipe those poor lips of hers\r\n      Oozing so clammily.\r\n\r\n    Loop up her tresses\r\n      Escaped from the comb,\r\n    Her fair auburn tresses;\r\n    Whilst wonderment guesses\r\n      Where was her home?\r\n\r\n    Who was her father?\r\n      Who was her mother?\r\n    Had she a sister?\r\n      Had she a brother?\r\n    Or was there a dearer one\r\n    Still, and a nearer one\r\n      Yet, than all other?\r\n\r\n    Alas! for the rarity\r\n    Of Christian charity\r\n      Under the sun!\r\n    O! it was pitiful!\r\n    Near a whole city full,\r\n      Home she had none.\r\n\r\n    Sisterly, brotherly,\r\n    Fatherly, motherly,\r\n      Feelings had changed;\r\n    Love, by harsh evidence,\r\n    Thrown from its eminence;\r\n    Even God's providence\r\n      Seeming estranged.\r\n\r\n    Where the lamps quiver\r\n    So far in the river,\r\n      With many a light\r\n    From window and casement,\r\n    From garret to basement,\r\n    She stood, with amazement,\r\n      Houseless by night.\r\n\r\n    The bleak wind of March\r\n      Made her tremble and shiver;\r\n    But not the dark arch,\r\n      Or the black flowing river:\r\n    Mad from life's history,\r\n    Glad to death's mystery\r\n      Swift to be hurl'd--\r\n    Anywhere, anywhere\r\n      Out of the world!\r\n\r\n    In she plunged boldly,\r\n    No matter how coldly\r\n      The rough river ran;\r\n    Over the brink of it,--\r\n    Picture it, think of it,\r\n      Dissolute Man!\r\n    Lave in it, drink of it\r\n      Then, if you can!\r\n\r\n    Take her up tenderly,\r\n      Lift her with care;\r\n    Fashion'd so slenderly,\r\n      Young, and so fair!\r\n\r\n    Ere her limbs frigidly\r\n    Stiffen too rigidly,\r\n      Decently, kindly,\r\n    Smooth and compose them;\r\n    And her eyes, close them,\r\n      Staring so blindly!\r\n\r\n    Dreadfully staring\r\n      Thro' muddy impurity,\r\n    As when with the daring\r\n    Last look of despairing\r\n      Fix'd on futurity.\r\n\r\n    Perishing gloomily,\r\n    Spurr'd by contumely,\r\n    Cold inhumanity,\r\n    Burning insanity,\r\n      Into her rest.\r\n    --Cross her hands humbly\r\n    As if praying dumbly,\r\n      Over her breast!\r\n\r\n    Owning her weakness,\r\n    Her evil behavior,\r\n    And leaving, with meekness,\r\n      Her sins to her Saviour!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\n_Out of the Depths_\r\n\r\nThe protest of the soul of man confronted with injustice and\r\ngroping for a remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe People's Anthem\r\n\r\nBY EBENEZER ELLIOTT\r\n\r\n(One of the leaders of the Chartist movement in England,\r\n1781-1849; known as the \"Poet of the People,\" and by his\r\nenemies as the \"Corn-law Rhymer\")\r\n\r\n\r\n    When wilt thou save the people?\r\n      O God of mercy! when?\r\n    Not kings and lords, but nations!\r\n      Not thrones and crowns, but men!\r\n    Flowers of thy heart, O God, are they!\r\n    Let them not pass, like weeds, away!\r\n    Their heritage a sunless day!\r\n                God save the people!\r\n\r\n    Shall crime bring crime for ever,\r\n      Strength aiding still the strong?\r\n    Is it thy will, O Father!\r\n      That man shall toil for wrong?\r\n    \"No!\" say thy mountains; \"No!\" thy skies;\r\n    \"Man's clouded sun shall brightly rise,\r\n    And songs be heard instead of sighs.\"\r\n                God save the people!\r\n\r\n    When wilt thou save the people?\r\n      O God of mercy! when?\r\n    The people, Lord! the people!\r\n      Not thrones and crowns, but men!\r\n    God save the people! thine they are;\r\n    Thy children, as thy angels fair;\r\n    Save them from bondage and despair!\r\n                God save the people!\r\n\r\n\r\nA Hymn\r\n\r\nBY GILBERT K.

You will deceive yourself with initial\r\nvictories. You will find me weak. You will count me only one\r\nagainst a million. You will see the world seem to go on just\r\nas it is. One day confirming another. Presidents succeeding\r\nPresidents in unvarying mediocrity. Millionaires dead reborn\r\nin millionaire children. Starvation handing starvation on.\r\nThe people innocently played against the people. Demand and\r\nsupply cohabited for the production of a blind progeny. The\r\nlandlord suborning the land. The moneylord suborning money. The\r\nstorelord suborning production. All will seem to go on just as\r\nit is. And you who resist me will be fooled. You will say the\r\nuniverse is against me. You will say I am cursed. Or you will\r\nin your tenderer moments ask: What's the use? But all this\r\ntime I will be keeping on. Doing nothing unusual. Only keeping\r\non. Asleep or awake, keeping on. Compelled to say the say of\r\njustice all by myself. Willing to wait until you are shaken up\r\nand convinced. Until you will say it to yourself. And say it to\r\nyourself you will.\r\n\r\nThere are things ahead that will stir you out of your\r\nindifference or lethargy or doubt. Give you an immortal\r\nawakening. So you will never sleep again. I do not know just\r\nwhat it will be. But something. And you will know it when it\r\ncomes. And then you will understand why I am calm. Why I am\r\nnot worried by delay. Why I am not defeated by postponements.\r\nWhy all the big things that seem to be against me do not seem\r\nto worry the one little thing that is for me. Why my faith\r\nmaintains itself against your property. Why my soul maintains\r\nitself against injustice. Why I am willing to say words that\r\nare thought personally unkind for the sake of a result that is\r\nuniversally sweet. Why I look in your face and see you long\r\nbefore you are able to see yourself. Why you with all your\r\nfortified rights doubt and despair. Why I without any right\r\nat all am cheerful and confident. Why you tremble when one\r\nlittle man with one little voice asks you a question. Why I\r\ndo not tremble with all the states and churches and political\r\neconomies at my heels.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese Populations\r\n\r\n(_From \"Towards Democracy\"_)\r\n\r\nBY EDWARD CARPENTER\r\n\r\n(English poet and philosopher, born 1844; disciple of Walt\r\nWhitman)\r\n\r\nThese populations--\r\n\r\nSo puny, white-faced, machine-made,\r\n\r\nTurned out by factories, out of offices, out of drawing-rooms,\r\nby thousands all alike--\r\n\r\nHuddled, stitched up, in clothes, fearing a chill, a drop\r\nof rain, looking timidly at the sea and sky as at strange\r\nmonsters, or running back so quick to their suburban runs and\r\nburrows,\r\n\r\nDapper, libidinous, cute, with washed-out small eyes--\r\n\r\nWhat are these?\r\n\r\nAre they men and women?\r\n\r\nEach denying himself, hiding himself?\r\n\r\nAre they men and women?\r\n\r\nSo timorous, like hares--a breath of propriety or custom, a\r\ndraught of wind, the mere threat of pain or of danger?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nO for a breath of the sea and the great mountains!\r\n\r\nA bronzed hardy live man walking his way through it all;\r\n\r\nThousands of men companioning the waves and the storms,\r\nsplendid in health, naked-breasted, catching the lion with\r\ntheir hands;\r\n\r\nA thousand women swift-footed and free--owners of themselves,\r\nforgetful of themselves; in all their actions--full of joy and\r\nlaughter and action;\r\n\r\nGarbed not so differently from the men, joining with them in\r\ntheir games and sports, sharing also their labors;\r\n\r\nFree to hold their own, to grant or withhold their love, the\r\nsame as the men;\r\n\r\nStrong, well-equipped in muscle and skill, clear of finesse and\r\naffectation--\r\n\r\n(The men, too, clear of much brutality and conceit)--\r\n\r\nComrades together, equal in intelligence and adventure,\r\n\r\nTrusting without concealment, loving without shame but with\r\ndiscrimination and continence towards a perfect passion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nO for a breath of the sea!\r\n\r\nThe necessity and directness of the great elements themselves!\r\n\r\nSwimming the rivers, braving the sun, the cold, taming the\r\nanimals and the earth, conquering the air with wings, and each\r\nother with love--\r\n\r\nThe true, the human society!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ship of Humanity\r\n\r\n(_From \"Gloucester Moors\"_)\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM VAUGHN MOODY\r\n\r\n(American poet and dramatist, 1869-1910)\r\n\r\n    God, dear God!

BERNARD SHAW\r\n\r\n(Irish dramatist and critic, born 1856; recognized as one of\r\nthe world's most brilliant advocates of Socialism)\r\n\r\nThe thoughtless wickedness with which we scatter sentences of\r\nimprisonment, torture in the solitary cell and on the plank\r\nbed, and flogging, on moral invalids and energetic rebels, is\r\nas nothing compared to the stupid levity with which we tolerate\r\npoverty as if it were either a wholesome tonic for lazy people\r\nor else a virtue to be embraced as St. Francis embraced it.\r\nIf a man is indolent, let him be poor. If he is drunken, let\r\nhim be poor. If he is not a gentleman, let him be poor. If he\r\nis addicted to the fine arts or to pure science instead of to\r\ntrade and finance, let him be poor. If he chooses to spend his\r\nurban eighteen shillings a week or his agricultural thirteen\r\nshillings a week on his beer and his family instead of saving\r\nit up for his old age, let him be poor. Let nothing be done\r\nfor \"the undeserving\": let him be poor. Serves him right!\r\nAlso--somewhat inconsistently--blessed are the poor!\r\n\r\nNow what does this Let Him Be Poor mean? It means let him be\r\nweak. Let him be ignorant. Let him become a nucleus of disease.\r\nLet him be a standing exhibition and example of ugliness and\r\ndirt. Let him have rickety children. Let him be cheap and let\r\nhim drag his fellows down to his price by selling himself to do\r\ntheir work. Let his habitations turn our cities into poisonous\r\ncongeries of slums. Let his daughters infect our young men with\r\nthe diseases of the streets and his sons revenge him by turning\r\nthe nation's manhood into scrofula, cowardice, cruelty,\r\nhypocrisy, political imbecility, and all the other fruits of\r\noppression and malnutrition. Let the undeserving become still\r\nless deserving; and let the deserving lay up for himself, not\r\ntreasures in heaven, but horrors in hell upon earth. This being\r\nso, is it really wise to let him be poor? Would he not do ten\r\ntimes less harm as a prosperous burglar, incendiary, ravisher,\r\nor murderer, to the utmost limits of humanity's comparatively\r\nnegligible impulses in these directions? Suppose we were to\r\nabolish all penalties for such activities, and decide that\r\npoverty is the one thing we will not tolerate--that every adult\r\nwith less than, say, £365 a year, shall be painlessly but\r\ninexorably killed, and every hungry half naked child forcibly\r\nfattened and clothed, would not that be an enormous improvement\r\non our existing system, which has already destroyed so many\r\ncivilizations, and is visibly destroying ours in the same way?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jungle\r\n\r\nBY UPTON SINCLAIR\r\n\r\n(See pages 43, 143)\r\n\r\nNow the dreadful winter was come upon them. In the forests,\r\nall summer long, the branches of the trees do battle for\r\nlight, and some of them lose and die; and then come the raging\r\nblasts, and the storms of snow and hail, and strew the ground\r\nwith these weaker branches. Just so it was in Packingtown;\r\nthe whole district braced itself for the struggle that was an\r\nagony, and those whose time was come died off in hordes. All\r\nthe year round they had been serving as cogs in the great\r\npacking-machine; and now was the time for the renovating of\r\nit, and the replacing of damaged parts. There came pneumonia\r\nand grippe, stalking among them, seeking for weakened\r\nconstitutions; there was the annual harvest of those whom\r\ntuberculosis had been dragging down. There came cruel cold, and\r\nbiting winds, and blizzards of snow, all testing relentlessly\r\nfor failing muscles and impoverished blood. Sooner or later\r\ncame the day when the unfit one did not report for work;\r\nand then, with no time lost in waiting, and no inquiries or\r\nregrets, there was a chance for a new hand....\r\n\r\nHome was not a very attractive place--at least not this winter.\r\nThey had only been able to buy one stove, and this was a small\r\none, and proved not big enough to warm even the kitchen in the\r\nbitterest weather. This made it hard for Teta Elzbieta all\r\nday, and for the children when they could not get to school.\r\nAt night they would sit huddled around this stove, while they\r\nate their supper off their laps; and then Jurgis and Jonas\r\nwould smoke a pipe, after which they would all crawl into their\r\nbeds to get warm, after putting out the fire to save the coal.\r\nThen they would have some frightful experiences with the cold.\r\nThey would sleep with all their clothes on, including their\r\novercoats, and put over them all the bedding and spare clothing\r\nthey owned; the children would sleep all crowded into one bed,\r\nand yet even so they could not keep warm. The outside ones\r\nwould be shivering and sobbing, crawling over the others and\r\ntrying to get down into the center, and causing a fight. This\r\nold house with the leaky weather-boards was a very different\r\nthing from their cabins at home, with great thick walls\r\nplastered inside and outside with mud; and the cold which\r\ncame upon them was a living thing, a demon-presence in the\r\nroom. They would waken in the midnight hours, when everything\r\nwas black; perhaps they would hear it yelling outside, or\r\nperhaps there would be deathlike stillness--and that would be\r\nworse yet. They could feel the cold as it crept in through\r\nthe cracks, reaching out for them with its icy, death-dealing\r\nfingers; and they would crouch and cower, and try to hide from\r\nit, all in vain. It would come, and it would come; a grisly\r\nthing, a spectre born in the black caverns of terror; a power\r\nprimeval, cosmic, shadowing the tortures of the lost souls\r\nflung out to chaos and destruction. It was cruel, iron-hard;\r\nand hour after hour they would cringe in its grasp, alone,\r\nalone. There would be no one to hear them if they cried out;\r\nthere would be no help, no mercy. And so on until morning--when\r\nthey would go out to another day of toil, a little weaker, a\r\nlittle nearer to the time when it would be their turn to be\r\nshaken from the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sad Sight of the Hungry\r\n\r\nBY LI HUNG CHANG\r\n\r\n(A poem by the Chinese statesman, 1823-1901; known as the\r\n\"Bismarck of Asia,\" and said to have been the richest man in\r\nthe world)\r\n\r\n    'Twould please me, gods, if you would spare\r\n    Mine eyes from all this hungry stare\r\n    That fills the face and eyes of men\r\n    Who search for food o'er hill and glen.\r\n\r\n    Their eyes are orbs of dullest fire,\r\n    As if the flame would mount up higher;\r\n    But in the darkness of their glow\r\n    We know the fuel's burning low.\r\n\r\n    Such looks, O gods, are not from thee!\r\n    No, they're the stares of misery!\r\n    They speak of hunger's frightful hold\r\n    On lips a-dry and stomachs cold.\r\n\r\n    \"Bread, bread,\" they cry, these weary men,\r\n    With wives and children from the glen!\r\n    O, they would toil the live-long day\r\n    But for a meal, their lives to stay.\r\n\r\n    But where is it in all the land?\r\n    Unless the gods with gen'rous hand\r\n    Send sweetsome rice and strength'ning corn\r\n    To these vast crowds to hunger born!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Right to be Lazy\r\n\r\nBY PAUL LAFARGUE\r\n\r\n(A well-known Socialist writer of France.

What good did Dawn's ministrations do?\r\nSometimes I went out with Miss Bronson, the kindergartner, and\r\nlistened to her talk to uncomprehending mothers about their\r\nduties to their children. What could Miss Bronson accomplish\r\nby playing a few hours a day with the youngsters who had to\r\ngo to filthy homes? They were given a wholesome lunch at the\r\nsettlement. But the two other meals a day they must eat poorly\r\ncooked, adulterated food. Sometimes I went out with Miss Cole,\r\nthe nurse, to visit her cases. It was hard for me to imagine\r\nanything more futile than her single-handed struggle against\r\nunsanitary tenements and unsanitary shops.\r\n\r\nI remember especially one visit I made with her. It was the\r\ncrisis for me. The case was a child-birth. There were six other\r\nchildren, all in one unventilated room; its single window\r\nlooked out on a dark, choked airshaft; and the father was a\r\ndrunkard. I remember sitting there, after the doctor had gone,\r\nholding the next youngest baby on my knee, while Miss Cole was\r\nbathing the puny newcomer.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you make him stop crying for a minute?\" Miss Cole asked\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said with sudden rage. \"I can't. I wouldn't if I could.\r\nWhy shouldn't he cry? Why don't the other little fools cry? Do\r\nyou want them to laugh?\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped working with the baby and offered me a flask of\r\nbrandy from her bag. But brandy was not what I wanted. Of\r\ncourse I knew men sank to the very dregs. But I had never\r\nrealized that some are born there.\r\n\r\nWhen she had done all she could for the mother and child, Miss\r\nCole put her things back in the bag and we started home. It was\r\nlong after midnight, but the streets were still alive.\r\n\r\n\"What good does it do?\" I demanded vehemently. \"Oh, I know--you\r\nand the doctor saved the mother's life--brought a new one into\r\nthe world and all that. But what good does it do? The child\r\nwill die--it was a girl--let's get down on our knees right here\r\nand pray the gods that it may die soon--not grow up to want and\r\nfear--and shame.\" Then I laughed. \"No, there's no use praying.\r\nShe'll die all right! They'll begin feeding her beer out of\r\na can before she's weaned. No. Not that. I don't believe the\r\nmother will be able to nurse her. She'll die of skimmed milk.\r\nAnd if that don't do the trick there's T. B. and several other\r\nthings for her to catch. Oh, she'll die all right! And next\r\nyear there'll be another. For God's sake, what's the use? What\r\ngood does it do?\" Abruptly I began to swear.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't talk like that,\" Miss Cole said in a strained\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't I curse?\" I said fiercely, turning on her\r\nchallengingly, trying to think of some greater blasphemy to\r\nhurl at the muddle of life. But the sight of her face, livid\r\nwith weariness, her lips twisting spasmodically from nervous\r\nexhaustion, showed me one reason not to. The realization that I\r\nhad been so brutal to her shocked me horribly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" I cried.\r\n\r\nShe stumbled slightly. I thought she was going to faint and I\r\nput my arm about her to steady her. She was almost old enough\r\nto be my mother, but she put her head on my shoulder and\r\ncried like a little child. We stood there on the sidewalk--in\r\nthe glare of a noisy, loathsome saloon--like two frightened\r\nchildren. I don't think either of us saw any reason to go\r\nanywhere. But we dried our eyes at last and from mere force of\r\nhabit walked blindly back to the children's house. On the steps\r\nshe broke the long silence.\r\n\r\n\"I know how you feel--everyone's like that at first, but you'll\r\nget used to it. I can't tell 'why.' I can't see that it does\r\nmuch good. But it's got to be done. You mustn't think about it.\r\nThere are things to do, today, tomorrow, all the time. Things\r\nthat must be done. That's how we live. So many things to do,\r\nwe can't think. It would kill you if you had time to think.\r\nYou've got to work--work.\r\n\r\n\"You'll stay too. I know. You won't be able to go away. You've\r\nbeen here too long. You won't ever know 'why.' You'll stop\r\nasking if it does any good. And I tell you if you stop to think\r\nabout it, it will kill you. You must work.\"\r\n\r\nShe went to her room and I across the deserted courtyard and up\r\nto mine. But there was no sleep. It was that night that I first\r\nrealized that I also _must_. I had seen so much I could never\r\nforget. It was something from which there was no escape. No\r\nmatter how glorious the open fields, there would always be the\r\nremembered stink of the tenements in my nostrils. The vision of\r\na sunken-cheeked, tuberculosis-ridden pauper would always rise\r\nbetween me and the beauty of the sunset. A crowd of hurrying\r\nghosts--the ghosts of the slaughtered babies--would follow me\r\neverywhere, crying \"Coward,\" if I ran away. The slums had taken\r\nme captive.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning Women\r\n\r\n(_From \"Aurora Leigh\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING\r\n\r\n(English poetess, 1806-1861; wife of Robert Browning, and an\r\nardent champion of the liberties of the Italian people)\r\n\r\n    I call you hard\r\n    To general suffering. Here's the world half blind\r\n    With intellectual light, half brutalized\r\n    With civilization, having caught the plague\r\n    In silks from Tarsus, shrieking east and west\r\n    Along a thousand railroads, mad with pain\r\n    And sin too!... does one woman of you all,\r\n    (You who weep easily) grow pale to see\r\n    This tiger shake his cage?--does one of you\r\n    Stand still from dancing, stop from stringing pearls,\r\n    And pine and die because of the great sum\r\n    Of universal anguish?--Show me a tear\r\n    Wet as Cordelia's, in eyes bright as yours,\r\n    Because the world is mad. You cannot count,\r\n    That you should weep for this account, not you!\r\n    You weep for what you know. A red-haired child\r\n    Sick in a fever, if you touch him once,\r\n    Though but so little as with a finger-tip,\r\n    Will set you weeping; but a million sick--\r\n    You could as soon weep for the rule of three\r\n    Or compound fractions. Therefore, this same world,\r\n    Uncomprehended by you.--Women as you are,\r\n    Mere women, personal and passionate,\r\n    You give us doting mothers, and perfect wives,\r\n    Sublime Madonnas, and enduring saints!\r\n    We get no Christ from you,--and verily\r\n    We shall not get a poet, in my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen and Economics\r\n\r\nBY CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMAN\r\n\r\n(See page 200)\r\n\r\nRecognizing her intense feeling on moral lines, and seeing in\r\nher the rigidly preserved virtues of faith, submission, and\r\nself-sacrifice--qualities which in the dark ages were held\r\nto be the first of virtues,--we have agreed of late years\r\nto call woman the moral superior of man. But the ceaseless\r\ngrowth of human life, social life, has developed in him new\r\nvirtues, later, higher, more needful; and the moral nature of\r\nwoman, as maintained in this rudimentary stage by her economic\r\ndependence, is a continual check to the progress of the human\r\nsoul. The main feature of her life--the restriction of her\r\nrange and duty to the love and service of her own immediate\r\nfamily--acts upon us continually as a retarding influence,\r\nhindering the expansion of the spirit of social love and\r\nservice on which our very lives depend. It keeps the moral\r\nstandard of the patriarchal era still before us, and blinds our\r\neyes to the full duty of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wrongfulness of Riches\r\n\r\nBY GRANT ALLEN\r\n\r\n(English essayist and nature student, 1848-1899)\r\n\r\nIf you are on the side of the spoilers, then you are a bad man.\r\nIf you are on the side of social justice, then you are a good\r\none. There is no effective test of high morality at the present\r\nday save this.\r\n\r\nCritics of the middle-class type often exclaim, of reasoning\r\nlike this, \"What on earth makes him say it? What has _he_ to\r\ngain by talking in that way? What does he expect to get by it?\"\r\nSo bound up are they in the idea of a self-interest as the\r\none motive of action that they never even seem to conceive of\r\nhonest conviction as a ground for speaking out the truth that\r\nis in one. To such critics I would answer, \"The reason why I\r\nwrite all this is because I profoundly believe it. I believe\r\nthe poor are being kept out of their own. I believe the\r\nrich are for the most part selfish and despicable. I believe\r\nwealth has been generally piled up by cruel and unworthy\r\nmeans. I believe it is wrong in us to acquiesce in the wicked\r\ninequalities of our existing social state, instead of trying\r\nour utmost to bring about another, where right would be done\r\nto all, where poverty would be impossible. I believe such a\r\nsystem is perfectly practicable, and that nothing stands in its\r\nway save the selfish fears and prejudices of individuals. And\r\nI believe that even those craven fears and narrow prejudices\r\nare wholly mistaken; that everybody, including the rich\r\nthemselves, would be infinitely happier in a world where no\r\npoverty existed, where no hateful sights and sounds met the\r\neye at every turn, where all slums were swept away, and where\r\neverybody had their just and even share of pleasures and\r\nrefinements in a free and equal community.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDespair\r\n\r\nBY LADY WILDE\r\n\r\n(Irish poetess, mother of Oscar Wilde; wrote under the pen-name\r\nof Speranza)\r\n\r\n    Before us dies our brother, of starvation;\r\n      Around are cries of famine and despair!\r\n    Where is hope for us, or comfort or salvation--\r\n      Where--oh! where?\r\n    If the angels ever hearken, downward bending,\r\n      They are weeping, we are sure,\r\n    At the litanies of human groans ascending\r\n      From the crushed hearts of the poor.\r\n\r\n    We never knew a childhood's mirth and gladness,\r\n      Nor the proud heart of youth free and brave;\r\n    Oh, a death-like dream of wretchedness and sadness\r\n      Is life's weary journey to the grave!\r\n    Day by day we lower sink, and lower,\r\n      Till the God-like soul within\r\n    Falls crushed beneath the fearful demon power\r\n      Of poverty and sin.\r\n\r\n    So we toil on, on with fever burning\r\n      In heart and brain;\r\n    So we toil on, on through bitter scorning,\r\n      Want, woe, and pain.\r\n    We dare not raise our eyes to the blue heavens\r\n      Or the toil must cease--\r\n    We dare not breathe the fresh air God has given\r\n      One hour in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nInequality of Wealth\r\n\r\nBY G. BERNARD SHAW\r\n\r\n(See page 193)\r\n\r\nI am not bound to keep my temper with an imposture so\r\noutrageous, so abjectly sycophantic, as the pretence that the\r\nexisting inequalities of income correspond to and are produced\r\nby moral and physical inferiorities and superiorities--that\r\nBarnato was five million times as great and good a man as\r\nWilliam Blake, and committed suicide because he lost two-fifths\r\nof his superiority; that the life of Lord Anglesey has\r\nbeen on a far higher plane than that of John Ruskin; that\r\nMademoiselle Liane de Pougy has been raised by her successful\r\nsugar speculation to moral heights never attained by Florence\r\nNightingale; and that an arrangement to establish economic\r\nequality between them by duly adjusted pensions would be\r\nimpossible. I say that no sane person can be expected to treat\r\nsuch impudent follies with patience, much less with respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Songs\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM BLAKE\r\n\r\n(See page 98)\r\n\r\n    I heard an Angel singing\r\n    When the day was springing:\r\n    \"Mercy, pity, and peace,\r\n    Are the world's release.\"\r\n\r\n    So he sang all day\r\n    Over the new-mown hay,\r\n    Till the sun went down,\r\n    And haycocks looked brown\r\n\r\n    I heard a Devil curse\r\n    Over the heath and the furze:\r\n    \"Mercy could be no more\r\n    If there were nobody poor,\r\n    And pity no more could be\r\n\r\n    If all were happy as ye:\r\n    And mutual fear brings peace.\r\n    Misery's increase\r\n    Are mercy, pity, peace.\"\r\n\r\n    At his curse the sun went down,\r\n    And the heavens gave a frown.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JAMES ANTHONY FROUDE\r\n\r\n(English historian, 1818-1894)\r\n\r\nThe endurance of the inequalities of life by the poor is the\r\nmarvel of human society.\r\n\r\n\r\nSavva\r\n\r\nBY LEONID ANDREYEV\r\n\r\n (In this strange drama, which might be called a symbolic tragi-comedy,\r\n the Russian writer has set forth the plight of the educated people\r\n of his country, confronted by the abject superstition of the\r\n peasantry. Savva, a fanatical revolutionist, endeavors to wipe out\r\n this superstition by blowing up a monastery full of drunken monks.\r\n But the plot is revealed to the monks, who carry out the ikon, or\r\n sacred image, before the explosion, and afterwards carry it back into\r\n the ruins. The peasants, arriving on the scene and finding the ikon\r\n uninjured, hail a supreme miracle; the whole country is swept by a\r\n wave of religious frenzy, in the course of which Savva is trampled to\r\n death by a mob.\r\n\r\n In the following scene Savva argues with his sister, a religious\r\n believer. The tramp of pilgrims is heard outside)\r\n\r\nSAVVA (_smiling_):--The tramp of death!\r\n\r\nLIPA:--Remember that each one of these would consider himself\r\nhappy in killing you, in crushing you like a reptile. Each one\r\nof these is your death. Why, they beat a simple thief to death,\r\na horse thief. What would they not do to you? You who wanted to\r\nsteal their God!\r\n\r\nSAVVA:--Quite true. That's property too.\r\n\r\nLIPA:--You still have the brazenness to joke? Who gave you the\r\nright to do such a thing? Who gave you the power over people?\r\nHow dare you meddle with what to them is right? How dare you\r\ninterfere with their life?\r\n\r\nSAVVA:--Who gave me the right? You gave it to me. Who gave\r\nme the power? You gave it to me--you with your malice, your\r\nignorance, your stupidity! You with your wretched impotence!\r\nRight! Power! They have turned the earth into a sewer, an\r\noutrage, an abode of slaves. They worry each other, they\r\ntorture each other, and they ask: \"Who dares to take us by the\r\nthroat?\" I! Do you understand? I!\r\n\r\nLIPA:--But to destroy all! Think of it!\r\n\r\nSAVVA:--What could you do with them? What would _you_ do? Try\r\nto persuade the oxen to turn away from their bovine path?\r\nCatch each one by his horn and pull him away? Would you put\r\non a frock-coat and read a lecture? Haven't they had plenty\r\nto teach them? As if words and thought had any significance\r\nto them! Thought--pure, unhappy thought! They have perverted\r\nit. They have taught it to cheat and defraud. They have made\r\nit a salable commodity, to be bought at auction in the market.\r\nNo, sister, life is short, and I am not going to waste it in\r\narguments with oxen. The way to deal with them is by fire.\r\nThat's what they require--fire!\r\n\r\nLIPA:--But what do you want? What do you want?\r\n\r\nSAVVA:--What do I want? To free the earth, to free mankind.\r\nMan--the man of today--is wise. He has come to his senses.\r\nHe is ripe for liberty. But the past eats away his soul like\r\na canker. It imprisons him within the iron circle of things\r\nalready accomplished. I want to do away with everything behind\r\nman, so that there is nothing to see when he looks back.

And what a world it is! I must face\r\nunflinchingly a world of facts--a world of misery and\r\ndegradation, of blindness, crookedness, and sin, a world\r\nstruggling against the elements, against the unknown, against\r\nitself. How reconcile this world of fact with the bright\r\nworld of my imagining? My darkness had been filled with the\r\nlight of intelligence, and, behold, the outer day-lit world\r\nwas stumbling and groping in social blindness. At first I was\r\nmost unhappy; but deeper study restored my confidence. By\r\nlearning the sufferings and burdens of men, I became aware as\r\nnever before of the life-power that has survived the forces of\r\ndarkness--the power which, though never completely victorious,\r\nis continuously conquering. The very fact that we are still\r\nhere carrying on the contest against the hosts of annihilation\r\nproves that on the whole the battle has gone for humanity.\r\nThe world's great heart has proved equal to the prodigious\r\nundertaking which God set it. Rebuffed, but always persevering;\r\nself-reproached, but ever regaining faith; undaunted,\r\ntenacious, the heart of man labors towards immeasurably distant\r\ngoals. Discouraged not by difficulties without, or the anguish\r\nof ages within, the heart listens to a secret voice that\r\nwhispers: \"Be not dismayed; in the future lies the Promised\r\nLand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHeirs of Time\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON\r\n\r\n(American poet and essayist, 1823-1911; a vehement anti-slavery\r\nagitator, he was colonel of the first negro regiment during the\r\nCivil War, and in later life became a devoted Socialist)\r\n\r\n    From street and square, from hill and glen,\r\n      Of this vast world beyond my door,\r\n    I hear the tread of marching men,\r\n      The patient armies of the poor.\r\n\r\n    Not ermine-clad or clothed in state,\r\n      Their title-deeds not yet made plain,\r\n    But waking early, toiling late,\r\n      The heirs of all the earth remain.\r\n\r\n    The peasant brain shall yet be wise,\r\n      The untamed pulse grow calm and still;\r\n    The blind shall see, the lowly rise,\r\n      And work in peace Time's wondrous will.\r\n\r\n    Some day, without a trumpet's call\r\n      This news will o'er the world be blown:\r\n    \"The heritage comes back to all;\r\n      The myriad monarchs take their own.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond Human Might\r\n\r\nBY BJÖRNSTJERNE BJÖRNSON\r\n\r\n (Next to Ibsen, the greatest of Norwegian dramatists, 1832-1910.

Ay, though one of us here and\r\nthere may die in faith, in sight of the promised land, yet\r\nis it not hard, when looking from the top of Pisgah into\r\n\"the good time coming,\" to watch the years slipping away one\r\nby one, and death crawling nearer and nearer, and the people\r\nwearying themselves in the fire for very vanity, and Jordan\r\nnot yet passed, the promised land not yet entered? While our\r\nlittle children die around us, like lambs beneath the knife,\r\nof cholera and typhus and consumption, and all the diseases\r\nwhich the good time can and will prevent; which, as science\r\nhas proved, and you the rich confess, might be prevented at\r\nonce, if you dared to bring in one bold and comprehensive\r\nmeasure, and not sacrifice yearly the lives of thousands to the\r\nidol of vested interests, and a majority in the House. Is it\r\nnot hard to men who smart beneath such things to help crying\r\naloud--\"Thou cursed Moloch-Mammon, take my life if thou wilt;\r\nlet me die in the wilderness, for I have deserved it; but\r\nthese little ones in mines and factories, in typhus cellars\r\nand Tooting pandemoniums, what have they done?

The\r\ngeneral spread of the light of science has already laid open to\r\nevery view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not\r\nbeen born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted\r\nand spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Vindication of Natural Society\r\n\r\nBY EDMUND BURKE\r\n\r\n(British statesman and orator, 1729-1797; defended the American\r\ncolonies in Parliament during the Revolutionary War)\r\n\r\nAsk of politicians the ends for which laws were originally\r\ndesigned, and they will answer that the laws were designed as a\r\nprotection for the poor and weak, against the oppression of the\r\nrich and powerful. But surely no pretence can be so ridiculous;\r\na man might as well tell me he has taken off my load, because\r\nhe has changed the burden. If the poor man is not able to\r\nsupport his suit according to the vexatious and expensive\r\nmanner established in civilized countries, has not the rich as\r\ngreat an advantage over him as the strong has over the weak in\r\na state of nature?...\r\n\r\nThe most obvious division of society is into rich and poor,\r\nand it is no less obvious that the number of the former bear a\r\ngreat disproportion to those of the latter. The whole business\r\nof the poor is to administer to the idleness, folly, and luxury\r\nof the rich, and that of the rich, in return, is to find the\r\nbest methods of confirming the slavery and increasing the\r\nburdens of the poor. In a state of nature it is an invariable\r\nlaw that a man's acquisitions are in proportion to his labors.\r\nIn a state of artificial society it is a law as constant and\r\ninvariable that those who labor most enjoy the fewest things,\r\nand that those who labor not at all have the greatest number\r\nof enjoyments. A constitution of things this, strange and\r\nridiculous beyond expression! We scarce believe a thing when\r\nwe are told it which we actually see before our eyes every day\r\nwithout being in the least surprised. I suppose that there\r\nare in Great Britain upwards of an hundred thousand people\r\nemployed in lead, tin, iron, copper, and coal mines; these\r\nunhappy wretches scarce ever see the light of the sun; they are\r\nburied in the bowels of the earth; there they work at a severe\r\nand dismal task, without the least prospect of being delivered\r\nfrom it; they subsist upon the coarsest and worst sort of\r\nfare; they have their health miserably impaired, and their\r\nlives cut short, by being perpetually confined in the close\r\nvapors of these malignant minerals. An hundred thousand more at\r\nleast are tortured without remission by the suffocating smoke,\r\nintense fires, and constant drudgery necessary in refining and\r\nmanaging the products of those mines. If any man informed us\r\nthat two hundred thousand innocent persons were condemned to so\r\nintolerable slavery, how should we pity the unhappy sufferers,\r\nand how great would be our just indignation against those who\r\ninflicted so cruel and ignominious a punishment! This is an\r\ninstance--I could not wish a stronger--of the numberless things\r\nwhich we pass by in their common dress, yet which shock us when\r\nthey are nakedly represented....\r\n\r\nIn a misery of this sort, admitting some few lenitives, and\r\nthose too but a few, nine parts in ten of the whole race\r\nof mankind drudge through life. It may be urged, perhaps,\r\nin palliation of this, that at least the rich few find a\r\nconsiderable and real benefit from the wretchedness of the\r\nmany. But is this so in fact?...\r\n\r\nThe poor by their excessive labor, and the rich by their\r\nenormous luxury, are set upon a level, and rendered equally\r\nignorant of any knowledge which might conduce to their\r\nhappiness. A dismal view of the interior of all civil society!\r\nThe lower part broken and ground down by the most cruel\r\noppression; and the rich by their artificial method of life\r\nbringing worse evils on themselves than their tyranny could\r\npossibly inflict on those below them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Antiquity of Freedom\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT\r\n\r\n(American poet and editor, 1794-1878; author of \"Thanatopsis\")\r\n\r\n    O freedom! thou art not, as poets dream,\r\n    A fair young girl, with light and delicate limbs,\r\n    And wavy tresses gushing from the cap\r\n    With which the Roman master crowned his slave\r\n    When he took off the gyves. A bearded man,\r\n    Armed to the teeth, art thou; one mailed hand\r\n    Grasps the broad shield, and one the sword; thy brow,\r\n    Glorious in beauty though it be, is scarred\r\n    With tokens of old wars; thy massive limbs\r\n    Are strong with struggling. Power at thee has launched\r\n    His bolts, and with his lightnings smitten thee;\r\n    They could not quench the life thou hast from heaven.\r\n    Merciless Power has dug thy dungeon deep,\r\n    And his swart armorers, by a thousand fires,\r\n    Have forged thy chain; yet, while he deems thee bound,\r\n    The links are shivered, and the prison walls\r\n    Fall outward; terribly thou springest forth,\r\n    As springs the flame above a burning pile,\r\n    And shoutest to the nations, who return\r\n    Thy shoutings, while the pale oppressor flies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY LORD BYRON\r\n\r\n(English poet of liberty, 1788-1824; died while taking part in\r\nthe war for the liberation of Greece)\r\n\r\n    Hereditary bondsmen! know ye not\r\n    Who would be free themselves must strike the blow?\r\n    By their right arms the conquest must be wrought?\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning Moderation\r\n\r\nBY LAFCADIO HEARN\r\n\r\n(A writer of Irish and Greek parentage, 1850-1904; became a\r\nlecturer on English in the University of Tokio. Japan's ablest\r\ninterpreter to the western world)\r\n\r\nPermit me to say something in opposition to a very famous and\r\nvery popular Latin proverb--In medio tutissimus ibis--\"Thou\r\nwilt go most safely by taking the middle course.\" In speaking\r\nof two distinct tendencies in literature, you might expect me\r\nto say that the aim of the student should be to avoid extremes,\r\nand to try not to be either too conservative or too liberal.\r\nBut I should certainly never give any such advice. On the\r\ncontrary, I think that the proverb above quoted is one of the\r\nmost mischievous, one of the most pernicious, one of the most\r\nfoolish, that ever was invented in the world. I believe very\r\nstrongly in extremes--in violent extremes; and I am quite\r\nsure that all progress in this world, whether literary, or\r\nscientific, or religious, or political, or social, has been\r\nobtained only with the assistance of extremes. But remember\r\nthat I say, \"With the assistance,\"--I do not mean that\r\nextremes alone accomplish the aim: there must be antagonism,\r\nbut there must also be conservatism. What I mean by finding\r\nfault with the proverb is simply this--that it is very bad\r\nadvice for a young man. To give a young man such advice is\r\nvery much like telling him not to do his best, but only to do\r\nhalf of his best--or, in other words, to be half-hearted in\r\nhis undertaking.... It is not the old men who ever prove great\r\nreformers: they are too cautious, too wise. Reforms are made by\r\nthe vigor and courage and the self-sacrifice and the emotional\r\nconviction of young men, who did not know enough to be afraid,\r\nand who feel much more deeply than they think. Indeed great\r\nreforms are not accomplished by reasoning, but by feeling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUTBREAK\r\n\r\nKÄTHE KOLLWITZ\r\n\r\n(_Contemporary German etching; from the \"Peasant-cycle\"_)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LIBERATRESS\r\n\r\nTHÉOPHILE ALEXANDRE STEINLEN\r\n\r\n(_French illustrator, born 1859_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Issue of \"The Liberator\"\r\n\r\n(_January 1, 1831_)\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON\r\n\r\n(America's most ardent anti-slavery agitator, 1805-1879.\r\nThe following pronouncement marked the beginning of the\r\nanti-slavery campaign)\r\n\r\nI am aware that many object to the severity of my language; but\r\nis there not cause for severity?

The following is from his\r\n contributions to the Dresden _Volksblätter_)\r\n\r\nI am the secret of perpetual youth, the everlasting creator of\r\nlife; where I am not, death rages. I am the comfort, the hope,\r\nthe dream of the oppressed. I destroy what exists; but from the\r\nrock whereon I light new life begins to flow. I come to you\r\nto break all chains which bear you down; to free you from the\r\nembrace of death, and instill a new life into your veins. All\r\nthat exists must perish; that is the eternal condition of life,\r\nand I the all-destroying fulfil that law to create a fresh, new\r\nexistence. I will renovate to the very foundations the order of\r\nthings in which you live, for it is the offspring of sin, whose\r\nblossom is misery and whose fruit is crime. The grain is ripe,\r\nand I am the reaper. I will dissipate every delusion which\r\nhas mastery over the human race. I will destroy the authority\r\nof the one over the many; of the lifeless over the living;\r\nof the material over the spiritual. I will break into pieces\r\nthe authority of the great; of the law of property. Let the\r\nwill of each be master of mankind, one's own strength be one's\r\none property, for the freeman is the sacred man, and there is\r\nnothing sublimer than he....\r\n\r\nI will destroy the existing order of things which divides one\r\nhumanity into hostile peoples, into strong and weak, into\r\nprivileged and outlawed, into rich and poor; for that makes\r\nunfortunate creatures of one and all. I will destroy the order\r\nof things which makes millions the slaves of the few, and\r\nthose few the slaves of their own power, of their own wealth.\r\nI will destroy the order of things which severs enjoyment from\r\nlabor, which turns labor into a burden and enjoyment into a\r\nvice, which makes one man miserable through want and another\r\nmiserable through super-abundance. I will destroy the order of\r\nthings which consumes the vigor of manhood in the service of\r\nthe dead, of inert matter, which sustains one part of mankind\r\nin idleness or useless activity, which forces thousands to\r\ndevote their sturdy youth to the indolent pursuits of soldiery,\r\nofficialism, speculation and usury, and the maintenance of\r\nsuch like despicable conditions, while the other half, by\r\nexcessive exertion and sacrifice of all the enjoyment of life,\r\nbears the burden of the whole infamous structure. I will\r\ndestroy even the very memory and trace of this delirious order\r\nof things which, pieced together out of force, falsehood,\r\ntrouble, tears, sorrow, suffering, need, deceit, hypocrisy and\r\ncrime, is shut up in its own reeking atmosphere, and never\r\nreceives a breath of pure air, to which no ray of pure joy ever\r\npenetrates....\r\n\r\nArise, then, ye people of the earth, arise, ye sorrow-stricken\r\nand oppressed. Ye, also, who vainly struggle to clothe the\r\ninner desolation of your hearts, with the transient glory of\r\nriches, arise! Come and follow in my track with the joyful\r\ncrowd, for I know not how to make distinction between those\r\nwho follow me. There are but two peoples from henceforth on\r\nearth--the one which follows me, and the one which resists me.\r\nThe one I will lead to happiness, but the other I will crush\r\nin my progress. For I am the Revolution, I am the new creating\r\nforce. I am the divinity which discerns all life, which\r\nembraces, revives, and rewards.\r\n\r\n\r\nCry of the People\r\n\r\nBY JOHN G.

In the preface to this book one\r\n learns that it is only a faint sketch from memory of part of a great\r\n work, the manuscript of which was destroyed during the Boer war)\r\n\r\nThrown into strict logical form, our demand is this: We do not\r\nask that the wheels of time should reverse themselves, or the\r\nstream of life flow backward. We do not ask that our ancient\r\nspinning-wheels be again resuscitated and placed in our hands;\r\nwe do not demand that our old grindstones and hoes be returned\r\nto us, or that man should again betake himself entirely to\r\nhis ancient province of war and the chase, leaving to us all\r\ndomestic and civil labor. We do not even demand that society\r\nshall immediately so reconstruct itself that every woman may be\r\nagain a childbearer (deep and overmastering as lies the hunger\r\nfor motherhood in every virile woman's heart!); neither do we\r\ndemand that the children we bear shall again be put exclusively\r\ninto our hands to train. This, we know, cannot be. The past\r\nmaterial conditions of life have gone for ever; no will of man\r\ncan recall them. But _this_ is our demand: We demand that,\r\nin that strange new world that is arising alike upon the man\r\nand the woman, where nothing is as it was, and all things are\r\nassuming new shapes and relations, that in this new world we\r\nalso shall have our share of honored and socially useful human\r\ntoil, our full half of the labor of the Children of Woman. We\r\ndemand nothing more than this, and will take nothing less.\r\n_This is our_ \"WOMAN'S RIGHT!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies in Rebellion\r\n\r\nBY ABIGAIL ADAMS\r\n\r\n(Wife of one president of the United States, and mother of\r\nanother.

If\r\nparticular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are\r\ndetermined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves\r\nbound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Doll's House\r\n\r\nBY HENRIK IBSEN\r\n\r\n(Norwegian dramatist, 1828-1906. A play which may be called the\r\nsource of the modern Feminist movement. In the following scene\r\na young wife announces her revolt)\r\n\r\nNORA:--While I was at home with father, he used to tell me his\r\nopinions, and I held the same opinions. If I had others, I\r\nconcealed them, because he wouldn't have liked it. He used to\r\ncall me his doll-child, and played with me as I played with my\r\ndolls. Then I came to live in your house--\r\n\r\nHELMER:--What an expression to use about our marriage!\r\n\r\nNORA (_undisturbed_):--I mean I passed from father's hands into\r\nyours. You settled everything according to your taste; and I\r\ngot the same tastes as you; or I pretended to--I don't know\r\nwhich--both ways, perhaps. When I look back on it now, I seem\r\nto have been living here like a beggar, from hand to mouth. I\r\nlived by performing tricks for you, Torvald. But you would have\r\nit so. You and father have done me a great wrong. It is your\r\nfault that my life has been wasted.\r\n\r\nHELMER:--Why, Nora, how unreasonable and ungrateful you are.\r\nHaven't you been happy here?\r\n\r\nNORA:--No, only merry. And you have always been so kind to\r\nme. But your house has been nothing but a play-room. Here I\r\nhave been your doll-wife, just as at home I used to be papa's\r\ndoll-child. And the children, in their turn, have been my\r\ndolls. I thought it fun when you played with me, just as\r\nthe children did when I played with them. That has been our\r\nmarriage, Torvald.... And that is why I am now leaving you!\r\n\r\nHELMER (_jumping up_):--What--do you mean to say--\r\n\r\nNORA:--I must stand quite alone, to know myself and my\r\nsurroundings; so I can't stay with you.\r\n\r\nHELMER:--Nora! Nora!\r\n\r\nNORA:--I am going at once. Christina will take me for tonight.\r\n\r\nHELMER:--You are mad! I shall not allow it. I forbid it.\r\n\r\nNORA:--It is no use your forbidding me anything now. I shall\r\ntake with me what belongs to me. From you I will accept\r\nnothing, either now or afterwards....\r\n\r\nHELMER:--To forsake your home, your husband, and your children!\r\nYou don't consider what the world will say.\r\n\r\nNORA:--I can pay no heed to that. I only know what I must do.\r\n\r\nHELMER:--It is exasperating! Can you forsake your holiest\r\nduties in this world?\r\n\r\nNORA:--What do you call my holiest duties?\r\n\r\nHELMER:--Do you ask me that?

The present scene describes a meeting in\r\nCarnegie Hall)\r\n\r\nYetta stood there alone, the blood mounting to her cheeks,\r\nlooking more and more like an orchid, and waited for the storm\r\nto pass.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to talk about this strike,\" she said when she\r\ncould make herself heard. \"It's over. I want to tell you about\r\nthe next one--and the next. I wish very much I could make you\r\nunderstand about the strikes that are coming....\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps there's some of you never thought much about strikes\r\ntill now. Well. There's been strikes all the time. I don't\r\nbelieve there's ever been a year when there wasn't dozens here\r\nin New York. When we began, the skirt-finishers was out. They\r\nlost their strike. They went hungry just the way we did, but\r\nnobody helped them. And they're worse now than ever. There\r\nain't no difference between one strike and another. Perhaps\r\nthey are striking for more pay or recognition or closed shops.\r\nBut the next strike'll be just like ours. It'll be people\r\nfighting so they won't be so much slaves like they was before.\r\n\r\n\"The Chairman said perhaps I'd tell you about my experience.\r\nThere ain't nothing to tell except everybody has been awful\r\nkind to me. It's fine to have people so kind to me. But I'd\r\nrather if they'd try to understand what this strike business\r\nmeans to all of us workers--this strike we've won and the ones\r\nthat are coming....\r\n\r\n\"I come out of the workhouse today, and they tell me a lady\r\nwants to give me money to study, she wants to have me go to\r\ncollege like I was a rich girl. It's very kind. I want to\r\nstudy. I ain't been to school none since I was fifteen. I\r\nguess I can't even talk English very good. I'd like to go to\r\ncollege. And I used to see pictures in the papers of beautiful\r\nrich women, and of course it would be fine to have clothes like\r\nthat. But being in a strike, seeing all the people suffer,\r\nseeing all the cruelty--it makes things look different.\r\n\r\n\"The Chairman told you something out of the Christian Bible.\r\nWell, we Jews have got a story too--perhaps it's in your\r\nBible--about Moses and his people in Egypt. He'd been brought\r\nup by a rich Egyptian lady--a princess--just like he was her\r\nson. But as long as he tried to be an Egyptian he wasn't no\r\ngood. And God spoke to him one day out of a bush on fire. I\r\ndon't remember just the words of the story, but God said:\r\n'Moses, you're a Jew. You ain't got no business with the\r\nEgyptians. Take off those fine clothes and go back to your own\r\npeople and help them escape from bondage.' Well. Of course, I\r\nain't like Moses, and God has never talked to me. But it seems\r\nto me sort of as if--during this strike--I'd seen a BLAZING\r\nBUSH. Anyhow I've seen my people in bondage. And I don't want\r\nto go to college and be a lady. I guess the kind princess\r\ncouldn't understand why Moses wanted to be a poor Jew instead\r\nof a rich Egyptian. But if you can understand, if you can\r\nunderstand why I'm going to stay with my own people, you'll\r\nunderstand all I've been trying to say.\r\n\r\n\"We're a people in bondage. There's lots of people who's kind\r\nto us. I guess the princess wasn't the only Egyptian lady that\r\nwas kind to the Jews. But kindness ain't what people want who\r\nare in bondage. Kindness won't never make us free. And God\r\ndon't send any more prophets nowadays. We've got to escape all\r\nby ourselves. And when you read in the papers that there's a\r\nstrike--it don't matter whether it's street-car conductors or\r\nlace-makers, whether it's Eyetalians or Polacks or Jews or\r\nAmericans, whether it's here or in Chicago--it's my People--the\r\nPeople in Bondage who are starting out for the Promised Land.\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped a moment, and a strange look came over her face--a\r\nlook of communication with some distant spirit. When she spoke\r\nagain, her words were unintelligible to most of the audience.\r\nSome of the Jewish vest-makers understood. And the Rev. Dunham\r\nDenning, who was a famous scholar, understood. But even those\r\nwho did not were held spellbound by the swinging sonorous\r\ncadence. She stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"It's Hebrew,\" she explained. \"It's what my father taught me\r\nwhen I was a little girl. It's about the Promised Land--I can't\r\nsay it in good English--I----\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless I've forgotten my Hebrew,\" the Reverend Chairman said,\r\nstepping forward, \"Miss Rayefsky has been repeating God's words\r\nto Moses as recorded in the third chapter of Exodus. I think\r\nit's the seventh verse:--\r\n\r\n\"'And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my\r\npeople which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason\r\nof their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;\r\n\r\n\"'And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the\r\nEgyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good\r\nland and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That's it,\" Yetta said. \"Well, that's what strikes mean.\r\nWe're fighting for the old promises.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"New\" Women\r\n\r\nBY OLIVE SCHREINER\r\n\r\n(See page 240)\r\n\r\nWe are not new!

The password was given\r\nand a date and hour secretly appointed. On Monday morning, the\r\nsixth of April, 1903, no train was to run on any railway in the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nSunday evening I set out, as one of the forty delegates, on the\r\nwarpath. I took leave of my family, filled a suitcase with\r\npamphlets and fly-leaves, and arrived in the middle of the\r\nnight at the little town of Amersfoort, an important railway\r\njunction, to bring my message from headquarters that a strike\r\nwould be declared that night in the whole country. Expecting\r\nthe Government to be very active and energetic and not unlikely\r\nto arrest me, I took an assumed name, and was dressed like a\r\nlaborer....\r\n\r\nI stayed a week in that little town, living in the houses of\r\nthe strikers, sharing their meals and their hours of suspense\r\nand anxiety. There was a dark, dingy meeting-room where they\r\nall preferred to gather, rather than stay at home. The women\r\nalso regularly attended these meetings, sometimes bringing\r\ntheir children, and they all sought the comfort of being in\r\ncompany, talking of hopes and fears, cheering each other up\r\nby songs, and trying to raise each other's spirits during the\r\nlong days of inaction. I addressed them, three or four times\r\na day, trying to give them sound notions on social conditions\r\nand preparing them for the defeat which I soon knew to be\r\ninevitable. I may say, however, that, though I was of all the\r\nforty delegates the least hopeful of ultimate success, my\r\nlittle party was the last to surrender and showed the smallest\r\npercentage of fugitives.\r\n\r\nI saw in those days of strife that of the two contending\r\nparties, the stronger, the victorious one, was by far the\r\nleast sympathetic in its moral attitude and methods. The\r\nstrikers were pathetically stupid and ignorant about the\r\nstrength of their opponents and their own weakness. If they had\r\nunexpectedly gained a complete victory they would have been\r\nutterly unable to use it. If the political power had shifted\r\nfrom the hands of the Government to those of the leading staff\r\nof that general strike, the result would have been a terrible\r\nconfusion. There was no mind strong enough, no hand firm\r\nenough among them to rule and reorganize that mass of workers,\r\nunaccustomed to freedom, untrained to self-control, unable to\r\nwork without severe authority and discipline. Yet the feelings\r\nand motives of that multitude were fair and just--they showed\r\na chivalry, a generosity, an idealism and an enthusiasm with\r\nwhich the low methods of their powerful opponents contrasted\r\npainfully.\r\n\r\nEvery striker had to fight his own fight at home. Every evening\r\nhe had to face the worn and anxious face of his wife, the sight\r\nof his children in danger of starvation and misery. He had to\r\nnotice the hidden tears of the woman, or to answer her doubts\r\nand reproaches, with a mind itself far from confident. He had\r\nto fight in his own heart the egotistical inclination to save\r\nhimself and give up what he felt to be his best sentiment,\r\nsolidarity, the faith towards his comrades.\r\n\r\nI believe no feeling man of the leisure class could have gone\r\nthrough a week in those surroundings and taken part in a\r\nstruggle like this without acquiring a different conception of\r\nthe ethics of socialism and class war.\r\n\r\nFor on the other side there were the Government, the companies,\r\nthe defendants of existing order, powerful by their wealth,\r\nby their routine, by their experience, and supported by the\r\nservility of the great public and the army. They had not to\r\nface any real danger (the strikers showed no inclination to\r\ndeeds of violence), and the arms they used were intimidation\r\nand bribery. The only thing for them to do was to demoralize\r\nthe striker, to make him an egoist, a coward, a traitor to his\r\ncomrades. And this was done quietly and successfully.\r\n\r\nDemoralizing the enemy may be the lawful object of every\r\nwar--the unavoidable evil to prevent a greater wrong; yet in\r\nthis case, where the method of corruption could be used only\r\non one side, it showed the ugly character of the conflict.\r\nThis was no fair battle with common moral rules of chivalry\r\nand generosity; it was a pitiful and hopeless struggle between\r\na weak slave and a strong usurper, between an ill-treated,\r\nrevolting child and a brutal oppressor, who cared only for the\r\nrestoration of his authority, not for the morals of the child.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Meaneth a Tyrant, and how he Useth his Power in a Kingdom\r\nWhen he hath Obtained it\r\n\r\n(_From \"Las Siete Partidas\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ALFONSO THE WISE\r\n\r\n(A Spanish king of great learning; 1226-1284)\r\n\r\nA tyrant doth signify a cruel lord, who, by force or by craft,\r\nor by treachery, hath obtained power over any realm or country;\r\nand such men be of such nature, that when once they have grown\r\nstrong in the land, they love rather to work their own profit,\r\nthough it be to the harm of the land, than the common profit of\r\nall, for they always live in an ill fear of losing it. And that\r\nthey may be able to fulfil this their purpose unencumbered,\r\nthe wise of old have said that they use their power against\r\nthe people in three manners. The first is, that they strive\r\nthat those under their mastery be ever ignorant and timorous,\r\nbecause, when they be such, they may not be bold to rise\r\nagainst them, nor to resist their wills; and the second is,\r\nthat their victims be not kindly and united among themselves,\r\nin such wise that they trust not one another, for while they\r\nlive in disagreement, they shall not dare to make any discourse\r\nagainst their lord, for fear faith and secrecy should not be\r\nkept among themselves; and the third way is, that they strive\r\nto make them poor, and to put them upon great undertakings,\r\nwhich they can never finish, whereby they may have so much harm\r\nthat it may never come into their hearts to devise anything\r\nagainst their ruler. And above all this, have tyrants ever\r\nstriven to make spoil of the strong and to destroy the wise;\r\nand have forbidden fellowship and assemblies of men in their\r\nland, and striven always to know what men said or did; and do\r\ntrust their counsel and the guard of their person rather to\r\nforeigners, who will serve at their will, than to them of the\r\nland, who serve from oppression.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Open Letter to the Employers\r\n\r\nBY \"A.E.\" (GEORGE W. RUSSELL)\r\n\r\n (This remarkable piece of eloquence, published in the Dublin _Times_\r\n at the time of the great strike of 1913, is said to have completely\r\n revolutionized public opinion on the question. The author, born\r\n 1867, is one of Ireland's greatest poets, and an ardent advocate of\r\n agricultural co-operation)\r\n\r\nSirs:--I address this warning to you, the aristocracy of\r\nindustry in this city, because, like all aristocracies, you\r\ntend to grow blind in long authority, and to be unaware that\r\nyou and your class and its every action are being considered\r\nand judged day by day by those who have power to shake or\r\noverturn the whole social order, and whose restlessness in\r\npoverty today is making our industrial civilization stir like a\r\nquaking bog. You do not seem to realize that your assumption\r\nthat you are answerable to yourselves alone for your actions in\r\nthe industries you control is one that becomes less and less\r\ntolerable in a world so crowded with necessitous life. Some of\r\nyou have helped Irish farmers to upset a landed aristocracy\r\nin the island, an aristocracy richer and more powerful in its\r\nsphere than you are in yours, with its roots deep in history.\r\nThey, too, as a class, though not all of them, were scornful\r\nor neglectful of the workers in the industry by which they\r\nprofited; and to many who knew them in their pride of place and\r\nthought them all-powerful they are already becoming a memory,\r\nthe good disappearing with the bad. If they had done their duty\r\nby those from whose labor came their wealth, they might have\r\ncontinued unquestioned in power and prestige for centuries to\r\ncome. The relation of landlord and tenant is not an ideal one,\r\nbut any relations in a social order will endure if there is\r\ninfused into them some of that spirit of human sympathy which\r\nqualifies life for immortality. Despotisms endure while they\r\nare benevolent, and aristocracies while \"_noblesse oblige_\" is\r\nnot a phrase to be referred to with a cynical smile. Even an\r\noligarchy might be permanent if the spirit of human kindness,\r\nwhich harmonizes all things otherwise incompatible, were\r\npresent....\r\n\r\nThose who have economic power have civic power also, yet you\r\nhave not used the power that was yours to right what was wrong\r\nin the evil administration of this city. You have allowed\r\nthe poor to be herded together so that one thinks of certain\r\nplaces in Dublin as of a pestilence. There are twenty thousand\r\nrooms, in each of which live entire families, and sometimes\r\nmore, where no functions of the body can be concealed, and\r\ndelicacy and modesty are creatures that are stifled ere they\r\nare born. The obvious duty of you in regard to these things\r\nyou might have left undone, and it be imputed to ignorance or\r\nforgetfulness; but your collective and conscious action as a\r\nclass in the present labor dispute has revealed you to the\r\nworld in so malign an aspect that the mirror must be held up to\r\nyou, so that you may see yourself as every humane person sees\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThe conception of yourselves as altogether virtuous and wronged\r\nis, I assure you, not at all the one which onlookers hold of\r\nyou.... The representatives of labor unions in Great Britain\r\nmet you, and you made of them a preposterous, an impossible\r\ndemand, and because they would not accede to it you closed\r\nthe Conference; you refused to meet them further; you assumed\r\nthat no other guarantees than those you asked were possible,\r\nand you determined deliberately, in cold anger, to starve out\r\none-third of the population of this city, to break the manhood\r\nof the men by the sight of the suffering of their wives and the\r\nhunger of their children. We read in the Dark Ages of the rack\r\nand thumbscrew. But these iniquities were hidden and concealed\r\nfrom the knowledge of men in dungeons and torture-chambers.\r\nEven in the Dark Ages humanity could not endure the sight of\r\nsuch suffering, and it learnt of such misuse of power by slow\r\ndegrees, through rumor, and when it was certain it razed its\r\nBastilles to their foundations. It remained for the twentieth\r\ncentury and the capital city of Ireland to see an oligarchy of\r\nfour hundred masters deciding openly upon starving one hundred\r\nthousand people, and refusing to consider any solution except\r\nthat fixed by their pride. You, masters, asked men to do that\r\nwhich masters of labor in any other city in these islands had\r\nnot dared to do. You insolently demanded of these men who were\r\nmembers of a trade union that they should resign from that\r\nunion; and from those who were not members you insisted on a\r\nvow that they would never join it.\r\n\r\nYour insolence and ignorance of the rights conceded to workers\r\nuniversally in the modern world were incredible, and as great\r\nas your inhumanity. If you had between you collectively a\r\nportion of human soul as large as a three-penny bit, you would\r\nhave sat night and day with the representatives of labor,\r\ntrying this or that solution of the trouble, mindful of the\r\nwomen and children, who at least were innocent of wrong against\r\nyou. But no! You reminded labor you could always have your\r\nthree square meals a day while it went hungry. You went into\r\nconference again with representatives of the State, because,\r\ndull as you are, you knew public opinion would not stand your\r\nholding out. You chose as your spokesman the bitterest tongue\r\nthat ever wagged in this island, and then, when an award was\r\nmade by men who have an experience in industrial matters a\r\nthousand times transcending yours, who have settled disputes\r\nin industries so great that the sum of your petty enterprises\r\nwould not equal them, you withdraw again, and will not agree\r\nto accept their solution, and fall back again on your devilish\r\npolicy of starvation. Cry aloud to Heaven for new souls! The\r\nsouls you have got cast upon the screen of publicity appear\r\nlike the horrid and writhing creatures enlarged from the insect\r\nworld, and revealed to us by the cinematograph.\r\n\r\nYou may succeed in your policy and ensure your own damnation by\r\nyour victory. The men whose manhood you have broken will loathe\r\nyou, and will always be brooding and scheming to strike a fresh\r\nblow. The children will be taught to curse you. The infant\r\nbeing molded in the womb will have breathed into its starved\r\nbody the vitality of hate. It is not they--it is you who are\r\nblind Samsons pulling down the pillars of the social order.\r\nYou are sounding the death-knell of autocracy in industry.\r\nThere was autocracy in political life, and it was superseded\r\nby democracy. So surely will democratic power wrest from you\r\nthe control of industry. The fate of you, the aristocracy of\r\nindustry, will be as the fate of the aristocracy of land if\r\nyou do not show that you have some humanity still among you.\r\nHumanity abhors, above all things, a vacuum in itself, and your\r\nclass will be cut off from humanity as the surgeon cuts the\r\ncancer and alien growth from the body. Be warned ere it is too\r\nlate.\r\n\r\n\r\nGod and the Strong Ones\r\n\r\nBY MARGARET WIDDEMER\r\n\r\n(Contemporary American poet)\r\n\r\n    \"We have made them fools and weak!\" said the Strong Ones:\r\n      \"We have bound them, they are dumb and deaf and blind;\r\n    We have crushed them in our hands like a heap of crumbling sands,\r\n      We have left them naught to seek or find:\r\n    They are quiet at our feet!\" said the Strong Ones;\r\n      \"We have made them one with wood and stone and clod;\r\n    Serf and laborer and woman, they are less than wise or human!----\"\r\n          _\"I shall raise the weak!\" saith God._\r\n\r\n    \"They are stirring in the dark!\" said the Strong Ones,\r\n      \"They are struggling, who were moveless like the dead;\r\n    We can hear them cry and strain hand and foot against the chain,\r\n      We can hear their heavy upward tread....\r\n    What if they are restless?\" said the Strong Ones;\r\n      \"What if they have stirred beneath the rod?\r\n    Fools and weak and blinded men, we can tread them down again----\"\r\n          _\"Shall ye conquer Me?\" saith God._\r\n\r\n    \"They will trample us and bind!\" said the Strong Ones;\r\n      \"We are crushed beneath the blackened feet and hands;\r\n    All the strong and fair and great they will crush from out the state;\r\n      They will whelm it with the weight of pressing sands--\r\n    They are maddened and are blind!\" said the Strong Ones;\r\n      \"Black decay has come where they have trod;\r\n    They will break the world in twain if their hands are on the rein--\"\r\n          _\"What is that to me?\" saith God._\r\n\r\n    _\"Ye have made them in their strength, who were Strong Ones,\r\n      Ye have only taught the blackness ye have known:\r\n    These are evil men and blind?--Ay, but molded to your mind!\r\n      How shall ye cry out against your own?\r\n    Ye have held the light and beauty I have given\r\n      Far above the muddied ways where they must plod:\r\n    Ye have builded this your lord with the lash and with the sword--\r\n          Reap what ye have sown!\" saith God._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Weavers\r\n\r\nBY GERHART HAUPTMANN\r\n\r\n (German dramatist and poet, born 1862. The present play is a wonderful\r\n picture of the lives of the weavers of Silesia, driven to revolt by\r\n starvation. Moritz, a soldier, has just come home to his friends)\r\n\r\nANSORGE:--Come, then, Moritz, tell us your opinion, you that's\r\nbeen out and seen the world. Are things at all like improving\r\nfor us weavers, eh?\r\n\r\nMORITZ:--They would need to.\r\n\r\nANSORGE:--We're in an awful state here. It's not livin' an'\r\nit's not dyin'. A man fights to the bitter end, but he's bound\r\nto be beat at last--to be left without a roof over his head,\r\nyou may say without ground under his feet. As long as he can\r\nwork at the loom he can earn some sort o' poor, miserable\r\nlivin'. But it's many a day since I've been able to get that\r\nsort o' job. Now I tries to put a bite into my mouth with this\r\nhere basket-makin'. I sits at it late into the night, and by\r\nthe time I tumbles into bed I've earned twelve pfennig. I put\r\nit to you if a man can live on that, when everything's so dear?\r\nNine marks goes in one lump for house tax, three marks for land\r\ntax, nine marks for mortgage interest--that makes twenty-one\r\nmarks. I may reckon my year's earnin's at just double that\r\nmoney, and that leaves me twenty-one marks for a whole year's\r\nfood, an' fire, an' clothes, an' shoes; and I've got to keep\r\nup some sort of place to live in. Is it any wonder that I'm\r\nbehind-hand with my interest payments?\r\n\r\nOLD BAUMERT:--Some one would need to go to Berlin an' tell the\r\nKing how hard put to it we are.\r\n\r\nMORITZ:--Little good that would do, Father Baumert. There's\r\nbeen plenty written about it in the newspapers. But the rich\r\npeople, they can turn and twist things round--as cunning as the\r\ndevil himself.\r\n\r\nOLD BAUMERT (_shaking his head_):--To think they've no more\r\nsense than that in Berlin!\r\n\r\nANSORGE:--And is it really true, Moritz? Is there no law to\r\nhelp us? If a man hasn't been able to scrape together enough to\r\npay his mortgage interest, though he's worked the very skin off\r\nhis hands, must his house be taken from him? The peasant that's\r\nlent the money on it, he wants his rights--what else can you\r\nlook for from him? But what's to be the end of it all, I don't\r\nknow.--If I'm put out o' the house.... (_In a voice choked by\r\ntears._) I was born here, and here my father sat at his loom\r\nfor more than forty years. Many was the time he said to mother:\r\nMother, when I'm gone, the house'll still be here. I've worked\r\nhard for it. Every nail means a night's weaving, every plank a\r\nyear's dry bread. A man would think that....\r\n\r\nMORITZ:--They're quite fit to take the last bite out of your\r\nmouth--that's what they are.\r\n\r\nANSORGE:--Well, well, well! I would rather be carried out\r\nthan have to walk out now in my old days. Who minds dyin'? My\r\nfather, he was glad to die. At the very end he got frightened,\r\nbut I crept into bed beside him, an' he quieted down again. I\r\nwas a lad of thirteen then. I was tired and fell asleep beside\r\nhim--I knew no better--and when I woke he was quite cold....\r\n\r\n(_They eat the food which the soldier has brought, but the old\r\nman Baumert is too far exhausted to retain it, and has to run\r\nfrom the room.

When it came to midnight Jurgis was lying\r\nupon the floor with his head in his arms, listening. Instead\r\nof falling silent at the end, the bell broke out into a sudden\r\nclangor. Jurgis raised his head; what could that mean--a fire?\r\nGod! suppose there were to be a fire in this jail! But then he\r\nmade out a melody in the ringing; there were chimes. And they\r\nseemed to waken the city--all around, far and near, there were\r\nbells, ringing wild music; for fully a minute Jurgis lay lost\r\nin wonder, before, all at once, the meaning of it broke over\r\nhim--that this was Christmas Eve!\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve--he had forgotten it entirely! There was a\r\nbreaking of flood-gates, a whirl of new memories and new\r\ngriefs rushing into his mind. In far Lithuania they had\r\ncelebrated Christmas; and it came to him as if it had been\r\nyesterday--himself a little child, with his lost brother and\r\nhis dead father in the cabin in the deep black forest, where\r\nthe snow fell all day and all night and buried them from the\r\nworld. It was too far off for Santa Claus in Lithuania, but\r\nit was not too far for peace and good-will to men, for the\r\nwonder-bearing vision of the Christ-child.\r\n\r\nBut no, their bells were not ringing for him--their Christmas\r\nwas not meant for him, they were simply not counting him at\r\nall. He was of no consequence, like a bit of trash, the carcass\r\nof some animal. It was horrible, horrible! His wife might be\r\ndying, his baby might be starving, his whole family might be\r\nperishing in the cold--and all the while they were ringing\r\ntheir Christmas chimes! And the bitter mockery of it--all this\r\nwas punishment for him! They put him in a place where the snow\r\ncould not beat in, where the cold could not eat through his\r\nbones; they brought him food and drink--why, in the name of\r\nheaven, if they must punish him, did they not put his family in\r\njail and leave him outside--why could they find no better way\r\nto punish him than to leave three weak women and six helpless\r\nchildren to starve and freeze?\r\n\r\nThat was their law, that was their justice! Jurgis stood\r\nupright, trembling with passion, his hands clenched and his\r\narms upraised, his whole soul ablaze with hatred and defiance.\r\nTen thousand curses upon them and their law! Their justice--it\r\nwas a lie, a sham and a loathsome mockery. There was no\r\njustice, there was no right, anywhere in it--it was only\r\nforce, it was tyranny, the will and the power, reckless and\r\nunrestrained!\r\n\r\nThese midnight hours were fateful ones to Jurgis; in them\r\nwas the beginning of his rebellion, of his outlawry and his\r\nunbelief. He had no wit to trace back the social crime to its\r\nfar sources--he could not say it was the thing men have called\r\n\"the system\" that was crushing him to the earth; that it was\r\nthe packers, his masters, who had bought up the law of the\r\nland, and had dealt out their brutal will to him from the seat\r\nof justice. He only knew that he was wronged, and that the\r\nworld had wronged him; that the law, that society, with all its\r\npowers, had declared itself his foe. And every hour his soul\r\ngrew blacker, every hour he dreamed new dreams of vengeance, of\r\ndefiance, of raging, frenzied hate.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobbers and Governments\r\n\r\nBY LEO TOLSTOY\r\n\r\n(See pages 88, 110, 148)\r\n\r\nThe robber generally plundered the rich, the governments\r\ngenerally plunder the poor and protect those rich who assist in\r\ntheir crimes. The robber doing his work risked his life, while\r\nthe governments risk nothing, but base their whole activity\r\non lies and deception. The robber did not compel anyone to\r\njoin his band, the governments generally enrol their soldiers\r\nby force.... The robber did not intentionally vitiate people,\r\nbut the governments, to accomplish their ends, vitiate whole\r\ngenerations from childhood to manhood with false religions and\r\npatriotic instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Gunmen\" in Israel\r\n\r\n(_From \"A Sociological Study of the Bible\"_)\r\n\r\nBY LOUIS WALLIS\r\n\r\nWe saw that the great revolt under David was put down by the\r\nassistance of mercenary troops, or hired \"strong men,\" and\r\nthat by their aid Solomon was elevated to the throne against\r\nthe wishes of the peasantry. In the Hebrew text, these men of\r\npower are called _gibborim_. They were among the principal\r\ntools used by the kings in maintaining the government. It was\r\nthe _gibborim_ who garrisoned the royal strongholds that held\r\nthe country in awe. In cases where the peasants refused to\r\nsubmit, bands of _gibborim_ were sent out by the kings and the\r\ngreat nobles. Through them the peasantry were \"civilized\";\r\nand through them, apparently, the Amorite law was enforced in\r\nopposition to the old justice.\r\n\r\nHence the prophets were very bitter against these tools of the\r\nruling class. Hosea writes: \"Thou didst trust in thy way, in\r\nthe multitude of thy _gibborim_; therefore shall a tumult arise\r\nagainst thy people; and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed.\"\r\nAmos, the shepherd, says that when Jehovah shall punish the\r\nland, the _gibborim_ shall fall: \"Flight shall perish from the\r\nswift ... neither shall the _gibbor_ deliver himself; neither\r\nshall he stand that handeth the bow; and he that is swift of\r\nfoot shall not deliver himself; ... and he that is courageous\r\namong the _gibborim_ shall flee away naked in that day, saith\r\nJehovah.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Gunmen\" in West Virginia\r\n\r\n(\"_When the Leaves Come Out_\")\r\n\r\nBY A PAINT CREEK MINER\r\n\r\n(Written during the terrible strike of 1911-12)\r\n\r\n    The hills are very bare and cold and lonely;\r\n      I wonder what the future months will bring.\r\n    The strike is on--our strength would win, if only--\r\n      O, Buddy, how I'm longing for the spring!\r\n\r\n    They've got us down--their martial lines enfold us;\r\n      They've thrown us out to feel the winter's sting,\r\n    And yet, by God, those curs can never hold us,\r\n      Nor could the dogs of hell do such a thing!\r\n\r\n    It isn't just to see the hills beside me\r\n      Grow fresh and green with every growing thing;\r\n    I only want the leaves to come and hide me,\r\n      To cover up my vengeful wandering.\r\n\r\n    I will not watch the floating clouds that hover\r\n      Above the birds that warble on the wing;\r\n    I want to use this GUN from under cover--\r\n      O, Buddy, how I'm longing for the spring!\r\n\r\n    You see them there, below, the damned scab-herders!\r\n      Those puppets on the greedy Owners' String;\r\n    We'll make them pay for all their dirty murders--\r\n      We'll show them how a starveling's hate can sting!\r\n\r\n    They riddled us with volley after volley;\r\n      We heard their speeding bullets zip and ring,\r\n    But soon we'll make them suffer for their folly--\r\n      O, Buddy, how I'm longing for the spring!\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ECCLESIASTES\r\n\r\nSurely oppression maketh a wise man mad.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Violence\r\n\r\n(From an Anarchist pamphlet published in London; author unknown)\r\n\r\nUnder miserable conditions of life, any vision of the\r\npossibility of better things makes the present misery more\r\nintolerable, and spurs those who suffer to the most energetic\r\nstruggles to improve their lot; and if these struggles only\r\nresult in sharper misery, the outcome is sheer desperation. In\r\nour present society, for instance, an exploited wage worker,\r\nwho catches a glimpse of what life and work ought to be, finds\r\nthe toilsome routine and the squalor of his existence almost\r\nintolerable; and even when he has the resolution and courage\r\nto continue steadily working his best, and waiting until new\r\nideas have so permeated society as to pave the way for better\r\ntimes, the mere fact that he has such ideas and tries to spread\r\nthem, brings him into difficulties with his employers. How\r\nmany thousands of Socialists, and above all Anarchists, have\r\nlost work and even the chance of work, solely on the ground of\r\ntheir opinions. It is only the specially gifted craftsman who,\r\nif he be a zealous propagandist, can hope to retain permanent\r\nemployment. And what happens to a man with his brain working\r\nactively with a ferment of new ideas, with a vision before\r\nhis eyes of a new hope dawning for toiling and agonizing men,\r\nwith the knowledge that his suffering and that of his fellows\r\nin misery is not caused by the cruelty of fate, but by the\r\ninjustice of other human beings,--what happens to such a man\r\nwhen he sees those dear to him starving, when he himself is\r\nstarved? Some natures in such a plight, and those by no means\r\nthe least social or the least sensitive, will become violent,\r\nand will even feel that their violence is social and not\r\nanti-social, that in striking when and how they can, they are\r\nstriking, not for themselves, but for human nature, outraged\r\nand despoiled in their persons and in those of their fellow\r\nsufferers. And are we, who ourselves are not in this horrible\r\npredicament, to stand by and coldly condemn those piteous\r\nvictims of the Furies and Fates? Are we to decry as miscreants\r\nthese human beings who act with heroic self-devotion,\r\nsacrificing their lives in protest, where less social and\r\nless energetic natures would lie down and grovel in abject\r\nsubmission to injustice and wrong? Are we to join the ignorant\r\nand brutal outcry which stigmatizes such men as monsters of\r\nwickedness, gratuitously running amuck in a harmonious and\r\ninnocently peaceful society? No! We hate murder with a hatred\r\nthat may seem absurdly exaggerated to apologists for Matabele\r\nmassacres, to callous acquiescers in hangings and bombardments;\r\nbut we decline in such cases of homicide, or attempted\r\nhomicide, as those of which we are treating, to be guilty of\r\nthe cruel injustice of flinging the whole responsibility of\r\nthe deed upon the immediate perpetrator. The guilt of these\r\nhomicides lies upon every man and woman who, intentionally or\r\nby cold indifference, helps to keep up social conditions that\r\ndrive human beings to despair. The man who flings his whole\r\nlife into the attempt, at the cost of his own life, to protest\r\nagainst the wrongs of his fellow-men, is a saint compared to\r\nthe active and passive upholders of cruelty and injustice, even\r\nif his protest destroys other lives besides his own. Let him\r\nwho is without sin in society cast the first stone at such an\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bomb\r\n\r\nBY FRANK HARRIS\r\n\r\n (The English author, born 1855, author of \"The Man Shakespeare,\" has\r\n in this novel told the inside story of the Haymarket explosion in\r\n Chicago in 1886. The following passage describes the treatment which\r\n the strikers received from the police)\r\n\r\nA meeting was called on a waste space in Packingtown, and\r\nover a thousand workmen came together. I went there out of\r\ncuriosity. Lingg, I may say here, always went alone to these\r\nstrike meetings. Ida told me once that he suffered so much at\r\nthem that he could not bear to be seen, and perhaps that was\r\nthe explanation of his solitary ways. Fielden, the Englishman,\r\nspoke first, and was cheered to the echo; the workmen knew\r\nhim as a working-man and liked him; besides, he talked in a\r\nhomely way, and was easy to understand. Spies spoke in German\r\nand was cheered also. The meeting was perfectly orderly\r\nwhen three hundred police tried to disperse it. The action\r\nwas ill-advised, to say the best of it, and tyrannical; the\r\nstrikers were hurting no one and interfering with no one.\r\nWithout warning or reason the police tried to push their way\r\nthrough the crowd to the speakers; finding a sort of passive\r\nresistance and not being able to overcome it, they used their\r\nclubs savagely. One or two of the strikers, hot-headed, bared\r\ntheir knives, and at once the police, led on by that madman,\r\nSchaack, drew their revolvers and fired. It looked as if the\r\npolice had been waiting for the opportunity. Three strikers\r\nwere shot dead on the spot, and more than twenty were wounded,\r\nseveral of them dangerously, before the mob drew sullenly away\r\nfrom the horrible place. A leader, a word, and not one of the\r\npolice would have escaped alive; but the leader was not there,\r\nand the word was not given, so the wrong was done, and went\r\nunpunished.\r\n\r\nI do not know how I reached my room that afternoon. The sight\r\nof the dead men lying stark there in the snow had excited me to\r\nmadness. The picture of one man followed me like an obsession;\r\nhe was wounded to death, shot through the lungs; he lifted\r\nhimself up on his left hand and shook the right at the police,\r\ncrying in a sort of frenzy till the spouting blood choked him--\r\n\r\n\"Bestien! Bestien!\" (\"Beasts! Beasts!\")\r\n\r\nI can still see him wiping the blood-stained froth from his\r\nlips; I went to help him; but all he could gasp was, \"Weib!\r\nKinder! (Wife, children!)\" Never shall I forget the despair in\r\nhis face. I supported him gently; again and again I wiped the\r\nblood from his lips; every breath brought up a flood; his poor\r\neyes thanked me, though he could not speak, and soon his eyes\r\nclosed; flickered out, as one might say, and he lay there still\r\nenough in his own blood; \"murdered,\" as I said to myself when I\r\nlaid the poor body back; \"murdered!\"\r\n\r\n(_As a result of this police action, the narrator goes to the\r\nnext meeting of the strikers with a bomb in his pocket._)\r\n\r\nThe crowd began to drift away at the edges. I was alone and\r\ncuriously watchful. I saw the mayor and the officials move\r\noff towards the business part of the town. It looked for a\r\nfew minutes as if everything was going to pass over in peace;\r\nbut I was not relieved. I could hear my own heart beating,\r\nand suddenly I felt something in the air; it was sentient\r\nwith expectancy. I slowly turned my head. I was on the very\r\noutskirts of the crowd, and as I turned I saw that Bonfield\r\nhad marched out his police, and was minded to take his own way\r\nwith the meeting now that the mayor had left. I felt personal\r\nantagonism stiffen my muscles.... It grew darker and darker\r\nevery moment. Suddenly there came a flash, and then a peal of\r\nthunder. At the end of the flash, as it seemed to me, I saw\r\nthe white clubs falling, saw the police striking down the men\r\nrunning along the sidewalk. At once my mind was made up. I put\r\nmy left hand on the outside of my trousers to hold the bomb\r\ntight, and my right hand into the pocket, and drew the tape.\r\nI heard a little rasp. I began to count slowly, \"One, two,\r\nthree, four, five, six, seven;\" as I got to seven the police\r\nwere quite close to me, bludgeoning every one furiously. Two or\r\nthree of the foremost had drawn their revolvers. The crowd were\r\nflying in all directions. Suddenly there was a shot, and then\r\na dozen shots, all, it seemed to me, fired by the police. Rage\r\nblazed in me.\r\n\r\nI took the bomb out of my pocket, careless whether I was seen\r\nor not, and looked for the right place to throw it; then I\r\nhurled it over my shoulder high in the air, towards the middle\r\nof the police, and at the same moment I stumbled forward, just\r\nas if I had fallen, throwing myself on my hands and face, for\r\nI had seen the spark. It seemed as if I had been on my hands\r\nfor an eternity, when I was crushed to the ground, and my ears\r\nsplit with the roar. I scrambled to my feet again, gasping.\r\nMen were thrown down in front of me, and were getting up on\r\ntheir hands. I heard groans and cries, and shrieks behind me.\r\nI turned around; as I turned a strong arm was thrust through\r\nmine, and I heard Lingg say--\r\n\r\n\"Come, Rudolph, this way;\" and he drew me to the sidewalk, and\r\nwe walked past where the police had been.\r\n\r\n\"Don't look,\" he whispered suddenly; \"don't look.\"\r\n\r\nBut before he spoke I had looked, and what I saw will be before\r\nmy eyes till I die. The street was one shambles; in the very\r\ncenter of it a great pit yawned, and round it men lying, or\r\npieces of men, in every direction, and close to me, near the\r\nside-walk as I passed, a leg and foot torn off, and near by\r\ntwo huge pieces of bleeding red meat, skewered together with a\r\nthigh-bone. My soul sickened; my senses left me; but Lingg held\r\nme up with superhuman strength, and drew me along.\r\n\r\n\"Hold yourself up, Rudolph,\" he whispered; \"come on, man,\"\r\nand the next moment we had passed it all, and I clung to him,\r\ntrembling like a leaf. When we got to the end of the block I\r\nrealized that I was wet through from head to foot, as if I had\r\nbeen plunged in cold water.\r\n\r\n\"I must stop,\" I gasped. \"I cannot walk, Lingg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" he said; \"take a drink of this,\" and he thrust\r\na flask of brandy into my hand. The brandy I poured down my\r\nthroat set my heart beating again, allowed me to breathe, and I\r\nwalked on with him.\r\n\r\n\"How you are shaking,\" he said. \"Strange, you neurotic people;\r\nyou do everything perfectly, splendidly, and then break down\r\nlike women. Come, I am not going to leave you; but for God's\r\nsake throw off that shaken, white look. Drink some more.\"\r\n\r\nI tried to; but the flask was empty. He put it back in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the bottle,\" he said. \"I have brought enough; but we\r\nmust get to the depot.\"\r\n\r\nWe saw fire engines with police on them, galloping like madmen\r\nin the direction whence we had come. The streets were crowded\r\nwith people, talking, gesticulating, like actors. Every one\r\nseemed to know of the bomb already, and to be talking about it.\r\nI noticed that even here, fully a block away, the pavement was\r\ncovered with pieces of glass; all the windows had been broken\r\nby the explosion.\r\n\r\nAs we came in front of the depot, just before we passed into\r\nthe full glare of the arc-lamps, Lingg said--\r\n\r\n\"Let me look at you,\" and as he let go my arm, I almost fell;\r\nmy legs were like German sausages; they felt as if they had no\r\nbones in them, and would bend in any direction; in spite of\r\nevery effort they would shake.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Rudolph,\" he said, \"we'll stop and talk; but you must\r\ncome to yourself. Take another drink, and think of nothing. I\r\nwill save you; you are too good to lose. Come, dear friend,\r\ndon't let them crow over us.\"\r\n\r\nMy heart seemed to be in my mouth, but I swallowed it down. I\r\ntook another swig of brandy, and then a long drink of it. It\r\nmight have been water for all I tasted; but it seemed to do me\r\nsome little good. In a minute or so I had got hold of myself.\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right,\" I said; \"what is there to do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply to go through the depot,\" he said, \"as if there were\r\nnothing the matter, and take the train.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\n_Martyrdom_\r\n\r\nMessages and records of the heroes of past and present who have\r\nsacrificed themselves for the sake of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial Ideals\r\n\r\nBY VIDA D. SCUDDER\r\n\r\n(Professor at Wellesley College, Mass.; born 1861)\r\n\r\nDeeper than all theories, apart from all discussion, the mighty\r\ninstinct for social justice shapes the hearts that are ready to\r\nreceive it. The personal types thus created are the harbingers\r\nof the victory of the cause of freedom. The heralds of freedom,\r\nthey are also its martyrs. The delicate vibrations of their\r\nconsciousness thrill through the larger social self which more\r\nstolid people still ignore, and the pain of the world is their\r\nown. Not for one instant can they know an undimmed joy in art,\r\nin thought, in nature while part of their very life throbs\r\nin the hunger of the dispossessed. All this by no virtue, no\r\nchoice of their own. So were they born: the children of the\r\nnew age, whom the new intuition governs. In every country, out\r\nof every class, they gather: men and women vowed to simplicity\r\nof life and to social service; possessed by a force mightier\r\nthan themselves, over which they have no control; aware of the\r\nlack of social harmony in our civilization, restless with pain,\r\nperplexity, distress, yet filled with deep inward peace as they\r\nobey the imperative claim of a widened consciousness. By active\r\nministry, and yet more by prayer and fast and vigil, they seek\r\nto prepare the way for the spiritual democracy on which their\r\nsouls are set.\r\n\r\n\r\nLe Père Perdrix\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES-LOUIS PHILIPPE\r\n\r\n (A poor and obscure clerk of the municipality of Paris, 1875-1909,\r\n who wrote seven volumes of fiction which have placed his name among\r\n the masters of French literature. He wrote of the poor whose lives he\r\n knew, and his work is characterized by fidelity to truth, beauty of\r\n sentiment, and rare charm of style. The following scene is in the home\r\n of a workingman, who by heavy sacrifice has succeeded in educating his\r\n only son. One day unexpectedly the son returns home)\r\n\r\nPierre Bousset said, \"How does it happen that you come to-day?\"\r\n\r\nJean sat down with slowness enough, and one saw yet another\r\nthing sit down in the house. The mother said, \"I guess you\r\nhaven't eaten. I'll make a little chocolate before noon-time.\"\r\n\r\nJean's tongue was loosed. \"Here it is. There is something new.\r\nIt is necessary to tell you: I have left my place!\"\r\n\r\n\"How! You have left your place!\" They sat up all three--Pierre\r\nBousset with his apron and his back of labor; and Jean saw\r\nthat he had gray hair. The mother held a saucepan in her\r\nhand, careful like a kitchen-servant, but with feelings as if\r\nthe saucepan were about to fall. Marguerite, the sister, was\r\nalready weeping: \"Ah, my God! I who was so proud!\"\r\n\r\nPierre Bousset said, \"And how did you manage that clever\r\nstroke?\"\r\n\r\nIt was then that Jean felt his soul wither, and there rose up\r\nfrom the depths of his heart all the needs, all the mists of\r\nlove. It was necessary that they should live side by side and\r\nunderstand one another, and it was necessary that someone\r\nshould begin to weaken. He said, \"Does one ever know what one\r\ndoes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed!\" said the father. \"You don't know what you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are moments,\" answered Jean, \"when one loses his head,\r\nand afterwards I don't say one should not have regrets.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the matter of losing one's head, I know only one thing:\r\nIt is that they pay you, and it is up to you always to obey\r\nwhatever they command.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother watched the chocolate, from which the steam rose\r\nwith a warmth of strong nutriment. They loved that in the\r\nfamily, like a Sunday morning indulgence, like a bourgeois\r\nchocolate for holiday folk. She said, \"Anyhow, let it be as it\r\nwill, he's got to eat.\"\r\n\r\nJean went on to speak. His blue eyes had undergone the first\r\ntransformation which comes in a man's life, when he is no\r\nlonger Jean, son of Pierre, pupil at the Central school, but\r\nJean Bousset, engineer of applied chemistry. There remained in\r\nthem, however, the shining of a young girl, that emotion which\r\nwakens two rays of sunlight in a spring. And now they kept a\r\nsort of supplication, like the sweetness of a naked infant.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know everything that you are going to say. You cannot\r\nexcuse me, because you are not in my place, and I cannot\r\ncondemn a movement of my heart. You know--I wrote it to\r\nyou--the workers were about to go on strike. At once I said\r\nto myself that these were matters which did not concern me;\r\nbecause, when you are taking care of yourself, it is not\r\nnecessary to look any farther. But Cousin François explained it\r\nall to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I told you so!\" cried Pierre Bousset. \"When you wanted\r\nto take Cousin François into your factory, I said to you:\r\n'Relatives, it is necessary always to keep them at a distance.\r\nThey push themselves forward, and sometimes, to excuse them one\r\nis led to commit whole heaps of lowness.'\"\r\n\r\n\"In truth,\" said Jean, \"I would never have had to complain of\r\nhim. On the contrary, he wore his heart on his sleeve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all drunkards are like that. One says: 'They wear their\r\nhearts on their sleeve,' and one does not count all the times\r\nwhen they lead the others away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I have understood many things, father. How can I explain\r\neverything that I have understood! There are moments still\r\nwhen, to see and to realize--that makes in my head a noise as\r\nif the world would not stay in place. I tell you again it was\r\nFrançois who made me understand. I saw, in the evenings. I\r\nwould say to him: 'I am bored, I haven't even a comrade, and I\r\neat at hotel-tables a dinner too well served.' He said: 'Come\r\nto my house. You don't know what it is to eat good things,\r\nbecause you don't work, and because hunger makes a part of\r\nwork. You will have some soup with us, and we will tell you\r\nat least that you are happy to be where you are, and to look\r\nupon the workingman while playing the amateur.' I said to him:\r\n'But I work, also. To see, to understand, to analyze, to be an\r\nengineer! You, it's your arms; me, it's my head and my heart\r\nthat ache.' He laughed: 'Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! When I come home\r\nin the evening with my throat dry and I eat my soup, I also\r\nhave a headache, and I laugh at you with your heart-ache. I am\r\nas tired as a wolf. What's that you call your heart?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he was right there,\" said Pierre Bousset. \"For my part, I\r\ndon't understand at all how you are going to pull through. You\r\nhave understood a lot of things! As for me, I understand but\r\none thing, which is you are unhappy over being too happy.\"\r\n\r\nJean went on speaking, with his blue eyes, like a madness, like\r\na ribbon, like a rosette without any reason which a young girl\r\nputs on her forehead. A sweetness came out of his heart to\r\nspread itself in the room, where the furniture gave off angular\r\nand waxy reflections. Marguerite listened, with restlessness,\r\nlistened to her father, like a child whose habit it is to be\r\nguided by her parents. The mother saw to the chocolate, in a\r\nstate of confusion, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday I was in the office of the superintendent. It\r\nwas then that the delegation arrived. It seems to me that I\r\nsee them again. There were three workingmen. They had taken\r\nto white shirts, and they had just washed their hands. You\r\nknow how the poor come into the homes of the rich. There was\r\na great racket, and their steps were put down with so much\r\nembarrassment that one felt in the hearts of the three men\r\nthe shame of crushed things. I had already thought about that\r\npoverty which, knowing that it soils, hides itself, and dares\r\nnot even touch an object. They said: 'Well, Mr. Superintendent,\r\nwe have been sent to talk to you. For more than ten years now\r\nwe have worked in the factory. We get seventy cents a day.\r\nThat's not much to tell about. We have wives and children,\r\nand our seventy cents hardly carries us farther than a glass\r\nof brandy and a little plate of soup. We understand that you\r\nalso have expenses. But we should like to get eighty cents a\r\nday, and for us to explain every thing to you, it is necessary\r\nthat you should consent, because money gives courage to the\r\nworkingman.' The other received them with that assurance of the\r\nrich, sitting straight up in his chair and holding his head as\r\nif it dominated your own. He would not have had much trouble,\r\nwith his education, his habits of a master, his stability as a\r\nman of affairs, to put them all three ill at ease. 'Gentlemen,\r\nfrom the first word I say to you: No. The company cannot take\r\naccount of your wishes. We pay you seventy cents a day, and we\r\njudge that it is up to you to lower your life to your wages.\r\nAs for your insinuations, I shall employ such means as please\r\nme to fortify your courage. For the rest, our profits are not\r\nwhat you imagine, you who know neither our efforts nor our\r\ndisappointments.' It was then, father, that I felt myself your\r\nson, and that I recalled your hands, your back which toils, and\r\nthe carriage wheels that you make. The three workingmen seemed\r\nthree children in their father's home, with hearts that swell\r\nand can feel no more. Ah, it was in vain I thought myself an\r\nengineer! On the benches of the school I imagined that my head\r\nwas full of science, and that that sufficed. But all the blood\r\nof my father, the days that I passed in your shop, the storms\r\nwhich go to one's head and seem to come from far off, all that\r\ncried out like a grimace, like a lock, like a key.[A] I took\r\nup the argument. 'Mr. Superintendent, I know these men. There\r\nis my cousin who works in the factory. Do you understand what\r\nit is, the life of acids, and that of charcoal?' If you could\r\nhave seen him! He looked at me with eyes, as if their pupils\r\nhad turned to ice. 'Mr. Engineer, I don't permit either you,\r\nwho are a child, or these, who are workingmen, a single word to\r\ndiscuss my sayings and my actions! Gentlemen, you may retire.'\r\nI went straight off the handle. A door opened at a single\r\nburst. We have at least insolence, we poor, and blows of the\r\nmouth, since their weapons stop our blows of the teeth. I went\r\naway like them. They lowered their heads and thought. For my\r\npart I cried out, I turned about and cried, 'You be hanged!'\"\r\n\r\n[A] _Tout cela criait comme une grimace, comme une serrure,\r\ncomme une clé._\r\n\r\n\"Ah, now, indeed! I didn't expect anything like that,\" said\r\nPierre Bousset. \"One raises children to make gentle-folk of\r\nthem, so that they will work a little less than you. Now then,\r\nin God's name! go and demand a place of those for whom you have\r\nlost your own!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duty of Civil Disobedience\r\n\r\nBY HENRY DAVID THOREAU\r\n\r\n (The New England essayist, 1817-1862, author of \"Walden,\" went to\r\n prison because he refused to pay taxes to a government which returned\r\n fugitive slaves to the South. It is narrated that Emerson came to\r\n him and asked, \"Henry, what are you doing in here?\" \"Waldo,\" was the\r\n answer, \"what are you doing out of here?\")\r\n\r\nUnder a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place\r\nfor a just man is also a prison. The proper place today, the\r\nonly place which Massachusetts has provided for her freer and\r\nless desponding spirits, is in her prisons, to be put out and\r\nlocked out of the State by her own act, as they have already\r\nput themselves out by their principles. It is there that the\r\nfugitive slave, and the Mexican prisoner on parole, and the\r\nIndian come to plead the wrongs of his race, should find them;\r\non that separate but more free and honorable ground, where\r\nthe State places those who are not _with_ her but _against_\r\nher--the only house in a slave State in which a free man can\r\nabide with honor.\r\n\r\nIf any think that their influence would be lost there, and\r\ntheir voices no longer afflict the ear of the State, that they\r\nwould not be as an enemy within its walls, they do not know\r\nby how much truth is stronger than error, nor how much more\r\neloquently and effectively he can combat injustice who has\r\nexperienced a little in his own person.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SURPRISE\r\n\r\nILYÁ EFÍMOVITCH REPIN\r\n\r\n(_Russian painter, born 1844_)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE END\r\n\r\nKÄTHE KOLLWITZ\r\n\r\n(_Contemporary German etching; from the \"Weaver-cycle\"_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress to the Jury\r\n\r\nBY ARTURO M. GIOVANNITTI\r\n\r\n (Italian student and clergyman, born 1884, who left the Church for the\r\n labor movement. During the strike at Lawrence, Mass., he was arrested\r\n upon a charge of \"constructive murder.\" He spoke in his own defense at\r\n Salem Court House, November 23, 1912)\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. FOREMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY:--\r\n\r\nIt is the first time in my life that I speak publicly in your\r\nwonderful language, and the most solemn moment in my life. I\r\nknow not if I will go to the end of my remarks. The District\r\nAttorney and the other gentlemen here who are used to measure\r\nall human emotions with the yardstick may not understand the\r\ntumult that is going on in my soul at this moment. But my\r\nfriends and my comrades before me, these gentlemen here who\r\nhave been with me for the last seven or eight months, know\r\nexactly, and if my words will fail before I reach the end\r\nof this short statement to you, it will be because of the\r\nsuperabundance of sentiments that are flooding to my heart.\r\n\r\nI speak to you not because I want to review this evidence at\r\nall. I shall not enter into the evidence that has been offered\r\nhere, as I feel that you gentlemen of the jury have by this\r\ntime a firm and set conviction; by this time you ought to know,\r\nyou ought to have realized whether I said or whether I did\r\nnot say those words that have been put into my mouth by those\r\ntwo detectives. You ought to know whether it is possible, not\r\nfor a man like me but for any living human being to say those\r\natrocious, those flagitious words that have been attributed to\r\nme. I say only this in regard to the evidence that has been\r\nintroduced in this case, that if there is or ever has been\r\nmurder in the heart of any man that is in this courtroom today,\r\ngentlemen of the jury, that man is not sitting in this cage.\r\nWe had come to Lawrence, as my noble comrade Mr. Ettor said,\r\nbecause we were prompted by something higher and loftier than\r\nwhat the District Attorney or any other man in this presence\r\nhere may understand and realize. Were I not afraid that I\r\nwas being somewhat sacrilegious, I would say that to go and\r\ninvestigate into the motives that prompted and actuated us\r\nto go into Lawrence would be the same as to inquire, why did\r\nthe Saviour come on earth, or why was Lloyd Garrison in this\r\nvery Commonwealth, in the city of Boston, dragged through the\r\nstreets with a rope around his neck? Why did all the other\r\ngreat men and masters of thought--why did they go to preach\r\nthis new gospel of fraternity and brotherhood? It is just that\r\ntruth should be ascertained, it is right that the criminal\r\nshould be brought before the bar of justice. But one side\r\nalone of our story has been told here. There has been brought\r\nonly one side of this great industrial question, the method\r\nand the tactics. But what about, I say, the ethical part of\r\nthis question? What about the human and humane part of our\r\nideas? What about the grand condition of tomorrow as we see\r\nit, and as we foretell it now to the workers at large, here\r\nin this same cage where the felon has sat, in this same cage\r\nwhere the drunkard, where the prostitute, where the hired\r\nassassin has been? What about the better and nobler humanity\r\nwhere there shall be no more slaves, where no man will ever\r\nbe obliged to go on strike in order to obtain fifty cents a\r\nweek more, where children will not have to starve any more,\r\nwhere women no more will have to go and prostitute themselves;\r\nwhere at last there will not be any more slaves, any more\r\nmasters, but one great family of friends and brothers. It may\r\nbe, gentlemen of the jury, that you do not believe in that. It\r\nmay be that we are dreamers; it may be that we are fanatics,\r\nMr. District Attorney. But so was a fanatic Socrates, who\r\ninstead of acknowledging the philosophy of the aristocrats of\r\nAthens, preferred to drink the poison. And so was a fanatic\r\nthe Saviour Jesus Christ, who instead of acknowledging that\r\nPilate, or that Tiberius was emperor of Rome, and instead of\r\nacknowledging his submission to all the rulers of the time and\r\nall the priestcraft of the time, preferred the cross between\r\ntwo thieves.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE\r\n\r\n(German philosopher and poet, 1749-1832)\r\n\r\nAll those who oppose intellectual truths merely stir up the\r\nfire; the cinders fly about and set fire to that which else\r\nthey had not touched.\r\n\r\n\r\nEssay on Liberty\r\n\r\nBY JOHN STUART MILL\r\n\r\n(English philosopher and economist, 1806-1873)\r\n\r\nMankind can hardly be too often reminded, that there was once\r\na man named Socrates, between whom and the legal authorities\r\nand public opinion of his time, there took place a memorable\r\ncollision. Born in an age and country abounding in individual\r\ngreatness, this man has been handed down to us by those who\r\nbest knew both him and the age, as the most virtuous man in it;\r\nwhile _we_ know him as the head and prototype of all subsequent\r\nteachers of virtue, the source equally of the lofty inspiration\r\nof Plato and the judicious utilitarianism of Aristotle, the\r\ntwo headsprings of ethical as of all other philosophy. This\r\nacknowledged master of all the eminent thinkers who have since\r\nlived--whose fame, still growing after more than two thousand\r\nyears, all but outweighs the whole remainder of the names\r\nwhich make his native city illustrious--was put to death by\r\nhis countrymen, after a judicial conviction, for impiety and\r\nimmorality. Impiety, in denying the Gods recognized by the\r\nState; indeed his accusers asserted (see the \"Apologia\") that\r\nhe believed in no gods at all. Immorality, in being, by his\r\ndoctrines and instructions, a \"corrupter of youth.\" Of these\r\ncharges the tribunal, there is every ground for believing,\r\nhonestly found him guilty, and condemned the man who probably\r\nof all then born had deserved best of mankind to be put to\r\ndeath as a criminal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE EPISTLE OF JAMES\r\n\r\nSo speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law\r\nof liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Walker\r\n\r\nBY ARTURO M. GIOVANNITTI\r\n\r\n(See page 296)\r\n\r\nI hear footsteps over my head all night.\r\n\r\nThey come and they go. Again they come and they go all night.\r\n\r\nThey come one eternity in four paces and they go one eternity\r\nin four paces, and between the coming and the going there is\r\nSilence and the Night and the Infinite.\r\n\r\nFor infinite are the nine feet of a prison cell, and endless is\r\nthe march of him who walks between the yellow brick wall and\r\nthe red iron gate, thinking things that cannot be chained and\r\ncannot be locked, but that wander far away in the sunlit world,\r\neach in a wild pilgrimage after a destined goal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThroughout the restless night I hear the footsteps over my head.\r\n\r\nWho walks? I know not. It is the phantom of the jail, the\r\nsleepless brain, a man, the man, the Walker.\r\n\r\nOne--two--three--four: four paces and the wall.\r\n\r\nOne--two--three--four: four paces and the iron gate.\r\n\r\nHe has measured his space, he has measured it accurately,\r\nscrupulously, minutely, as the hangman measures the rope and\r\nthe grave-digger the coffin--so many feet, so many inches, so\r\nmany fractions of an inch for each of the four paces.\r\n\r\nOne--two--three--four. Each step sounds heavy and hollow over\r\nmy head, and the echo of each step sounds hollow within my head\r\nas I count them in suspense and in dread that once, perhaps,\r\nin the endless walk, there may be five steps instead of four\r\nbetween the yellow brick wall and the red iron gate.\r\n\r\nBut he has measured the space so accurately, so scrupulously,\r\nso minutely that nothing breaks the grave rhythm of the slow,\r\nfantastic march....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll the sounds of the living beings and inanimate things, and\r\nall the noises of the night I have heard in my wistful vigil.\r\n\r\nI have heard the moans of him who bewails a thing that is dead\r\nand the sighs of him who tries to smother a thing that will not\r\ndie;\r\n\r\nI have heard the stifled sobs of the one who weeps with his\r\nhead under the coarse blanket, and the whisperings of the one\r\nwho prays with his forehead on the hard, cold stone of the\r\nfloor;\r\n\r\nI have heard him who laughs the shrill, sinister laugh of folly\r\nat the horror rampant on the yellow wall and at the red eyes of\r\nthe nightmare glaring through the iron bars;\r\n\r\nI have heard in the sudden icy silence him who coughs a dry,\r\nringing cough, and wished madly that his throat would not\r\nrattle so and that he would not spit on the floor, for no sound\r\nwas more atrocious than that of his sputum upon the floor;\r\n\r\nI have heard him who swears fearsome oaths which I listen to\r\nin reverence and awe, for they are holier than the virgin's\r\nprayer;\r\n\r\nAnd I have heard, most terrible of all, the silence of two\r\nhundred brains all possessed by one single, relentless,\r\nunforgiving, desperate thought.\r\n\r\nAll this I have heard in the watchful night,\r\n\r\nAnd the murmur of the wind beyond the walls,\r\n\r\nAnd the tolls of a distant bell,\r\n\r\nAnd the woeful dirge of the rain,\r\n\r\nAnd the remotest echoes of the sorrowful city,\r\n\r\nAnd the terrible beatings, wild beatings, mad beatings of the\r\nOne Heart which is nearest to my heart.\r\n\r\nAll this have I heard in the still night;\r\n\r\nBut nothing is louder, harder, drearier, mightier, more awful\r\nthan the footsteps I hear over my head all night....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll through the night he walks and he thinks. Is it more\r\nfrightful because he walks and his footsteps sound hollow over\r\nmy head, or because he thinks and speaks not his thoughts?\r\n\r\nBut does he think? Why should he think? Do I think? I only hear\r\nthe footsteps and count them. Four steps and the wall. Four\r\nsteps and the gate. But beyond? Beyond? Where goes he beyond\r\nthe gate and the wall?\r\n\r\nHe does not go beyond. His thought breaks there on the iron\r\ngate. Perhaps it breaks like a wave of rage, perhaps like a\r\nsudden flow of hope, but it always returns to beat the wall\r\nlike a billow of helplessness and despair.\r\n\r\nHe walks to and fro within the narrow whirlpit of this ever\r\nstorming and furious thought. Only one thought--constant,\r\nfixed, immovable, sinister, without power and without voice.\r\n\r\nA thought of madness, frenzy, agony and despair, a hell-brewed\r\nthought, for it is a natural thought. All things natural are\r\nthings impossible while there are jails in the world--bread,\r\nwork, happiness, peace, love.\r\n\r\nBut he thinks not of this. As he walks he thinks of the most\r\nsuperhuman, the most unattainable, the most impossible thing in\r\nthe world:\r\n\r\nHe thinks of a small brass key that turns just half around and\r\nthrows open the red iron gate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat is all the Walker thinks, as he walks throughout the night.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what two hundred minds drowned in the darkness and\r\nthe silence of the night think, and that is also what I think.\r\n\r\nWonderful is the supreme wisdom of the jail that makes all\r\nthink the same thought. Marvelous is the providence of the law\r\nthat equalizes all, even in mind and sentiment. Fallen is the\r\nlast barrier of privilege, the aristocracy of the intellect.\r\nThe democracy of reason has leveled all the two hundred minds\r\nto the common surface of the same thought.\r\n\r\nI, who have never killed, think like the murderer;\r\n\r\nI, who have never stolen, reason like the thief;\r\n\r\nI think, reason, wish, hope, doubt, wait like the hired\r\nassassin, the embezzler, the forger, the counterfeiter, the\r\nincestuous, the raper, the drunkard, the prostitute, the pimp,\r\nI, I who used to think of love and life and flowers and song\r\nand beauty and the ideal.\r\n\r\nA little key, a little key as little as my little finger, a\r\nlittle key of shining brass.\r\n\r\nAll my ideas, my thoughts, my dreams are congealed in a little\r\nkey of shiny brass.\r\n\r\nAll my brain, all my soul, all the suddenly surging latent\r\npowers of my deepest life are in the pocket of a white-haired\r\nman dressed in blue.\r\n\r\nHe is great, powerful, formidable, the man with the white hair,\r\nfor he has in his pocket the mighty talisman which makes one\r\nman cry, and one man pray, and one laugh, and one cough, and\r\none walk, and all keep awake and listen and think the same\r\nmaddening thought.\r\n\r\nGreater than all men is the man with the white hair and the\r\nsmall brass key, for no other man in the world could compel two\r\nhundred men to think for so long the same thought. Surely when\r\nthe light breaks I will write a hymn unto him which shall hail\r\nhim greater than Mohammed and Arbues and Torquemada and Mesmer,\r\nand all the other masters of other men's thoughts. I shall call\r\nhim Almighty, for he holds everything of all and of me in a\r\nlittle brass key in his pocket.\r\n\r\nEverything of me he holds but the branding iron of contempt\r\nand the claymore of hatred for the monstrous cabala that can\r\nmake the apostle and the murderer, the poet and the procurer,\r\nthink of the same gate, the same key and the same exit on the\r\ndifferent sunlit highways of life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy brother, do not walk any more.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to walk on a grave. It is a sacrilege to walk four\r\nsteps from the headstone to the foot and four steps from the\r\nfoot to the headstone.\r\n\r\nIf you stop walking, my brother, no longer will this be a\r\ngrave, for you will give me back that mind that is chained to\r\nyour feet and the right to think my own thoughts.\r\n\r\nI implore you, my brother, for I am weary of the long vigil,\r\nweary of counting your steps, and heavy with sleep.\r\n\r\nStop, rest, sleep, my brother, for the dawn is well nigh and it\r\nis not the key alone that can throw open the gate.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n(First president of the United States, 1732-1799)\r\n\r\nGovernment is not reason, it is not eloquence--it is force!\r\nLike fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master; never\r\nfor a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.\r\n\r\n\r\nForcible Feeding\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Suffragette\"_)\r\n\r\nBY E. SYLVIA PANKHURST\r\n\r\n(English militant leader)\r\n\r\nShe was then surrounded and held down, whilst the chair was\r\ntilted backwards. She clenched her teeth, but the doctor pulled\r\nher mouth away to form a pouch and the wardress poured in milk\r\nand brandy, some of which trickled in through the crevices.\r\nLater in the day the doctors and wardresses again appeared.\r\nThey forced her down on to the bed and held her there. One\r\nof the doctors then produced a tube two yards in length with\r\na glass junction in the center and a funnel at one end. He\r\nforced the other end of the tube up her nostril, hurting her so\r\nterribly that the matron and two of the wardresses burst into\r\ntears and the second doctor interfered. At last the tube was\r\npushed down into the stomach. She felt the pain of it to the\r\nend of the breast bone. Then one of the doctors stood upon a\r\nchair holding the funnel end of the tube at arm's length, and\r\npoured food down whilst the wardress and the other doctor all\r\ngripped her tight. She felt as though she would suffocate.\r\nThere was a rushing, burning sensation in her head, the drums\r\nof her ears seemed to be bursting. The agony of pain in the\r\nthroat and breast bone continued. The thing seemed to go on for\r\nhours. When at last the tube was withdrawn, she felt as though\r\nall the back of her nose and throat were being torn out with it.\r\n\r\nThen almost fainting she was carried back to the punishment\r\ncell and put to bed. For hours the pain in the chest, nose and\r\nears continued and she felt terribly sick and faint. Day after\r\nday the struggle continued; she used no violence, but each\r\ntime resisted and was overcome by force of numbers. Often she\r\nvomited during the operation. When the food did not go down\r\nquickly enough the doctor pinched her nose with the tube in it,\r\ncausing her even greater pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Subjection of Women\r\n\r\nBY JOHN STUART MILL\r\n\r\n(See pages 199, 299)\r\n\r\nIn struggles for political emancipation, everybody knows how\r\noften its champions are bought off by bribes, or daunted by\r\nterrors. In the case of women, each individual of the subject\r\nclass is in a chronic state of bribery and intimidation\r\ncombined. In setting up the standard of resistance, a large\r\nnumber of the leaders, and still more of the followers, must\r\nmake an almost complete sacrifice of the pleasures or the\r\nalleviations of their own individual lot. If ever any system of\r\nprivilege and enforced subjection had its yoke tightly riveted\r\non the necks of those who are kept down by it, this has.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Suffragist\r\n\r\nBY MARGARET WIDDEMER\r\n\r\n(See page 256)\r\n\r\n    She could have loved--her woman-passions beat\r\n      Deeper than theirs, or else she had not known\r\n    How to have dropped her heart beneath their feet\r\n      A living stepping-stone:\r\n\r\n    The little hands--did they not clutch her heart?\r\n      The guarding arms--was she not very tired?\r\n    Was it an easy thing to walk apart,\r\n      Unresting, undesired?\r\n\r\n    She gave away her crown of woman-praise,\r\n      Her gentleness and silent girlhood grace\r\n    To be a merriment for idle days,\r\n      Scorn for the market-place:\r\n\r\n    She strove for an unvisioned, far-off good,\r\n      For one far hope she knew she should not see:\r\n    These--not _her_ daughters--crowned with motherhood\r\n      And love and beauty--free.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing to the People\r\n\r\n(_From \"Memoirs of a Revolutionist\"_)\r\n\r\nBY PETER KROPOTKIN\r\n\r\n(The Russian author and scientist, born 1842, who renounced\r\nthe title of prince and spent many years in a dungeon for his\r\nfaith, has here told his life story)\r\n\r\n\"It is bitter, the bread that has been made by slaves,\" our\r\npoet Nekrasoff wrote. The young generation actually refused\r\nto eat that bread, and to enjoy the riches that had been\r\naccumulated in their fathers' houses by means of servile labor,\r\nwhether the laborers were actual serfs or slaves of the present\r\nindustrial system.\r\n\r\nAll Russia read with astonishment, in the indictment which\r\nwas produced at the court against Karakozoff and his friends,\r\nthat these young men, owners of considerable fortunes, used\r\nto live three or four in the same room, never spending more\r\nthan ten roubles (five dollars) apiece a month for all\r\ntheir needs, and giving at the same time their fortunes for\r\nco-operative associations, co-operative workshops (where they\r\nthemselves worked), and the like. Five years later, thousands\r\nand thousands of the Russian youth--the best part of it--were\r\ndoing the same. Their watch-word was, \"V naród!\" (To the\r\npeople; be the people.) During the years 1860-65 in nearly\r\nevery wealthy family a bitter struggle was going on between\r\nthe fathers, who wanted to maintain the old traditions, and\r\nthe sons and daughters, who defended their right to dispose\r\nof their life according to their own ideals. Young men left\r\nthe military service, the counter and the shop, and flocked\r\nto the university towns. Girls, bred in the most aristocratic\r\nfamilies, rushed penniless to St. Petersburg, Moscow, and\r\nKieff, eager to learn a profession which would free them\r\nfrom the domestic yoke, and some day, perhaps, also from the\r\npossible yoke of a husband. After hard and bitter struggles,\r\nmany of them won that personal freedom. Now they wanted to\r\nutilize it, not for their own personal enjoyment, but for\r\ncarrying to the people the knowledge that had emancipated them.\r\n\r\nIn every town of Russia, in every quarter of St. Petersburg,\r\nsmall groups were formed for self-improvement and\r\nself-education; the works of the philosophers, the writings of\r\nthe economists, the researches of the young Russian historical\r\nschool, were carefully read in these circles, and the reading\r\nwas followed by endless discussions. The aim of all that\r\nreading and discussion was to solve the great question which\r\nrose before them: In what way could they be useful to the\r\nmasses? Gradually, they came to the idea that the only way was\r\nto settle among the people and to live the people's life. Young\r\nmen went into the villages as doctors, doctors' assistants,\r\nteachers, village scribes, even as agricultural laborers,\r\nblacksmiths, woodcutters, and so on, and tried to live there\r\nin closest contact with the peasants. Girls passed teachers'\r\nexaminations, learned midwifery or nursing, and went by the\r\nhundred into the villages, devoting themselves entirely to the\r\npoorest part of the population....\r\n\r\nHere and there, small groups of propagandists had settled\r\nin towns and villages in various capacities. Blacksmiths'\r\nshops and small farms had been started, and young men of the\r\nwealthier classes worked in the shops or on the farms, to be in\r\ndaily contact with the toiling masses. At Moscow, a number of\r\nyoung girls, of rich families, who had studied at the Zurich\r\nuniversity and had started a separate organization, went even\r\nso far as to enter cotton factories, where they worked from\r\nfourteen to sixteen hours a day, and lived in the factory\r\nbarracks the miserable life of the Russian factory girls. It\r\nwas a grand movement, in which, at the lowest estimate, from\r\ntwo to three thousand persons took an active part, while twice\r\nor thrice as many sympathizers and supporters helped the active\r\nvanguard in various ways. With a good half of that army our St.\r\nPetersburg circle was in regular correspondence--always, of\r\ncourse, in cipher.\r\n\r\nThe literature which could be published in Russia under a\r\nrigorous censorship--the faintest hint of Socialism being\r\nprohibited--was soon found insufficient, and we started a\r\nprinting office of our own abroad. Pamphlets for the workers\r\nand the peasants had to be written, and our small \"literary\r\ncommittee,\" of which I was a member, had its hands full of\r\nwork. Serghei wrote a couple of such pamphlets--one in the\r\nLammenais style, and another containing an exposition of\r\nSocialism in a fairy tale--and both had a wide circulation. The\r\nbooks and pamphlets which were printed abroad were smuggled\r\ninto Russia by thousands, stored at certain spots, and sent\r\nout to the local circles, which distributed them amongst the\r\npeasants and the workers. All this required a vast organization\r\nas well as much traveling about, and a colossal correspondence,\r\nparticularly for protecting our helpers and our bookstores from\r\nthe police. We had special ciphers for different provincial\r\ncircles, and often, after six or seven hours had been passed\r\nin discussing all details, the women, who did not trust to our\r\naccuracy in the cipher correspondence, spent all the night in\r\ncovering sheets of paper with cabalistic figures and fractions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionist\r\n\r\nBY IVAN TURGÉNEV\r\n\r\n (Russian writer, 1818-1883, one of the masters of the novel form. He\r\n was imprisoned and later exiled. In the original the present extract\r\n is a prose poem. The versification is by Arthur Guiterman)\r\n\r\n    I saw a spacious house. O'erhung with pall,\r\n    A narrow doorway pierced the sombre wall.\r\n    Within was chill, impenetrable shade;\r\n    Without there stood a maid--a Russian maid,\r\n    To whom the icy dark sent forth a slow\r\n    And hollow-sounding Voice:\r\n\r\n                               \"And dost thou know,\r\n    When thou hast entered, what awaits thee here?\"\r\n    \"I know,\" she said, \"and knowing do not fear.\"\r\n    \"Cold, hunger, hatred, Slander's blighting breath,\"\r\n    The Voice still chanted, \"suffering--and Death?\"\r\n    \"I know,\" she said.\r\n\r\n                        \"Undaunted, wilt thou dare\r\n    The sneers of kindred? Art thou steeled to bear\r\n    From those whom most thou lovest, spite and scorn?\"\r\n    \"Though Love be paid with Hate, that shall be borne,\"\r\n    She answered.\r\n\r\n                  \"Think! Thy doom may be to die\r\n    By thine own hand, with none to fathom why,\r\n    Unthanked, unhonored, desolate, alone,\r\n    Thy grave unmarked, thy toil, thy love unknown,\r\n    And none in days to come shall speak thy name.\"\r\n    She said: \"I ask no pity, thanks or fame.\"\r\n    \"Art thou prepared for crime?\"\r\n\r\n                                      She bowed her head:\r\n    \"Yes, crime, if that shall need,\" the maiden said.\r\n    Now paused the Voice before it asked anew:\r\n    \"But knowest thou that all thou holdest true\r\n    Thy soul may yet deny in bitter pain,\r\n    So thou shalt deem thy sacrifice in vain?\"\r\n    \"E'en this I know,\" she said, \"and yet again\r\n    I pray thee, let me enter.\"\r\n\r\n                                \"Enter then!\"\r\n    That hollow Voice replied. She passed the door.\r\n    A sable curtain fell--and nothing more.\r\n    \"A fool!\" snarled some one, gnashing. Like a prayer\r\n    \"A saint!\" the whispered answer thrilled the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a Russian Prison\r\n\r\n(_From \"Memoirs of a Revolutionist\"_)\r\n\r\nBY PETER KROPOTKIN\r\n\r\n(See page 308)\r\n\r\nOne day in the summer of 1875, in the cell that was next to\r\nmine I distinctly heard the light steps of heeled boots, and\r\na few minutes later I caught fragments of a conversation.\r\nA feminine voice spoke from the cell, and a deep bass\r\nvoice--evidently that of the sentry--grunted something in\r\nreply. Then I recognized the sound of the colonel's spurs,\r\nhis rapid steps, his swearing at the sentry, and the click of\r\nthe key in the lock. He said something, and a feminine voice\r\nloudly replied: \"We did not talk. I only asked him to call the\r\nnon-commissioned officer.\" Then the door was locked, and I\r\nheard the colonel swearing in whispers at the sentry.\r\n\r\nSo I was alone no more. I had a lady neighbor, who at once\r\nbroke down the severe discipline which had hitherto reigned\r\namong the soldiers. From that day the walls of the fortress,\r\nwhich had been mute during the last fifteen months, became\r\nanimated. From all sides I heard knocks with the foot on the\r\nfloor: one, two, three, four, ... eleven knocks; twenty-four\r\nknocks, fifteen knocks; then an interruption, followed by three\r\nknocks, and a long succession of thirty-three knocks. Over and\r\nover again these knocks were repeated in the same succession,\r\nuntil the neighbor would guess at last that they were meant for\r\n\"Kto vy?\" (Who are you?), the letter v being the third letter\r\nin our alphabet. Thereupon conversation was soon established,\r\nand usually was conducted in the abridged alphabet; that is,\r\nthe alphabet being divided into six rows of five letters, each\r\nletter marked by its row and its place in the row.\r\n\r\nI discovered with great pleasure that I had at my left my\r\nfriend Serdukóff, with whom I could soon talk about everything,\r\nespecially when we used our cipher. But intercourse with men\r\nbrought its sufferings as well as its joys. Underneath me was\r\nlodged a peasant, whom Serdukóff knew. He talked to him by\r\nmeans of knocks; and even against my will, often unconsciously\r\nduring my work, I followed their conversations. I also spoke\r\nto him. Now, if solitary confinement without any sort of\r\nwork is hard for educated men, it is infinitely harder for a\r\npeasant who is accustomed to physical work, and not at all\r\nwont to spend years in reading. Our peasant friend felt quite\r\nmiserable, and having been kept for nearly two years in another\r\nprison before he was brought to the fortress--his crime was\r\nthat he had listened to Socialists--he was already broken\r\ndown. Soon I began to notice, to my terror, that from time to\r\ntime his mind wandered. Gradually his thoughts grew more and\r\nmore confused, and we two perceived, step by step, day by day,\r\nevidences that his reason was failing, until his talk became\r\nat last that of a lunatic. Frightful noises and wild cries\r\ncame next from the lower story; our neighbor was mad, but was\r\nstill kept for several months in the casemate before he was\r\nremoved to an asylum, from which he never emerged. To witness\r\nthe destruction of a man's mind, under such conditions, was\r\nterrible. I am sure it must have contributed to increase the\r\nnervous irritability of my good and true friend Serdukóff.\r\nWhen, after four years' imprisonment, he was acquitted by the\r\ncourt and released, he shot himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nBatuschka\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH\r\n\r\n(New England poet and journalist, 1836-1907)\r\n\r\n    From yonder gilded minaret\r\n    Beside the steel-blue Neva set,\r\n    I faintly catch, from time to time,\r\n    The sweet, aerial midnight chime--\r\n          \"God save the Tsar!\"\r\n\r\n    Above the ravelins and the moats\r\n    Of the white citadel it floats;\r\n    And men in dungeons far beneath\r\n    Listen, and pray, and gnash their teeth--\r\n          \"God save the Tsar!\"\r\n\r\n    The soft reiterations sweep\r\n    Across the horror of their sleep,\r\n    As if some demon in his glee\r\n    Were mocking at their misery--\r\n          \"God save the Tsar!\"\r\n\r\n    In his red palace over there,\r\n    Wakeful, he needs must hear the prayer.\r\n    How can it drown the broken cries\r\n    Wrung from his children's agonies?--\r\n          \"God save the Tsar!\"\r\n\r\n    Father they called him from of old--\r\n    Batuschka!...

Into\r\nmy cell a physician came to see if I were strong enough to live\r\nthrough the agony. I saw at once that, afraid to flog a woman\r\n\"political\" without precedent, by this trick of declaring me\r\ntoo sick to be punished they wished to establish the precedent\r\nof the sentence in order that others might be flogged in the\r\nfuture. I insisted that I was strong enough, and that the court\r\nhad no right to record such a sentence unless they flogged me\r\nat once. The sentence was not carried out.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later eight of the men politicals escaped in pairs,\r\nleaving dummies in their places. As the guards never took\r\nmore than a hasty look into that noisome cell, they did not\r\ndiscover the ruse for weeks. Then mounted Cossacks rode out.\r\nThe man-hunt spread. Some of the fugitives struggled through\r\njungles, over mountains and through swamps a thousand miles to\r\nVladivostok, saw the longed-for American vessels, and there on\r\nthe docks were re-captured. All were brought back to Kara.\r\n\r\nFor this we were all punished. One morning the Cossack guards\r\nentered our cells, seized us, tore off our clothes, and dressed\r\nus in convict suits alive with vermin. That scene cannot be\r\ndescribed. One of us attempted suicide. Taken to an old prison\r\nwe were thrown into the \"black holes\"--foul little stalls\r\noff a low grimy hall which contained two big stoves and two\r\nlittle windows. Each of us had a stall six feet by five. On\r\nwinter nights the stall doors were left open for heat, but in\r\nsummer each was locked at night in her own black hole. For\r\nthree months we did not use our bunks, but fought with candles\r\nand pails of scalding water, until at last the vermin were\r\nall killed. We had been put on the \"black hole diet\" of black\r\nbread and water. For three years we never breathed the outside\r\nair. We struggled constantly against the outrages inflicted\r\non us. After one outrage we lay like a row of dead women for\r\nnine days without touching food, until certain promises were\r\nfinally exacted from the warden. This \"hunger strike\" was used\r\nrepeatedly. To thwart it we were often bound hand and foot,\r\nwhile Cossacks tried to force food down our throats.\r\n\r\nKara grew worse after I left. To hint at what happened I\r\ntell briefly the story of my dear friend Maria, a woman of\r\nbroad education and deep refinement. Shortly after my going,\r\nMaria saw Madame Sigida strike an official who had repeatedly\r\ninsulted the women. Two days later she watched Sigida die,\r\nmoaning and bleeding from the lash; that night she saw three\r\nwomen commit suicide as a protest to the world; she knew that\r\ntwenty men attempted suicide on the night following, and she\r\ndetermined to double the protest by assassinating the Governor\r\nof Trans-Baikal, who had ordered Sigida's flogging. At this\r\ntime Maria was pregnant. Her prison term over, she left her\r\nhusband and walked hundreds of miles to the Governor's house\r\nand shot him. She spent three months in a cold, dirty, \"secret\r\ncell\" not long enough to lie down in or high enough to stand\r\nup in, wearing the cast-off suit of a convict, sleeping on the\r\nbare floor and tormented by vermin. She was then sentenced\r\nto be hanged. She hesitated now whether to save the life of\r\nher unborn child. She knew that if she revealed her condition\r\nher sentence would be changed to imprisonment. She decided to\r\nkeep silence and sacrifice her child, that when the execution\r\nwas over and her condition was discovered, the effect on\r\nRussia might be still greater. Her condition, however, became\r\napparent, and she was started off to the Irkutsk prison. It was\r\nmidwinter, forty degrees below zero. She walked. She was given\r\nno overcoat and no boots, until some common criminals in the\r\ncolumn gave her theirs. Her child was born dead in prison, and\r\nsoon after she too died.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrison Memoirs of an Anarchist\r\n\r\nBY ALEXANDER BERKMAN\r\n\r\n(The life-story of a man who served a fourteen-year sentence\r\nin the Western Penitentiary of Pennsylvania for an attempt at\r\nassassination)\r\n\r\n(_Introduction by Hutchins Hapgood_)\r\n\r\nNot only has this book the interest of the human document, but\r\nit is also a striking proof of the power of the human soul.\r\nAlexander Berkman spent fourteen years in prison, under perhaps\r\nmore than commonly harsh and severe conditions. Prison life\r\ntends to destroy the body, weaken the mind and pervert the\r\ncharacter. Berkman consciously struggled with these adverse,\r\ndestructive conditions. He took care of his body. He took care\r\nof his mind. He did so strenuously. It was a moral effort. He\r\nfelt insane ideas trying to take possession of him. Insanity is\r\na natural result of prison life. It always tends to come. This\r\nman felt it, consciously struggled against it, and overcame it.\r\nThat the prison affected him is true. It always does. But he\r\nsaved himself, essentially. Society tried to destroy him, but\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nIf people will read this book carefully it will tend to do\r\naway with prisons. The public, once vividly conscious of what\r\nprison life is and must be, would not be willing to maintain\r\nprisons. This is the only book that I know which goes deeply\r\ninto the corrupting, demoralizing psychology of prison life.\r\nIt shows, in picture after picture, sketch after sketch, not\r\nonly the obvious brutality, stupidity, ugliness permeating the\r\ninstitution, but, very touching, it shows the good qualities\r\nand instincts of the human heart perverted, demoralized,\r\nhelplessly struggling for life; beautiful tendencies basely\r\nexpressing themselves. And the personality of Berkman goes\r\nthrough it all; idealistic, courageous, uncompromising,\r\nsincere, truthful; not untouched, as I have said, by his\r\nsurroundings, but remaining his essential self....\r\n\r\nThe Russian Nihilistic origin of Berkman, his Anarchistic\r\nexperience in America, his attempt on the life of Frick--an\r\nattempt made at a violent industrial crisis, an attempt made as\r\na result of a sincere if fanatical belief that he was called\r\non by his destiny to strike a psychological blow for the\r\noppressed of the community--this part of the book will arouse\r\nextreme disagreement and disapproval of his ideas and his act.\r\nBut I see no reason why this, with the rest, should not rather\r\nbe regarded as an integral part of a human document, as part\r\nof the record of a life, with its social and psychological\r\nsuggestions and explanations. Why not try to understand an\r\nhonest man even if he feels called on to kill? There, too, it\r\nmay be deeply instructive. There, too, it has its lessons. Read\r\nit not in a combative spirit. Read to understand. Do not read\r\nto agree, of course, but read to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dungeon_\r\n\r\nIn the storeroom I am stripped of my suit of dark gray, and\r\nclad in the hateful stripes. Coatless and shoeless, I am led\r\nthrough hallways and corridors, down a steep flight of stairs,\r\nand thrown into the dungeon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTotal darkness. The blackness is massive, palpable--I feel its\r\nhand upon my head, my face. I dare not move, lest a misstep\r\nthrust me into the abyss. I hold my hand close to my eyes--I\r\nfeel the touch of my lashes upon it, but I cannot see its\r\noutline. Motionless I stand on the spot, devoid of all sense\r\nof direction. The silence is sinister; it seems to me I can\r\nhear it. Only now and then the hasty scrambling of nimble feet\r\nsuddenly rends the stillness, and the gnawing of invisible\r\nriver rats haunts the fearful solitude.\r\n\r\nSlowly the blackness pales. It ebbs and melts; out of the\r\nsombre gray, a wall looms above; the silhouette of a door\r\nrises dimly before me, sloping upward and growing compact and\r\nimpenetrable.\r\n\r\nThe hours drag in unbroken sameness. Not a sound reaches me\r\nfrom the cell-house. In the maddening quiet and darkness I am\r\nbereft of all consciousness of time, save once a day when the\r\nheavy rattle of keys apprises me of the morning: the dungeon is\r\nunlocked, and the silent guards hand me a slice of bread and a\r\ncup of water. The double doors fall heavily to, the steps grow\r\nfainter and die in the distance, and all is dark again in the\r\ndungeon.\r\n\r\nThe numbness of death steals upon my soul. The floor is cold\r\nand clammy, the gnawing grows louder and nearer, and I am\r\nfilled with dread lest the starving rats attack my bare feet. I\r\nsnatch a few unconscious moments leaning against the door; and\r\nthen again I pace the cell, striving to keep awake, wondering\r\nwhether it be night or day, yearning for the sound of a human\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nUtterly forsaken! Cast into the stony bowels of the\r\nunderground, the world of man receding, leaving no trace\r\nbehind.... Eagerly I strain my ear--only the ceaseless, fearful\r\ngnawing. I clutch the bars in desperation--a hollow echo mocks\r\nthe clanking iron. My hands tear violently at the door--\"Ho,\r\nthere! Any one here?\" All is silent. Nameless terrors quiver\r\nin my mind, weaving nightmares of mortal dread and despair.\r\nFear shapes convulsive thoughts: they rage in wild tempest,\r\nthen become calm, and again rush through time and space in a\r\nrapid succession of strangely familiar scenes, wakened in my\r\nslumbering consciousness.\r\n\r\nExhausted and weary I droop against the wall. A slimy creeping\r\non my face startles me in horror, and again I pace the cell.\r\nI feel cold and hungry. Am I forgotten? Three days must have\r\npassed, and more. Have they forgotten me?...\r\n\r\nThe clank of keys sends a thrill of joy to my heart. My tomb\r\nwill open--oh, to see the light, and breathe the air again....\r\n\r\n\"Officer, isn't my time up yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your hurry? You've only been here one day.\"\r\n\r\nThe doors fall to. Ravenously I devour the bread, so small and\r\nthin, just a bite. Only _one_ day! Despair enfolds me like a\r\npall. Faint with anguish, I sink to the floor....\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sick Line_\r\n\r\nOne by one the men augment the row; they walk slowly, bent and\r\ncoughing, painfully limping down the steep flights. From every\r\nrange they come; the old and decrepit, the young consumptives,\r\nthe lame and asthmatic, a tottering old negro, an idiotic white\r\nboy. All look withered and dejected,--a ghastly line, palsied\r\nand blear-eyed, blanched in the valley of death.\r\n\r\nThe rotunda door opens noisily, and the doctor enters,\r\naccompanied by Deputy Warden Graves and Assistant Deputy\r\nHopkins. Behind them is a prisoner, dressed in dark gray and\r\ncarrying a medicine box. Dr. Boyce glances at the long line,\r\nand knits his brows. He looks at his watch, and the frown\r\ndeepens. He has much to do. Since the death of the senior\r\ndoctor, the young graduate is the sole physician of the big\r\nprison. He must make the rounds of the shops before noon, and\r\nvisit the hospital before the Warden or the Deputy drops in.\r\n\r\nMr. Greaves sits down at the officers' desk, near the hall\r\nentrance. The Assistant Deputy, pad in hand, places himself at\r\nthe head of the sick line. The doctor leans against the door of\r\nthe rotunda, facing the Deputy. The block officers stand within\r\ncall, at respectful distances.\r\n\r\n\"Two-fifty-five!\" the Assistant Deputy calls out.\r\n\r\nA slender young man leaves the line and approaches the doctor.\r\nHe is tall and well featured, the large eyes lustrous in the\r\npale face. He speaks in a hoarse voice:\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, there is something the matter with my side. I have\r\npains, and I cough bad at night, and in the morning----\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" the doctor interrupts, without looking up from his\r\nnote book. \"Give him some salts,\" he adds, with a nod to his\r\nassistant.\r\n\r\n\"Next!\" the Deputy calls.\r\n\r\n\"Will you please excuse me from the shop for a few days?\" the\r\nsick prisoner pleads, a tremor in his voice.\r\n\r\nThe physician glances questioningly at the Deputy. The latter\r\ncries, impatiently, \"Next, next man!\" striking the desk twice,\r\nin quick succession, with the knuckles of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Return to the shop,\" the doctor says to the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"Next,\" the Deputy calls, spurting a stream of tobacco juice\r\nin the direction of the cuspidor. It strikes sidewise, and\r\nsplashes over the foot of the approaching new patient, a young\r\nnegro, his neck covered with bulging tumors.\r\n\r\n\"Number?\" the doctor inquires.\r\n\r\n\"One-thirty-seven, A one-thirty-seven!\" the Deputy mumbles, his\r\nhead thrown back to receive a fresh handful of \"scrap\" tobacco.\r\n\r\n\"Guess Ah's got de big neck, Ah is, Mistah Boyce,\" the negro\r\nsays hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"Salts. Return to work. Next!\"\r\n\r\n\"A one-twenty-six!\"\r\n\r\nA young man with parchment-like face, sere and yellow, walks\r\npainfully from the line.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, I seem to be gettin' worser, and I'm afraid----\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pains in the stomach. Gettin' so turrible, I----\"\r\n\r\n\"Give him a plaster. Next!\"\r\n\r\n\"Plaster hell!\" the prisoner breaks out in a fury, his face\r\ngrowing livid. \"Look at this, will you?\" With a quick motion he\r\npulls his shirt up to his head. His chest and back are entirely\r\ncovered with porous plasters; not an inch of skin is visible.\r\n\"Damn your plasters,\" he cries with sudden sobs, \"I ain't got\r\nno more room for plasters. I'm putty near dyin', an' you won't\r\ndo nothin' fer me.\"\r\n\r\nThe guards pounce upon the man, and drag him into the rotunda.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Keepers_\r\n\r\nThe comparative freedom of the range familiarizes me with the\r\nworkings of the institution, and brings me in close contact\r\nwith the authorities. The personnel of the guards is of\r\nvery inferior character. I find their average intelligence\r\nconsiderably lower than that of the inmates. Especially does\r\nthe element recruited from the police and the detective service\r\nlack sympathy with the unfortunates in their charge. They\r\nare mostly men discharged from city employment because of\r\nhabitual drunkenness, or flagrant brutality and corruption.\r\nTheir attitude toward the prisoners is summed up in coercion\r\nand suppression. They look upon the men as will-less objects\r\nof iron-handed discipline, exact unquestioning obedience\r\nand absolute submissiveness to peremptory whims, and\r\nharbor personal animosity toward the less pliant. The more\r\nintelligent among the officers scorn inferior duties, and\r\ncrave advancement. The authority and remuneration of a Deputy\r\nWardenship is alluring to them, and every keeper considers\r\nhimself the fittest for the vacancy. But the coveted prize\r\nis awarded to the guard most feared by the inmates, and most\r\nsubservient to the Warden,--a direct incitement to brutality on\r\nthe one hand, to sycophancy on the other....\r\n\r\nDaily I behold the machinery at work, grinding and pulverizing,\r\nbrutalizing the officers, dehumanizing the inmates. Far removed\r\nfrom the strife and struggle of the larger world, I yet witness\r\nits miniature replica, more agonizing and merciless within the\r\nwalls. A perfected model it is, this prison life, with its\r\napparent uniformity and dull passivity. But beneath the torpid\r\nsurface smolder the fires of being, now crackling faintly under\r\na dun smothering smoke, now blazing forth with the ruthlessness\r\nof despair. Hidden by the veil of discipline rages the struggle\r\nof fiercely contending wills, and intricate meshes are woven in\r\nthe quagmire of darkness and suppression.\r\n\r\nIntrigue and counter-plot, violence and corruption, are rampant\r\nin cell-house and shop. The prisoners spy upon each other, and\r\nin turn upon the officers. The latter encourage the trusties in\r\nunearthing the secret doings of the inmates, and the stools\r\nenviously compete with each other in supplying information to\r\nthe keepers. Often they deliberately inveigle the trustful\r\nprisoner into a fake plot to escape, help and encourage him in\r\nthe preparations, and at the critical moment denounce him to\r\nthe authorities.

The _provocateur_\r\nis rewarded with greater liberty and special privileges.\r\nFrequently his treachery proves the stepping-stone to freedom,\r\naided by the Warden's official recommendation of the \"model\r\nprisoner\" to the State Board of Pardons.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY FREDERIC HARRISON\r\n\r\n(English philosopher, born 1831)\r\n\r\nSociety can overlook murder, adultery or swindling; it never\r\nforgives the preaching of a new gospel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Seven That Were Hanged\r\n\r\nBY LEONID ANDREYEV\r\n\r\n (One of the most famous of the Russian writer's stories, in which he\r\n describes the execution of a group of Terrorists, analyzing their\r\n sensations in their separate cells, and on their journey together to\r\n the foot of the gallows)\r\n\r\nThe Unknown, surnamed Werner, was a man fatigued by struggle.\r\nHe had loved life, the theatre, society, art, literature,\r\npassionately. Endowed with an excellent memory, he spoke\r\nseveral languages perfectly. He was fond of dress, and had\r\nexcellent manners. Of the whole group of terrorists he was\r\nthe only one who was able to appear in society without risk of\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nFor a long time already, and without his comrades having\r\nnoticed it, he had entertained a profound contempt for men.\r\nMore of a mathematician than a poet, ecstasy and inspiration\r\nhad remained so far things unknown to him; at times he would\r\nlook upon himself as a madman seeking to square the circle in\r\nseas of human blood. The enemy against which he daily struggled\r\ncould not inspire him with respect; it was nothing but a\r\ncompact network of stupidities, treasons, falsehoods, base\r\ndeceits....\r\n\r\nWerner understood that the execution was not simply death, but\r\nalso something more. In any case, he was determined to meet it\r\ncalmly, to live until the end as if nothing had happened or\r\nwould happen. Only in this way could he repress the profoundest\r\ncontempt for the execution and preserve his liberty of mind.\r\nHis comrades, although knowing well his cold and haughty\r\nintrepidity, would perhaps not have believed it themselves; but\r\nin the courtroom he thought not of life or of death: he played\r\nin his mind a difficult game of chess, giving it his deepest\r\nand quietest attention. An excellent player, he had begun this\r\ngame on the very day of his imprisonment, and he had kept it\r\nup continually. And the verdict that condemned him did not\r\ndisplace a single piece on the invisible board.\r\n\r\nNow he was shrugging his shoulders and feeling his pulse. His\r\nheart beat fast, but tranquilly and regularly, with a sonorous\r\nforce. Like a novice thrown into prison for the first time, he\r\nexamined attentively the cell, the bolts, the chair screwed to\r\nthe wall, and said to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Why have I such a sensation of joy, of liberty? Yes, of\r\nliberty; I think of to-morrow's execution, and it seems to me\r\nit does not exist. I look at the walls, and they seem to me not\r\nto exist either. And I feel as free as if, instead of being in\r\nprison, I had just come out of another cell in which I had been\r\nconfined all my life.\"\r\n\r\nWerner's hands began to tremble, a thing unknown to him. His\r\nthought became more and more vibrant. It seemed to him that\r\ntongues of fire were moving in his head, trying to escape from\r\nhis brain to lighten the still obscure distance. Finally the\r\nflame darted forth, and the horizon was brilliantly illuminated.\r\n\r\nThe vague lassitude that had tortured Werner during the last\r\ntwo years had disappeared at sight of death; his beautiful\r\nyouth came back. It was even something more than beautiful\r\nyouth. With the astonishing clearness of mind that sometimes\r\nlifts man to the supreme heights of meditation, Werner saw\r\nsuddenly both life and death; and the majesty of this new\r\nspectacle struck him. He seemed to be following a path as\r\nnarrow as the edge of a blade, on the crest of the loftiest\r\nmountain. On one side he saw life, and on the other he saw\r\ndeath; and they were like two seas, sparkling and beautiful,\r\nmelting into each other at the horizon in a single infinite\r\nextension.\r\n\r\n\"What is this, then? What a divine spectacle!\" said he slowly.\r\n\r\nHe arose involuntarily and straightened up, as if in presence\r\nof the Supreme Being. And, annihilating the walls, annihilating\r\nspace and time, by the force of his all-penetrating look, he\r\ncast his eyes into the depths of the life that he had quitted.\r\n\r\nAnd life took on a new aspect. He no longer tried, as of old,\r\nto translate into words that he was; moreover, in the whole\r\nrange of human language, still so poor and miserly, he found\r\nno words adequate. The paltry, dirty and evil things that\r\nsuggested to him contempt and sometimes even disgust at the\r\nsight of men had completely disappeared, just as, to people\r\nrising in a balloon, the mud and filth of the narrow streets\r\nbecome invisible, and ugliness changes into beauty.\r\n\r\nWith an unconscious movement Werner walked toward the table and\r\nleaned upon it with his right arm. Haughty and authoritative by\r\nnature, he had never been seen in a prouder, freer, and more\r\nimperious attitude; never had his face worn such a look, never\r\nhad he so lifted up his head, for at no previous time had he\r\nbeen as free and powerful as now, in this prison, on the eve of\r\nexecution, at the threshold of death.\r\n\r\nIn his illuminated eyes men wore a new aspect, an unknown\r\nbeauty and charm. He hovered above time, and never had this\r\nhumanity, which only the night before was howling like a\r\nwild beast in the forest, appeared to him so young. What had\r\nheretofore seemed to him terrible, unpardonable and base,\r\nbecame suddenly touching and naïve, just as we cherish in\r\nthe child the awkwardness of its behavior, the incoherent\r\nstammerings in which its unconscious genius glimmers, its\r\nlaughable errors and blunders, its cruel bruises.\r\n\r\n\"My dear friends!\" ...\r\n\r\nWhat mysterious path had he followed to pass from a feeling of\r\nunlimited and haughty liberty to this passionate and moving\r\npity? He did not know. Did he really pity his comrades, or did\r\nhis tears hide something more passionate, something really\r\ngreater? His heart, which had suddenly revived and reblossomed,\r\ncould not tell him. Werner wept, and whispered:\r\n\r\n\"My dear comrades! My dear comrades!\"\r\n\r\nAnd in this man who wept, and who smiled through his tears, no\r\none--not the judges, or his comrades, or himself--would have\r\nrecognized the cold and haughty Werner, sceptical and insolent.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Woman's Execution\r\n\r\nBY EDWARD KING\r\n\r\n(After the Paris Commune of 1871, the leaders of the people\r\nwere led out and slaughtered by thousands.

It is its natural manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese Shifting Scenes\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES EDWARD RUSSELL\r\n\r\n(American editor and Socialist lecturer, born 1860. In the\r\nfollowing paragraphs he has given a newspaper reporter's\r\nreminiscences of the Chicago Anarchists)\r\n\r\nAfter so many years the passions and prejudices of the\r\nhalf-forgotten struggle ought to have died away, and men may\r\nnow speak candidly and without restraint of these things as\r\nthey really were. Let me then record my deliberate conviction\r\nthat Albert Parsons never entertained the thought of harm\r\nagainst any human being, for I have seldom met a man of a more\r\ngenuine kindness of heart; and if the men he denounced in his\r\nspeeches had been in actual danger before him I am certain\r\nhe would have been the first to rush to their defense from\r\nphysical harm. And while I am on this subject, I may add an\r\nexpression of a wonder growing upon me for many years, that\r\nno one has ever paid an adequate tribute to this man. I have\r\nnot the slightest sympathy with his doctrines, if he believed\r\nin the violence he seemed sometimes to preach, which I could\r\nnever tell. I have lived in the world long enough to know that\r\nthe social wrongs that moved him to protest can never be cured\r\nby violence. Say, then, that the man erred grievously; if his\r\nerror had been ten times as great it ought to have been wiped\r\nfrom human recollection by his sacrifice, and there should\r\nremain but the one image of him, leaving his place of safety\r\nand voluntarily entering the prisoner's dock. I doubt if that\r\nmagnanimous act has its parallel in history. A hundred men have\r\nbeen elevated to be national heroes for deeds far less heroic.\r\nThe fact that after all these years it is still obscured\r\nand men hesitate to speak about it is marvelous testimony to\r\nthe power of the press to produce enduring impressions. Even\r\nthe other staggering fact that in the history of American\r\ncourts this is the only man that ever came voluntarily and\r\ngave himself up and then was hanged, even that seems to be\r\neliminated from the little consideration that is ever bestowed\r\nupon a figure of courage so extraordinary.\r\n\r\nSimilarly I wondered while all these events were passing before\r\nme and wonder now, that no one ever stopped to inquire why such\r\nmen as Parsons and Fielden were in revolt. Granted freely that\r\ntheir idea of the best manner of making a protest was utterly\r\nwrong and impossible; granted that they went not the best way\r\nto work. But what was it that drove them into attack against\r\nthe social order as they found it? They and thousands of other\r\nmen that stood with them were not bad men, nor depraved, nor\r\nbloodthirsty, nor hard-hearted, nor criminal, nor selfish,\r\nnor crazy. Then what was it that evoked a complaint so bitter\r\nand deep-seated? In all the clamor that filled the press for\r\nthe execution of the law and the supremacy of order not one\r\nwriter ever stopped to ask this obvious question. No one ever\r\ncontemplated the simple fact that men do not band themselves\r\ntogether to make a protest without the belief that they have\r\nsomething to protest about, and that in any organized state of\r\nsociety a widespread protest is something for grave inquiry. I\r\nthought then and I think now that a few words devoted to this\r\nsuggestion would have been of far greater service to society\r\nthan the insensate demand for blood and more blood with which\r\nthe journals of Chicago were mostly filled.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle that is Forgotten\r\n\r\nBY VACHEL LINDSAY\r\n\r\n (Poet and minstrel of Springfield, Illinois, born 1879; has tramped\r\n over many parts of the United States with his leaflet of \"Rhymes to be\r\n Traded for Bread.\" He has rediscovered the Homeric chant, and poured\r\n into it the life of the Middle West. The following poem is addressed\r\n to John P. Altgeld, once Governor of Illinois, who, having convinced\r\n himself that the so-called Chicago Anarchists were innocent of the\r\n crime charged against them, pardoned them, and thereby sacrificed his\r\n political career)\r\n\r\n    Sleep softly ... eagle forgotten ... under the stone.\r\n    Time has its way with you there, and the clay has its own.\r\n    \"We have buried him now,\" thought your foes, and in secret rejoiced.\r\n    They made a brave show of their mourning, their hatred unvoiced.\r\n    They had snarled at you, barked at you, foamed at you, day after day,\r\n    Now you were ended. They praised you ... and laid you away.\r\n    The others, that mourned you in silence and terror and truth,\r\n    The widow bereft of her crust, and the boy without youth,\r\n    The mocked and the scorned and the wounded, the lame and the poor,\r\n    That should have remembered forever ... remember no more.\r\n    Where are those lovers of yours, on what name do they call,\r\n    The lost, that in armies wept over your funeral pall?\r\n    They call on the names of a hundred high-valiant ones,\r\n    A hundred white eagles have risen, the sons of your sons.\r\n    The zeal in their wings is a zeal that your dreaming began,\r\n    The valor that wore out your soul in the service of man.\r\n    Sleep softly ... eagle forgotten ... under the stone.\r\n    Time has its way with you there, and the clay has its own.\r\n    Sleep on, O brave-hearted, O wise man that kindled the flame--\r\n    To live in mankind is far more than to live in a name,\r\n    To live in mankind, far, far more ... than to live in a name.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmortality\r\n\r\n(_From the Will of Francisco Ferrer_)\r\n\r\n (Spanish educator and radical, 1859-1909, executed after the Barcelona\r\n riots by a plot of his clerical enemies)\r\n\r\nI also wish my friends to speak little or not at all about\r\nme, because idols are created when men are praised, and this\r\nis very bad for the future of the human race. Acts alone, no\r\nmatter by whom committed, ought to be studied, praised, or\r\nblamed. Let them be praised in order that they may be imitated\r\nwhen they seem to contribute to the common weal; let them be\r\ncensured when they are regarded as injurious to the general\r\nwell-being, so that they may not to be repeated.\r\n\r\nI desire that on no occasion, whether near or remote, nor for\r\nany reason whatsoever, shall demonstrations of a political or\r\nreligious character be made before my remains, as I consider\r\nthe time devoted to the dead would be better employed in\r\nimproving the condition of the living, most of whom stand in\r\ngreat need of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nLight Upon Waldheim\r\n\r\nBY VOLTAIRINE DE CLEYRE\r\n\r\n (American anarchist writer, 1866-1912.

But no, they prefer to remain deaf to their\r\nappeals. It seems that a fatality impels them, like the royalty\r\nof the eighteenth century, toward the precipice which will\r\nengulf them; for woe be to those who remain deaf to the cries\r\nof the starving, woe to those who, believing themselves of\r\nsuperior essence, assume the right to exploit those beneath\r\nthem! There comes a time when the people no longer reason; they\r\nrise like a hurricane, and rush onward like a torrent. Then we\r\nsee bleeding heads impaled on pikes.\r\n\r\nAmong the exploited, gentlemen, there are two classes of\r\nindividuals. Those of one class, not realizing what they\r\nare and what they might be, take life as it comes, believe\r\nthat they are born to be slaves, and content themselves with\r\nthe little that is given them in exchange for their labor.\r\nBut there are others, on the contrary, who think, who study\r\nand, looking about them, discover social iniquities. Is it\r\ntheir fault if they see clearly and suffer at seeing others\r\nsuffer? Then they throw themselves into the struggle, and make\r\nthemselves the bearers of the popular claims.\r\n\r\nI know very well that I shall be told that I ought to have\r\nconfined myself to speech for the vindication of the people's\r\nclaims. But what can you expect! It takes a loud voice to\r\nmake the deaf hear. Too long have they answered our voices by\r\nimprisonment, the rope, and rifle-volleys. Make no mistake;\r\nthe explosion of my bomb is not only the cry of the rebel\r\nVaillant, but the cry of an entire class which vindicates its\r\nrights, and which will soon add acts to words. For, be sure of\r\nit, in vain will they pass laws. The ideas of the thinkers will\r\nnot halt!\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond Human Might\r\n\r\nBY BJÖRNSTJERNE BJÖRNSON\r\n\r\n (A drama of modern industry.

And then the sun, the spring--ever since that dreadful\r\nnight--nothing but fine weather, night and day--a stretch of\r\nit the like of which I cannot recall. Is it not as if nature\r\nitself were crying out to us: \"Shame! shame! You sprinkle my\r\nleaves with blood, and mingle death-cries with my song. You\r\ndarken the air for me with your gruesome complaints.\" That's\r\nwhat it is saying to us. \"You are soiling the spring for me.\r\nYour diseases and your evil thoughts are crouching in the\r\nwoods and on the greenswards. Everywhere a stink of misery is\r\nfollowing you like that of rotting waters.\" That's what it is\r\ntelling us. \"Your greed and your envy are a pair of sisters\r\nwho have fought each other since they were born\"--that's what\r\nit says. \"Only my highest mountain peaks, only my sandy wastes\r\nand icy deserts, have not seen those sisters; every other part\r\nof the earth has been filled by them with blood and brutal\r\nbawling.

But Jesus knew that\r\nhe had come to kindle a fire on earth. Much as he loved peace,\r\nhe knew that the actual result of his work would be not peace\r\nbut the sword. His mother in her song had recognized in her own\r\nexperience the settled custom of God to \"put down the proud\r\nand exalt them of low degree,\" to \"fill the hungry with good\r\nthings and to send the rich empty away.\" King Robert of Sicily\r\nrecognized the revolutionary ring in those phrases, and thought\r\nit well that the Magnificat was sung only in Latin. The son of\r\nMary expected a great reversal of values. The first would be\r\nlast and the last would be first. He saw that what was exalted\r\namong man was an abomination before God, and therefore these\r\nexalted things had no glamour for his eye. This revolutionary\r\nnote runs even through the beatitudes, where we should least\r\nexpect it. The point of them is that henceforth those were to\r\nbe blessed whom the world had not blessed, for the kingdom of\r\nGod would reverse their relative standing. Now the poor and the\r\nhungry and sad were to be satisfied and comforted; the meek\r\nwho had been shouldered aside by the ruthless would get their\r\nchance to inherit the earth, and conflict and persecution would\r\nbe inevitable in the process.\r\n\r\nWe are apt to forget that his attack on the religious leaders\r\nand authorities of his day was of revolutionary boldness and\r\nthoroughness. He called the ecclesiastical leaders hypocrites,\r\nblind leaders who fumbled in their casuistry, and everywhere\r\nmissed the decisive facts in teaching right and wrong. Their\r\npiety was no piety; their law was inadequate; they harmed\r\nthe men whom they wanted to convert. Even the publicans and\r\nharlots had a truer piety than theirs. If we remember that\r\nreligion was still the foundation of the Jewish State, and\r\nthat the religious authorities were the pillars of existing\r\nsociety, much as in mediæval Catholic Europe, we shall realize\r\nhow revolutionary were his invectives. It was like Luther\r\nanathematizing the Catholic hierarchy.\r\n\r\nHis mind was similarly liberated from spiritual subjection\r\nto the existing civil powers. He called Herod, his own liege\r\nsovereign, \"that fox.\" When the mother of James and John tried\r\nto steal a march on the others and secure for her sons a pledge\r\nof the highest places in the Messianic kingdom, Jesus felt\r\nthat this was a backsliding into the scrambling methods of the\r\npresent social order, in which each tries to make the others\r\nserve him, and he is greatest who can compel service from\r\nmost. In the new social order, which was expressed in his own\r\nlife, each must seek to give the maximum of service, and he\r\nwould be greatest who would serve utterly. In that connection\r\nhe sketched with a few strokes the pseudo-greatness of the\r\npresent aristocracy: \"Ye know that they which are supposed\r\nto rule over the nations lord it over them, and their great\r\nones tyrannize over them. Thus shall it not be among you.\"\r\nThe monarchies and aristocracies have always lived on the\r\nfiction that they exist for the good of the people, and yet\r\nit is an appalling fact how few kings have loved their people\r\nand have lived to serve. Usually the great ones have regarded\r\nthe people as their oyster. In a similar saying reported by\r\nLuke, Jesus wittily adds that these selfish exploiters of the\r\npeople graciously allow themselves to be called \"Benefactors.\"\r\nHis eyes were open to the unintentional irony of the titles\r\nin which the \"majesties,\" \"excellencies,\" and \"holinesses\" of\r\nthe world have always decked themselves. Every time the inbred\r\ninstinct to seek precedence cropped up among his disciples he\r\nsternly suppressed it. They must not allow themselves to be\r\ncalled Rabbi or Father or Master, \"for all ye are brothers.\"\r\nChrist's ideal of society involved the abolition of rank\r\nand the extinction of those badges of rank in which former\r\ninequality was incrusted. The only title to greatness was to\r\nbe distinguished service at cost to self. All this shows the\r\nkeenest insight into the masked selfishness of those who hold\r\npower, and involves a revolutionary consciousness, emancipated\r\nfrom reverence for things as they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the \"Christians\"\r\n\r\nBY FRANCIS ADAMS\r\n\r\n(See pages 219, 266)\r\n\r\n    Take, then, your paltry Christ,\r\n      Your gentleman God.\r\n    We want the carpenter's son,\r\n      With his saw and hod.\r\n\r\n    _We_ want the man who loved\r\n      The poor and the oppressed,\r\n    Who hated the Rich man and King\r\n      And the Scribe and the Priest.\r\n\r\n    _We_ want the Galilean\r\n      Who knew cross and rod.\r\n    It's your \"good taste\" that prefers\r\n      A bastard \"God!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of Jesus\r\n\r\nBY ERNEST RENAN\r\n\r\n(French philosopher and historian, 1823-1892)\r\n\r\nThe chosen flock presented in fact a very mixed character, and\r\none likely to astonish rigorous moralists. It counted in its\r\nfold men with whom a Jew, respecting himself, would not have\r\nassociated. Perhaps Jesus found in this society, unrestrained\r\nby ordinary rules, more mind and heart than in a pedantic\r\nand formal middle class, proud of its apparent morality....\r\nHe appreciated conditions of soul only in proportion to the\r\nlove mingled therein. Women with tearful hearts, and disposed\r\nthrough their sins to feelings of humanity, were nearer to his\r\nkingdom than ordinary natures, who often have little merit in\r\nnot having fallen. We may conceive on the other hand that these\r\ntender souls, finding in their conversion to the sect an easy\r\nmeans of restoration, would passionately attach themselves to\r\nHim. Far from seeking to soothe the murmurs stirred up by his\r\ndisdain for the social susceptibilities of the time, He seemed\r\nto take pleasure in exciting them. Never did anyone avow more\r\nloftily this contempt for the \"world,\" which is the essential\r\ncondition of great things and great originality. He pardoned a\r\nrich man, but only when the rich man, in consequence of some\r\nprejudice, was disliked by society. He greatly preferred men\r\nof equivocal life and of small consideration in the eyes of\r\nthe orthodox leaders. \"The publicans and the harlots go into\r\nthe kingdom of God before you. For John came unto you and ye\r\nbelieved him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed\r\nhim.\" We can understand how galling the reproach of not having\r\nfollowed the good example set by prostitutes must have been to\r\nmen making a profession of seriousness and rigid morality.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE\r\n\r\nAnd as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine\r\nwith him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. And when the\r\nPharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed\r\nbefore dinner.\r\n\r\nAnd the Lord said unto him, \"Now do ye Pharisees make clean\r\nthe outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part\r\nis full of ravening and wickedness. Ye fools, did not he, that\r\nmade that which is without, make that which is within also? But\r\nrather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all\r\nthings are clean unto you. But woe unto you, Pharisees! for\r\nye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over\r\njudgment and the love of God; these ought ye to have done, and\r\nnot to leave the other undone. Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye\r\nlove the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in\r\nthe markets. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\r\nfor ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk\r\nover them are not aware of them.\"\r\n\r\nThen answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, \"Master,\r\nthus saying thou reproachest us also.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Woe unto you, also, ye lawyers, for ye lade men\r\nwith burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not\r\nthe burdens with one of your fingers. Woe unto you! for ye\r\nbuild the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed\r\nthem.... Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key\r\nof knowledge; ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were\r\nentering in ye hindered.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the\r\nPharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to\r\nspeak of many things: laying wait for him, and seeking to catch\r\nsomething out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Tramp's Confession\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Cry of Youth\"_)\r\n\r\nBY HARRY KEMP\r\n\r\n(See page 37)\r\n\r\n    We huddled in the mission\r\n      Fer it was cold outside,\r\n    An' listened to the preacher\r\n      Tell of the Crucified;\r\n\r\n    Without, a sleety drizzle\r\n      Cut deep each ragged form,--\r\n    An' so we stood the talkin'\r\n      Fer shelter from the storm\r\n\r\n    They sang of God an' angels,\r\n      An' heaven's eternal joy,\r\n    An' things I stopped believin'\r\n      When I was still a boy;\r\n\r\n    They spoke of good an' evil,\r\n      An' offered savin' grace--\r\n    An' some showed love for mankin'\r\n      A-shinin' in their face,\r\n\r\n    An' some their graft was workin'\r\n      The same as me an' you:\r\n    But most was urgin' on us\r\n      Wot they believed was true.\r\n\r\n    We sang an' dozed an' listened,\r\n      But only feared, us men,\r\n    The time when, service over,\r\n      We'd have to mooch again\r\n\r\n    An' walk the icy pavements\r\n      An' breast the snowstorm gray\r\n    Till the saloons was opened\r\n      An' there was hints of day.\r\n\r\n    So, when they called out \"Sinners,\r\n      Won't you come!\" I came ...\r\n    But in my face was pallor\r\n      And in my heart was shame ...\r\n    An' so forgive me, Jesus,\r\n      Fer mockin' of thy name--\r\n\r\n    Fer I was cold an' hungry!\r\n      They gave me grub an' bed\r\n    After I kneeled there with them\r\n      An' many prayers was said.\r\n\r\n    An' so fergive me, Jesus,\r\n      I didn't mean no harm--\r\n    An' outside it was zero,\r\n      An' inside it was warm....\r\n\r\n    Yes, I was cold an' hungry,--\r\n      An', O Thou Crucified,\r\n    Thou friend of all the Lowly,\r\n      Fergive the lie I lied!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Call of the Carpenter[A]\r\n\r\n[A] By permission of Doubleday, Page & Co.\r\n\r\nBY BOUCK WHITE\r\n\r\n(American Congregational clergyman, born 1874; imprisoned for\r\nprotesting in a church against the Colorado massacres)\r\n\r\nJesus held that self-respect required of the rich young man\r\nthat he refuse to accept too long a handicap over his fellows\r\nin the race of life, and start as near as may be from the\r\nsame mark with them. But he went also a step further. He\r\nexacted of the young man that he de-class himself. \"Come,\r\nfollow me.\" This was the staggerer. To stay in his own set\r\nand invest his fortune in works of charity, would have been\r\ncomparatively easy. Philanthropy has been fashionable in every\r\nage. Charity takes the insurrectionary edge off of poverty.\r\nTherefore the philanthropic rich man is a benefactor to his\r\nfellow magnates, and is made to feel their gratitude; to him\r\nall doors of fashion swing. But Jesus issued a veto. He denied\r\nthe legitimacy of alms-giving as a plaster for the deep-lying\r\nsore in the social tissue. Neighborly help, man to man, was\r\nacceptable to him, and he commended it. But philanthropy as a\r\nsubstitute for justice--he would have none of it. Charity is\r\ntwice cursed--it hardens him that gives and softens him that\r\ntakes. It does more harm to the poor than exploitation, because\r\nit makes them willing to be exploited. It breeds slavishness,\r\nwhich is moral suicide. The only thing Jesus would permit a\r\nswollen fortune to do was to give itself to revolutionary\r\npropaganda, in order that swollen fortunes might be forever\r\nafter impossible. Patchwork reformers are but hewing at a\r\nhydra. Confronted with this imperative, the rich young ruler\r\nmade the great refusal. To give up his fashionable set and join\r\nhimself to this company of working-class Galileans, was a moral\r\nheroism to which he was unequal. Therefore he was sorrowful; he\r\nwent away, for he had a great social standing.\r\n\r\nSomething of the same brand of atonement was evidently\r\nin the mind of Dives when he awoke to the mistake he had\r\nmade--desirous to send from hell and tell his five brothers\r\nto use the family fortune in erecting a \"Dives Home for the\r\nHungry,\" belike with the family name and coat of arms over\r\nthe front portal. Jesus would concede no such privilege. He\r\nreferred those \"five brethren\" to \"Moses and the prophets; let\r\nthem hear them\"--Moses being the leader of the labor movement\r\nwhich had given to the slaves in the Goshen brick-yards\r\ntheir long-deferred rights; and the prophets being those\r\nardent Old Testament tribunes of the people who had so\r\nhotly contended for the family idea of society against the\r\nexploiters and graspers at the top. Dante's idea that each sin\r\non earth fashions its own proper punishment in hell receives\r\nconfirmation in this parable. \"The great gulf fixed,\" which\r\nconstituted Dives's hell, was the gulf which he himself had\r\nbrought about. For the private fortune he amassed had broken\r\nup the solidarity of society--had introduced into it a chasm\r\nboth broad and deep. The gulf between him and Lazarus in this\r\nworld exists in the world to come to plague him. The thirst\r\nwhich parched Dives's tongue, \"being in torments,\" was the\r\nthirst for companionship, the healing contact once more with\r\nhis fellows, from whom his fortune had sundered him like a\r\nbutcher's cleaver. Jesus had so exalted a notion of the working\r\nclass, their absence of cant, their rugged facing of the facts,\r\ntheir elemental simplicities, their first-hand contact with the\r\nrealities of life, that he regarded any man who should draw\r\nhimself off from them in a fancied superiority, as immeasurably\r\nthe loser thereby, and as putting himself \"in torments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLazarus\r\n\r\n(_From the London \"Spectator\"_)\r\n\r\nANONYMOUS\r\n\r\n    Still he lingers, where wealth and fashion\r\n      Meet together to dine or play--\r\n    Lingers, a matter of vague compassion,\r\n      Out in the darkness across the way;\r\n    Out beyond the warmth and the glitter,\r\n      The light where luxury's laughter rings,\r\n    Lazarus waits, where the wind is bitter,\r\n      Receiving his evil things.\r\n\r\n    Still ye find him when, breathless, burning,\r\n      Summer flames upon square and street,\r\n    When the fortunate ones of the earth are turning\r\n      Their thoughts to meadows and meadow-sweet;\r\n    Far away from the wide green valley,\r\n      The bramble patch where the white-throat sings,\r\n    Lazarus sweats in his crowded alley,\r\n      Receiving his evil things....\r\n\r\n    In the name of Knowledge the race grows healthier,\r\n      In the name of Freedom the world grows great;\r\n    And men are wiser, and men are wealthier,\r\n      But--Lazarus lies at the rich man's gate.\r\n    Lies as he lay through human history,\r\n      Fame of heroes and pomp of kings,\r\n    At the rich man's gate, an abiding mystery,\r\n      Receiving his evil things.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Parable\r\n\r\nBY JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL\r\n\r\n(See page 189)\r\n\r\n    Said Christ our Lord, \"I will go and see\r\n    How the men, my brethren, believe in me.\"\r\n    He passed not again through the gate of birth,\r\n    But made himself known to the children of earth.\r\n\r\n    Then said the chief priests, and rulers, and kings,\r\n    \"Behold, now, the Giver of all good things;\r\n    Go to, let us welcome with pomp and state\r\n    Him who alone is mighty and great.\"\r\n\r\n    With carpets of gold the ground they spread\r\n    Wherever the Son of Man should tread,\r\n    And in palace chambers lofty and rare\r\n    They lodged him, and served him with kingly fare.\r\n\r\n    Great organs surged through arches dim\r\n    Their jubilant floods in praise of him;\r\n    And in church, and palace, and judgment-hall,\r\n    He saw his image high over all.\r\n\r\n    But still, wherever his steps they led,\r\n    The Lord in sorrow bent down his head,\r\n    And from under the heavy foundation-stones\r\n    The son of Mary heard bitter groans.\r\n\r\n    And in church, and palace, and judgment-hall,\r\n    He marked great fissures that rent the wall,\r\n    And opened wider and yet more wide\r\n    As the living foundation heaved and sighed.\r\n\r\n    \"Have ye founded your thrones and altars, then,\r\n    On the bodies and souls of living men?\r\n    And think ye that building shall endure,\r\n    Which shelters the noble and crushes the poor?\r\n\r\n    \"With gates of silver and bars of gold\r\n    Ye have fenced my sheep from their Father's fold;\r\n    I have heard the dropping of their tears\r\n    In heaven these eighteen hundred years.\"\r\n\r\n    \"O Lord and Master, not ours the guilt,\r\n    We build but as our fathers built;\r\n    Behold thine images, how they stand,\r\n    Sovereign and sole, through all our land.\r\n\r\n    \"Our task is hard,--with sword and flame\r\n    To hold thine earth forever the same,\r\n    And with sharp crooks of steel to keep\r\n    Still, as thou leftest them, thy sheep.\"\r\n\r\n    Then Christ sought out an artisan,\r\n    A low-browed, stunted, haggard man,\r\n    And a motherless girl, whose fingers thin\r\n    Pushed from her faintly want and sin.\r\n\r\n    These set he in the midst of them,\r\n    And as they drew back their garment-hem,\r\n    For fear of defilement, \"Lo, here,\" said he,\r\n    \"The images ye have made of me!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW\r\n\r\nThen shall the King say unto them on his right hand, \"Come, ye\r\nblessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from\r\nthe foundation of the world: For I was a hungered, and ye gave\r\nme meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger,\r\nand ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye\r\nvisited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.\"\r\n\r\nThen shall the righteous answer him, saying, \"Lord, when saw we\r\nthee a hungered, and fed thee?

Johannes is a boy of good family, who meets a strange,\r\n homeless workingman, to whom he becomes devoted, and whom he calls his\r\n \"Brother.\" The present selection narrates how Johannes was taken to\r\n church.)\r\n\r\n\"You see, Father,\" said the countess, \"we have come to seek\r\nJesus. Johannes, also.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is waiting for you,\" replied the priest, solemnly, pointing\r\nout the great crucifix above the altar. Then he disappeared\r\ninto the sacristy.\r\n\r\nJohannes immediately fastened his eyes upon that figure, and\r\ncontinued to contemplate it while the people were taking their\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nIt hung in the strongest light of the shadowy church.\r\nApparently it was of wood stained to a pale rose, with peculiar\r\nblue and brown shadows. The wounds in the side and under the\r\nthorns on the forehead were distinct to exaggeration--all\r\npurple and swollen, with great streaks of blood like dark-red\r\nsealing-wax. The face, with its closed eyes, wore a look of\r\ndistress, and a large circle of gold and precious stones\r\nwaggishly adorned the usual russet-colored, cork-screwy,\r\nwoodeny locks. The cross itself was of shining gold, and each\r\nof its four extremities was ornamented, while a nice, wavy\r\npaper above the head bore the letters I. N. R. I. One could\r\nsee that it was all brand-new, and freshly gilded and painted.\r\nWreaths and bouquets of paper flowers embellished the altar.\r\n\r\nFor a long time--perhaps a quarter of an hour--Johannes\r\ncontinued to look at the image. \"That is Jesus,\" he muttered\r\nto himself, \"He of whom I have so often heard. Now I am going\r\nto learn about Him, and He is to comfort me. He it is who has\r\nredeemed the world.\"\r\n\r\nBut however often he might repeat this, trying seriously\r\nto convince himself--because he would have been glad to be\r\nconvinced and also to be redeemed--he could nevertheless see\r\nnothing except a repulsive, ugly, bloody, prinked-up wooden\r\ndoll. And this made him feel doubly sorrowful and disheartened.\r\nFully fifteen minutes had he sat there, looking and musing,\r\nhearing the people around him chatting--about the price they\r\nhad paid for their places, about the keeping on or taking\r\noff of women's hats, and about the reserved seats for the\r\nfirst families. Then the door of the sacristy opened, and the\r\nchoir-boys with their swinging censers, and the sacristan, and\r\nthe priests in their beautiful, gold-bordered garments, came\r\nslowly and majestically in. And as the congregation kneeled,\r\nJohannes kneeled with them.\r\n\r\nAnd when Johannes, as well as the others, looked at the\r\nincoming procession, and then again turned his eyes to the high\r\naltar, behold! there, to his amazement, kneeling before the\r\nwhite altar, he saw a dark form. It was in plain sight, bending\r\nforward in the twilight, the arms upon the altar, and the face\r\nhidden in the arms. A man it was, in the customary dark clothes\r\nof a laborer. No one--neither Johannes nor probably any one\r\nelse in the church--had seen whence he came. But he was now in\r\nthe full sight of all, and one could hear whisperings and a\r\nsubdued excitement run along the rows of people and pass on to\r\nthe rear, like a gust of wind over a grain-field.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the procession of choir-boys and priests came\r\nwithin sight of the altar, the sacristan stepped hastily out\r\nof line and went forward to the stranger, to assure him that,\r\npossibly from too deep absorption in devotion, or from lack\r\nof familiarity with ecclesiastical ceremony, he was guilty of\r\nintrusion.\r\n\r\nHe touched the man's shoulder, but the man did not stir. In the\r\nbreathless stillness that followed, while everyone expectantly\r\nawaited the outcome, a deep, heartrending sob was heard.\r\n\r\n\"A penitent!\" \"A drunken man!\" \"A convert!\" were some of the\r\nwhispered comments of the people.\r\n\r\nThe perplexed sacristan turned round, and beckoned Father\r\nCanisius, who, with impressive bearing, stepped up in his\r\nwhite, gold-threaded garb, as imposingly as a full-sailed\r\nfrigate moves.\r\n\r\n\"Your place is not here,\" said the priest, in his deep voice.\r\nHe spoke kindly, and not particularly loudly. \"Go to the back\r\nof the church.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply, and the man did not move; yet, in the still\r\nmore profound silence, his weeping was so audible that many\r\npeople shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not hear me?\" said the priest, raising his voice a\r\nlittle, and speaking with some impatience. \"It is well that\r\nyou are repentant, but only the consecrated belong here--not\r\npenitents.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he grasped the shoulder of the stranger with his\r\nlarge, strong hand.\r\n\r\nThen, slowly, very slowly, the kneeling man raised his head\r\nfrom his arms, and turned his face toward the priest.\r\n\r\nWhat followed, perhaps each one of the hundreds of witnesses\r\nwould tell differently; and of those who heard about it later,\r\neach had a different idea. But I am going to tell you what\r\nJohannes saw and heard--heard quite as clearly as you have seen\r\nand heard the members of your own household, today.\r\n\r\nHe saw his Brother's face, pale and illumined, as if his head\r\nwere shone upon by beams of clearest sunlight. And the sadness\r\nof that face was so deep and unutterable, so bitter and yet so\r\ngentle, that Johannes felt forced, through pain, to press both\r\nhands upon his heart, and to set his teeth, while he gazed with\r\nwide, tear-filled eyes, forgetting everything save that shining\r\nface so full of grief.\r\n\r\nFor a time it was as still as death, while man and priest\r\nregarded each other. At last the man spoke, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, and in whose name are you here?\"\r\n\r\nWhen two men stand thus, face to face, and address each other\r\nwith all earnestness in the hearing of many others, one of them\r\nis always immediately recognized to be the superior--even if\r\nthe listeners are unable to gauge the force of the argument.\r\nEvery one feels that superiority, although later many forget\r\nor deny it. If that dominance is not very great, it arouses\r\nspitefulness and fury; but if it is indeed great, it brings,\r\nbetimes, repose and submissiveness.\r\n\r\nIn this case the ascendency was so great that the priest lost\r\neven the air of authority and assurance with which he had\r\ncome forward, and did that for which, later, he reproached\r\nhimself--he stopped to explain:\r\n\r\n\"I am a consecrated priest of the Triune God, and I speak in\r\nthe name of our Lord Jesus Christ--our Saviour and Redeemer.\"\r\n\r\nThere ensued a long silence, and Johannes saw nothing but the\r\nshining, human face and the eyes, which, full of sorrow and\r\ncompassion, continued to regard the richly robed priest with a\r\nbitter smile. The priest stood motionless, with hanging hands\r\nand staring eyes, as if uncertain what next to say or do; but\r\nhe listened silently for what was coming, as did Johannes and\r\nall the others in the church--as if under an overpowering spell.\r\n\r\nThen came the following words, and so long as they sounded no\r\none could think of anything else--neither of the humble garb of\r\nhim who spoke, nor of the incomprehensible subjection of his\r\ngorgeously arrayed listener:\r\n\r\n\"But you are not yet a man!

It snapped off like\r\nglass, and he threw it on the marble floor at the feet of the\r\npriest. The fragment broke into many bits. It was apparently\r\nnot wood, but plaster.\r\n\r\n\"Sacrilege!\" cried the priest, in a stifled voice, as if\r\nthe sound were wrung from his throat. His eyes seemed to be\r\nstarting out of his great purple face.\r\n\r\nThe man quietly replied:\r\n\r\n\"No, but my right; for you are the sacrilegist and the\r\nblasphemer who makes of the Son of man a hideous caricature.\"\r\n\r\nThen the priest stepped forward, and gripped Markus by the\r\nwrist. The latter made no resistance, but cried in a loud voice\r\nthat reverberated through the church:\r\n\r\n\"Do your work, Caiaphas!\"\r\n\r\nAfter that he suffered himself to be led away to the sacristy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Image in the Forum\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT BUCHANAN\r\n\r\n(English novelist and dramatist, 1814-1901)\r\n\r\n    Not Baal, but Christus-Jingo!

Jesus has been held\r\nfor examination as to his sanity)\r\n\r\n\"Does he often have those whims, Johannes,\" asked Dr. Cijfer,\r\n\"when he will not speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has no whims,\" said Johannes, stoutly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, will he not reply?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you would not answer me,\" returned Johannes, \"if I\r\nwere to ask you if you were mad.\"\r\n\r\nThe two learned men exchanged smiles.\r\n\r\n\"That is a somewhat different situation,\" said Bommeldoos,\r\nhaughtily.\r\n\r\n\"He was not questioned in such a blunt manner as that,\"\r\nexplained Doctor Cijfer. \"I asked about his extraction, his\r\nage, the health of his father and mother, about his own youth,\r\nand so forth--the usual memory promptings. Will you not give\r\nus some further information concerning him? Remember, it is of\r\nreal importance to your brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mijnheer,\" said Johannes, \"I know as little as yourself about\r\nall that....\"\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door. The nurse came and said, \"Here\r\nis the patient.\" Then he let Markus in....\r\n\r\nMarkus had on a dark-blue linen blouse, such as all the\r\npatients of the working-class wear. He stood tall and erect,\r\nand Johannes observed that his face was less pale and sad than\r\nusual. The blue became his dark curling hair, and Johannes felt\r\nhappy and confident as he looked at him--standing there so\r\nproud and calm and handsome.\r\n\r\n\"Take a seat,\" said Dr. Cijfer.\r\n\r\nBut Markus seemed not to have heard, and remained standing,\r\nwhile he nodded kindly and reassuringly to Johannes.\r\n\r\n\"Observe his pride,\" said Professor Bommeldoos, in Latin to Dr.\r\nCijfer.\r\n\r\n\"The proud find pride, and the gloomy, gloom; but the glad find\r\ngladness, and the lowly, humility,\" said Markus.\r\n\r\nDr. Cijfer stood up, and took his measuring instrument from the\r\ntable. Then, in a quiet, courteous tone, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Will you not permit us, Mijnheer, to take your head measure?\r\nIt is for a scientific purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"It gives no pain,\" added Bommeldoos.\r\n\r\n\"Not to the body,\" said Markus.\r\n\r\nSaid Dr. Cijfer, \"There is nothing in it to offend one. I have\r\nhad it done to myself many a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a kind of opinionativeness and denseness that offend.\"\r\n\r\nBommeldoos flushed. \"Opinionativeness and denseness! Mine,\r\nperchance? Am I such an ignoramus? Opinionated and stupid!\"\r\n\r\n\"Colleague!\" exclaimed Dr. Cijfer, in gentle expostulation.\r\nAnd then, as he enclosed Markus's head with the shining\r\ncraniometer, he gave the measurement figures. A considerable\r\ntime passed, nothing being heard save the low voice of the\r\ndoctor dictating the figures. Then, as if proceeding with his\r\npresent occupation, taking advantage of what he considered a\r\ncompliant mood of the patient, the crafty doctor fancied he saw\r\nhis opportunity, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Your parents certainly dwelt in another country--one more\r\nsoutherly and more mountainous.\"\r\n\r\nBut Markus removed the doctor's hand, with the instrument, from\r\nhis head, and looked at him piercingly.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you not sincere?\" he then asked, with gentle stress.\r\n\"How can truth be found through untruth?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Cijfer hesitated, and then did exactly what Father Canisius\r\nhad done--something which, later, he was of the opinion he\r\nought not to have done: he argued with him.\r\n\r\n\"But if you will not give me a direct reply I am obliged to get\r\nthe truth circuitously.\"\r\n\r\nSaid Markus, \"A curved sword will not go far into a straight\r\nscabbard.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Bommeldoos grew impatient, and snapped at the doctor\r\naside, in a smothered voice: \"Do not argue, Colleague, do not\r\nargue! Megalomaniacs are smarter, and sometimes have subtler\r\ndialectic faculties than you have. Just let _me_ conduct the\r\nexamination.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, after a loud \"h'm! h'm!\" he said to Markus:\r\n\r\n\" ... Now just tell me, frankly, my friend, are you a prophet?\r\nAn apostle? Are you perhaps the King? Or are you God himself?\"\r\n\r\nMarkus was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you not answer now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am not being questioned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not being questioned! What, then, am I now doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Raving,\" said Markus.\r\n\r\nBommeldoos flushed, and lost his composure.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful, my friend. You must not be impertinent. Remember\r\nthat we may decide your fate here.\"\r\n\r\nMarkus lifted his head, with a questioning air, so earnest that\r\nthe professor held his peace.\r\n\r\n\"With whom rests the decision of our fate?\" asked Markus. Then,\r\npointing with his finger: \"Do you consider yourself the one to\r\ndecide?\"\r\n\r\nAfter that he uttered not a word. Dr. Cijfer questioned with\r\ngentle stress, Professor Bommeldoos with vehement energy; but\r\nMarkus was silent, and seemed not to notice that there were\r\nothers in the room.\r\n\r\n\"I adhere to my diagnosis, Colleague,\" said Bommeldoos.\r\n\r\nDr. Cijfer rang, and ordered the nurse to come.\r\n\r\n\"Take the patient to his ward again. He will remain, for the\r\npresent, under observation.\"\r\n\r\nMarkus went, after making a short but kindly inclination of the\r\nhead to Johannes.\r\n\r\n\"Will you not tell us now, Johannes, what you know of this\r\nperson?\" asked Dr. Cijfer.\r\n\r\n\"Mijnheer,\" replied Johannes, \"I know but little more of him\r\nthan you do yourself. I met him two years ago, and he is my\r\ndearest friend; but I have seen him rarely, and have never\r\ninquired about his life nor his origin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remarkable!\" exclaimed Dr. Cijfer.\r\n\r\n\"Once again, Colleague, I stand by my diagnosis,\" said\r\nBommeldoos. \"Initial paranoia, with megalomaniacal symptoms, on\r\nthe basis of hereditary inferiority, with vicarious genius.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ECCE HOMO\r\n\r\nCONSTANTIN MEUNIER\r\n\r\n(_Belgian sculptor, 1831-1905_)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DESPISED AND REJECTED OF MEN\r\n\r\nSIGISMUND GOETZE\r\n\r\n(_Contemporary German painter_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Swordless Christ\r\n\r\nBY PERCY ADAMS HUTCHISON\r\n\r\n(American poet, born 1875)\r\n\r\n\"_Vicisti Galilaee_\"\r\n\r\n    Ay, down the years behold he rides,\r\n      The lowly Christ, upon an ass;\r\n    But conquering?

Are the centuries a waste? Nigh\r\nupon two thousand years have gone since Thou didst walk the\r\nworld, and the face of things is not unchanged. In _Thy_ Name\r\nnow doth the Pharisee give alms in the street to the sound of a\r\ntrumpet going before him. In Thy Name now doth the Levite pass\r\nby on the other side when a man hath fallen among thieves. In\r\nThy Name now doth the lawyer lay on the poor burdens grievous\r\nto be borne. In Thy Name now doth the priest buy and sell the\r\nglad tidings of the kingdom, giving for the gospel of God\r\nthe commandments of men, living in rich men's houses, faring\r\nsumptuously every day, praying with his lips, \"Give us this day\r\nour daily bread,\" but saying to his soul, \"Soul, thou hast much\r\ngoods laid up for many years: take thine ease, eat, drink, and\r\nbe merry.\"\r\n\r\nDo men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Is it this\r\nThy gospel that yields that Thy fruit? Then will the master of\r\nthe vineyard come shortly and say, \"Cut it down; why cumbereth\r\nit the ground?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a Siberian Prison Church\r\n\r\n(_From \"Resurrection\"_)\r\n\r\nBY LEO TOLSTOY\r\n\r\n(See pages 88, 110, 148, 276)\r\n\r\nThe service began.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of the following. The priest, having dressed\r\nhimself up in a strange and very inconvenient garb of gold\r\ncloth, cut and arranged little bits of bread on a saucer and\r\nthen put most of them in a cup with wine, repeating at the same\r\ntime different names and prayers. Meanwhile the deacon first\r\nread Slavonic prayers, difficult to understand in themselves,\r\nand rendered still more incomprehensible by being read very\r\nfast; he then sang them turn and turn about with the convicts.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the service consisted in the supposition that\r\nthe bits of bread cut up by the priest and put into the wine,\r\nwhen manipulated and prayed over in a certain way, turned into\r\nthe flesh and blood of God.\r\n\r\nThese manipulations consisted in the priest, hampered by the\r\ngold cloth sack he had on, regularly lifting and holding up\r\nhis arms and then sinking to his knees and kissing the table\r\nand all that was on it; but chiefly in his taking a cloth by\r\ntwo of its corners and waving it rhythmically and softly over\r\nthe silver saucer and the golden cup. It was supposed that at\r\nthis point the bread and the wine turned into flesh and blood;\r\ntherefore this part of the service was performed with the\r\nutmost solemnity. And the convicts made the sign of the cross,\r\nand bowed, first at each sentence, then after every two, and\r\nthen after three; and all were very glad when the glorification\r\nended and the priest shut the book with a sigh of relief and\r\nretired behind the partition. One last act remained. The priest\r\ntook from a table a large gilt cross with enamel medallions\r\nat the ends, and came out into the center of the church with\r\nit. First the inspector came up and kissed the cross, then\r\nthe jailers, and then the convicts, pushing and jostling, and\r\nabusing each other in whispers. The priest, talking to the\r\ninspector, pushed the cross and his hand, now against the\r\nmouths and now against the noses of the convicts, who were\r\ntrying to kiss both the cross and the hand of the priest. And\r\nthus ended the Christian service, intended for the comfort and\r\nedification of these brothers who had gone astray.\r\n\r\nAnd none of these present, from the inspector down, seemed\r\nconscious of the fact that this Jesus, whose name the priest\r\nrepeated such a great number of times, whom he praised with\r\nall these curious expressions, had forbidden the very things\r\nthat were being done there; that he had not only prohibited\r\nthis meaningless much-speaking and the blasphemous incantation\r\nover the bread and wine, but had also, in the clearest words,\r\nforbidden men to call other men their master or to pray in\r\ntemples; had taught that every one should pray in solitude;\r\nhad forbidden to erect temples, saying that he had come to\r\ndestroy them, and that one should worship not in a temple, but\r\nin spirit and in truth; and, above all, that not only had he\r\nforbidden to judge, to imprison, to torment, to execute men, as\r\nwas done here, but had even prohibited any kind of violence,\r\nsaying that he had come to give freedom to the captives.\r\n\r\nNo one present seemed conscious that all that was going on here\r\nwas the greatest blasphemy, and a mockery of that same Christ\r\nin whose name it was being done. No one seemed to realize that\r\nthe gilt cross with the enamel medallions at the ends, which\r\nthe priest held out to the people to be kissed, was nothing but\r\nthe emblem of that gallows on which Christ had been executed\r\nfor denouncing just what was going on here. That these priests,\r\nwho imagined they were eating and drinking the body and blood\r\nof Christ in the form of bread and wine, did in reality eat\r\nand drink his flesh and his blood, only not as wine and bits\r\nof bread, but by ensnaring \"these little ones\" with whom he\r\nidentified himself, by depriving them of the greatest blessings\r\nand submitting them to most cruel torments, and by hiding from\r\nmen the tidings of great joy which he had brought--that thought\r\ndid not enter the mind of any one present.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore a Crucifix\r\n\r\nBY ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE\r\n\r\n(English poet of nature and liberty, 1837-1909)\r\n\r\n    Here, down between the dusty trees,\r\n      At this lank edge of haggard wood,\r\n    Women with labor-loosened knees,\r\n      With gaunt backs bowed by servitude,\r\n    Stop, shift their loads, and pray, and fare\r\n    Forth with souls easier for the prayer.\r\n\r\n    The suns have branded black, the rains\r\n      Striped gray this piteous God of theirs;\r\n    The face is full of prayers and pains,\r\n      To which they bring their pains and prayers;\r\n    Lean limbs that shew the laboring bones,\r\n    And ghastly mouth that gapes and groans.\r\n\r\n    God of this grievous people, wrought\r\n      After the likeness of their race,\r\n    By faces like thine own besought,\r\n      Thine own blind helpless, eyeless face,\r\n    I too, that have nor tongue nor knee\r\n    For prayer, I have a word to thee.\r\n\r\n    It was for this then, that thy speech\r\n      Was blown about the world in flame\r\n    And men's souls shot up out of reach\r\n      Of fear or lust or thwarting shame--\r\n    That thy faith over souls should pass\r\n    As sea-winds burning the grey grass?\r\n\r\n    It was for this, that prayers like these\r\n      Should spend themselves about thy feet,\r\n    And with hard overlabored knees\r\n      Kneeling, these slaves of men should beat\r\n    Bosoms too lean to suckle sons\r\n    And fruitless as their orisons?\r\n\r\n    It was for this, that men should make\r\n      Thy name a fetter on men's necks,\r\n    Poor men made poorer for thy sake,\r\n      And women withered out of sex?\r\n    It was for this, that slaves should be,\r\n    Thy word was passed to set men free?\r\n\r\n    The nineteenth wave of the ages rolls\r\n      Now deathward since thy death and birth.\r\n    Hast thou fed full men's starved-out souls?\r\n      Hast thou brought freedom upon earth?\r\n    Or are there less oppressions done\r\n    In this wild world under the sun?\r\n\r\n    Nay, if indeed thou be not dead,\r\n      Before thy terrene shrine be shaken,\r\n    Look down, turn usward, bow thine head;\r\n      O thou that wast of God forsaken,\r\n    Look on thine household here, and see\r\n    These that have not forsaken thee.\r\n\r\n    Thy faith is fire upon their lips,\r\n      Thy kingdom golden in their hands;\r\n    They scourge us with thy words for whips,\r\n      They brand us with thy words for brands;\r\n    The thirst that made thy dry throat shrink\r\n    To their moist mouths commends the drink....\r\n\r\n    O sacred head, O desecrate,\r\n      O labor-wounded feet and hands,\r\n    O blood poured forth in pledge to fate\r\n      Of nameless lives in divers lands,\r\n    O slain and spent and sacrificed\r\n    People, the grey-grown speechless Christ!\r\n\r\n    Is there a gospel in the red\r\n      Old witness of thy wide-mouthed wounds?\r\n    From thy blind stricken tongueless head\r\n      What desolate evangel sounds\r\n    A hopeless note of hope deferred?\r\n    What word, if there be any word?\r\n\r\n    O son of man, beneath man's feet\r\n      Cast down, O common face of man\r\n    Whereon all blows and buffets meet,\r\n      O royal, O republican\r\n    Face of the people bruised and dumb\r\n    And longing till thy kingdom come!...\r\n\r\n    The tree of faith ingraft by priests\r\n      Puts its foul foliage out above thee,\r\n    And round it feed man-eating beasts\r\n      Because of whom we dare not love thee;\r\n    Though hearts reach back and memories ache,\r\n    We cannot praise thee for their sake....\r\n\r\n    Nay, if their God and thou be one,\r\n      If thou and this thing be the same,\r\n    Thou shouldst not look upon the sun;\r\n      The sun grows haggard at thy name.\r\n    Come down, be done with, cease, give o'er;\r\n    Hide thyself, strive not, be no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII\r\n\r\n_The Church_\r\n\r\nContains passages, both of exhortation and

Tivoli--and gazed moodily up and down\r\nthe Strand.\r\n\r\nAs I have remarked elsewhere, I like the Strand. It is a very\r\nhuman place. But I own that the Strand lacks dignity and\r\nbeauty, and that amongst its varied odors the odor of sanctity\r\nis scarcely perceptible.\r\n\r\nThere are no trees in the Strand. The thoroughfare should be\r\nwider. The architecture is, for the most part, banal. For a\r\nchief street in a Christian capital, the Strand is not eloquent\r\nof high national ideals.\r\n\r\nThere are derelict churches in the Strand, and dingy, blatant\r\ntaverns, and strident signs and hoardings; and there are slums\r\nhard by.\r\n\r\nThere are thieves in the Strand, and prowling vagrants, and\r\ngaunt hawkers, and touts, and gamblers, and loitering failures,\r\nwith tragic eyes and wilted garments; and prostitutes plying\r\nfor hire.\r\n\r\nAnd east and west, and north and south of the Strand, there\r\nis London. Is there a man amongst all London's millions brave\r\nenough to tell the naked truth about the vice and crime, the\r\nmisery and meanness, the hypocrisies and shames of the great,\r\nrich, heathen city? Were such a man to arise amongst us and\r\nvoice the awful truth, what would his reception be? How would\r\nhe fare at the hands of the Press, and the Public--and the\r\nChurch?\r\n\r\nAs London is, so is England. This is a Christian country.\r\nWhat would Christ think of Park Lane, and the slums, and the\r\nhooligans? What would He think of the Stock Exchange, and the\r\nmusic hall, and the race-course? What would He think of our\r\nnational ideals? What would He think of the House of Peers, and\r\nthe Bench of Bishops, and the Yellow Press?\r\n\r\nPausing again, over against Exeter Hall, I mentally\r\napostrophize the Christian British people. \"Ladies and\r\nGentlemen,\" I say, \"you are Christians in name, but I discern\r\nlittle of Christ in your ideals, your institutions, or your\r\ndaily lives. You are a mercenary, self-indulgent, frivolous,\r\nboastful, blood-guilty mob of heathen. I like you very much,\r\nbut that is what you are. And it is you--_you_ who call men\r\n'Infidels.' You ridiculous creatures, what do you mean by it?\"\r\n\r\nIf to praise Christ in words, and deny Him in deeds, be\r\nChristianity, then London is a Christian city, and England is\r\na Christian nation. For it is very evident that our common\r\nEnglish ideals are anti-Christian, and that our commercial,\r\nforeign, and social affairs are run on anti-Christian lines.\r\n\r\nRenan says, in his _Life of Jesus_, that \"were Jesus to return\r\namongst us He would recognize as His disciples, not those who\r\nimagine they can compress Him into a few catechismal phrases,\r\nbut those who labour to carry on his work.\"\r\n\r\nMy Christian friends, I am a Socialist, and as such believe in,\r\nand work for, universal freedom, and universal brotherhood, and\r\nuniversal peace.\r\n\r\nAnd you are Christians, and I am an \"Infidel.\" Well, be it even\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE GOSPEL OF LUKE\r\n\r\nWhen he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,\r\nsaying, if thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy\r\nday, the things which belong unto thy peace!\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Bottom Up\r\n\r\nBY ALEXANDER IRVINE\r\n\r\n(The life-story of an Irish peasant lad, born 1863, who\r\nbecame in turn stableman, man-of-war's-man, slum-missionary,\r\nclergyman, and Socialist agitator)\r\n\r\nAfter some years' experience in missions and mission churches,\r\nI would find it very hard if I were a workingman living in a\r\ntenement not to be antagonistic to them; for, in large measure,\r\nsuch work is done on the assumption that people are poor and\r\ndegraded through laxity in morals. The scheme of salvation is\r\na salvation for the individual; social salvation is out of the\r\nquestion. Social conditions cannot be touched, because in all\r\nrotten social conditions, there is a thin red line which always\r\nleads to the rich man or woman who is responsible for them.\r\n\r\nComing in contact with these ugly social facts continuously,\r\nled me to this belief. It came very slowly; as did also the\r\nopinion that the missionary himself or the pastor, be he as\r\nwise as Solomon, as eloquent as Demosthenes, as virtuous as St.\r\nFrancis, has no social standing whatever among the people whose\r\nalms support the institutions, religious and philanthropic, of\r\nwhich he is the executive head. The fellowship of the saints is\r\na pure fiction, has absolutely no foundation in fact in a city\r\nlike New York except as the poor saints have it by themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE GOSPEL OF JOHN\r\n\r\nIf a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar:\r\nfor he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can\r\nhe love God whom he hath not seen?

This story\r\n has for its theme the failure of the Church in the face of modern\r\n social problems. In the following scene a rich man is rebuked by his\r\n pastor)\r\n\r\nThe perceptions of the banker were keen, and his sense of\r\nsecurity was brief. Somehow, as he met the searching eye of\r\nthe rector, he was unable to see the man as a visionary, but\r\nbeheld and,--to do him justice--felt a twinge of respect for\r\nan adversary worthy of his steel. He, who was accustomed\r\nto prepare for clouds when they were mere specks on his\r\nhorizon, paused even now to marvel why he had not dealt\r\nwith this. Here was a man--a fanatic, if he liked--but\r\nstill a man who positively did not fear him, to whom his\r\nwrath and power were as nothing! A new and startling and\r\ncomplicated sensation--but Eldon Parr was no coward. If he\r\nhad, consciously or unconsciously, formerly looked upon the\r\nclergyman as a dependent, Hodder appeared to be one no more.\r\nThe very ruggedness of the man had enhanced, expanded--as\r\nit were--until it filled the room. And Hodder had, with an\r\naudacity unparalleled in the banker's experience, arraigned by\r\nimplication his whole life, managed to put him on the defensive.\r\n\r\n\"But if that has become your philosophy,\" the rector\r\nsaid--\"that a man must look out for himself--what is it in you\r\nthat impels you to give these large sums for the public good?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should suppose that you, as a clergyman, might understand\r\nthat my motive is a Christian one.\"\r\n\r\nHodder sat very still, but a higher light came into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Parr,\" he replied, \"I have been a friend of yours, and I\r\nam a friend still. And what I am going to tell you is not only\r\nin the hope that others may benefit, but that your own soul\r\nmay be saved. I mean that literally--your own soul. You are\r\nunder the impression that you are a Christian, but you are not\r\nand never have been one. And you will not be one until your\r\nwhole life is transformed, until you become a different man.\r\nIf you do not change, it is my duty to warn you that sorrow\r\nand suffering, the uneasiness which you now know, and which\r\ndrive you on, in search of distraction, to adding useless sums\r\nof money to your fortune--this suffering, I say, will become\r\nintensified. You will die in the knowledge of it, and live on\r\nafter, in the knowledge of it.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of himself, the financier drew back before this\r\nunexpected blast, the very intensity of which had struck a\r\nchill of terror in his inmost being. He had been taken off his\r\nguard,--for he had supposed the day long past--if it had ever\r\nexisted--when a spiritual rebuke would upset him; the day long\r\npast when a minister _could_ pronounce one with any force. That\r\nthe Church should ever again presume to take herself seriously\r\nhad never occurred to him. And yet--the man had denounced\r\nhim in a moment of depression, of nervous irritation and\r\nexasperation against a government which had begun to interfere\r\nwith the sacred liberty of its citizens, against political\r\nagitators who had spurred that government on. The world was\r\nmad. No element, it seemed, was now content to remain in its\r\nproper place. His voice, as he answered, shook with rage,--all\r\nthe greater because the undaunted sternness by which it was\r\nconfronted seemed to reduce it to futility.\r\n\r\n\"Take care!\" he cried, \"take care! You, nor any other man,\r\nclergyman or no clergyman, have any right to be the judge of my\r\nconduct.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" said Hodder, \"if your conduct affects the\r\nwelfare, the progress, the reputation of the church of which I\r\nam rector, I have the right. And I intend to exercise it. It\r\nbecomes my duty, however painful, to tell you, as a member of\r\nthe Church, wherein you have wronged the Church and wronged\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't raise his tone, and there was in it more of sorrow\r\nthan of indignation. The banker turned an ashen gray.... A\r\nmoment elapsed before he spoke, a transforming moment. He\r\nsuddenly became ice.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he said. \"I can't pretend to account for these\r\nastounding views you have acquired--and I am using a mild term.\r\nLet me say this\" (he leaned forward a little, across the desk):\r\n\"I demand that you be specific. I am a busy man, I have little\r\ntime to waste, I have certain matters before me which must be\r\nattended to to-night. I warn you that I will not listen any\r\nlonger to vague accusations.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Hodder's turn to marvel. Did Eldon Parr, after all, have\r\nno sense of guilt? Instantaneously, automatically, his own\r\nanger rose.\r\n\r\n\"You may be sure, Mr. Parr, that I should not be here unless I\r\nwere prepared to be specific. And what I am going to say to you\r\nI have reserved for your ear alone, in the hope that you will\r\ntake it to heart while it is not yet too late, and amend your\r\nlife accordingly....\"\r\n\r\n(The clergyman tells the banker of lives that have been ruined\r\nby his financial dishonesties.)\r\n\r\n\"I am not talking about the imperfect code of human justice\r\nunder which we live, Mr. Parr,\" he cried. \"This is not a case\r\nin which a court of law may exonerate you, it is between\r\nyou and your God. But I have taken the trouble to find out,\r\nfrom unquestioned sources, the truth about the Consolidated\r\nTractions Company--I shall not go into the details at\r\nlength--they are doubtless familiar to you. I know that the\r\nlegal genius of Mr. Langmaid, one of my vestry, made possible\r\nthe organization of the company, and thereby evaded the plain\r\nspirit of the law of the state. I know that one branch line\r\nwas bought for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and\r\ncapitalized for three millions, and that most of the others\r\nwere scandalously over-capitalized. I know that while the\r\ncoming transaction was still a secret, you and other gentlemen\r\nconnected with the matter bought up large interests in other\r\nlines, which you proceeded to lease _to yourselves_ at\r\nguaranteed dividends which these lines do not earn. I know\r\nthat the first large dividend was paid out of capital. And the\r\nstock which you sold to poor Garvin was so hopelessly watered\r\nthat it never could have been anything but worthless. If, in\r\nspite of these facts, you do not deem yourself responsible for\r\nthe misery which has been caused, if your conscience is now\r\nclear, it is my duty to tell you that there is a higher bar of\r\njustice.\"\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the fire of the denunciation had, indeed,\r\na momentary yet visible effect in the banker's expression.\r\nWhatever the emotions thus lashed to self-betrayal, anger,\r\nhatred,--fear, perhaps, Hodder could not detect a trace of\r\npenitence; and he was aware, on the part of the other, of\r\na supreme, almost spasmodic effort for self-control. The\r\nconstitutional reluctance of Eldon Parr to fight openly could\r\nnot have been more clearly demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\"Because you are a clergyman, Mr. Hodder,\" he began, \"because\r\nyou are the rector of St. John's, I have allowed you to say\r\nthings to me which I would not have permitted from any other\r\nman. I have tried to take into account your point of view,\r\nwhich is naturally restricted, your pardonable ignorance of\r\nwhat business men, who wish to do their duty by Church and\r\nState, have to contend with. When you came to this parish you\r\nseemed to have a sensible, a proportional view of things; you\r\nwere content to confine your activities to your own sphere,\r\ncontent not to meddle with politics and business, which you\r\ncould, at first hand, know nothing about. The modern desire\r\nof clergymen to interfere in these matters has ruined the\r\nusefulness of many of them.\r\n\r\n\"I repeat, I have tried to be patient. I venture to hope,\r\nstill, that this extraordinary change in you may not be\r\npermanent, but merely the result of a natural sympathy with the\r\nweak and unwise and unfortunate who are always to be found in a\r\ncomplex civilization. I can even conceive how such a discovery\r\nmust have shocked you, temporarily aroused your indignation,\r\nas a clergyman, against the world as it is--and, I may add,\r\nas it has always been. My personal friendship for you, and my\r\ninterest in your future welfare impel me to make a final appeal\r\nto you not to ruin a career which is full of promise....\"\r\n\r\n\"I hinted to you awhile ago of a project I have conceived and\r\nalmost perfected of gifts on a much larger scale than I have\r\never attempted.\" The financier stared at him meaningly. \"And I\r\nhad you in mind as one of the three men whom I should consult,\r\nwhom I should associate with myself in the matter. We cannot\r\nchange human nature, but we can better conditions by wise\r\ngiving. I do not refer now to the settlement house, which I am\r\nready to help make and maintain as the best in the country,\r\nbut I have in mind a system to be carried out with the consent\r\nand aid of the municipal government, of playgrounds, baths,\r\nparks, places of recreation, and hospitals, for the benefit of\r\nthe people, which will put our city in the very forefront of\r\nprogress. And I believe, as a practical man, I can convince you\r\nthat the betterment which you and I so earnestly desire can be\r\nbrought about in no other way. Agitation can only result in\r\nanarchy and misery for all.\"\r\n\r\nHodder's wrath, as he rose from his chair, was of the sort\r\nthat appears incredibly to add to the physical stature,--the\r\nbewildering spiritual wrath which is rare indeed, and carries\r\nall before it.\r\n\r\n\"Don't tempt me, Mr. Parr!\" he said. \"Now that I know the\r\ntruth, I tell you frankly I would face poverty and persecution\r\nrather than consent to your offer. And I warn you once more not\r\nto flatter yourself that existence ends here, that you will\r\nnot be called to answer for every wrong act you have committed\r\nin accumulating your fortune, that what you call business\r\nis an affair of which God takes no account. What I say may\r\nseem foolishness to you, but I tell you, in the words of that\r\nFoolishness, that it will not profit you to gain the whole\r\nworld and lose your own soul. You remind me that the Church in\r\nold time accepted gifts from the spoils of war, and I will add\r\nof rapine and murder. And the Church today, to repeat your\r\nown parallel, grows rich with money wrongfully got. Legally?\r\nAh, yes, legally, perhaps. But that will not avail you. And\r\nthe kind of church you speak of--to which I, to my shame, once\r\nconsented--Our Lord repudiates. It is none of his. I warn you,\r\nMr. Parr, in his Name, first to make your peace with your\r\nbrothers before you presume to lay another gift on the altar.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this withering condemnation of himself Eldon Parr sat\r\nmotionless, his face grown livid, an expression on it that\r\ncontinued to haunt Hodder long afterwards. An expression,\r\nindeed, which made the banker almost unrecognizable.\r\n\r\n\"Go,\" he whispered, his hand trembling visibly as he pointed\r\ntowards the door. \"Go--I have had enough of this.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTrinity Church\r\n\r\nBY EDWIN DAVIES SCHOONMAKER\r\n\r\n(Contemporary American poet)\r\n\r\n    In vain she points her finger to the sky\r\n      And sends her voice along the famous street,\r\n      Admonishing how the mortal hours fleet\r\n    And bidding men bethink that they must die.\r\n    Tearing the coat of Christ they jostle by\r\n      And ply their gambling at her very feet.\r\n      \"Prepare, prepare, prepare thy God to meet!\"\r\n    She loudly calls.

The industrial conflicts make them realize how their\r\ninterests diverge from those of the commercial class. As that\r\nconsciousness increases, it becomes harder for the two classes\r\nto meet in the expression of Christian faith and love--in\r\nprayer meetings, for instance. When the Christian business man\r\nis presented as a model Christian, working people are coming\r\nto look with suspicion on these samples of our Christianity.\r\nI am not justifying that, but simply stating the fact. They\r\ndisapprove of the Christianity of the churches, not because it\r\nis too good, but because it is not good enough. The working\r\npeople are now developing the principle and practice of\r\nsolidarity, which promises to be one of the most potent ethical\r\nforces of the future, and which is essentially more Christian\r\nthan the covetousness and selfishness which we regard as the\r\nindispensable basis of commerce. If this is a correct diagnosis\r\nof our condition, is it strange that the Church is unable\r\nto evangelize a class alienated from it by divergent class\r\ninterests and class morality?\r\n\r\n\r\nTainted Wealth\r\n\r\nBY JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE\r\n\r\n(See page 298)\r\n\r\n    Capacious is the Church's belly;\r\n    Whole nations it has swallowed down,\r\n    Yet no dyspepsia 'neath its gown;\r\n    The Church alone, in jewels drest,\r\n    Your \"tainted wealth\" can quite digest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Collection\r\n\r\nBY ERNEST HOWARD CROSBY\r\n\r\n(American writer and social reformer, 1856-1907)\r\n\r\n I passed the plate in church.\r\n\r\n There was little silver, but the crisp bank-notes heaped themselves up\r\n high before me;\r\n\r\n And ever as the pile grew, the plate became warmer and warmer until it\r\n burned my fingers, and a smell of scorching flesh rose from it, and I\r\n perceived that some of the notes were beginning to smoulder and curl,\r\n half-browned, at the edges.\r\n\r\n And then I saw thru the smoke into the very substance of the money,\r\n and I beheld what it really was;\r\n\r\n I saw the stolen earnings of the poor, the wide margins of wages pared\r\n down to starvation;\r\n\r\n I saw the underpaid factory girl eking out her living on the street,\r\n and the overworked child, and the suicide of the discharged miner;\r\n\r\n I saw poisonous gases from great manufactories spreading disease and\r\n death; ...\r\n\r\n I saw hideousness extending itself from coal mine and foundry over\r\n forest and river and field;\r\n\r\n I saw money grabbed from fellow grabbers and swindlers, and underneath\r\n them the workman forever spinning it out of his vitals....\r\n\r\n I saw all this, and the plate burned my fingers so that I had to hold\r\n it first in one hand and then in the other; and I was glad when the\r\n parson in his white robes took the smoking pile from me on the chancel\r\n steps and, turning about, lifted it up and laid it on the altar.\r\n\r\n It was an old-time altar indeed, for it bore a burnt offering of flesh\r\n and blood--a sweet savor unto the Moloch whom these people worship\r\n with their daily round of human sacrifices.\r\n\r\n The shambles are in the temple as of yore, and the tables of the\r\n money-changers, waiting to be overturned.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY ÉMILE DE LAVELAYE\r\n\r\n(Belgian economist, 1822-1892)\r\n\r\nIf Christianity were taught and understood conformably to the\r\nspirit of its Founder, the existing social organism could not\r\nlast a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Voice of the Early Church\r\n\r\nBY CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA\r\n\r\n(Greek Church; 150-215)\r\n\r\nI know that God has given us the use of goods, but only as far\r\nas is necessary; and He has determined that the use be common.\r\nIt is absurd and disgraceful for one to live magnificently and\r\nluxuriously when so many are hungry.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY TERTULLIAN\r\n\r\n(Earliest of the Latin fathers; 155-222)\r\n\r\nAll is common with us except women.

Formerly a Jew, he deserted his nationality and with it\r\nhis former name, and called himself thereafter Paul. Paul was\r\nundeniably sincere. He believed that in reinterpreting the\r\nChristian faith so as to make it acceptable to the Romans he\r\nwas doing that faith a service. His make-up was imperial rather\r\nthan democratic. Both by birth and training he was unfitted to\r\nenter into the working-class consciousness of Galileans. He was\r\nin culture a Hellenist, in religion a Pharisee, in citizenship\r\na Roman. From the first strain, Hellenism, he received a bias\r\nin the direction of philosophy rather than economics; from the\r\nsecond, his Pharisaism, he received a bias toward aloofness,\r\notherworldliness; and from the third, his Romanism, he received\r\na bias toward political acquiescence and the preservation of\r\nthe status quo....\r\n\r\nPaul planned to make Christianity the religion of the Roman\r\nEmpire. It needed a religion badly. The catalogue of its\r\nvices, in the forepart of the Epistle to the Romans, is proof.\r\nPaul the Roman citizen saw nothing but excellence in Rome's\r\nworld-wide empire. Only, it must be redeemed from its laxity\r\nof morals. Therefore he would bring to it the Christ as its\r\ncleanser and thereby its perpetuator. It was the test of loyal\r\ncitizenship among the Romans to seek out in every part of the\r\nworld that which was most rare and valued, and bring it back\r\nto Rome as a gift. Thus her sons went forth and returned laden\r\nwith richest trophies to lay at her feet. They brought to her\r\npearls from India, gold chariots from Babylon, elephants from\r\ninterior Africa, high-breasted virgins from the Greek isles,\r\nPhidian marbles from Athens. Paul also would be a bringer of\r\ngifts to the Rome that had honored him and his fathers with the\r\nhigh honor of citizenship. And the gift he would bring and lay\r\nat her feet would be the richest of them all--a religion....\r\n\r\nPaul was a stockholder in Rome's world corporation. And that\r\nstock by slow degrees had blinded him to the injustice of\r\na social system in whose dividends he himself shared. This\r\nexplains in large part why he accepted the political status\r\nquo, and preached its acceptance by others. Students of ethics\r\nhave difficulty in reconciling Aristotle's defence of human\r\nservitude, \"slavery is a law of nature which is advantageous\r\nand just,\" with his insight and logic in other matters. The\r\ndifficulty resolves itself when it is recalled that Aristotle\r\npossessed thirteen slaves, and therefore had exactly thirteen\r\narguments for the righteousness of slavery. Seneca, gifted\r\nin other things with fine powers of moral philosophy, saw no\r\nmonstrousness in Nero that he should rebuke--Seneca was a\r\nfavorite with Nero, and was using that favoritism to amass\r\nan enormous fortune. Paul was too highly educated--using the\r\nterm in its academic sense--to be at one with the unbookish\r\nGalileans, and he was personally too much the gainer from\r\nRome's empire of privilege to share the insurrectionary spirit\r\nof the Son of Mary....\r\n\r\nPaul was under the spell of Rome's material greatness. His\r\nheart was secretly enticed by her triumphal arches, her\r\nliterature, her palaces on the Palatine, her baths, porticos of\r\nphilosophy, gymnasia, schools of rhetoric, her athletic games\r\nin the arena. He thought of her history, her jurisprudence,\r\nher military might, the starry names in her roll of glory, her\r\nsweep of empire from the Thames to the Tigris, and from the\r\nRhine to the deserts of Africa; and when, to this summary,\r\ncame the pleasant reflection that he was a part of this\r\nworld corporation, one of the privileged few to share in its\r\nprofits, it was not hard for him to find reasons to justify his\r\ndesertion of that poverty-stricken and fanatically democratic\r\nrace of Israel off there in unimportant Palestine.\r\n\r\nA true Roman, Paul preaches to the proletariat the duty of\r\npolitical passivity. To the Carpenter, with his splendid\r\nworldliness, the premier qualification for character was\r\nself-respect, and the alertness and mastery of environment\r\nwhich go with self-respect. But to Paul the primate virtue is\r\nsubmissiveness--\"the powers that be!\" He sought to cure the\r\nseditiousness of the working class by drawing off their gaze\r\nto a crown of righteousness reserved in heaven for them--a\r\ngaseous felicity beyond the stars. Israel, holding fast to\r\nthe enrichment of the present life, had kept its religion\r\nfrom getting off into fog lands, by seeking \"a city that hath\r\nfoundations.\" But Paul sought to hush all these \"worldly\" aims;\r\nhe wooed the toiling masses to desire \"a building of God, a\r\nhouse not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\" He was a\r\ntrue yoke-fellow of Pylades, the Roman play-actor, who, wishing\r\nto justify his usefulness to the master class, said to Augustus\r\nthat \"it was for the emperor's advantage that the people should\r\nhave their attention fixed on the playhouse rather than on\r\npolitics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface to \"Major Barbara\"\r\n\r\nBY G. BERNARD SHAW\r\n\r\n(See pages 193, 212, 263)\r\n\r\nChurches are suffered to exist only on condition that they\r\npreach submission to the State as at present capitalistically\r\norganized. The Church of England itself is compelled to add to\r\nthe thirty-six articles in which it formulates its religious\r\ntenets, three more in which it apologetically protests that the\r\nmoment any of these articles comes in conflict with the State\r\nit is to be entirely renounced, abjured, violated, abrogated\r\nand abhorred, the policeman being a much more important person\r\nthan any of the Persons of the Trinity. And this is why no\r\ntolerated Church nor Salvation Army can ever win the entire\r\nconfidence of the poor. It must be on the side of the police\r\nand the military, no matter what it believes or disbelieves;\r\nand as the police and the military are the instruments by\r\nwhich the rich rob and oppress the poor (on legal and moral\r\nprinciples made for the purpose), it is not possible to be on\r\nthe side of the poor and of the police at the same time. Indeed\r\nthe religious bodies, as the almoners of the rich, become a\r\nsort of auxiliary police, taking off the insurrectionary edge\r\nof poverty with coals and blankets, bread and treacle, and\r\nsoothing and cheering the victims with hopes of immense and\r\ninexpensive happiness in another world, when the process of\r\nworking them to premature death in the service of the rich is\r\ncomplete in this.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrince Hagen\r\n\r\nBY UPTON SINCLAIR\r\n\r\n (Prince Hagen, ruler of the Nibelungs, a race of gold-hoarding gnomes,\r\n comes up to visit the land of the earth-men, and study Christian\r\n civilization. He finds a number of ideas worth taking back to his\r\n underground home)\r\n\r\nPrince Hagen paused for a moment and puffed in silence; then\r\nsuddenly he remarked: \"Do you know that it is a very wonderful\r\nidea--that immortality? Did you ever think about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, the man who got that up was a world-genius. When\r\nI saw how it worked, it was something almost too much for\r\nme to believe; and still I find myself wondering if it can\r\nlast. For you know if you can once get a man believing in\r\nimmortality, there is no more left for you to desire; you can\r\ntake everything in the world he owns--you can skin him alive\r\nif it pleases you--and he will bear it all with perfect good\r\nhumor. I tell you what, I lie awake at night and dream about\r\nthe chances of getting the Nibelungs to believe in immortality;\r\nI don't think I can manage it, but it is a stake worth playing\r\nfor. I say the phrases over to myself--you know them all--'It\r\nis better to give than to receive'--'Lay not up for yourself\r\ntreasures on earth'--'Take no heed, saying what shall ye eat!'\r\nAs a matter of fact, I fancy the Nibelungs will prove pretty\r\ntough at reforming, but it is worth any amount of labor.\r\nSuppose I could ever get them to the self-renouncing point!\r\nJust fancy the self-renunciation of a man with a seventy-mile\r\ntunnel full of gold!\"\r\n\r\nPrince Hagen's eyes danced; his face was a study. I watched him\r\nwonderingly. \"Why do you go to all that bother?\" I demanded,\r\nsuddenly. \"If you want the gold, why don't you simply kill the\r\nNibelungs and take it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have thought of that,\" he replied; \"I might easily manage\r\nit all with a single revolver. But why should I kill the geese\r\nthat lay me golden eggs? I want not only the gold they have,\r\nbut the gold that they will dig through the centuries that are\r\nto come; for I know that the resources of Nibelheim, if they\r\ncould only be properly developed, would be simply infinite. So\r\nI have made up my mind to civilize the people and develop their\r\nsouls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain to me just how you expect to get their gold,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Just as the capitalist is getting it in New York,\" was the\r\nresponse. \"At present the Nibelungs hide their wealth; I mean\r\nto broaden their minds, and establish a system of credit.\r\nI mean to teach them ideals of usefulness and service, to\r\nestablish the arts and sciences, to introduce machinery\r\nand all the modern improvements that tend to increase the\r\ncentralization of power; I shall be master--just as I am\r\nhere--because I am the strongest, and because I am not a dupe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" I said; \"but all this will take a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"I know; it is the whole course of history\r\nto be lived over again. But there will be no mistakes and no\r\ngroping in this case, for I know the way, and I am king. It\r\nwill be a sort of benevolent despotism--the ideal form of\r\ngovernment, as I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are sure there is no chance of your plans failing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Failing!\" he laughed. \"You should have seen how they have\r\nworked so far.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have begun applying them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been down to Nibelheim twice since the death of dear\r\ngrandpa,\" said the prince. \"The first time, as you imagine,\r\nthere was tremendous excitement, for all Nibelheim knew what\r\na bad person I had been, and stood in terror of my return.\r\nI got them all together and told them the truth--that I had\r\nbecome wise and virtuous, that I meant to respect every man's\r\nproperty, and that I meant to consecrate my whole endeavor to\r\nthe developing of the resources of my native land. And then\r\nyou should have witnessed the scene! They went half wild with\r\nrejoicing; they fell down on their knees and thanked me with\r\ntears in their eyes: I played the _pater patriae_ in a fashion\r\nto take away your breath. And afterwards I went on to explain\r\nto them that I had discovered very many wonderful things\r\nup on the earth; that I was going to make a law forbidding\r\nany of them to go there, because it was so dangerous, but\r\nthat I myself was going to brave all the perils for their\r\nsakes. I told them about a wonderful animal that was called a\r\nsteam-drill, and that ate fire, and dug out gold with swiftness\r\nbeyond anything they could imagine. I said that I was going\r\nto empty all my royal treasure caves, and take my fortune and\r\nsome of theirs to the earth to buy a few thousand of these\r\nwonderful creatures; and I promised them that I would give them\r\nto the Nibelungs to use, and they might have twice as much gold\r\nas they would have dug with their hands, provided they would\r\ngive me the balance. Of course they agreed to it with shouts\r\nof delight, and the contracts were signed then and there.\r\nThey helped me get out all my gold, and I took them down the\r\nsteam-drills, and showed them how to manage them; so before\r\nvery long I expect to have quite a snug little income.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince\r\n\r\nBY NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI\r\n\r\n(Italian courtier, author of a famous treatise on statecraft:\r\n1469-1527)\r\n\r\nA prince has to have particular care that, to see and to hear\r\nhim, he appears all goodness, integrity, humanity and religion,\r\nwhich last he ought to pretend to more than ordinarily.

P. Dutton & Co.\r\n\r\nBY PATRICK MACGILL\r\n\r\n(See pages 32, 47, 122)\r\n\r\nNearly every second year the potatoes went bad; then we were\r\nalways hungry, although Farley McKeown, a rich merchant in the\r\nneighboring village, let my father have a great many bags of\r\nIndian meal on credit. A bag contained sixteen stone of meal\r\nand cost a shilling a stone. On the bag of meal Farley McKeown\r\ncharged sixpence a month interest; and fourpence a month on a\r\nsack of flour which cost twelve shillings. All the people round\r\nabout were very honest, and paid up their debts when they were\r\nable. Usually when the young went off to Scotland or England\r\nthey sent home money to their fathers and mothers, and with\r\nthis money the parents paid for the meal to Farley McKeown.\r\n\"What doesn't go to the landlord goes to Farley McKeown,\" was a\r\nGlenmornan saying.\r\n\r\nThe merchant was a great friend of the parish priest, who\r\nalways told the people if they did not pay their debts they\r\nwould burn for ever and ever in hell. \"The fires of eternity\r\nwill make you sorry for the debts that you did not pay,\" said\r\nthe priest. \"What is eternity?\" he would ask in a solemn voice\r\nfrom the altar steps. \"If a man tried to count the sands on\r\nthe sea-shore and took a million years to count every single\r\ngrain, how long would it take him to count them all? A long\r\ntime, you'll say. But that time is nothing to eternity. Just\r\nthink of it! Burning in hell while a man, taking a million\r\nyears to count a grain of sand, counts all the sand on the\r\nsea-shore. And this because you did not pay Farley McKeown his\r\nlawful debts, his lawful debts within the letter of the law.\"\r\nThat concluding phrase, \"within the letter of the law,\" struck\r\nterror into all who listened, and no one, maybe not even the\r\npriest himself, knew what it meant.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncantations\r\n\r\nBY MAX EASTMAN\r\n\r\n(Editor of \"The Masses,\" born 1883)\r\n\r\nI remember a vesper service at Ravello in Italy. I remember\r\nthat the exquisite and pathetically resplendent little chapel\r\nwas filled with ragged and dirty-smelling and sweet, sad-eyed\r\nmothers. Some carried in their arms their babies, some carried\r\nonly a memory in their haggard eyes. They were all poor.\r\nThey were all sad in that place. They were mothers. Mothers\r\nwrinkle-eyed, stooped, worn old, but yet gentle--O, so gentle\r\nand eager to believe that it would all be made up to them and\r\ntheir beloved in Heaven! I see their bodies swaying to the\r\nchant of meaningless long syllables of Latin magic, I see them\r\nworked upon by those dark agencies of candle, and minor chord,\r\nand incense, and the unknown tongue, and I see that this little\r\ndirt-colored coin clutched so tight in their five fingers is\r\ngoing to be given up, with a kind of desperate haste, ere the\r\nclimax of these incantations is past. Poor, anguished dupes of\r\nthe hope of Heaven, poor mothers, pinching your own children's\r\nbellies to fatten the wallets of those fat priests!\r\n\r\n\r\nExit Salvatore\r\n\r\nBY CLEMENT WOOD\r\n\r\n(American poet, born 1888)\r\n\r\n    Salvatore's dead--a gap\r\n      Where he worked in the ditch-edge, shovelling mud;\r\n    Slanting brow; a head mayhap\r\n      Rather small, like a bullet; hot southern blood;\r\n    Surly now, now riotous\r\n      With the flow of his joy; and his hovel bare,\r\n    As his whole life is to us--\r\n      A stone in his belly the whole of his share.\r\n\r\n    Body starved, but the soul secure,\r\n      Masses to save it from Purgatory,\r\n    And to dwell with the Son and the Virgin pure--\r\n               Lucky Salvatore!\r\n\r\n    Salvatore's glad, for see\r\n      On the hearse and the coffin, purple and black,\r\n    Tassels, ribbons, broidery\r\n      Fit for the Priest's or the Pope's own back;\r\n    Flowers costly, waxen, gay,\r\n      And the mates from the ditch-edge, pair after pair;\r\n    Dirging band, and the Priest to pray,\r\n      And the soul of the dead one pleasuring there.\r\n\r\n    Body starved, and the mind as well.\r\n      Peace--let him rot in his costly glory,\r\n    Cheated no more with a Heaven or Hell--\r\n                Exit Salvatore.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MICAH\r\n\r\nHear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and\r\nrulers of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert\r\nall equity.

A devout Catholic, he\r\n endeavored to reform the Church from within. The present novel created\r\n a tremendous sensation in Italy, and was placed upon the \"Index.\" In\r\n this scene \"the Saint\" pleads with the Pope)\r\n\r\n\"May I continue, Your Holiness?\"\r\n\r\nThe Pope, who while Benedetto had been speaking had kept his\r\neyes fixed on his face, now bowed his head slightly, in answer.\r\n\r\n\"The third evil spirit which is corrupting the Church does\r\nnot disguise itself as an angel of light, for it well knows\r\nit cannot deceive; it is satisfied with the garb of common,\r\nhuman honesty. This is the spirit of avarice. The Vicar of\r\nChrist dwells in this royal palace as he dwelt in his episcopal\r\npalace, with the pure heart of poverty. Many venerable pastors\r\ndwell in the Church with the same heart, but the spirit of\r\npoverty is not preached sufficiently, not preached as Christ\r\npreached it. The lips of Christ's ministers are too often\r\nover-complaisant to those who seek riches. There are those\r\namong them who bow the head respectfully before the man who has\r\nmuch, simply because he has much; there are those who let their\r\ntongues flatter the greedy, and too many preachers of the word\r\nand of the example of Christ deem it just for them to revel in\r\nthe pomp and honors attending on riches, to cleave with their\r\nsouls to the luxury riches bring. Father, exhort the clergy to\r\nshow those greedy for gain, be they rich or poor, more of that\r\ncharity which admonishes, which threatens, which rebukes. Holy\r\nFather!----\"\r\n\r\nBenedetto ceased speaking. There was an expression of fervent\r\nappeal in the gaze fixed upon the Pope.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" the Pontiff murmured.\r\n\r\nBenedetto spread wide his arms, and continued:\r\n\r\n\"The Spirit urges me to say more. It is not the work of a day,\r\nbut let us prepare for the day--not leaving this task to the\r\nenemies of God and of the Church--let us prepare for the day\r\non which the priests of Christ shall set the example of true\r\npoverty; when it shall be their duty to live in poverty, as it\r\nis their duty to live in chastity; and let the words of Christ\r\nto the Seventy-two serve them as a guide in this. Then the Lord\r\nwill surround the least of them with such honors, with such\r\nreverence as does not to-day exist in the hearts of the people\r\nfor the princes of the Church. They will be few in number, but\r\nthey will be the light of the world. Holy Father, are they that\r\nto-day? Some among them are, but the majority shed neither\r\nlight nor darkness.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point the Pontiff for the first time bowed his head in\r\nsorrowful acquiescence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Rome\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT BUCHANAN\r\n\r\n(See page 367)\r\n\r\n    A thousand starve, a few are fed,\r\n      Legions of robbers rack the poor,\r\n    The rich man steals the widow's bread,\r\n      And Lazarus dies at Dives' door;\r\n    The Lawyer and the Priest adjust\r\n    The claims of Luxury and Lust\r\n    To seize the earth and hold the soil,\r\n      To store the grain they never reap;\r\n    Under their heels the white slaves toil,\r\n      While children wail and women weep!--\r\n    The gods are dead, but in their name\r\n    Humanity is sold to shame,\r\n    While (then as now!) the tinsel'd Priest\r\n    Sitteth with robbers at the feast,\r\n    Blesses the laden blood-stain'd board,\r\n    Weaves garlands round the butcher's sword,\r\n    And poureth freely (now as then)\r\n    The sacramental blood of Men!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Priest and the Devil\r\n\r\nBY FÉODOR DOSTOYEVSKY\r\n\r\n(The Russian realist, 1821-1881, wrote this little story upon\r\nthe wall of his Siberian prison)\r\n\r\n\"Hello, you little fat father!\" the devil said to the priest.\r\n\"What made you lie so to those poor, misled people?

It is you that make them suffer\r\nthe pains of hell with which you threaten them. Don't you know\r\nthis? Well, then, come with me!\"\r\n\r\nThe devil grabbed the priest by the collar, lifted him high\r\nin the air, and carried him to a factory, to an iron foundry.\r\nHe saw the workmen there running and hurrying to and fro, and\r\ntoiling in the scorching heat. Very soon the thick, heavy air\r\nand the heat are too much for the priest. With tears in his\r\neyes, he pleads with the devil: \"Let me go! Let me leave this\r\nhell!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear friend, I must show you many more places.\" The\r\ndevil gets hold of him again and drags him off to a farm. There\r\nhe sees workmen threshing the grain. The dust and heat are\r\ninsufferable. The overseer carries a knout, and unmercifully\r\nbeats anyone who falls to the ground overcome by hard toil or\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\nNext the priest is taken to the huts where these same workers\r\nlive with their families--dirty, cold, smoky, ill-smelling\r\nholes. The devil grins. He points out the poverty and hardships\r\nwhich are at home here.\r\n\r\n\"Well, isn't this enough?\" he asks. And it seems as if even\r\nhe, the devil, pities the people. The pious servant of God can\r\nhardly bear it. With uplifted hands he begs: \"Let me go away\r\nfrom here. Yes, yes! This is hell on earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, you see.

M. Bondareff, a Siberian peasant and\r\nex-serf, at the age of sixty-seven)\r\n\r\nThey often arrest thieves in the world; but these culprits\r\nare rather rogues than thieves. I have laid hands on the real\r\nthief, who has robbed God and the church. He has stolen the\r\nprimal commandment which belongs to us who till the fields. I\r\nwill point him out. It is he who does not produce his bread\r\nwith his own hands, but eats the fruit of others' toil.\r\nSeize him and lead him away to judgment. All crimes such as\r\nrobberies, murders, frauds and the like arise from the fact\r\nthat this commandment is hidden from man. The rich do all they\r\ncan to avoid working with their hands, and the poor to rid\r\nthemselves of the necessity. The poor man says, \"There are\r\npeople who can live on others' labor; why should not I?\" and\r\nhe kills, steals and cheats in consequence. Behold now what\r\nharm can be done by white hands, more than all that good grimy\r\nhands can repair upon the earth! You spread out before the\r\nlaborer the idleness of your life, and thus take away the force\r\nfrom his hands. Your way of living is for us the most cruel\r\nof offences, and a shame withal. You are a hundred-fold more\r\nwise and learned than I am, and for that reason you take my\r\nbread. But because you are wise you ought rather to have pity\r\non me who am weak. It is said, \"Love thy neighbor as thyself.\"\r\nI am your neighbor, and you are mine. Why are we coarse and\r\nuntaught? Because we produce our own bread, and yours too! Have\r\nwe any time to study and educate ourselves? You have stolen our\r\nbrains as well as our bread by trickery and violence.\r\n\r\nHow blind thou art, O wise man; thou that readest the\r\nscriptures, and seest not the way in which thou mightest free\r\nthyself, and the flock committed to thee, from the burden of\r\nsin! Thy blindness is like unto that of Balaam, who, astride\r\nhis ass, saw not the angel of God armed with a sword of fire\r\nstanding in the way before him.

The hero\r\n is a Russian prince who in early youth seduces a peasant girl, and in\r\n after life meets her, a prostitute on trial for murder. He follows\r\n her to Siberia, in an effort to reclaim her. Near the end of his\r\n story Tolstoi introduces this scene. The Englishman may be said to\r\n represent modern science, which asks questions and accumulates futile\r\n statistics; while the old man voices the peculiar Christian Anarchism\r\n of the author, who at the age of eighty-two left his home and wandered\r\n out into the steppes to die)\r\n\r\nIn one of the exiles' wards, Nehlúdof [the prince] recognized\r\nthe strange old man he had seen crossing the ferry that\r\nmorning. This tattered and wrinkled old man was sitting on\r\nthe floor by the beds, barefooted, wearing only a dirty\r\ncinder-colored shirt, torn on one shoulder, and similar\r\ntrousers. He looked severely and inquiringly at the new-comers.\r\nHis emaciated body, visible through the holes in his dirty\r\nshirt, looked miserably weak, but in his face was more\r\nconcentrated seriousness and animation than even when Nehlúdof\r\nsaw him crossing the ferry. As in all the other wards, so here\r\nalso the prisoners jumped up and stood erect when the official\r\nentered; but the old man remained sitting. His eyes glittered\r\nand his brow frowned wrathfully.\r\n\r\n\"Get up!\" the inspector called out to him.\r\n\r\nThe old man did not rise, but only smiled contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"Thy servants are standing before thee, I am not thy servant.\r\nThou bearest the seal....\" said the old man, pointing to the\r\ninspector's forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Wha--a--t?\" said the inspector threateningly, and made a step\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n\"I know this man,\" said Nehlúdof. \"What is he imprisoned for?\"\r\n\r\n\"The police have sent him here because he has no passport.\r\nWe ask them not to send such, but they will do it,\" said the\r\ninspector, casting an angry side glance at the old man.\r\n\r\n\"And so it seems thou, too, art one of Antichrist's army?\" said\r\nthe old man to Nehlúdof.\r\n\r\n\"No, I am a visitor,\" said Nehlúdof.\r\n\r\n\"What, hast thou come to see how Antichrist tortures men?

He should have written those laws sooner.\"\r\n\r\nNehlúdof translated. The Englishman smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyhow, ask him how one should treat thieves and\r\nmurderers now?\"\r\n\r\nNehlúdof again translated the question.\r\n\r\n\"Tell him he should take the seal of Antichrist off from\r\nhimself,\" the old man said, frowning severely; \"then he will\r\nknow neither thieves nor murderers. Tell him so.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is crazy,\" said the Englishman, when Nehlúdof had\r\ntranslated the old man's words; and shrugging his shoulders he\r\nleft the cell.\r\n\r\n\"Do thine own task and leave others alone. Every one for\r\nhimself. God knows whom to execute, whom to pardon, but we do\r\nnot know,\" said the old man. \"Be your own chief, then chiefs\r\nwill not be wanted. Go, go,\" he added, frowning angrily, and\r\nlooking with glittering eyes at Nehlúdof, who lingered in\r\nthe ward. \"Hast thou not gazed enough on how the servants of\r\nAntichrist feed lice on men?

Go!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday\r\n\r\n(_From \"Challenge\"_)\r\n\r\nBY LOUIS UNTERMEYER\r\n\r\n(See pages 42, 418)\r\n\r\n    It was Sunday--\r\n    Eleven in the morning; people were at church--\r\n    Prayers were in the making; God was near at hand--\r\n    Down the cramped and narrow streets of quiet Lawrence\r\n    Came the tramp of workers marching in their hundreds;\r\n    Marching in the morning, marching to the grave-yard,\r\n    Where, no longer fiery, underneath the grasses,\r\n    Callous and uncaring, lay their friend and sister.\r\n    In their hands they carried wreaths and drooping flowers,\r\n    Overhead their banners dipped and soared like eagles--\r\n    Aye, but eagles bleeding, stained with their own heart's blood--\r\n    Red, but not for glory--red, with wounds and travail,\r\n    Red, the buoyant symbol of the blood of all the world.\r\n    So they bore their banners, singing toward the grave-yard,\r\n    So they marched and chanted, mingling tears and tributes,\r\n    So, with flowers, the dying went to deck the dead.\r\n\r\n          Within the churches people heard\r\n            The sound, and much concern was theirs--\r\n          God might not hear the Sacred Word--\r\n            God might not hear their prayers!\r\n\r\n          _Should such things be allowed these slaves--\r\n            To vex the Sabbath peace with Song,\r\n          To come with chants, like marching waves,\r\n            That proudly swept along._\r\n\r\n          _Suppose God turned to these--and heard!\r\n            Suppose He listened unawares--\r\n          God might forget the Sacred Word,\r\n            God might forget their prayers!_\r\n\r\n          And so (the tragic irony)\r\n            The blue-clad Guardians of the Peace\r\n          Were sent to sweep them back--to see\r\n            The ribald Song should cease;\r\n\r\n          To scatter those who came and vexed\r\n            God with their troubled cries and cares.\r\n          Quiet--so God might hear the text;\r\n            The sleek and unctuous prayers!\r\n\r\n    Up the rapt and singing streets of little Lawrence\r\n    Came the stolid soldiers; and, behind the bluecoats,\r\n    Grinning and invisible, bearing unseen torches,\r\n    Rode red hordes of anger, sweeping all before them.\r\n    Lust and Evil joined them--Terror rode among them;\r\n    Fury fired its pistols; Madness stabbed and yelled.\r\n    Through the wild and bleeding streets of shuddering Lawrence,\r\n    Raged the heedless panic, hour-long and bitter.\r\n    Passion tore and trampled; men once mild and peaceful,\r\n    Fought with savage hatred in the name of Law and Order.\r\n    And, below the outcry, like the sea beneath the breakers,\r\n    Mingling with the anguish, rolled the solemn organ....\r\n\r\n    Eleven in the morning--people were at church--\r\n    Prayers were in the making--God was near at hand--\r\n    It was Sunday!\r\n\r\n\r\nBY ISAIAH\r\n\r\nHear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto\r\nthe law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

To\r\nthese last, man has no economic needs; this world does not\r\ncount; it is merely a place of probation, mitigated sometimes,\r\nit is true, by ecclesiastical pomp and episcopal palaces;\r\nbut serving for the most part as a mere preparation for a\r\nfuture existence which will satisfy the aspirations of the\r\nhuman soul--the only thing that does count, in this world\r\nor the next.

OSBORNE WARD\r\n\r\n(American historian, who was forced to publish at his own\r\nexpense the results of his life-time researches into the early\r\nhistory of the working class)\r\n\r\nThe great strikes and uprisings of the working people of the\r\nancient world are almost unknown to the living age. It matters\r\nlittle how accounts of five immense strike-wars, involving\r\ndestruction of property and mutual slaughter of millions of\r\npeople, have been suppressed, or have otherwise failed to reach\r\nus; the fact remains that people are absolutely ignorant of\r\nthese great events. A meagre sketch of Spartacus may be seen\r\nin the encyclopedias, but it is always ruined and its interest\r\npinched and blighted by being classed with crime, its heroes\r\nwith criminals, its theme with desecration. Yet Spartacus was\r\none of the great generals of history; fully equal to Hannibal\r\nand Napoleon, while his cause was much more just and infinitely\r\nnobler, his life a model of the beautiful and virtuous, his\r\ndeath an episode of surpassing grandeur.\r\n\r\nStill more strange is it, that the great ten-years' war of\r\nEunus should be unknown. He marshalled at one time an army of\r\ntwo hundred thousand soldiers. He manœuvered them and fought\r\nfor ten full years for liberty, defeating army after army\r\nof Rome. Why is the world ignorant of this fierce, epochal\r\nrebellion? Almost the whole matter is passed over in silence by\r\nour histories of Rome. In these pages it will be read as news,\r\nyet should a similar war rage in our day, against a similar\r\ncondition of slavery, its cause would not only be considered\r\njust, but the combatants would have the sympathy and support of\r\nthe civilized world.\r\n\r\nThe great system of labor organization explained in these\r\npages must likewise be regarded as a chapter of news. The\r\nportentous fact has lain in abeyance century after century,\r\nwith the human family in profound ignorance of an organization\r\nof trades and other labor unions so powerful that for hundreds\r\nof years they undertook and successfully conducted the business\r\nof manufacture, of distribution, of purveying provisions to\r\narmies, of feeding the inhabitants of the largest cities in the\r\nworld, of inventing, supplying and working the huge engines of\r\nwar, and of collecting customs and taxes--tasks confided to\r\ntheir care by the state.\r\n\r\nOur civilization has a blushingly poor excuse for its profound\r\nignorance of these facts; for the evidences have existed from\r\nmuch before the beginning of our era.... They are growing fewer\r\nand dimmer as their value rises higher in the estimation of a\r\nthinking, appreciative, gradually awakening world.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgis\r\n\r\nBY PLUTARCH\r\n\r\n (Greek historian, A. D. 50-120; author of numerous biographical\r\n sketches. It has been said: He stands before us as the legate, the\r\n ambassador, and the orator on behalf of those institutions whereby the\r\n old-time men were rendered wise and virtuous)\r\n\r\nWhen the love of gold and silver had once gained admittance\r\ninto the Lacedæmonian commonwealth, it was quickly followed by\r\navarice and baseness of spirit in the pursuit of it, and by\r\nluxury, effeminacy and prodigality in the use. Then Sparta fell\r\nfrom almost all her former virtue and repute....\r\n\r\nFor the rich men without scruple drew the estate into their own\r\nhands, excluding the rightful heirs from their succession; and\r\nall the wealth being centered upon the few, the generality were\r\npoor and miserable. Honorable pursuits, for which there was\r\nno longer leisure, were neglected; the state was filled with\r\nsordid business, and with hatred and envy of the rich....\r\n\r\nAgis, therefore, believing it a glorious action, as in truth\r\nit was, to equalize and repeople the state, began to sound the\r\ninclinations of the citizens. He found the young men disposed\r\nbeyond his expectation; they were eager to enter with him upon\r\nthe contest in the cause of virtue, and to fling aside, for\r\nfreedom's sake, their old manner of life, as readily as the\r\nwrestler does his garment. But the old men, habituated and\r\nconfirmed in their vices, were most of them alarmed. These men\r\ncould not endure to hear Agis continually deploring the present\r\nstate of Sparta, and wishing she might be restored to her\r\nancient glory....\r\n\r\nAgis, nevertheless, little regarding these rumours, took the\r\nfirst occasion of proposing his measure to the council, the\r\nchief articles of which were these: That every one should be\r\nfree from their debts; all the lands to be divided into equal\r\nportions....\r\n\r\nThe people were transported with admiration of the young man's\r\ngenerosity, and with joy that, after three hundred years'\r\ninterval, at last there had appeared a king worthy of Sparta.\r\nBut, on the other side, Leonidas was now more than ever averse,\r\nbeing sensible that he and his friends would be obliged to\r\ncontribute with their riches, and yet all the honour and\r\nobligation would redound to Agis. [Sparta had two kings,\r\nLeonidas and Agis.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward, as the common people followed Agis,\r\nso the rich men adhered to Leonidas. They besought him not to\r\nforsake their cause; and with persuasions and entreaties so far\r\nprevailed with the council of Elders, whose power consisted in\r\npreparing all laws before they were proposed to the people,\r\nthat the designed measure was rejected, though but by one vote.\r\n\r\n[Attacked by his enemies, Agis sought refuge in a temple.]\r\nLeonidas proceeded also to displace the ephors, and to choose\r\nothers in their stead; then he began to consider how he\r\nmight entrap Agis. At first, he endeavored by fair means to\r\npersuade him to leave the sanctuary, and partake with him in\r\nthe kingdom. The people, he said, would easily pardon the\r\nerrors of a young man, ambitious of glory. But finding Agis was\r\nsuspicious, and not to be prevailed with to quit his sanctuary,\r\nhe gave up that design; yet what could not then be effected by\r\nthe dissimulation of an enemy, was soon after brought to pass\r\nby the treachery of friends.\r\n\r\nAmphares, Damochares, and Arcesilaus often visited Agis, and he\r\nwas so confident of their fidelity that after a while he was\r\nprevailed on to accompany them to the baths, which were not\r\nfar distant, they constantly returning to see him safe again\r\nin the temple. They were all three his familiars; and Amphares\r\nhad borrowed a great deal of plate and rich household stuff\r\nfrom the mother of Agis, and hoped if he could destroy her and\r\nthe whole family, he might peaceably enjoy those goods. And\r\nhe, it is said, was the readiest of all to serve the purposes\r\nof Leonidas, and being one of the ephors, did all he could to\r\nincense the rest of his colleagues against Agis. These men,\r\ntherefore, finding that Agis would not quit his sanctuary, but\r\non occasion would venture from it to go to the bath, resolved\r\nto seize him on the opportunity thus given them. And one day\r\nas he was returning, they met and saluted him as formerly,\r\nconversing pleasantly by the way, and jesting, as youthful\r\nfriends might, till coming to the turning of the street which\r\nled to the prison, Amphares, by virtue of his office, laid his\r\nhand on Agis, and told him, \"You must go with me, Agis, before\r\nthe other ephors, to answer for your misdemeanors.\" At the same\r\ntime Damochares, who was a tall, strong man, drew his cloak\r\ntight around his neck, and dragged him after by it, whilst the\r\nothers went behind to thrust him on. So that none of Agis'\r\nfriends being near to assist him, nor any one by, they easily\r\ngot him into the prison, where Leonidas was already arrived,\r\nwith a company of soldiers, who strongly guarded all the\r\navenues; the ephors also came in, with as many of the Elders as\r\nthey knew to be true to their party, being desirous to proceed\r\nwith some semblance of justice. And thus they bade him give\r\nan account of his actions. To which Agis, smiling at their\r\ndissimulation, answered not a word. Amphares told him it was\r\nmore seasonable for him to weep, for now the time was come in\r\nwhich he should be punished for his presumption. Another of the\r\nephors, as though he would be more favorable, and offering as\r\nit were an excuse, asked him whether he was not forced to what\r\nhe did by Agesilaus and Lysander. But Agis answered, he had not\r\nbeen constrained by any man, nor had any other intent in what\r\nhe did but to follow the example of Lycurgus, and to govern\r\nconformably to his laws. The same ephor asked him whether now\r\nat least he did not repent his rashness. To which the young man\r\nanswered that though he were to suffer the extremest penalty\r\nfor it, yet he could never repent of so just and glorious a\r\ndesign. Upon this they passed sentence of death on him, and\r\nbade the officers carry him to the Dechas, as it is called, a\r\nplace in the prison where they strangle malefactors. And when\r\nthe officers would not venture to lay hands on him, and the\r\nvery mercenary soldiers declined it, believing it an illegal\r\nand a wicked act to lay violent hands on a king, Damochares,\r\nthreatening and reviling them for it, himself thrust him into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nFor by this time the news of his being seized had reached many\r\nparts of the city, and there was a concourse of people with\r\nlights and torches about the prison gates, and in the midst of\r\nthem the mother and the grandmother of Agis, crying out with a\r\nloud voice that their king ought to appear, and to be heard and\r\njudged by the people. But this clamour, instead of preventing,\r\nhastened his death; his enemies fearing, if the tumult should\r\nincrease, he might be rescued during the night out of their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nAgis, being now at the point to die, perceived one of the\r\nofficers bitterly bewailing his misfortune. \"Weep not, friend,\"\r\nsaid he, \"for me, who die innocent, by the lawless act of\r\nwicked men. My condition is much better than theirs.\" As soon\r\nas he had spoken these words, not showing the least sign of\r\nfear, he offered his neck to the noose.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Labor Problem in Egypt\r\n\r\n(_From the Book of Exodus_)\r\n\r\n(Hebrew, B. C. Fourteenth Century; a record of one of the\r\nearliest of labor disputes)\r\n\r\nPharaoh said, \"Who is the Lord, that I should hearken unto his\r\nvoice to let Israel go? I know not the Lord, and moreover I\r\nwill not let Israel go.... Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron,\r\nloose the people from their work? get you unto your burdens....\r\nLet heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labour\r\ntherein; and let them not regard lying words.... Ye are idle,\r\nye are idle; therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to the\r\nLord. Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be\r\ngiven you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the officers of the children of Israel did see that they\r\nwere in evil case, when it was said, \"Ye shall not minish aught\r\nfrom your bricks, your daily task.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they\r\ncame forth from Pharaoh: and they said unto them, \"The Lord\r\nlook upon you and judge; because you have made our savour to\r\nbe abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his\r\nservants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, \"Lord, wherefore\r\nhast thou evil entreated this people?

One of the kings of Arabia, who was notorious\r\nfor his injustice, happened to come on a pilgrimage, and having\r\nperformed his devotions, he uttered the following words: \"The\r\npoor and the rich are servants of this earth, and those who are\r\nrichest have the greatest wants.\" He then looked towards me,\r\nand said, \"Because dervishes are strenuous and sincere in their\r\ncommerce with heaven, unite your prayers with mine, for I am in\r\ndread of a powerful enemy.\"\r\n\r\nI replied, \"Show mercy to the weak peasant, that you may not\r\nexperience difficulty from a strong enemy. It is criminal to\r\ncrush the poor and defenceless subjects with the arm of\r\npower. He liveth in dread who befriendeth not the poor; for\r\nshould his foot slip, no one layeth hold of his hand.

The story narrates how a peasant named Rensi was robbed\r\nof his asses by the henchmen of a certain grand steward. In\r\nspite of all threats the peasant persisted in appealing against\r\nthe robber to the grand steward himself. The scene is described\r\nin \"Social Forces and Religion in Ancient Egypt,\" by James\r\nHenry Breasted, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is a tableau which epitomizes ages of social history in the\r\nEast: on the one hand, the brilliant group of the great man's\r\nsleek and subservient suite, the universal type of the official\r\nclass; and, on the other, the friendless and forlorn figure\r\nof the despoiled peasant, the pathetic personification of the\r\ncry for social justice. This scene is one of the earliest\r\nexamples of that Oriental skill in setting forth abstract\r\nprinciples, so wonderfully illustrated later in the parables\r\nof Jesus. Seeing that the grand steward makes no reply, the\r\npeasant makes another effort to save his family and himself\r\nfrom the starvation which threatens them. He steps forward and\r\nwith amazing eloquence addresses the great man in whose hands\r\nhis case now rests, promising him a fair voyage as he embarks\r\non the canal, and voicing the fame of the grand steward's\r\nbenevolence, on which he had reckoned. 'For thou art the father\r\nof the orphan, the husband of the widow, the brother of the\r\nforsaken, the kilt of the motherless. Let me put thy name in\r\nthis land above every good law, O leader free from avarice,\r\ngreat man free from littleness, who destroys falsehood and\r\nbrings about truth. Respond to the cry which my mouth utters;\r\nwhen I speak, hear thou. Do justice, thou who art praised, whom\r\nthe praised praise. Relieve my misery. Behold me, I am heavy\r\nladen; prove me, lo I am in sorrow.'\"\r\n\r\nTo follow the account of the incident in other records, the\r\ngrand steward is so much pleased with the peasant's eloquence\r\nthat he goes to the king and tells him about it. \"My Lord, I\r\nhave found one of these peasants, excellent of speech, in very\r\ntruth; stolen are his goods, and he has come to complain to me\r\nof the matter.\"\r\n\r\nHis majesty says, \"As thou wishest that I may see health,\r\nlengthen out his complaint, without reply to any of his\r\nspeeches! He who desireth him to continue speaking should be\r\nsilent; behold, bring us his words in writing that we may\r\nlisten to them.\"\r\n\r\nSo he keeps the peasant pleading for many days. The story\r\nquotes nine separate speeches, of constantly increasing\r\nbitterness and pathos. The peasant is beaten by the servants of\r\nthe grand steward, but still he comes. \"Thou art appointed to\r\nhear causes, to judge two litigants, to ward off the robber.\r\nBut thou makest common cause with the thief.... Thou art\r\ninstructed, thou art educated, thou art taught--but not for\r\nrobbery. Thou art accustomed to do like all men, and thy kin\r\nare likewise ensnared. Thou the rectitude of all men, art the\r\nchief transgressor of the whole land. The gardener of evil\r\nwaters his domain with iniquity that his domain may bring forth\r\nfalsehood, in order to flood the estate with wickedness.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his eloquence, the grand steward remains unmoved.\r\nThe peasant appeals to the gods of Justice; and in the ninth\r\naddress he threatens to make his plea to the god Anubis, who\r\nis the god of the dead--meaning thereby that he will commit\r\nsuicide. None of the extant papyri informs us as to the outcome\r\nof the whole proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrayers Without Answer\r\n\r\n(_From The Iliad_)\r\n\r\nBY HOMER\r\n\r\n(Greek epic poet, B.C. 700?)\r\n\r\n    Prayers are Jove's daughters of celestial race,\r\n    Lame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face;\r\n    With homely mien and with dejected eyes,\r\n    Constant they follow where injustice flies.\r\n    Injustice, suave, erect, and unconfined,\r\n    Sweeps the wide earth, and tramples o'er mankind--\r\n    While prayers to heal her wrongs move slow behind.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Suffering of Women\r\n\r\nBY HERBERT SPENCER\r\n\r\n(English philosopher, 1820-1903)\r\n\r\nIn the history of humanity as written, the saddest part\r\nconcerns the treatment of women; and had we before us its\r\nunwritten history we should find this part still sadder. I\r\nsay the saddest part because there have been many things\r\nmore conspicuously dreadful--cannibalism, the torturing of\r\nprisoners, the sacrifice of victims to ghosts and gods--these\r\nhave been but occasionally; whereas the brutal treatment of\r\nwoman has been universal and constant. If looking first at\r\ntheir state of subjection among the semi-civilized we pass to\r\nthe uncivilized, and observe the lives of hardship borne by\r\nnearly all of them; if we then think what must have gone on\r\namong those still ruder peoples who, for so many thousands of\r\nyears roamed over the uncultivated earth; we shall infer that\r\nthe amount of suffering which has been and is borne by women is\r\nutterly beyond imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\nDivorce in Ancient Babylon\r\n\r\n(_From the Code of Hammurabi_)\r\n\r\n(B.C. 2250)\r\n\r\nAnu and Baal called me, Hammurabi, the exalted prince, the\r\nworshipper of the gods, to cause justice to prevail in the\r\nland, to destroy the wicked and evil, to prevent the strong\r\nfrom oppressing the weak, to enlighten the land and to further\r\nthe welfare of the people.

Hunter and dog\r\nentered the palace, and the dog howled so woefully that the\r\nroyal buildings shook with the sound to their very foundations.\r\nThe tyrant had the awe-inspiring hunter brought before his\r\nthrone and inquired after the cause of the terrible bark. The\r\nhunter said, \"The dog is hungry,\" whereupon the frightened\r\nking ordered food for him. All the food prepared at the royal\r\nbanquet disappeared rapidly in the dog's jaws, and still he\r\nhowled with portentous significance. More food was sent for,\r\nand all the royal store-houses were emptied, but in vain. Then\r\nthe tyrant grew desperate and asked: \"Will nothing satisfy the\r\ncravings of that woeful beast?\" \"Nothing,\" replied the hunter,\r\n\"nothing except perhaps the flesh of all his enemies.\" \"And\r\nwho are his enemies?\" anxiously asked the tyrant. The hunter\r\nreplied: \"The dog will howl as long as there are people\r\nhungry in the kingdom, and his enemies are those that practice\r\ninjustice and oppress the poor.\" The oppressor of the people,\r\nremembering his evil deeds, was seized with remorse, and for\r\nthe first time in his life he began to listen to the teachings\r\nof righteousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nature of Kings\r\n\r\n(_From the First Book of Samuel_)\r\n\r\n(Hebrew, B.C.

And he said: \"This will be the manner of\r\nthe king that shall reign over you; he will take your sons,\r\nand appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be\r\nhis horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. And he\r\nwill appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over\r\nfifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his\r\nharvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments\r\nof his chariots.

The maidens ground through\r\nmany years, they ground endless treasures; but at last they\r\ngrew weary. Then Frothi said, \"Grind on! Rest ye not, sleep ye\r\nnot, longer than the cuckoo is silent, or a verse can be sung.\"\r\nThe weary slaves ground on, till lo! from the mighty mill is\r\npoured forth an army of men.

It still cares very little,\r\nindeed, for what it cannot either put on or into itself. It\r\nis self-centred. Its fair votaries must be set up by the best\r\nman-milliner, and fed up by the best man-cook; and then,\r\nprovided they are known at the opera by their diamonds, in\r\nMayfair by their motors, and at Cowes by their yacht, nothing\r\nelse matters, especially if they happen to have a house at\r\nAscot and a launch at Henley for the racing weeks.\r\n\r\nIt is not so much persons as things that count in this age of\r\nmaterialism. Hence there is but one sin less pardonable than\r\nthat of being dull, and that is being poor. After all, there\r\nmay be some excuse for dulness if you have money, but there\r\nis simply none at all for poverty, which like dirt on one's\r\nshoes, or dust on one's gown, must be brushed away from sight\r\nas soon as possible. Not even poor relatives are tolerated or\r\nrecognized, except occasionally on an \"off-day,\" when, like\r\nsome unfortunate governesses in such households, they may be\r\nasked to look in at tea-time, when nobody is there. Surely\r\nall this is very contemptible, and altogether unworthy of old\r\nEnglish traditions. Yes, but old English traditions, with\r\nrare exceptions, are being swept away by the incoming tide\r\nof millionaire wealth, so that, nowadays, it matters little\r\nwhat you are, but much, nay, everything, what you have. If you\r\ncommand money, you command the world. If you have none, you are\r\nnobody, though you be a prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_From a leading London newspaper_)\r\n\r\nFather Vaughan's knotted lash is sharp, and he wields it\r\nsternly, but it does not raise one weal on the delicate flesh\r\nof these massaged and manicured Salomes and Phrynes. His scorn\r\nis savage, but it does not produce more than a polite smile\r\non these soft, faultless faces. His contempt is bitter, but\r\nit does not make a single modish harlot blush. They are dimly\r\namused by the excitement of the good man. They are not in the\r\nleast annoyed. They are, on the contrary, eager to ask him to\r\ndinner. What a piquant sensation to serve adultery with the\r\nsauce of asceticism!\r\n\r\nFather Vaughan says that if King Herod and Herodias and Salome\r\nwere to arrive in Mayfair they would be petted by the Smart\r\nSet. The good father, in the innocence of his heart, underacts\r\nthe role of Sa-vaughan-rola. Herod and Herodias and Salome\r\nhave arrived. They are here. We know them. We see them daily.\r\nTheir names are in the newspapers. They were at Ascot. They\r\nare present at the smartest weddings at St. George's, Hanover\r\nSquare. Do we despise them? Do we boycott them? Do we cut\r\nthem. By no means. We honor and reverence them.

By permission of Charles Scribner's Sons.\r\n\r\n(_From \"The House of Mirth\"_)\r\n\r\nBY EDITH WHARTON\r\n\r\n(Contemporary American novelist)\r\n\r\nThe environment in which Lily found herself was as strange\r\nto her as its inhabitants. She was unacquainted with the\r\nworld of the fashionable New York hotel--a world over-heated,\r\nover-upholstered, and overfitted with mechanical appliances\r\nfor the gratification of fantastic requirements, while the\r\ncomforts of a civilized life were as unattainable as in a\r\ndesert. Through this atmosphere of torrid splendor moved wan\r\nbeings as richly upholstered as the furniture, beings without\r\ndefinite pursuits or permanent relations, who drifted on a\r\nlanguid tide of curiosity from restaurant to concert-hall, from\r\npalm-garden to music-room, from \"art-exhibit\" to dressmaker's\r\nopening. High-stepping horses or elaborately equipped motors\r\nwaited to carry these ladies into vague metropolitan distances,\r\nwhence they returned, still more wan from the weight of their\r\nsables, to be sucked back into the stifling inertia of the\r\nhotel routine. Somewhere behind them in the background of\r\ntheir lives, there was doubtless a real past, peopled by real\r\nhuman activities: they themselves were probably the product of\r\nstrong ambitions, persistent energies, diversified contacts\r\nwith the wholesome roughness of life; yet they had no more real\r\nexistence than the poet's shades in limbo.\r\n\r\nLily had not been long in this pallid world without discovering\r\nthat Mrs. Hatch was its most substantial figure.... The daily\r\ndetails of her existence were as strange to Lily as its general\r\ntenor. The lady's habits were marked by an Oriental indolence\r\nand disorder peculiarly trying to her companion. Mrs. Hatch\r\nand her friends seemed to float together outside the bounds\r\nof time and space. No definite hours were kept; no fixed\r\nobligations existed: night and day floated into one another\r\nin a blur of confused and retarded engagements, so that one\r\nhad the impression of lunching at the tea-hour, while dinner\r\nwas often merged in the noisy after-theatre supper which\r\nprolonged Mrs. Hatch's vigil until daylight. Through this\r\njumble of futile activities came and went a strange throng of\r\nhangers-on--manicures, beauty-doctors, hair-dressers, teachers\r\nof bridge, of French, of \"physical development.\" ... Mrs. Hatch\r\nswam in a haze of indeterminate enthusiasms, of aspirations\r\nculled from the stage, the newspapers, the fashion-journals,\r\nand a gaudy world of sport still more completely beyond her\r\ncompanion's ken.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Parasitic Female\r\n\r\n(_From \"Woman and Labor\"_)\r\n\r\nBY OLIVE SCHREINER\r\n\r\n(In the preface to this book, it is explained that it is\r\nonly a faint sketch from memory of part of a great work, the\r\nmanuscript of which was destroyed during the Boer war)\r\n\r\nIn place of the active laboring woman, upholding society by her\r\ntoil, had come the effete wife, concubine or prostitute, clad\r\nin fine raiment, the work of others' fingers; fed on luxurious\r\nviands, the result of others' toil, waited on and tended by the\r\nlabor of others. The need for her physical labor having gone,\r\nand mental industry not having taken its place, she bedecked\r\nand scented her person, or had it bedecked and scented for\r\nher, she lay upon her sofa, or drove or was carried out in her\r\nvehicle, and, loaded with jewels, she sought by dissipations\r\nand amusements to fill up the inordinate blank left by the\r\nlack of productive activity. And the hand whitened and the\r\nframe softened, till at last, the very duties of motherhood,\r\nwhich were all the constitution of her life left her, became\r\ndistasteful, and, from the instant when her infant came damp\r\nfrom her womb, it passed into the hands of others, to be\r\ntended and reared by them; and from youth to age her offspring\r\noften owed nothing to her personal toil. In many cases so\r\ncomplete was her enervation, that at last the very joy of\r\ngiving life, the glory and beatitude of a virile womanhood,\r\nbecame distasteful; and she sought to evade it, not because of\r\nits interference with more imperious duties to those already\r\nborn of her, or to her society, but because her existence of\r\ninactivity had robbed her of all joy in strenuous exertion\r\nand endurance in any form. Finely clad, tenderly housed, life\r\nbecame for her merely the gratification of her own physical and\r\nsexual appetites, and the appetites of the male, through the\r\nstimulation of which she could maintain herself. And, whether\r\nas kept wife, kept mistress, or prostitute, she contributed\r\nnothing to the active and sustaining labors of her society.\r\nShe had attained to the full development of that type which,\r\nwhether in modern Paris or New York or London, or in ancient\r\nGreece, Assyria, or Rome, is essentially one in its features,\r\nits nature, and its results. She was the \"fine lady,\" the human\r\nfemale parasite--the most deadly microbe which can make its\r\nappearance on the surface of any social organism.\r\n\r\nWherever in the history of the past this type has reached its\r\nfull development and has comprised the bulk of the females\r\nbelonging to any dominant class or race, it has heralded its\r\ndecay. In Assyria, Greece, Rome, Persia, as in Turkey today,\r\nthe same material conditions have produced the same social\r\ndisease among the wealthy and dominant races; and again and\r\nagain, when the nation so affected has come into contact with\r\nnations more healthily constituted, this diseased condition has\r\ncontributed to its destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Market-Place\r\n\r\n(_From \"Beyond the Breakers\"_)\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE STERLING\r\n\r\n(California poet, born 1869)\r\n\r\n    In Babylon, high Babylon,\r\n      What gear is bought and sold?\r\n    All merchandise beneath the sun\r\n      That bartered is for gold;\r\n    Amber and oils from far beyond\r\n      The desert and the fen,\r\n    And wines whereof our throats are fond--\r\n      Yea! and the souls of men!\r\n\r\n    In Babylon, grey Babylon,\r\n      What goods are sold and bought?\r\n    Vesture of linen subtly spun,\r\n      And cups from agate wrought;\r\n    Raiment of many-colored silk\r\n      For some fair denizen,\r\n    And ivory more white than milk--\r\n      Yea! and the souls of men!...\r\n\r\n    In Babylon, sad Babylon,\r\n      What chattels shall invite?\r\n    A wife whenas your youth is done,\r\n      Or leman for a night.\r\n    Before Astarte's portico\r\n      The torches flare again;\r\n    The shadows come, the shadows go--\r\n      Yea! and the souls of men!\r\n\r\n    In Babylon, dark Babylon,\r\n      Who take the wage of shame?\r\n    The scribe and singer, one by one,\r\n      That toil for gold and fame.\r\n    They grovel to their masters' mood\r\n      The blood upon the pen\r\n    Assigns their souls to servitude--\r\n      Yea! and the souls of men!\r\n\r\n\r\nDinner à la Tango\r\n\r\nBY EDWIN BJÖRKMAN\r\n\r\n(American critic, born in Sweden 1866)\r\n\r\nIt is after eight o'clock in one of the smaller dining-rooms of\r\na fashionable New York hotel. The middle of the room is cleared\r\nfor dancing. At one end a small orchestra is working furiously\r\nat a melody that affects the mind like the triple-distilled\r\nessence of nervous unrest. Every table is occupied by merry\r\ngroups of men and women in evening dress. Above our heads are\r\nstrung almost invisible wires, to which are attached colored\r\nlanterns, gaudy mechanical butterflies, and huge red and green\r\ntoy balloons. Just as we enter, a stoutish, heavy-faced chap\r\nwith a monocle slaps the next man on the back and cries out:\r\n\r\n\"We must be gay, old boy!\"\r\n\r\nThe open square in the middle is filled with dancers. They trip\r\nand slide and dip. They side-step and back-step and gyrate.\r\nThey wave their arms like pump-handles, or raise them skyward,\r\npalm to palm, as if in prayer. There are among them young girls\r\nwith shining faces full of inarticulate desire; simpering\r\nyoung men with a leer lurking at the bottom of their vacant\r\nstares; stiff-legged and white-haired old men with drooping\r\neyelids; and stern-jawed matrons with hand-made faces of a\r\nstartling purple hue. But on every face, young or old, bright\r\nor dull, there beams a smile or clings a smirk, for the spirit\r\nof the place demands gaiety at any price.\r\n\r\nOn the tables are strewn gaily trimmed packages that open with\r\na report, and yield up gaily colored paper caps. Rubicund\r\ngentlemen place the caps over their bald spots, while women\r\npick the big butterflies to pieces, and put the fragments into\r\ntheir hair until they look like barbarous princesses. Men and\r\nwomen drink and dance, feast and flirt, sing and laugh and\r\nshout....\r\n\r\nGay is the scene indeed: gay the music and the laughter; gay\r\nthe wine that sparkles in the glasses; gay the swirling,\r\nswaying maze of dancing couples; gay the bright balloons and\r\nbrilliant dresses of the women. And it is as if my mind's eye\r\nsaw these words written in burning letters on the wall:\r\n\r\n         _Leave care behind, all ye that enter here!_\r\n\r\nBut out there on Fifth Avenue a lot of unkempt, unreasonable\r\nmen and women are marching savagely behind a black flag.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvils of Gold\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\n(See pages 181, 492)\r\n\r\n    O thou sweet king killer, and dear divorce\r\n    'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler\r\n    Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars;\r\n    Thou ever young, fresh, loved, and delicate wooer,\r\n    Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow\r\n    That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,\r\n    That solder'st close impossibilities,\r\n    And mak'st them kiss; that speak'st with every tongue,\r\n    To every purpose!

But dress has subtler and more far-reaching\r\npossibilities than this crude, first-hand evidence of\r\nwasteful consumption only. If, in addition to showing that\r\nthe wearer can afford to consume freely and uneconomically,\r\nit can also be shown in the same stroke that he or she is not\r\nunder the necessity of earning a livelihood, the evidence of\r\nsocial worth is enhanced in a very considerable degree. Our\r\ndress, therefore, in order to serve its purpose effectually,\r\nshould not only be expensive, but it should also make plain\r\nto all observers that the wearer is not engaged in any kind\r\nof productive labor. In the evolutionary process by which our\r\nsystem of dress has been elaborated into its present admirably\r\nperfect adaptation to its purpose, this subsidiary line of\r\nevidence has received due attention. A detailed examination\r\nof what passes in popular apprehension for elegant apparel\r\nwill show that it is contrived at every point to convey the\r\nimpression that the wearer does not habitually put forth\r\nany useful effort. It goes without saying that no apparel\r\ncan be considered elegant, or even decent, if it shows the\r\neffect of manual labor on the part of the wearer, in the way\r\nof soil or wear. The pleasing effect of neat and spotless\r\ngarments is chiefly, if not altogether, due to their carrying\r\nthe suggestion of leisure--exemption from personal contact\r\nwith industrial processes of any kind. Much of the charm\r\nthat invests the patent-leather shoe, the stainless linen,\r\nthe lustrous cylindrical hat, and the walking-stick, which\r\nso greatly enhance the native dignity of a gentleman, comes\r\nof their pointedly suggesting that the wearer cannot when so\r\nattired bear a hand in any employment that is directly and\r\nimmediately of any human use....\r\n\r\nThe dress of women goes even farther than that of men in the\r\nway of demonstrating the wearer's abstinence from productive\r\nemployment. It needs no argument to enforce the generalization\r\nthat the more elegant styles of feminine bonnets go even\r\nfarther towards making work impossible than does the man's\r\nhigh hat. The woman's shoe adds the so-called French heel\r\nto the evidence of enforced leisure afforded by its polish;\r\nbecause this high heel obviously makes any, even the simplest\r\nand most necessary manual work extremely difficult. The like\r\nis true even in a higher degree of the skirt and the rest of\r\nthe drapery which characterizes woman's dress. The substantial\r\nreason for our tenacious attachment to the skirt is just this:\r\nit is expensive and it hampers the wearer at every turn and\r\nincapacitates her for all useful exertion. The like is true of\r\nthe feminine custom of wearing the hair excessively long.\r\n\r\nBut the woman's apparel not only goes beyond that of the modern\r\nman in the degree in which it argues exemption from labor; it\r\nalso adds a peculiar and highly characteristic feature which\r\ndiffers in kind from anything habitually practiced by the men.\r\nThis feature is the class of contrivances of which the corset\r\nis the typical example. The corset is, in economic theory,\r\nsubstantially a mutilation, undergone for the purpose of\r\nlowering the subject's vitality and rendering her permanently\r\nand obviously unfit for work. It is true, the corset impairs\r\nthe personal attractions of the wearer, but the loss suffered\r\non that score is offset by the gain in reputability which comes\r\nof her visibly increased expensiveness and infirmity. It may\r\nbroadly be set down that the womanliness of woman's apparel\r\nresolves itself, in point of substantial fact, into the more\r\neffective hindrance to useful exertion offered by the garments\r\npeculiar to women.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vanity of Human Wishes\r\n\r\nBY SAMUEL JOHNSON\r\n\r\n(English essayist and poet, 1709-1784. The poem from which\r\nthese lines are taken is a paraphrase of the Roman poet Juvenal)\r\n\r\n    But, scarce observed, the knowing and the bold\r\n    Fall in the general massacre of gold;\r\n    Wide wasting pest! that rages unconfined,\r\n    And crowds with crimes the records of mankind;\r\n    For gold his sword the hireling ruffian draws,\r\n    For gold the hireling judge distorts the laws;\r\n    Wealth heaped on wealth, nor truth nor safety buys,\r\n    The dangers gather as the treasures rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters from a Chinese Official\r\n\r\nBY G. LOWES DICKINSON\r\n\r\n (This little book, published anonymously, was taken for a genuine\r\n document by many critics, among others, Mr. William Jennings Bryan,\r\n who wrote an elaborate answer to it. The writer is an English\r\n university lecturer)\r\n\r\nWhen I review my impressions of the average English citizen,\r\nimpressions based on many years' study, what kind of man do I\r\nsee? I see one divorced from Nature, but unreclaimed by Art;\r\ninstructed, but not educated; assimilative, but incapable\r\nof thought. Trained in the tenets of a religion in which he\r\ndoes not believe--for he sees it flatly contradicted in every\r\nrelation of life--he dimly feels that it is prudent to conceal\r\nunder a mask of piety the atheism he is hardly intelligent\r\nenough to avow. His religion is conventional; and, what is\r\nmore important, his morals are as conventional as his creed.\r\nCharity, chastity, self-abnegation, contempt of the world and\r\nits prizes--these are the words on which he has been fed from\r\nhis childhood upward. And words they have remained, for neither\r\nhas he anywhere seen them practiced by others, nor has it ever\r\noccurred to him to practice them himself. Their influence,\r\nwhile it is strong enough to make him a chronic hypocrite, is\r\nnot so strong as to show him the hypocrite he is. Deprived\r\non the one hand of the support of a true ethical standard,\r\nembodied in the life of the society of which he is a member,\r\nhe is duped, on the other, by lip-worship of an impotent\r\nideal. Abandoned thus to his instinct, he is content to do as\r\nothers do, and, ignoring the things of the spirit, to devote\r\nhimself to material ends. He becomes a mere tool; and of such\r\nyour society is composed. By your works you may be known. Your\r\ntriumphs in the mechanical arts are the obverse of your failure\r\nin all that calls for spiritual insight.\r\n\r\n\r\nStupidity Street\r\n\r\nBY RALPH HODGSON\r\n\r\n(Contemporary English poet, who publishes his work in tiny\r\npamphlets with quaint illustrations)\r\n\r\n    I saw with open eyes\r\n      Singing birds sweet\r\n    Sold in the shops\r\n      For the people to eat,\r\n    Sold in the shops of\r\n      Stupidity Street.\r\n\r\n    I saw in vision\r\n      The worm in the wheat;\r\n    And in the shops nothing\r\n      For people to eat;\r\n    Nothing for sale in\r\n      Stupidity Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Souls of Black Folk\r\n\r\nBY W. E. BURGHARDT DU BOIS\r\n\r\n(Professor in the University of Atlanta, born 1868; a prominent\r\nadvocate of the rights of his race)\r\n\r\nIn the Black World, the Preacher and Teacher embodied once\r\nthe ideals of this people,--the strife for another and a\r\njuster world, the vague dream of righteousness, the mystery of\r\nknowing; but today the danger is that these ideals, with their\r\nsimple beauty and weird inspiration, will suddenly sink to a\r\nquestion of cash and a lust for gold. Here stands this black\r\nyoung Atalanta, girding herself for the race that must be run;\r\nand if her eyes be still toward the hills and sky as in the\r\ndays of old, then we may look for noble running; but what if\r\nsome ruthless or wily or even thoughtless Hippomenes lay golden\r\napples before her? What if the negro people be wooed from a\r\nstrife for righteousness, from a love of knowing, to regard\r\ndollars as the be-all and the end-all of life? What if to the\r\nMammonism of America be added the rising Mammonism of the\r\nre-born South, and the Mammonism of this South be reinforced\r\nby the budding Mammonism of its half-awakened black millions?\r\nWhither, then, is the new-world quest of Goodness and Beauty\r\nand Truth gone glimmering?\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-operation and Nationality\r\n\r\nBY \"A.E.\" (GEORGE W. RUSSELL)\r\n\r\n(See page 252)\r\n\r\nWhen steam first began to puff and wheels go round at so\r\nmany revolutions per minute, the wild child humanity, who\r\nhad hitherto developed his civilization in picturesque\r\nunconsciousness of where he was going, and without any set\r\nplan, was caught and put in harness. What are called business\r\nhabits were invented to make the life of man run in harmony\r\nwith the steam engine, and his movements rival the train in\r\npunctuality. The factory system was invented, and it was an\r\ninstantaneous success. Men were clothed with cheapness and\r\nuniformity. Their minds grew numerously alike, cheap and\r\nuniform also. They were at their desks at nine o'clock, or at\r\ntheir looms at six. They adjusted themselves to the punctual\r\nwheels. The rapid piston acted as pacemaker, and in England,\r\nwhich started first in the modern race for wealth, it was an\r\nenormous advantage to have tireless machines of superhuman\r\nactivity to make the pace, and nerve men, women and children\r\nto the fullest activity possible. Business methods had a long\r\nstart in England, and irregularity and want of uniformity\r\nbecame after a while such exceptions that they were regarded as\r\ndeadly sins. The grocer whose supplies of butter did not arrive\r\nweek after week by the same train, at the same hour, and of the\r\nsame quality, of the same color, the same saltness, and in the\r\nsame kind of box, quarrelled with the wholesaler, who in his\r\nturn quarrelled with the producer. Only the most machine-like\r\nrace could win custom. After a while every country felt it had\r\nto be drilled or become extinct. Some made themselves into\r\nmachines to enter the English market, some to preserve their\r\nown markets. Even the indolent Oriental is getting keyed up,\r\nand in another fifty years the Bedouin of the desert will be at\r\nhis desk and the wild horseman of Tartary will be oiling his\r\nengines.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Communist Manifesto\r\n\r\nBY KARL MARX AND FREDERICK ENGELS\r\n\r\n(Published in 1848, the charter of the modern Socialist\r\nmovement)\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put\r\nan end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has\r\npitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound\r\nman to his \"natural superiors,\" and has left remaining no\r\nother nexus between man and man than naked self-interest,\r\nthan callous \"cash payment.\" It has drowned the most heavenly\r\necstasies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of\r\nphilistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical\r\ncalculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange\r\nvalue, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered\r\nfreedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom--Free\r\nTrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nPortrait of an American\r\n\r\nBY LOUIS UNTERMEYER\r\n\r\n(See pages 42, 418)\r\n\r\n    He slobbers over sentimental plays\r\n      And sniffles over sentimental songs.\r\n      He tells you often how he sadly longs\r\n    For the ideals of the dear old days.\r\n    In gatherings he is the first to raise\r\n      His voice against \"our country's shameful wrongs.\"\r\n      He storms at greed.

PIERPONT MORGAN\r\n\r\n(American banker; testimony before the United States Commission\r\non Industrial Relations)\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Do you consider ten dollars a week enough for a\r\n'longshoreman with a family to support?\r\n\r\nANSWER: If that's all he can get, and he takes it, I should say\r\nit's enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nImpressions\r\n\r\nBY HAROLD MONRO\r\n\r\n(Contemporary English poet)\r\n\r\n    He's something in the city. Who shall say\r\n      His fortune was not honorably won?\r\n    Few people can afford to give away\r\n      As he, or help the poor as he has done.\r\n\r\n    Neat in his habits, temperate in his life:\r\n      Oh, who shall dare his character besmirch?\r\n    He scarcely ever quarrels with his wife,\r\n      And every Sabbath strictly goes to church.\r\n\r\n    He helps the village club, and in the town\r\n      Attends parochial meetings once a week,\r\n    Pays for each purchase ready-money down:\r\n      Is anyone against him?--Who will speak?\r\n\r\n    There is a widow somewhere in the north,\r\n      On whom slow ruin gradually fell,\r\n    While she, believing that her God was wroth,\r\n      Suffered without a word--or she might tell.\r\n\r\n    And there's a beggar somewhere in the west,\r\n      Whose fortune vanished gradually away:\r\n    Now he but drags his limbs in horror lest\r\n      Starvation feed on them--or he might say.\r\n\r\n    And there are children stricken with disease,\r\n      Too ignorant to curse him, or too weak.\r\n    In a true portrait of him all of these\r\n      Must figure in the background--they shall speak.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Varieties of Sin\r\n\r\n(_From \"Sin and Society\"_)\r\n\r\nBY EDWARD ALSWORTH ROSS\r\n\r\n(American college professor, born 1866, a prominent advocate of\r\nacademic freedom)\r\n\r\nToday the sacrifice of life incidental to quick success rarely\r\ncalls for the actual spilling of blood. How decent are the\r\npale slayings of the quack, the adulterator, and the purveyor\r\nof polluted water, compared with the red slayings of the\r\nvulgar bandit or assassin! Even if there is blood-letting, the\r\nlong-range, tentacular nature of modern homicide eliminates\r\nall personal collision. What an abyss between the knife-play\r\nof brawlers and the law-defying neglect to fence dangerous\r\nmachinery in a mill, or to furnish cars with safety couplers!\r\nThe providing of unsuspecting passengers with \"cork\"\r\nlife-preservers secretly loaded with bars of iron to make up\r\nfor their deficiency in weight of cork, is spiritually akin\r\nto the treachery of Joab, who, taking Amasa by the beard \"to\r\nkiss him,\" smote Amasa \"in the fifth rib\"; but it wears a very\r\ndifferent aspect. The current methods of annexing the property\r\nof others are characterized by a pleasing indirectness and\r\nrefinement. The furtive, apprehensive manner of the till-tapper\r\nor the porch-climber would jar disagreeably upon the tax-dodger\r\n\"swearing off\" his property, or the city official concealing\r\na \"rake-off\" in his specifications for a public building. The\r\nwork of the card-sharp and the thimblerigger shocks a type of\r\nman that will not stick at the massive \"artistic swindling\" of\r\nthe contemporary promoter....\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that an exasperated public would sternly\r\ncastigate these modern sins. But the fact is, the very\r\nqualities that lull the conscience of the sinner blind the\r\neyes of the on-lookers. People are sentimental, and bastinado\r\nwrong-doing not according to its harmfulness, but according to\r\nthe infamy that has come to attach to it. Undiscerning, they\r\nchastise with scorpions the old authentic sins, but spare the\r\nnew. They do not see that boodling is treason, that blackmail\r\nis piracy, that embezzlement is theft, that speculation\r\nis gambling, that tax dodging is larceny, that railroad\r\ndiscrimination is treachery, that the factory labor of children\r\nis slavery, that deleterious adulteration is murder. It has not\r\ncome home to them that the fraudulent promoter \"devours widows'\r\nhouses,\" that the monopolist \"grinds the faces of the poor,\"\r\nthat mercenary editors and spellbinders \"put bitter for sweet\r\nand sweet for bitter.\" The cloven hoof hides in patent leather;\r\nand to-day, as in Hosea's time, the people \"are destroyed for\r\nlack of knowledge.\" The mob lynches the red-handed slayer,\r\nwhen it ought to keep a gallows Haman-high for the venal mine\r\ninspector, the seller of infected milk, the maintainer of a\r\nfire-trap theatre. The child-beater is forever blasted in\r\nreputation, but the exploiter of infant toil, or the concocter\r\nof a soothing syrup for the drugging of babies, stands a pillar\r\nof society. The petty shoplifter is more abhorred than the\r\nstealer of a franchise, and the wife-whipper is outcast long\r\nbefore the man who sends his over-insured ship to founder with\r\nits crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JACK LONDON\r\n\r\nFar better to have the front of one's face pushed in by the\r\nfist of an honest prize-fighter than to have the lining of\r\none's stomach corroded by the embalmed beef of a dishonest\r\nmanufacturer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTono-Bungay\r\n\r\nBY H. G. WELLS\r\n\r\n (English novelist, born 1866; author of many strange romances of\r\n modern science, and later, of penetrating studies of social injustice\r\n and hypocrisy. The present novel tells of the career of a financial\r\n potentate who begins life with a patent-medicine business)\r\n\r\nIt was my uncle's genius that did it. No doubt he\r\nneeded me--I was, I will admit, his indispensable right\r\nhand; but his was the brain to conceive. He wrote every\r\nadvertisement; some of them even he sketched. You must\r\nremember that his were the days before the _Times_\r\ntook to enterprise and the vociferous hawking of that\r\nantiquated _Encyclopædia_. That alluring, button-holing,\r\nlet-me-just-tell-you-quite-soberly-something-you-ought-to-know\r\nstyle of newspaper advertisement, with every now and then a\r\nconvulsive jump of some attractive phrase into capitals, was\r\nthen almost a novelty. \"Many people who are MODERATELY well\r\nthink they are QUITE well,\" was one of his early efforts. The\r\njerks in capitals were, \"DO NOT NEED DRUGS OR MEDICINE,\" and\r\n\"SIMPLY A PROPER REGIMEN TO GET YOU IN TONE.\" One was warned\r\nagainst the chemist or druggist who pushed \"much-advertised\r\nnostrums\" on one's attention. That trash did more harm than\r\ngood. The thing needed was regimen--and Tono-Bungay!\r\n\r\nVery early, too, was that bright little quarter column, at\r\nleast it was usually a quarter column in the evening papers:\r\n\"HILARITY--TONO-BUNGAY. Like Mountain Air in the Veins.\"\r\nThe penetrating trio of questions: \"Are you bored with your\r\nBusiness? Are you bored with your Dinner? Are you bored with\r\nyour Wife?\"--that, too, was in our Gower Street days. Both\r\nthese we had in our first campaign when we worked London south,\r\ncentral, and west; and then, too, we had our first poster,--the\r\nHEALTH, BEAUTY AND STRENGTH one. That was his design; I happen\r\nstill to have got by me the first sketch he made for it....\r\n\r\nBy all modern standards the business was, as my uncle would\r\nsay, \"absolutely _bona fide_.\" We sold our stuff and got the\r\nmoney, and spent the money honestly in lies and clamor to sell\r\nmore stuff. Section by section we spread it over the whole\r\nof the British Isles; first working the middle-class London\r\nsuburbs, then the outer suburbs, then the home counties,\r\nthen going (with new bills and a more pious style of \"ad\")\r\ninto Wales, a great field always for a new patent-medicine,\r\nand then into Lancashire. My uncle had in his inner office a\r\nbig map of England, and as we took up fresh sections of the\r\nlocal press and our consignments invaded new areas, flags\r\nfor advertisements and pink underlines for orders showed our\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\"The romance of modern commerce, George!\" my uncle would say,\r\nrubbing his hands together and drawing in air through his\r\nteeth. \"The romance of modern commerce, eh? Conquest. Province\r\nby Province. Like sogers.\"\r\n\r\nWe subjugated England and Wales; we rolled over the Cheviots\r\nwith a special adaptation containing eleven per cent. of\r\nabsolute alcohol; \"Tono-Bungay: Thistle Brand.\" We also had\r\nthe Fog poster adapted to a kilted Briton in a misty Highland\r\nscene....\r\n\r\nAs I look back at them now, those energetic years seem all\r\ncompacted to a year or so; from the days of our first hazardous\r\nbeginning in Farrington Street with barely a thousand pounds'\r\nworth of stuff or credit all told--and that got by something\r\nperilously like snatching--to the days when my uncle went to\r\nthe public on behalf of himself and me (one-tenth share) and\r\nour silent partners, the drug wholesalers and the printing\r\npeople and the owner of that group of magazines and newspapers,\r\nto ask with honest confidence for £150,000. Those silent\r\npartners were remarkably sorry, I know, that they had not taken\r\nlarger shares and given us longer credit when the subscriptions\r\ncame pouring in. My uncle had a clear half to play with\r\n(including the one-tenth understood to be mine).\r\n\r\n£150,000--think of it!--for the goodwill in a string of lies\r\nand a trade in bottles of mitigated water! Do you realize the\r\nmadness of the world that sanctions such a thing? Perhaps you\r\ndon't. At times use and wont certainly blinded me. If it had\r\nnot been for Ewart, I don't think I should have had an inkling\r\nof the wonderfulness of this development of my fortunes; I\r\nshould have grown accustomed to it, fallen in with all its\r\ndelusions as completely as my uncle presently did. He was\r\nimmensely proud of the flotation. \"They've never been given\r\nsuch value,\" he said, \"for a dozen years.\" But Ewart, with his\r\ngesticulating hairy hands and bony wrists, is single-handed\r\nchorus to all this as it plays itself over again in my memory,\r\nand he kept my fundamental absurdity illuminated for me during\r\nall this astonishing time.\r\n\r\n\"It's just on all fours with the rest of things,\" he remarked;\r\n\"only more so. You needn't think you're anything out of the\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMan the Reformer\r\n\r\nBY RALPH WALDO EMERSON\r\n\r\n(See page 235)\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to ask a few questions as to the progress\r\nof the articles of commerce from the fields where they grew,\r\nto our houses, to become aware that we eat and drink and\r\nwear perjury and fraud in a hundred commodities. We are all\r\nimplicated in this charge. The sins of our trade belong to\r\nno class, to no individual. Everybody partakes, everybody\r\nconfesses, yet none feels himself accountable. The trail of\r\nthe serpent reaches into all the lucrative professions and\r\npractices of man. Nay, the evil custom reaches into the whole\r\ninstitution of property, until our laws which establish and\r\nprotect it seem not to be the issue of love and reason, but of\r\nselfishness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a Certain Rich Young Ruler\r\n\r\nBY CLEMENT WOOD\r\n\r\n(A sonnet which was widely circulated at the time of the\r\nColorado coal-strike of 1913-14)\r\n\r\n    White-fingered lord of murderous events,\r\n      Well are you guarding what your father gained;\r\n      With torch and rifle you have well maintained\r\n    The lot to which a heavenly providence\r\n    Has called you; laborers, risen in defense\r\n      Of liberty and life, lie charred and brained\r\n      About your mines, whose gutted hills are stained\r\n    With slaughter of these newer innocents.\r\n\r\n    Ah, but your bloody fingers clenched in prayer!\r\n      Your piety, which all the world has seen!\r\n    The godly odor spreading through the air\r\n      From your efficient charity machine!\r\n    Thus you rehearse for your high rôle up there,\r\n      Ruling beside the lowly Nazarene!\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE POLITICS OF ARISTOTLE\r\n\r\n(See page 480)\r\n\r\nA tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to\r\nreligion.

LAWSON\r\n\r\n (Part of a statement before the United States Commission on Industrial\r\n Relations, 1915. The writer was the representative of the miners in\r\n charge of the Colorado strike, and went to work as a pit-boy at the\r\n age of eight)\r\n\r\nThere is another cause of industrial discontent. This is the\r\nskillful attempt that is being made to substitute Philanthropy\r\nfor Justice. There is not one of these foundations, now\r\nspreading their millions over the world in showy generosity,\r\nthat does not draw those millions from some form of industrial\r\ninjustice. It is not _their_ money that these lords of\r\ncommercialized virtue are spending, but the withheld wages of\r\nthe American working-class.\r\n\r\nI sat in this room and heard a great philanthropist read the\r\nlist of activities of his Foundation \"to promote the well-being\r\nof mankind.\" An international health commission to extend to\r\nforeign countries and peoples the work of eradicating the\r\nhookworm; the promotion of medical education and health in\r\nChina; the investigations of vice conditions in Europe; one\r\nhundred thousand dollars for the American Academy in Rome,\r\ntwenty thousand a year for widows' pensions in New York, one\r\nmillion for the relief of Belgians, thirty-four millions for\r\nthe University of Chicago, thirty-four millions for a General\r\nEducation Board. A wave of horror swept over me during that\r\nreading, and I say to you that that same wave is now rushing\r\nover the entire working-class of the United States. Health for\r\nChina, a refuge for birds in Louisiana, food for the Belgians,\r\npensions for New York widows, university training for the\r\nelect--and never a thought or a dollar for the many thousands\r\nof men, women and children who starved in Colorado, for the\r\nwidows robbed of husbands and children of their fathers, by\r\nlaw-violating conditions in the mines.

A story of the\r\n political leader of a corrupt city, who lies upon his death-bed, and\r\n has asked to have the meaning of his own career made plain to him)\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a kid were you, Boss?\" I began.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty tough, I guess,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Born here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; in the Third Ward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tough then as it is now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tougher,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Produces toughness the way Kansas produces corn,\" I remarked.\r\n\"Father?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Kept a saloon; a driver before that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother a girl of the ward?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"She was brought up there; but she came to this\r\ncountry with her father from England, as a baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of woman was she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quiet,\" he said; \"always still; silent-like; a worker. Kept\r\nthe old man straight--some; and me too--'s well as she could.\r\nShe's th' one that got him off th' wagon and started in th'\r\nliquor business.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were poor people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And common?\"\r\n\r\n\"Y-yes-s.\"\r\n\r\n\"A child of the people,\" I commented: \"the common people.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded, wondering.\r\n\r\n\"One of the great, friendless mass of helpless humanity?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"That wasn't your fault, was it?\" I said. \"Not to blame for\r\nthat? That's not your sin, is it?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, staring, and he was so mystified that I\r\nsaid that most people were \"pretty terribly punished for being\r\nborn poor and common.\" He nodded, but he wasn't interested or\r\nenlightened, apparently. \"And you learned, somehow, that the\r\nthing to do was to get yourself on, get up out of it, make a\r\nsuccess of your life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said slowly. \"I don't know how, but I did get that,\r\nsomehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was the ideal they taught you,\" I said. \"Never heard of\r\ngetting everybody on and making a success of society; of the\r\ncity and State?\"\r\n\r\nBut this line of questioning was beyond him. I changed my\r\ntack....\r\n\r\n\"In that first interview we had,\" I said, \"you insisted that,\r\nwhile the business boss was the real boss, the sovereign, you\r\nhad some power of your own. And you described it today as the\r\nbacking of your own ward, which, you said, you had in your\r\npocket. When you became boss, you got the backing, the personal\r\nsupport, of other wards, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seven of 'em,\" he counted. \"Made th' leaders myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you developed a big personal following in other wards,\r\ntoo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" he said; \"in every one of them. I was a popular leader;\r\nnot only a boss, but a friend with friends, lots of 'em. The\r\npeople liked me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the point,\" I said. \"The people liked you.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded warmly.\r\n\r\n\"The common people,\" I went on, and he was about to nod, but\r\nhe didn't. And his fingers became still. \"Your own people--the\r\ngreat helpless mass of the friendless mob--liked you.\" His eyes\r\nwere fixed on mine. \"They followed you; they trusted you.\"\r\n\r\nI paused a moment, then I asked: \"Didn't they, Boss?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said with his lips alone.\r\n\r\n\"They didn't set a watch on you, did they?\" I continued. \"They\r\nvoted as you bade them vote, elected the fellows you put on the\r\ntickets of their party for them. And, after they elected them,\r\nthey left it to them, and to you, to be true to them; to stick\r\nto them; to be loyal.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes fell to his fingers, and his fingers began again to\r\npick.\r\n\r\n\"And when your enemies got after you and accused you,\" I said,\r\n\"the people stuck by you?\"\r\n\r\nNo answer; only the fingers picked.\r\n\r\n\"The great, friendless mass--the hopeful, hopeless\r\nmajority--they were true to you and the party, and they\r\nre-elected you.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes were on mine again, and there was light in them; but\r\nit was the reflected light of fire, and it burned.\r\n\r\n\"And you--you betrayed them,\" I said; and I hurried on, piling\r\non the fuel, all I had. \"They have power, the people have,\r\nand they have needs, great common needs; and they have great\r\ncommon wealth. All your fat, rich franchises, all your great\r\nsocial values, the values added to land and franchise by the\r\npresence of the great, common, numerous mass, all the city's\r\npublic property--all are theirs, their common property. They\r\nown enough in common to meet all their great common needs, and\r\nthey have an organization to keep for them and to develop for\r\ntheir use and profit all these great needed social values. It\r\nis the city; the city government; city, State, and national.\r\nAnd they have, they breed in their own ranks, men like you,\r\nnatural political leaders, to go into public life and lead\r\nthem, teach them, represent them. And they leave it all to\r\nyou, trusting you. And you, all of you--not you alone, Boss,\r\nbut all of you: ward leaders; State leaders; all the national\r\npolitical bosses--you all betray them. You receive from them\r\ntheir votes, so faithfully given, and you transform them into\r\noffice-holders whom you teach or corrupt and compel to obey\r\nyou. So you reorganize the city government. You, not the Mayor,\r\nare the head of it; you, not the council, are its legislature;\r\nyou, not the heads of departments, are the administrators of\r\nthe property and the powers of the people of your city; the\r\ncommon, helpless, friendless people. And, having thus organized\r\nand taken over all this power and property and--this beautiful\r\nfaith, you do not protect their rights and their property.\r\nWhat do you do with it, Boss?\"\r\n\r\nHe started. He could not answer. I answered for him:\r\n\r\n\"You sell 'em out; you turn over the whole thing--the city,\r\nits property, and its people--to Business, to the big fellows;\r\nto the business leaders of the people. You deliver, not only\r\nfranchises, privileges, private rights and public properties,\r\nand values, Boss: you--all of you together--have delivered the\r\ngovernment itself to these men, so that today this city, this\r\nState, and the national government represent, normally, not the\r\npeople, not the great mass of common folk, who need protection,\r\nbut--Business; preferably bad business; privileged business; a\r\nclass; a privileged class.\"\r\n\r\nHe had sunk back among the pillows, his eyes closed, his\r\nfingers still. I sounded him.\r\n\r\n\"That's the system,\" I repeated. \"It's an organization of\r\nsocial treason, and the political boss is the chief traitor. It\r\ncouldn't stand without the submission of the people; the real\r\nbosses have to get that. They can't buy the people--too many of\r\nthem; so they buy the people's leaders, and the disloyalty of\r\nthe political boss is the key to the whole thing.\"\r\n\r\nThese was no response. I plumbed him again.\r\n\r\n\"And you--you believe in loyalty, Boss,\" I said--\"in being true\r\nto your own.\" His eyes opened. \"That's your virtue, you say,\r\nand you said, too, that you have practiced it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Ballad of Dead Girls\r\n\r\nBY DANA BURNET\r\n\r\n(American poet, born 1888)\r\n\r\n    Scarce had they brought the bodies down\r\n

the bar\r\n      And shivered where he stood.\r\n    \"You listen now to me,\" he cried,\r\n      \"Like business fellers should!\r\n\r\n    \"I've paid for all my hundred dead,\r\n      I've paid, I've paid, I've paid.\"\r\n    His ragged laughter rang, and died--\r\n      For he was sore afraid.\r\n\r\n    \"I've paid for wooden hall and stair,\r\n      I've paid to strain my floors,\r\n

bought,\r\n      The thing the System sold.\"\r\n\r\n    The District Leader filled a glass\r\n      With whiskey from the bar,\r\n    (The little silver counter where\r\n      He bought men's souls at par.)\r\n\r\n    And well he knew that he must give\r\n      The thing that he had sold,\r\n    Else men should doubt the System's word,\r\n      Keep back the System's gold.\r\n\r\n    The whiskey burned beneath his tongue:\r\n      \"A hundred women dead!\r\n    I guess the Boss can fix it up,\r\n      Go home--and hide,\" he said.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n

came\r\n      To search the sheeted dead;\r\n    And Horror strode the blackened walls.\r\n      Where Death had walked in red.\r\n\r\n    But Max Rogosky did not weep.\r\n      (He knew that tears

In the\r\n following scene she argues with a suffrage-worker, who has called upon\r\n her, in ignorance of her true character)\r\n\r\nThe woman's eyes were rapt, her hands tightly clenched, her\r\nlips parted, her cheeks a little flushed. But Victoria's face\r\nhad hardened suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Welkin,\" she said quietly, \"has anything struck you about\r\nthis house, about me?\"\r\n\r\nThe suffragist looked at her uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to know whom you are talking to,\" Victoria went on,\r\n\"I am a.... I am a what you would probably call ... well, not\r\nrespectable.\"\r\n\r\nA dull red flush spread over Miss Welkin's face, from the line\r\nof her tightly pulled hair to her stiff white collar; even her\r\nears went red. She looked away into a corner.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Victoria, \"it's a shock, isn't it? I ought not\r\nto have let you in.

Our cause is not the cause of\r\nrich women or poor women, of good women or bad; it's the cause\r\nof woman. Thus, it doesn't matter who she is, so long as there\r\nis a woman who stands aloof from us there is still work to do.\r\nI know that yours is not a happy life; and we are bringing the\r\nlight.\"\r\n\r\n\"The light!\" echoed Victoria bitterly. \"You have no idea, I\r\nsee, of how many people there are who are bringing the light\r\nto women like me.

There are\r\nalso many kindly souls who offer little jobs as charwomen to\r\nthose of us who are too worn out to pursue our calling; we\r\nare offered emigration as servants in exchange for the power\r\nof commanding a household; we are offered poverty for luxury,\r\nservice for domination, slavery to women instead of slavery to\r\nmen. How tempting it is!\" ...\r\n\r\nThe suffragist said nothing for a second.

Only portions of the poem could be printed in a work intended\r\n for general circulation in English; but even of these passages the\r\n editor will venture the assertion that never before has the horror of\r\n prostitution been so packed into human speech)\r\n\r\n    Hard by the docks, soon as the shadows fold\r\n    The dizzy mansion-fronts that soar aloft,\r\n    When eyes of lamps are burning soft,\r\n    The shy, dark quarter lights again its old\r\n    Allurement of red vice and gold.\r\n\r\n    Women, blocks of heaped, blown meat,\r\n    Stand on low thresholds down the narrow street,\r\n    Calling to every man that passes;\r\n    Behind them, at the end of corridors,\r\n    Shine fires, a curtain stirs\r\n    And gives a glimpse of masses\r\n    Of mad and naked flesh in looking-glasses.\r\n    Hard by the docks\r\n    The street upon the left is ended by\r\n    A tangle of high masts and shrouds that blocks\r\n    A sheet of sky;\r\n    Upon the right a net of grovelling alleys\r\n    Falls from the town--and here the black crowd rallies\r\n    And reels to rotten revelry.\r\n\r\n    It is the flabby, fulsome butcher's stall of luxury,\r\n    Time out of mind erected on the frontiers\r\n    Of the city and the sea.\r\n\r\n    Far-sailing melancholy mariners\r\n    Who, wet with spray, thru grey mists peer,\r\n    Cabin-boys cradled among the rigging, and they who steer\r\n    Hallucinated by the blue eyes of the vast sea-spaces,\r\n    All dream of it, evoke it when the evening falls;\r\n    Their raw desire to madness galls;\r\n    The wind's soft kisses hover on their faces;\r\n    The wave awakens rolling images of soft embraces;\r\n    And their two arms implore\r\n    Stretched in a frantic cry towards the shore.\r\n\r\n    And they of offices and shops, the city tribes,\r\n    Merchants precise, keen reckoners, haggard scribes,\r\n    Who sell their brains for hire, and tame their brows,\r\n    When the keys of desks are hanging on the wall,\r\n    Feel the same galling rut at even-fall,\r\n    And run like hunted dogs to the carouse.\r\n    Out of the depths of dusk come their dark flocks,\r\n    And in their hearts debauch so rudely shocks\r\n    Their ingrained greed and old accustomed care,\r\n    That they are racked and ruined by despair.\r\n\r\n    It is the flabby, fulsome butcher's stall of luxury,\r\n    Time out of mind erected on the frontiers\r\n    Of the city and the sea.\r\n\r\n    Come from what far sea-isles or pestilent parts?\r\n    Come from what feverish or methodic marts?\r\n    Their eyes are filled with bitter, cunning hate,\r\n    They fight their instincts that they cannot sate;\r\n    Around red females who befool them, they\r\n    Herd frenzied till the dawn of sober day.\r\n    The panelling is fiery with lewd art;\r\n    Out of the wall nitescent knick-knacks dart;\r\n    Fat Bacchuses and leaping satyrs in\r\n    Wan mirrors freeze an unremitting grin....\r\n\r\n    And women with spent loins and sleeping croups\r\n    Are piled on sofas and arm-chairs in groups,\r\n    With sodden flesh grown vague, and black and blue\r\n    With the first trampling of the evening's crew.\r\n    One of them slides a gold coin in her stocking;\r\n    Another yawns, and some their knees are rocking;\r\n    Others by bacchanalia worn out,\r\n    Feeling old age, and, sniffing them, Death's snout,\r\n    Stare with wide-open eyes, torches extinct,\r\n    And smooth their legs with hands together linked....\r\n\r\n    It is the flabby, fulsome butcher's stall of luxury,\r\n    Wherein Crime plants his knives that bleed,\r\n    Where lightning madness stains\r\n    Foreheads with rotting pains,\r\n    Time out of mind erected on frontiers that feed\r\n    The city and the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nFomá Gordyéeff\r\n\r\nBY MAXIM GORKY\r\n\r\n (Perhaps the most famous novel of the Russian writer, the life-story\r\n of the son of a prosperous merchant, a youth who wrecks himself in a\r\n vain search for some outlet for his energies, and at the end commits\r\n suicide)\r\n\r\n\"Where is the merchant to spend his energy? He cannot spend\r\nmuch of it on the Exchange, so he squanders the excess of his\r\nmuscular capital in drinking-bouts in _kabaky_; for he has\r\nno conception of other applications of his strength, which\r\nare more productive, more valuable to life. He is still a\r\nbeast, and life has already become to him a cage, and it is\r\ntoo narrow for him with his splendid health and predilection\r\nfor licentiousness. Hampered by culture, he at once starts to\r\nlead a dissolute life. The debauch of a merchant is always the\r\nrevolt of a captive beast. Of course this is bad. But, ah! it\r\nwill be worse yet, when this beast shall have gathered some\r\nsense and shall have disciplined it. Believe me, even then he\r\nwill not cease to create scandals, but they will be historical\r\nevents. For they will emanate from the merchant's thirst for\r\npower; their aim will be the omnipotence of one class, and the\r\nmerchant will not be particular about the means toward the\r\nattainment of this aim.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I to make use of my strength, since there is no\r\ndemand for it? I ought to fight with robbers, or turn a robber\r\nmyself. In general I ought to do something big. And that would\r\nbe done, not with the head, but with the arms and breast. While\r\nhere we have to go to the Exchange and try to aim well to make\r\na rouble. What do we need it for? And what is it, anyway? Has\r\nlife been arranged in this form forever? What sort of life is\r\nit, if everyone finds it too narrow for him? Life ought to be\r\naccording to the taste of man. If it is narrow for me; I must\r\nmove it asunder that I may have more room. I must break it\r\nand reconstruct it. But how? That's where the trouble lies!\r\nWhat ought to be done that life may be freer? That I don't\r\nunderstand, and that's all there is to it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVenus Pandemos\r\n\r\nBY RICHARD DEHMEL\r\n\r\n(Contemporary German poet, born 1863)\r\n\r\n    This was the last time. I was lounging in\r\n    The night-café that lights the suburb gloom,\r\n    Tired with the reek of sultry sofa plush,\r\n    And with my glowing toddy, and the steam\r\n    Of women sweating in their gowns: tired, lustful.\r\n\r\n    Clouds of tobacco smoke were wavering through\r\n    The laughter and the haggling cries and shrieks\r\n    Of painted women and the men they drew.\r\n    The rattling at the sideboard of the spoons\r\n    Cheered on the hubbub of the mart of love\r\n    Uninterrupted like a tambourine....\r\n\r\n    I was about to choose, when, where I sate,\r\n    The crimson curtain of the door was split,\r\n    And a fresh couple entered. A cold draught\r\n    Cut through the heated room, and some one swore;\r\n    But through the crowd the pair stepped noiselessly.\r\n    Over against me at the transverse end\r\n    Of the corridor, whence they could sweep the room,\r\n    They took their seats. The chandelier of bronze\r\n    Hung o'er them like an awning heavy, old.\r\n    And no one seemed to know the couple, but\r\n    At my right hand I heard a hoarse voice pipe:\r\n    \"I must have come across that pair before.\"\r\n\r\n    He sat quite still. The loud gray of the air\r\n    Almost recoiled before his callous brow,\r\n    Which wan as wax rose into his sparse hair.\r\n    His great pale eye-lids hung down deep and shut,\r\n    On both sides lay around his sunken nose\r\n    Their shadows, and through his thin beard shone the skin.\r\n    And only when the woman at his side,\r\n    Less tall than he, and of a lissom shape,\r\n    Hissed, giggling, in his ear some obscene word,\r\n    Half rose of one black eye the heavy lid,\r\n    And slowly round he turned his long, thin neck,\r\n    As when a vulture lunges at a corpse.\r\n\r\n    And silent and more silent grew the room;\r\n    All eyes were fixed upon the silent guest,\r\n    And on the woman squatted, strange to see.\r\n    \"She is quite young\"--a whispering round me went;\r\n    And with a child's greed she was drinking milk.\r\n    Yet almost old she seemed to me, whenever\r\n    Her tongue shot through a gap in her black teeth,\r\n    Her pointed tongue out of her hissing mouth,\r\n    While her gray, eager glance took in the room;\r\n    The gaslight in it shone like poisonous green.\r\n\r\n    And now she rose. He had not touched his glass;\r\n    A great coin lit the table. She went out;\r\n    He automatically followed her.\r\n    The crimson curtain round the door fell to,\r\n    Once more the cold draught shivered through the heat,\r\n    But no one cursed. Through me a shiver ran.\r\n\r\n    I did not choose a partner--suddenly\r\n    I knew them: it was Syphilis and Death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XI\r\n\r\n_War_\r\n\r\nPictures of a terrible evil, and denunciations of it, which\r\nwill be found especially timely at the present hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nI Sing the Battle\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Cry of Youth\"_)\r\n\r\nBY HARRY KEMP\r\n\r\n(See pages 37, 351)\r\n\r\n    I sing the song of the great clean guns that belch forth death at will.\r\n    Ah, but the wailing mothers, the lifeless forms and still!\r\n\r\n    I sing the songs of the billowing flags, the bugles that cry before.\r\n    Ah, but the skeletons flapping rags, the lips that speak no more!\r\n\r\n    I sing the clash of bayonets and sabres that flash and cleave.\r\n    And wilt thou sing the maimed ones, too, that go with pinned-up sleeve?\r\n\r\n    I sing acclaimèd generals that bring the victory home.\r\n    Ah, but the broken bodies that drip like honey-comb!\r\n\r\n    I sing of hearts triumphant, long ranks of marching men.\r\n    And wilt thou sing the shadowy hosts that never march again?\r\n\r\n\r\nWar\r\n\r\n(_From \"Beyond the Breakers\"_)\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE STERLING\r\n\r\n(See page 504)\r\n\r\n    The night was on the world, and in my sleep\r\n    I heard a voice that cried across the dark:\r\n    \"Give steel!\" And gazing I beheld a red,\r\n    Infernal stithy. There were Titans five\r\n    Assembled, thewed and naked and malign\r\n    Against the glare. One to the furnace throat,\r\n    Whence issued screams, fed shapes of human use--\r\n    The hammer, axe and plow. Those molten soon,\r\n    Another haled the dazzling ingot forth\r\n    With tongs, and gave it to the anvil. Two,\r\n    With massy sledges throbbing at the task,\r\n    Harried the gloom with unenduring stars\r\n    And poured a clangorous music on the dark,\r\n    With loud, astounding shock and counter-shock\r\n    Incessant. And the fifth colossus stood\r\n    The captain of that labor. From his form\r\n    Spread wings more black than Hell's high-altar--ribbed\r\n    As are the vampire-bat's. The night grew old,\r\n    And I was then aware they shaped a sword....\r\n\r\n    In that domain and interval of dream\r\n    'Twas dawn upon the headlands of the world,\r\n    And I, appalled, beheld how men had reared\r\n    A mountain, dark below the morning star--\r\n    A peak made up of houses and of herds,\r\n    Of cradles, yokes and all the handiwork\r\n    Of man. Upon its crest were gems and gold,\r\n    Rare fabrics, and the woof of humble looms.\r\n    Harvests and groves and battlements were made\r\n    Part of its ramparts, and the whole was drenched\r\n    With oil and wine and honey. Then thereon\r\n    Men bound their sons, the fair, alert and strong,\r\n    Sparing no household. And when all were bound,\r\n    Brands were brought forth: the mount became a pyre.\r\n    Black from that red immensity of flame,\r\n    A tower of smoke, upcoiling to the sky,\r\n    Was shapen by the winds, and took the form\r\n    Of him who in the stithy gave command.\r\n    A shadow between day and men he stood;\r\n    His eyes looked forth on nothingness; his wings\r\n    Domed desolations, and the scarlet sun\r\n    Glowed through their darkness like a seal that God\r\n    Might set on Hell forever. Then the pyre\r\n    Shrank, and he reeled. Whereat, to save that shape\r\n    Their madness had evoked in death and pain,\r\n    Men rose and made a second sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSartor Resartus\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS CARLYLE\r\n\r\n(See pages 31, 74, 133, 488)\r\n\r\nWhat, speaking in quite unofficial language, is the net-purport\r\nand upshot of war? To my own knowledge, for example, there\r\ndwell and toil, in the British village of Dumdrudge, usually\r\nsome five hundred souls. From these, by certain \"Natural\r\nEnemies\" of the French, there are successfully selected, during\r\nthe French war, say thirty able-bodied men: Dumdrudge, at\r\nher own expense, has suckled and nursed them: she has, not\r\nwithout difficulty and sorrow, fed them up to manhood, and even\r\ntrained them to crafts, so that one can weave, another build,\r\nanother hammer, and the weakest can stand under thirty stone\r\navoirdupois. Nevertheless, amid much weeping and swearing,\r\nthey are selected; all dressed in red, and shipped away, at\r\nthe public charges, some two thousand miles, or say only to\r\nthe south of Spain; and fed there till wanted. And now to that\r\nsame spot, in the south of Spain, are thirty similar French\r\nartisans, from a French Dumdrudge, in like manner wending;\r\ntill at length, after infinite effort, the two parties come\r\ninto actual juxtaposition, and Thirty stands fronting Thirty,\r\neach with a gun in his hand. Straightway the word \"Fire!\" is\r\ngiven and they blow the souls out of one another, and in place\r\nof sixty brisk useful craftsmen, the world has sixty dead\r\ncarcasses, which it must bury, and anew shed tears for. Had\r\nthese men any quarrel? Busy as the Devil is, not the smallest!\r\nThey lived far enough apart; were the entirest strangers;\r\nnay, in so wide a Universe, there was even, unconsciously,\r\nby Commerce, some mutual helpfulness between them. How then?\r\nSimpleton! their Governors had fallen out; and, instead of\r\nshooting one another, had the cunning to make these poor\r\nblockheads shoot.--Alas, so is it in Deutschland, and hitherto\r\nin all other lands; still as of old, \"what devilry soever Kings\r\ndo, the Greeks must pay the piper!\"--In that fiction of the\r\nEnglish Smollett, it is true, the final Cessation of War is\r\nperhaps prophetically shadowed forth; where the two Natural\r\nEnemies, in person, take each a Tobacco-pipe, filled with\r\nBrimstone; light the same, and smoke in one another's faces,\r\ntill the weaker gives in: but from such predicted Peace-Era,\r\nwhat blood-filled trenches, and contentious centuries, may\r\nstill divide us!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Soldier's Oath\r\n\r\nBY KAISER WILHELM OF GERMANY\r\n\r\n(Speech delivered in 1891)\r\n\r\nRecruits! Before the altar and the servant of God you have\r\ngiven me the oath of allegiance. You are too young to know\r\nthe full meaning of what you have said, but your first care\r\nmust be to obey implicitly all orders and directions. You have\r\nsworn fidelity to me, you are the children of my guard, you\r\nare my soldiers, you have surrendered yourselves to me, body\r\nand soul. Only one enemy can exist for you--my enemy. With the\r\npresent Socialist machinations, it may happen that I shall\r\norder you to shoot your own relatives, your brothers, or even\r\nyour parents--which God forbid--and then you are bound in duty\r\nimplicitly to obey my orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coming of War\r\n\r\nBY LEO TOLSTOY\r\n\r\n(See pages 88, 110, 148, 276, 374, 416)\r\n\r\nThe bells will peal, long-haired men will dress in golden sacks\r\nto pray for successful slaughter. And the old story will begin\r\nagain, the awful customary acts.\r\n\r\nThe editors of the daily Press will begin virulently to stir\r\nmen up to hatred and manslaughter in the name of patriotism,\r\nhappy in the receipt of an increased income. Manufacturers,\r\nmerchants, contractors for military stores, will hurry joyously\r\nabout their business, in the hope of double receipts.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of Government officials will buzz about, foreseeing\r\na possibility of purloining something more than usual. The\r\nmilitary authorities will hurry hither and thither, drawing\r\ndouble pay and rations, and with the expectation of receiving\r\nfor the slaughter of other men various silly little ornaments\r\nwhich they so highly prize, as ribbons, crosses, orders, and\r\nstars. Idle ladies and gentlemen will make a great fuss,\r\nentering their names in advance for the Red Cross Society, and\r\nready to bind up the wounds of those whom their husbands and\r\nbrothers will mutilate; and they will imagine that in so doing\r\nthey are performing a most Christian work.\r\n\r\nAnd, smothering despair within their souls by songs,\r\nlicentiousness, and wine, men will trail along, torn\r\nfrom peaceful labor, from their wives, mothers and\r\nchildren--hundreds of thousands of simple-minded, good-natured\r\nmen with murderous weapons in their hands--anywhere they may be\r\ndriven.\r\n\r\nThey will march, freeze, hunger, suffer sickness, and die from\r\nit, or finally come to some place where they will be slain by\r\nthousands or kill thousands themselves with no reason--men whom\r\nthey have never seen before, and who neither have done nor\r\ncould do them any mischief.\r\n\r\nAnd when the number of sick, wounded, and killed becomes so\r\ngreat that there are not hands enough left to pick them up,\r\nand when the air is so infected with the putrefying scent\r\nof the \"food for powder\" that even the authorities find it\r\ndisagreeable, a truce will be made, the wounded will be picked\r\nup anyhow, the sick will be brought in and huddled together in\r\nheaps, the killed will be covered with earth and lime, and once\r\nmore all the crowd of deluded men will be led on and on till\r\nthose who have devised the project, weary of it, or till those\r\nwho thought to find it profitable receive their spoil.\r\n\r\nAnd so once more men will be made savage, fierce, and brutal,\r\nand love will wane in the world, and the Christianizing of\r\nmankind, which has already begun, will lapse for scores and\r\nhundreds of years. And so once more the men who reaped profit\r\nfrom it all, will assert with assurance that since there has\r\nbeen a war there must needs have been one, and that other wars\r\nmust follow, and they will again prepare future generations for\r\na continuance of slaughter, depraving them from their birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlavery\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM COWPER\r\n\r\n(English poet, 1731-1800)\r\n\r\n    O for a lodge in some vast wilderness,\r\n    Some boundless contiguity of shade,\r\n    Where rumor of oppression and deceit,\r\n    Of unsuccessful or successful war,\r\n    Might never reach me more. My ear is pained,\r\n    My soul is sick, with every day's report\r\n    Of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled.\r\n    There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart,\r\n    It does not feel for man; the natural bond\r\n    Of brotherhood is severed as the flax\r\n    That falls asunder at the touch of fire.\r\n    He finds his fellow guilty of a skin\r\n    Not colored like his own; and having power\r\n    To enforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause\r\n    Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.\r\n    Lands intersected by a narrow frith\r\n    Abhor each other. Mountains interposed\r\n    Make enemies of nations, who had else\r\n    Like kindred drops been mingled into one.\r\n    Thus man devotes his brother, and destroys;\r\n    And, worse than all, and most to be deplored,\r\n    As human nature's broadest, foulest blot,\r\n    Chains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweat\r\n    With stripes, that Mercy, with a bleeding heart,\r\n    Weeps when she sees inflicted on a beast.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Biglow Papers\r\n\r\nBY JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL\r\n\r\n(These poems, first published in the _Atlantic Monthly_ in\r\n1846, voiced the bitter opposition of New England to the\r\nMexican war as a slave-holders' enterprise)\r\n\r\n    Thrash away, you'll _hev_ to rattle\r\n      On them kittle-drums o' yourn,--\r\n    'Tain't a knowin' kind o' cattle\r\n      Thet is ketched with mouldy corn;\r\n    Put in stiff, you fifer feller,\r\n      Let folks see how spry you be,--\r\n    Guess you'll toot till you are yeller\r\n      'Fore you git ahold o' me!...\r\n\r\n    Ez fer war, I call it murder,--\r\n      There you hev it plain an' flat;\r\n    I don't want to go no furder\r\n      Than my Testyment fer that;\r\n    God hez sed so plump an' fairly,\r\n      It's ez long ez it is broad,\r\n    An' you've got to git up airly\r\n      Ef you want to take in God.\r\n\r\n    'Tain't your eppyletts an' feathers\r\n      Make the thing a grain more right;\r\n    'Tain't afollerin' your bell-wethers\r\n      Will excuse ye in His sight;\r\n    Ef you take a sword an' dror it,\r\n      An' go stick a feller thru,\r\n    Guv'mint ain't to answer for it,\r\n      God'll send the bill to you.\r\n\r\n    Wut's the use o' meetin'-goin'\r\n      Every Sabbath, wet or dry,\r\n    Ef it's right to go amowin'\r\n      Feller-men like oats an' rye?\r\n    I dunno but wut it's pooty\r\n      Trainin' round in bobtail coats,--\r\n    But it's curus Christian dooty\r\n      This 'ere cuttin' folks's throats....\r\n\r\n    Tell ye jest the eend I've come to\r\n      Arter cipherin' plaguey smart,\r\n    An' it makes a handy sum, tu,\r\n      Any gump could larn by heart;\r\n    Laborin' man an' laborin' woman\r\n      Hev one glory an' one shame.\r\n    Ev'y thin' thet's done inhuman\r\n      Injers all on 'em the same.\r\n\r\n    'Tain't by turnin' out to hack folks\r\n      You're agoin' to git your right,\r\n    Nor by lookin' down on black folks\r\n      Coz you're put upon by white;\r\n    Slavery ain't o' nary color,\r\n      'Tain't the hide thet makes it wus,\r\n    All it keers fer in a feller\r\n      'S jest to make him fill its pus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a Nine-inch Gun\r\n\r\nBY P.

On Monday we are to move out.\r\nToday, being Sunday, is full-dress Church Parade.\r\n\r\nI slept badly last night, and am feeling uneasy and limp.\r\n\r\nAnd now we are sitting close-packed in church.\r\n\r\nThe organ is playing a voluntary.\r\n\r\nI am leaning back and straining my ears for the sounds in the\r\ndim twilight of the building. Childhood's days rise before my\r\neyes again. I am watching a little solemn-faced boy sitting\r\ncrouched in a corner and listening to the divine service. The\r\npriest is standing in front of the altar, and is intoning the\r\nExhortation devoutly. The choir in the gallery is chanting\r\nthe responses. The organ thunders out and floods through the\r\nbuilding majestically. I am rapt in an ecstasy of sweet terror,\r\nfor the Lord God is coming down upon us. He is standing before\r\nme and touching my body, so that I have to close my eyes in a\r\nterror of shuddering ecstasy....\r\n\r\nThat is long, long ago, and is all past and done with, as youth\r\nitself is past and done with....\r\n\r\nStrange! After all these years of doubt and unbelief, at this\r\nmoment of lucid consciousness, the atmosphere of devoutness,\r\nlong since dead, possesses me, and thrills me so passionately\r\nthat I can hardly resist it. This is the same heavy\r\ntwilight--these are the same yearning angel voices--the same\r\nfearful sense of rapture--\r\n\r\nI pull myself together, and sit bolt upright on the hard wooden\r\npew.\r\n\r\nIn the main and the side aisles below, and in the galleries\r\nabove, nothing but soldiers in uniform, and all, with level\r\nfaces, turned toward the altar, toward that pale man in his\r\nlong dignified black gown, toward that sonorous, unctuous\r\nmouth, from whose lips flows the name of God.\r\n\r\nLook! He is now stretching forth his hands. We incline our\r\nheads. He is pronouncing the Benediction over us in a voice\r\nthat echoes from the tomb. He is blessing us in the name of\r\nGod, the Merciful. He is blessing our rifles that they may not\r\nfail us; he is blessing the wire-drawn guns on their patent\r\nrecoilless carriages; he is blessing every precious cartridge,\r\nlest a single bullet be wasted, lest any pass idly through the\r\nair; that each one may account for a hundred human beings, may\r\nshatter a hundred human beings simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFather in Heaven! Thou art gazing down at us in such terrible\r\nsilence. Dost Thou shudder at these sons of men? Thou poor and\r\nslight God! Thou couldst only rain Thy paltry pitch and sulphur\r\non Sodom and Gomorrah. But we, Thy children, whom Thou hast\r\ncreated, we are going to exterminate them by high-pressure\r\nmachinery, and butcher whole cities in factories. Here we\r\nstand, and while we stretch our hands to Thy Son in prayer,\r\nand cry Hosannah! we are hurling shells and shrapnel in the\r\nface of Thy Image, and shooting the Son of Man down from His\r\nCross like a target at the rifle-butts.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Holy Communion is being celebrated. The organ is\r\nplaying mysteriously from afar off, and the flesh and blood of\r\nthe Redeemer is mingling with our flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nThere He is hanging on the Cross above me, and gazing down upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHow pale those cheeks look! And those eyes are the eyes as of\r\none dead! Who was this Christ Who is to aid us, and Whose blood\r\nwe drink? What was it they once taught us at school? Didst Thou\r\nnot love mankind? And didst Thou not die for the whole human\r\nrace? Stretch out Thine arms toward me. There is something I\r\nwould fain ask of Thee.... Ah! they have nailed Thy arms to the\r\nCross, so that Thou canst not stretch out a finger toward us.\r\n\r\nShuddering, I fix my eyes on the corpse-like face and see that\r\nHe died long ago, that He is nothing more than wood, nothing\r\nother than a puppet. Christ, it is no longer Thee to whom we\r\npray. Look there! Look there! It is he. The new patron saint\r\nof a Christian State! Look there! It is he, the great Genghis\r\nKhan. Of him we know that he swept through the history of the\r\nworld with fire and sword, and piled up pyramids of skulls.\r\nYes, that is he. Let us heap up mountains of human heads, and\r\npile up heaps of human entrails. Great Genghis Khan! Thou, our\r\npatron saint! Do thou bless us! Pray to thy blood-drenched\r\nfather seated above the skies of Asia, that he may sweep with\r\nus through the clouds; that he may strike down that accursed\r\nnation till it writhes in its blood, till it never can rise\r\nagain. A red mist swims before my eyes. Of a sudden I see\r\nnothing but blood before me. The heavens have opened, and the\r\nred flood pours in through the windows. Blood wells up on the\r\naltar. The walls run blood from the ceiling to the floor,\r\nand--God the Father steps out of the blood. Every scale of his\r\nskin stands erect, his beard and hair drip blood. A giant of\r\nblood stands before me. He seats himself backward on the altar,\r\nand is laughing from thick, coarse lips--there sits the King\r\nof Dahomey, and he butchers his slaves. The black executioner\r\nraises his sword and whirls it above my head. Another moment\r\nand my head will roll down on the floor--another moment and the\r\nred jet will spurt from my neck.... Murderers, murderers! None\r\nother than murderers! Lord God in Heaven!\r\n\r\nThen--\r\n\r\nThe church door opens creaking--\r\n\r\nLight, air, the blue of heaven, burst in.\r\n\r\nI draw a breath of relief. We have risen to our feet, and at\r\nlength pass out of the twilight into the open air.\r\n\r\nMy knees are still trembling under me.\r\n\r\nWe fall into line, and in our hob-nailed boots tramp in step\r\ndown the street toward the barracks. When I see my mates\r\nmarching beside me in their matter-of-fact and stolid way,\r\nI feel ashamed, and call myself a wretched coward. What a\r\nweak-nerved, hysterical breed, that can no longer look at blood\r\nwithout fainting! You neurasthenic offspring of your sturdy\r\npeasant forebears, who shouted for joy when they went out to\r\nfight!\r\n\r\nI pull myself together and throw my head back.\r\n\r\nI never was a coward, and eye for eye I have always looked my\r\nman in the face, and will so do this time, too, happen what\r\nmay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe War Prayer[A]\r\n\r\n[A] (Quoted by special permission of Harper & Brothers.)\r\n\r\nBY MARK TWAIN\r\n\r\n (American humorist. See page 265. This \"War Prayer,\" withheld from\r\n publication until after Mark Twain's death, pictures the assembling\r\n of soldiers in church, and the prayer of the chaplain for victory.\r\n In answer to the prayer, God sends down a white-robed messenger, who\r\n voices the unspoken meaning of the prayer.)\r\n\r\n\"O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody\r\nshreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields\r\nwith the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown\r\nthe thunder of the guns with the wounded, writhing in pain;\r\nhelp us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of\r\nfire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows\r\nwith unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with\r\ntheir little children to wander unfriended through wastes of\r\ntheir desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sport of\r\nthe sun-flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken\r\nin spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of\r\nthe grave and denied it--for our sakes, who adore Thee, Lord,\r\nblast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter\r\npilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with their\r\ntears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded\r\nfeet! We ask of one who is the Spirit of love and who is the\r\never-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset, and\r\nseek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Grant our prayer,\r\nO Lord, and Thine shall be the praise and honor and glory now\r\nand ever, Amen.\"\r\n\r\n(After a pause.) \"Ye have prayed it; if ye still desire it,\r\nspeak!--the messenger of the Most High waits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Illusion of War\r\n\r\nBY RICHARD LE GALLIENNE\r\n\r\n(American poet, born in England, 1866)\r\n\r\n    War I abhor, and yet how sweet\r\n    The sound along the marching street\r\n    Of drum and fife, and I forget\r\n    Wet eyes of widows, and forget\r\n    Broken old mothers, and the whole\r\n    Dark butchery without a soul.\r\n\r\n    Without a soul, save this bright drink\r\n    Of heady music, sweet as hell;\r\n    And even my peace-abiding feet\r\n    Go marching with the marching street--\r\n    For yonder, yonder goes the fife,\r\n    And what care I for human life!\r\n\r\n    The tears fill my astonished eyes,\r\n      And my full heart is like to break;\r\n    And yet 'tis all embannered lies,\r\n      A dream those little drummers make.\r\n\r\n    O, it is wickedness to clothe\r\n      Yon hideous grinning thing that stalks,\r\n    Hidden in music, like a queen,\r\n      That in a garden of glory walks,\r\n    Till good men love the thing they loathe.\r\n\r\n    Art, thou hast many infamies,\r\n      But not an infamy like this--\r\n    Oh, snap the fife, and still the drum,\r\n      And show the monster as she is!\r\n\r\n\r\nLay Down Your Arms\r\n\r\nBY BARONESS BERTHA VON SUTTNER\r\n\r\n (Austrian novelist and peace advocate, 1850-1914. Her protest against\r\n war, published in 1889, made a deep impression throughout Europe. In\r\n the following scene a woman is taken to visit a field of battle with\r\n the hospital-corps)\r\n\r\nNo more thunder of artillery, no more blare of trumpets, no\r\nmore beat of drum; only the low moans of pain and the rattle\r\nof death. In the trampled ground some redly-glimmering pools,\r\nlakes of blood; all the crops destroyed, only here and there a\r\npiece of land left untouched, and still covered with stubble;\r\nthe smiling villages of yesterday turned into ruins and\r\nrubbish. The trees burned and hacked in the forests, the hedges\r\ntorn with grape-shot. And on this battle-ground thousands and\r\nthousands of men dead and dying--dying without aid. No blossoms\r\nof flowers are to be seen on wayside or meadow; but sabres,\r\nbayonets, knapsacks, cloaks, overturned ammunition wagons,\r\npowder wagons blown into the air, cannon with broken carriages.\r\nNear the cannon, whose muzzles are black with smoke, the ground\r\nis bloodiest. There the greatest number and the most mangled\r\nof dead and half-dead men are lying, literally torn to pieces\r\nwith shot; and the dead horses, and the half-dead which raise\r\nthemselves on their feet--such feet as they have left--to sink\r\nagain; then raise themselves up once more and fall down again,\r\ntill they only raise their head to shriek out their pain-laden\r\ndeath-cry. There is a hollow way quite filled with corpses\r\ntrodden into the mire. The poor creatures had taken refuge\r\nthere no doubt to get cover, but a battery has driven over\r\nthem, and they have been crushed by the horses' hoofs and the\r\nwheels. Many of them are still alive--a pulpy, bleeding mass,\r\nbut \"still alive\".\r\n\r\nAnd yet there is still something more hellish even than\r\nall this, and that is the appearance of the most vile scum\r\nof humanity, as it shows itself in war--the appearance and\r\nactivity of \"the hyenas of the battlefield.\" \"Then slink on\r\nthe monsters who grope after the spoils of the dead, and bend\r\nover the corpses and over the living, mercilessly tearing off\r\ntheir clothes from their bodies. The boots are dragged off the\r\nbleeding limbs, the rings off the wounded hands, or to get the\r\nring the finger is simply chopped off, and if a man tries to\r\ndefend himself from such a sacrifice, he is murdered by these\r\nhyenas; or, in order to make him unrecognizable, they dig his\r\neyes out.\"\r\n\r\nI shrieked out loud at the doctor's last words. I again saw the\r\nwhole scene before me, and the eyes into which the hyena was\r\nplunging his knife were Frederick's soft, blue, beloved eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Pray, forgive me, dear lady, but it was by your own wish----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; I desire to hear it all. What you are now describing\r\nwas the night that follows the battle; and these scenes are\r\nenacted by the starlight?\"\r\n\r\n\"And by torchlight. The patrols which the conquerors send out\r\nto survey the field of battle carry torches and lanterns, and\r\nred lanterns are hoisted on signal poles to point out the\r\nplaces where flying hospitals are to be established.\"\r\n\r\n\"And next morning, how does the field look?\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost more fearful still. The contrast between the bright\r\nsmiling daylight and the dreadful work of man on which it\r\nshines has a doubly-painful effect. At night the entire picture\r\nof horror is something ghostly and fantastic. By daylight it\r\nis simply hopeless. Now you see for the first time the mass\r\nof corpses lying around on the lanes, between the fields,\r\nin the ditches, behind the ruins of walls. Everywhere dead\r\nbodies--everywhere. Plundered, some of them naked; and just\r\nthe same with the wounded. Those who, in spite of the nightly\r\nlabor of the Sanitary Corps, are still always lying around in\r\nnumbers, look pale and collapsed, green or yellow, with fixed\r\nand stupefied gaze, or writhing in agonies of pain, they beg\r\nany one who comes near to put them to death. Swarms of carrion\r\ncrows settle on the tops of the trees, and with loud croaks\r\nannounce the bill of fare of the tempting banquet. Hungry dogs,\r\nfrom the villages around, come running by and lick the blood\r\nfrom wounds. Further afield there are a few hyenas to be seen,\r\nwho are still carrying on their work hastily. And now comes the\r\ngreat interment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who does that--the Sanitary Corps?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could they suffice for such a mass of work? They have\r\nfully enough to do with the wounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then troops are detailed for the work?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. A crowd of men impressed, or even offering themselves\r\nvoluntarily--loiterers, baggage people, who are supporting\r\nthemselves by the market-stalls, baggage-wagons and so forth,\r\nand who now have been hunted away by the force of the military\r\noperations, together with the inhabitants of the cottages\r\nand huts--to dig trenches--good large ones, of course--wide\r\ntrenches, for they are not made deep--there is no time for\r\nthat. Into these the dead bodies are thrown, heads up or heads\r\ndown just as they come to hand. Or it is done in this way:\r\nA heap is made of the corpses, and a foot or two of earth\r\nis heaped up over them, and then it has the appearance of a\r\ntumulus. In a few days rain comes on and washes the covering\r\noff the festering dead bodies! but what does that matter? The\r\nnimble, jolly grave-diggers do not look so far forward. For\r\njolly, merry workmen they are, that one must allow. Songs are\r\npiped out there, and all kinds of dubious jokes made--nay,\r\nsometimes a dance of hyenas is danced round the open trench.\r\nWhether life is still stirring in several of the bodies that\r\nare shovelled into it or are covered with the earth, they give\r\nthemselves no trouble to think. The thing is inevitable, for\r\nthe stiff cramp often comes on after wounds. Many who have been\r\nsaved by accident have told of the danger of being buried alive\r\nwhich they have escaped. But how many are there of those who\r\nare not able to tell anything! If a man has once got a foot or\r\ntwo of earth over his mouth he may well hold his tongue.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Sedan\r\n\r\nBY AUSTIN DOBSON\r\n\r\n(English poet and essayist, born 1840)\r\n\r\n    Here in this leafy place\r\n      Quiet he lies,\r\n    Cold, with his sightless face\r\n      Turned to the skies;\r\n    'Tis but another dead;\r\n    All you can say is said.\r\n\r\n    Carry his body hence,--\r\n      Kings must have slaves;\r\n    Kings climb to eminence\r\n      Over men's graves;\r\n    So this man's eye is dim;--\r\n    Throw the earth over him.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoubt\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Present Hour\"_)\r\n\r\nBY PERCY MACKAYE\r\n\r\n(One of a group of six sonnets, entitled \"Carnage,\" written in\r\nSeptember, 1914)\r\n\r\n    So thin, so frail the opalescent ice\r\n      Where yesterday, in lordly pageant, rose\r\n      The monumental nations--the repose\r\n    Of continents at peace!

I hope it will be lasting, and that mankind will at\r\nlength, as they call themselves reasonable creatures, have\r\nreason enough to settle their differences without cutting\r\nthroats; for, in my opinion, there never was a good war or a\r\nbad peace. What vast additions to the conveniences and comforts\r\nof life might mankind have acquired, if the money spent in\r\nwars had been employed in works of utility! What an extension\r\nof agriculture, even to the tops of the mountains; what\r\nrivers rendered navigable, or joined by canals; what bridges,\r\naqueducts, new roads, and other public works, edifices and\r\nimprovements, rendering England a complete paradise, might not\r\nhave been obtained by spending those millions in doing good,\r\nwhich in the last war have been spent in doing mischief--in\r\nbringing misery into thousands of families, and destroying the\r\nlives of so many working people, who might have performed the\r\nuseful labors.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Prayer of the Peoples\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Present Hour\"_)\r\n\r\nBY PERCY MACKAYE\r\n\r\n(See pages 561, 572)\r\n\r\n    God of us who kill our kind!\r\n    Master of this blood-tracked Mind\r\n    Which from wolf and Caliban\r\n    Staggers toward the star of Man--\r\n    Now, on Thy cathedral stair,\r\n    God, we cry to Thee in prayer!\r\n\r\n    Where our stifled anguish bleeds\r\n    Strangling through Thine organ reeds,\r\n    Where our voiceless songs suspire\r\n    From the corpses in Thy choir--\r\n    Through Thy charred and shattered nave,\r\n    God, we cry on Thee to save!\r\n\r\n    Save us from our tribal gods!\r\n    From the racial powers, whose rods--\r\n    Wreathed with stinging serpents--stir\r\n    Odin and old Jupiter\r\n    From their ancient hells of hate\r\n    To invade Thy dawning state....\r\n\r\n    Lord, our God! to whom, from clay,\r\n    Blood and mire, Thy peoples pray--\r\n    Not from Thy cathedral's stair\r\n    Thou hearest:--Thou criest _through_ our prayer\r\n    For our prayer is but the gate:\r\n    We, who pray, ourselves are fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar\r\n\r\nBY THE GREAT INDIAN, CHIEF JOSEPH\r\n\r\n    Hear me, my warriors; my heart is sick and sad;\r\n    Our chiefs are killed,\r\n    The old men are all dead,\r\n    It is cold and we have no blankets;\r\n    The little children are freezing to death.\r\n    Hear me, my warriors; my heart is sick and sad;\r\n    From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever!\r\n\r\n\r\nA Project for a Perpetual Peace\r\n\r\nBY JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU\r\n\r\n(A document published 1756 in which the French philosopher\r\noutlined in detail a plan for a European federation, which\r\nseems in 1915 to have become the next step in civilization)\r\n\r\nAs a more noble, useful, and delightful Project never engaged\r\nthe human mind, than that of establishing a perpetual peace\r\namong the contending nations of Europe, never did a writer\r\nlay a better claim to the attention of the public than he who\r\npoints out the means to carry such a design into execution. It\r\nis indeed very difficult for a man of probity and sensibility,\r\nnot to be fired with a kind of enthusiasm on such a subject;\r\nnay, I am not clear that the very illusions of a heart truly\r\nhumane, whose warmth makes everything easily surmountable, are\r\nnot in this case more eligible than that rigid and forbidding\r\nprudence, which finds in its own indifference and want of\r\npublic spirit, the chief obstacle to everything that tends to\r\npromote the public good.\r\n\r\nI doubt not that many of my readers will be forearmed with\r\nincredulity, to withstand the pleasing temptation of being\r\npersuaded; and indeed I sincerely lament their dullness in\r\nmistaking obstinacy for wisdom. But I flatter myself, that\r\nmany an honest mind will sympathize with me in that delightful\r\nemotion, with which I take up the pen to treat of a subject so\r\ngreatly interesting to the world. I am going to take a view, at\r\nleast in imagination, of mankind united by love and friendship:\r\nI am going to take a contemplative prospect of an agreeable\r\nand peaceful society of brethren, living in constant harmony,\r\ndirected by the same maxims, and joint sharers of one common\r\nfelicity; while, realizing to myself so affecting a picture,\r\nthe representation of such imaginary happiness will give me the\r\nmomentary enjoyment of a pleasure actually present.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet the People Vote on War\r\n\r\nBY ALLEN L.

In counting, the ballots for war should be kept apart\r\nfrom the ballots against war. In the event of more than half of\r\nthe population voting for war, those who voted for war should\r\nbe sent to the front in the order in which they appeared at\r\ntheir respective polling places.

The present scene describes\r\n a debate organized between champions of the revolutionary and the\r\n conservative labor unions, the \"Reds\" and the \"Yellows\"; a grand\r\n Homeric combat of ideas, in which the audience is wrought to a furious\r\n pitch of excitement, and does as much talking as the orators. In the\r\n following extract, from about forty pages of mingled eloquence and\r\n humor, the champion of the \"Reds\" announces \"the grave and dreadful\r\n problem of anti-militarism\")\r\n\r\nA long shudder agitated the hostile crowds. All the wild beasts\r\nquivered in their cages. Rougemont, immobile, scarcely raised\r\nhis hand; never before had his voice sounded more grave and\r\nmore pathetic.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes! Question profound and dreadful. No one has been\r\ntroubled by it more than I, for I am not among those bold\r\ninternationalists who deny their country. I love my land of\r\nFrance. To make our happiness perfect, we must have the land\r\nof France. But who would dare to say that we, the poor, are\r\nany other thing upon that land than food for suffering and\r\nfood for barracks? The worst Prussian, provided that he owns\r\na coin of a hundred sous--is he not superior to the unhappy\r\nwretch who rummages in empty pockets? All the pleasures, all\r\nthe beauty, all the luxury, our most beautiful daughters,\r\nbelong to the rich cosmopolitan: he possesses the enchanter's\r\nring. If you have nothing, you will live more a stranger in\r\nyour country than the dog of a swindling millionaire. If you\r\nhave nothing, you will be insulted, scorned, hunted, locked in\r\nprison for vagabondage. _La patrie!_ _La patrie_ of the poor!\r\nIt is a fable, a symbol, an inscription upon a military-list or\r\na school-book--the most bitter derision! Your right, unhappy\r\nones--it is to suffer and defend the soil, which belongs to\r\nyour master, to him who possesses. For him, for him alone, our\r\nFrance devotes each year a billion francs for army and navy....\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary purely and simply to suppress the budget of\r\nthe army and navy,\" thundered Rougemont, with such force that\r\nhe broke the tumult. \"France must give all at once, without\r\nhesitation, the example of disarmament. And that would be a\r\nthing so grand and so beautiful that the entire universe would\r\napplaud, that all humanity would turn toward her. From that day\r\nalone we should be at the head of the nations, and our country\r\nwould become the country of free men!\"\r\n\r\n\"Under the heel of Wilhelm!\"\r\n\r\n\"A Poland!\"\r\n\r\n\"Guts for the cats!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sold! Rubbish! Meat for sheenies!\"\r\n\r\n\"... living in boiling water like lobsters!\"\r\n\r\nAll at once, the tumult sank. The voice of the orator forced\r\nitself upon the ear, high as a bell, precise as a clarion.\r\n\"Free, superb, and triumphant! Queen of the peoples, goddess\r\nof the unfortunate! If we should disarm, before ten years,\r\nFrance would become a land of pilgrimage, the Mecca of men.\r\nBefore twenty years, the other nations would have followed her\r\nexample. As for making of us a Poland, let them try it! Have\r\nyou then forgotten the teachings of history? Do you not know\r\nthat our grand armies, our innumerable victories--we have won\r\nas many victories as all the rest of Europe together--have only\r\nended in the crushing of Waterloo and the collapse of Sedan? On\r\nthe contrary, Italy, dismembered for centuries, Italy, which\r\ncannot count its defeats, is become a free nation. That is\r\nbecause it is inhabited by a race, clean and well-defined, upon\r\nwhich the foreigner has been unable to impress his mark. France\r\nenslaved, she, the most intelligent of nations, she who has had\r\nthe most influence upon minds and hearts! Come now, that is\r\nnot possible, that will never happen! But the people who would\r\nhowl indignation at the dismembering of a disarmed France,\r\nwould let a war-like France go down to ruin: she would be only\r\none country like the others. So, I repeat it without scruple:\r\nit is necessary that we should give the magnificent example of\r\ndisarmament. Only then shall we be a nation loved and admired\r\namong nations. Only then will all hearts turn toward us. Only\r\nthen will the idea that anyone could touch France seem a\r\nsacrilege such as no tyrant would risk!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dawn\r\n\r\nBY ÉMILE VERHAEREN\r\n\r\n (In this play the Belgian poet has voiced his hopes for the\r\n regeneration of human society. The city of Oppidomagne is besieged by\r\n a hostile army, and the revolutionists in both armies conspire and\r\n revolt. The gates of the city are thrown open, and the end of war\r\n declared. A captain in the hostile army is speaking over the body of\r\n Hérénian, leader of the revolutionists in the city)\r\n\r\nI was his disciple, and his unknown friend. His books were\r\nmy Bible. It is men like this who give birth to men like me,\r\nfaithful, long obscure, but whom fortune permits, in one\r\noverwhelming hour, to realize the supreme dream of their\r\nmaster. If fatherlands are fair, sweet to the heart, dear\r\nto the memory, armed nations on the frontiers are tragic and\r\ndeadly; and the whole world is yet bristling with nations.\r\nIt is in their teeth that we throw them this example of our\r\nconcord. (Cheers.) They will understand some day the immortal\r\nthing accomplished here, in this illustrious Oppidomagne,\r\nwhence the loftiest ideas of humanity have taken flight, one\r\nafter another, through all the ages. For the first time since\r\nthe beginning of power, since brains have reckoned time, two\r\nraces, one renouncing its victory, the other its humbled\r\npride, are made one in an embrace. The whole earth must needs\r\nhave quivered, all the blood, all the sap of the earth must\r\nhave flowed to the heart of things. Concord and good will\r\nhave conquered hate. (Cheers.) Human strife, in its form of\r\nbloodshed, has been gainsaid. A new beacon shines on the\r\nhorizon of future storms. Its steady rays shall dazzle all\r\neyes, haunt all brains, magnetize all desires.

The\r\n following is the peroration of a speech delivered at an Anglo-French\r\n parliamentary dinner, 1903)\r\n\r\nThe majesty of suffering labor is no longer dumb: it speaks now\r\nwith a million tongues, and it asks the nations not to increase\r\nthe ills which crush down the workers by an added burden of\r\nmistrust and hate, by wars and the expectation of wars.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, you may ask how and when and in what form this\r\nlonging for international concord will express itself to some\r\npurpose.... I can only answer you by a parable which I gleaned\r\nby fragments from the legends of Merlin, the magician, from the\r\nArabian Nights, and from a book that is still unread.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was an enchanted forest. It had been\r\nstripped of all verdure, it was wild and forbidding. The trees,\r\ntossed by the bitter winter wind that never ceased, struck one\r\nanother with a sound as of breaking swords. When at last, after\r\na long series of freezing nights and sunless days that seemed\r\nlike nights, all living things trembled with the first call of\r\nspring, the trees became afraid of the sap that began to move\r\nwithin them. And the solitary and bitter spirit that had its\r\ndwelling within the hard bark of each of them said very low,\r\nwith a shudder that came up from the deepest roots: \"Have a\r\ncare! If thou art the first to risk yielding to the wooing of\r\nthe new season, if thou art the first to turn thy lancelike\r\nbuds into blossoms and leaves, their delicate raiment will be\r\ntorn by the rough blows of the trees that have been slower to\r\nput forth leaves and flowers.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the proud and melancholy spirit that was shut up within the\r\ngreat Druidical oak spoke to its tree with peculiar insistence:\r\n\"And wilt thou, too, seek to join the universal love-feast,\r\nthou whose noble branches have been broken by the storm?\"\r\n\r\nThus, in the enchanted forest, mutual distrust drove back the\r\nsap, and prolonged the death-like winter even after the call of\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nWhat happened at last? By what mysterious influence was the\r\ngrim charm broken? Did some tree find the courage to act alone,\r\nlike those April poplars that break into a shower of verdure,\r\nand give from afar the signal for a renewal of all life? Or did\r\na warmer and more life-giving beam start the sap moving in all\r\nthe trees at once? For lo! in a single day the whole forest\r\nburst forth into a magnificent flowering of joy and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY MICAH\r\n\r\n(Hebrew prophet, B.

Have we, inheritors of this continent and of the\r\nideals to which the fathers consecrated it,--have we maintained\r\nthem, realizing them, as each generation must, anew? Are we,\r\nin the consciousness that the life of man is pledged to higher\r\nlevels here than elsewhere, striving still to bear aloft the\r\nstandards of liberty and hope; or, disillusioned and defeated,\r\nare we feeling the disgrace of having had a free field in which\r\nto do new things and of not having done them?\r\n\r\nThe answer must be, I am sure, that we have been in a fair\r\nway of failure,--tragic failure. And we stand in danger of\r\nutter failure yet, except we fulfil speedily the determination\r\nwe have reached, to deal with the new and subtle tyrannies\r\naccording to their deserts. Don't deceive yourselves for\r\na moment as to the power of the great interests which now\r\ndominate our development. They are so great that it is almost\r\nan open question whether the government of the United States\r\ncan dominate them or not.

As the real problem was whether one organization\r\nof needy men should remain in control, or whether another\r\nshould replace it, there were few matters of policy to be\r\ndiscussed; and so the speechmaking and the printing resolved\r\nthemselves into personal investigations, and attacks upon\r\ncharacter. Private detectives were hired, records searched,\r\nneighbors questioned, old enemies sought out, and family feuds\r\nrevived. Desks were broken open, letters bought, anonymous\r\ncommunications mailed, boyhood indiscretions unearthed, and\r\nwomen and men hired to wheedle, to commit perjury, to entrap.\r\nWhatever was discovered, forged, stolen, manufactured--whatever\r\ntruth or falsehood could be seized by whatever means--was\r\nblazoned in the papers, shrieked by the newsboys, bawled from\r\nthe cart-tails at the corners under the campaign banners, in\r\nthe light of the torches and before the cheering crowds. It\r\nwould be all over in a very short while; in a very short while\r\nthere would pass one another, with pleasant smiles, in court,\r\nat church, and along Broadway, the distinguished gentlemen that\r\nwere now, before big audiences, calling one another adulterers\r\nand thieves; but it is customary for distinguished gentlemen so\r\nto call one another during a manly campaign in this successful\r\ndemocracy of ours, and it seems to be an engrossing occupation\r\nwhile the chance endures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Doom of Empires\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT G. INGERSOLL\r\n\r\n(American lawyer and lecturer, 1833-1899)\r\n\r\nThe traveler standing amid the ruins of ancient cities and\r\nempires, seeing on every side the fallen pillar and the\r\nprostrate wall, asks why did these cities fall, why did these\r\nempires crumble? And the Ghost of the Past, the wisdom of ages,\r\nanswers: These temples, these palaces, these cities, the ruins\r\nof which you stand upon, were built by tyranny and injustice.\r\nThe hands that built them were unpaid. The backs that bore\r\nthe burdens also bore the marks of the lash. They were built\r\nby slaves to satisfy the vanity and ambition of thieves and\r\nrobbers. For these reasons they are dust.\r\n\r\nTheir civilization was a lie. Their laws merely regulated\r\nrobbery and established theft. They bought and sold the bodies\r\nand souls of men, and the mournful wind of desolation, sighing\r\namid their crumbling ruins, is a voice of prophetic warning to\r\nthose who would repeat the infamous experiment, uttering the\r\ngreat truth, that no nation founded upon slavery, either of\r\nbody or mind, can stand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Statue of Liberty\r\n\r\n(_New York Harbor, A.D. 2900_)\r\n\r\nBY ARTHUR UPSON\r\n\r\n(American poet, 1877-1908)\r\n\r\n    Here once, the records show, a land whose pride\r\n    Abode in Freedom's watchword!

They crowned a king this day, and there\r\nhave been great rejoicing and elaborate tomfoolery, and I am\r\nperplexed and saddened. I never saw anything to compare with\r\nthe pageant, except Yankee circuses and Alhambra ballets; nor\r\ndid I ever see anything so hopeless and so tragic.\r\n\r\nTo have enjoyed the Coronation procession, I should have come\r\nstraight from America to the Hotel Cecil, and straight from\r\nthe Hotel Cecil to a five-guinea seat among the washed. My\r\nmistake was in coming from the unwashed of the East End. There\r\nwere not many who came from that quarter. The East End, as a\r\nwhole, remained in the East End and got drunk. The Socialists,\r\nDemocrats, and Republicans went off to the country for a breath\r\nof fresh air, quite unaffected by the fact that four hundred\r\nmillions of people were taking to themselves a crowned and\r\nanointed ruler. Six thousand five hundred prelates, priests,\r\nstatesmen, princes and warriors beheld the crowning, and the\r\nrest of us the pageant as it passed.\r\n\r\nI saw it at Trafalgar Square, \"the most splendid site in\r\nEurope,\" and the very innermost heart of the empire. There\r\nwere many thousands of us, all checked and held in order\r\nby a superb display of armed power. The line of march was\r\ndouble-walled with soldiers. The base of the Nelson Column was\r\ntriple-fringed with bluejackets. Eastward, at the entrance to\r\nthe square, stood the Royal Marine Artillery. In the triangle\r\nof Pall Mall and Cockspur Street, the statue of George III was\r\nbuttressed on either side by the Lancers and Hussars. To the\r\nwest were the red-coats of the Royal Marines, and from the\r\nUnion Club to the embouchure of Whitehall swept the glittering,\r\nmassive curve of the First Life Guards--gigantic men mounted\r\non gigantic chargers, steel-breastplated, steel-helmeted,\r\nsteel-caparisoned, a great war-sword of steel ready to the hand\r\nof the powers that be. And further, throughout the crowd, were\r\nflung long lines of the Metropolitan Constabulary, while in the\r\nrear were the reserves--tall, well-fed men, with weapons to\r\nwield and muscles to wield them in case of need.\r\n\r\nAnd as it was thus at Trafalgar Square, so was it along the\r\nwhole line of march--force, overpowering force; myriads of men,\r\nsplendid men, the pick of the people, whose sole function in\r\nlife is blindly to obey, and blindly to kill and destroy and\r\nstamp out life. And that they should be well fed, well clothed,\r\nand well armed, and have ships to hurl them to the ends of\r\nthe earth, the East End of London, and the \"East End\" of all\r\nEngland, toils and rots and dies.\r\n\r\nThere is a Chinese proverb that if one man lives in laziness\r\nanother will die of hunger; and Montesquieu has said, \"The fact\r\nthat many men are occupied in making clothes for one individual\r\nis the cause of there being many people without clothes.\" We\r\ncannot understand the starved and runty toiler of the East End\r\n(living with his family in a one-room den, and letting out the\r\nfloor space for lodgings to other starved and runty toilers)\r\ntill we look at the strapping Life Guardsmen of the West End,\r\nand come to know that the one must feed and clothe and groom\r\nthe other....\r\n\r\nIn these latter days, five hundred hereditary peers own\r\none-fifth of England; and they, and the officers and servants\r\nunder the King, and those who go to compose the powers that\r\nbe, yearly spend in wasteful luxury $1,850,000,000, or\r\n£370,000,000, which is thirty-two per cent of the total wealth\r\nproduced by all the toilers of the country.\r\n\r\nAt the Abbey, clad in wonderful golden raiment, amid fanfare\r\nof trumpets and throbbing of music, surrounded by a brilliant\r\nthrong of masters, lords, and rulers, the King was being\r\ninvested with the insignia of his sovereignty. The spurs were\r\nplaced to his heels by the Lord Great Chamberlain, and a\r\nsword of state, in purple scabbard, was presented him by the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, with these words:--\r\n\r\n\"Receive this kingly sword brought now from the altar of God,\r\nand delivered to you by the hands of the bishops and servants\r\nof God, though unworthy.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon, being girded, he gave heed to the Archbishop's\r\nexhortation:--\r\n\r\n\"With this sword do justice, stop the growth of iniquity,\r\nprotect the Holy Church of God, help and defend widows and\r\norphans, restore the things that are gone to decay, maintain\r\nthe things that are restored, punish and reform what is amiss,\r\nand confirm what is in good order....\"\r\n\r\n\"And how did you like the procession, mate?\" I asked an old man\r\non a bench in Green Park.\r\n\r\n\"'Ow did I like it? A bloomin' good chawnce, sez I to myself,\r\nfor a sleep, wi' all the coppers aw'y, so I turned into the\r\ncorner there, along wi' fifty others. But I couldn't sleep,\r\na-lyin' there 'ungry an' thinkin' 'ow I'd worked all the years\r\n'o my life, an' now 'ad no plyce to rest my 'ead; an' the music\r\ncomin' to me, an' the cheers an' cannon, till I got almost\r\na hanarchist an' wanted to blow out the brains o' the Lord\r\nChamberlain.\"\r\n\r\nWhy the Lord Chamberlain I could not precisely see, nor could\r\nhe, but that was the way he felt, he said conclusively, and\r\nthere was no more discussion....\r\n\r\nAt three in the morning I strolled up the Embankment. It was\r\na gala night for the homeless, for the police were elsewhere;\r\nand each bench was jammed with sleeping occupants. There were\r\nas many women as men, and the great majority of them, male and\r\nfemale, were old. Occasionally a boy was to be seen. On one\r\nbench I noticed a family, a man sitting upright with a sleeping\r\nbabe in his arms, his wife asleep, her head on his shoulder,\r\nand in her lap the head of a sleeping youngster. The man's eyes\r\nwere wide open. He was staring out over the water and thinking,\r\nwhich is not a good thing for a shelterless man with a family\r\nto do. It would not be a pleasant thing to speculate upon his\r\nthoughts; but this I know, and all London knows, that the\r\ncases of out-of-works killing their wives and babies is not an\r\nuncommon happening.\r\n\r\nOne cannot walk along the Thames Embankment, in the small hours\r\nof morning, from the Houses of Parliament, past Cleopatra's\r\nNeedle, to Waterloo Bridge, without being reminded of the\r\nsufferings, seven and twenty centuries old, recited by the\r\nauthor of \"Job\":--\r\n\r\n\"There are that remove the landmarks; they violently take away\r\nflocks and feed them.\r\n\r\n\"They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the\r\nwidow's ox for a pledge.\r\n\r\n\"They turn the needy out of the way; the poor of the earth hide\r\nthemselves together.\r\n\r\n\"Behold, as wild asses in the desert they go forth to their\r\nwork, seeking diligently for meat; the wilderness yieldeth them\r\nfood for their children.\r\n\r\n\"They cut their provender in the field, and they glean the\r\nvintage of the wicked.\r\n\r\n\"They lie all night naked without clothing, and have no\r\ncovering in the cold.\r\n\r\n\"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace\r\nthe rock for want of a shelter.\r\n\r\n\"There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take\r\na pledge of the poor.\r\n\r\n\"So that they go about naked without clothing, and being an\r\nhungered they carry the sheaves.\"\r\n\r\nSeven and twenty centuries agone!

LOWES DICKINSON\r\n\r\n(See page 510)\r\n\r\nLike the prince in the fable, you seem to have released from\r\nhis prison the genie of competition, only to find that you are\r\nunable to control him. Your legislation for the past hundred\r\nyears is a perpetual and fruitless effort to regulate the\r\ndisorders of your economic system. Your poor, your drunk,\r\nyour incompetent, your aged, ride you like a nightmare. You\r\nhave dissolved all human and personal ties, and you endeavor,\r\nin vain, to replace them by the impersonal activity of the\r\nState. The salient characteristic of your civilization is\r\nits irresponsibility. You have liberated forces you cannot\r\ncontrol; you are caught yourselves in your own levers and cogs.\r\nIn every department of business you are substituting for the\r\nindividual the company, for the workman the tool. The making\r\nof dividends is a universal preoccupation; the well-being of\r\nthe laborer is no one's concern but the State's. And this\r\nconcern even the State is incompetent to undertake, for the\r\nfactors by which it is determined are beyond its control.\r\nYou depend on variations of supply and demand which you can\r\nneither determine nor anticipate. The failure of a harvest, the\r\nmodification of a tariff in some remote country, dislocates the\r\nindustry of millions, thousands of miles away. You are at the\r\nmercy of a prospector's luck, an inventor's genius, a woman's\r\ncaprice--nay, you are at the mercy of your own instruments.\r\nYour capital is alive, and cries for food; starve it and it\r\nturns and throttles you. You produce, not because you will,\r\nbut because you must; you consume, not what you choose, but\r\nwhat is forced upon you. Never was any trade so bound as this\r\nwhich you call free; but it is bound, not by a reasonable will,\r\nbut by the accumulated irrationality of caprice.\r\n\r\n\r\nUtopia\r\n\r\nBY SIR THOMAS MORE\r\n\r\n(See pages 160, 490)\r\n\r\nWhen I consider and way in my mind all these common wealthes,\r\nwhich now a dayes any where do florish, so god helpe me, I\r\ncan perceave nothing but a certain conspiracy of riche men\r\nprocuringe theire owne commodities under the name and title\r\nof the commen wealth. They invent and devise all meanes and\r\ncraftes, first how to kepe safely, without feare of losing,\r\nthat they have unjustly gathered together, and next how to hire\r\nand abuse the worke and laboure of the poore for as litle money\r\nas may be.

It is interesting to note\r\n how this change of environment altered not merely his point of view,\r\n but even his literary style. The following narrative has the clarity\r\n and delicacy of the best French prose. It is the story of an Italian\r\n workingman)\r\n\r\n\"I was born naked and stupid, like you and everybody else;\r\nin my youth I dreamed of a rich wife; when I was a soldier I\r\nstudied in order to pass the examination for an officer's rank.\r\nI was twenty-three when I felt that all was not as it should be\r\nin this world, and that it was a shame to live as if it were....\r\n\r\n\"We, our whole regiment, were sent to Bologna. The peasantry\r\nthere were in revolt, some demanding that the rent of land\r\nshould be lowered, others shouting about the necessity for\r\nraising wages: both parties seemed to be in the wrong. 'To\r\nlower rents and increase wages, what nonsense!' thought\r\nI. 'That would ruin the landowners.' To me, who was a\r\ntown-dweller, it seemed utter foolishness. I was very\r\nindignant--the heat helped to make one so, and the constant\r\ntravelling from place to place and the mounting guard at night.\r\nFor, you know, these fine fellows were breaking the machinery\r\nbelonging to the landowners; and it pleased them to burn the\r\ncorn and to try to spoil everything that did not belong to\r\nthem. Just think of it!\"\r\n\r\nHe sipped his wine and, becoming more animated, went on: \"They\r\nroamed about the fields in droves like sheep, always silently,\r\nand as if they meant business. We used to scatter them,\r\nthreatening them with our bayonets sometimes. Now and then\r\nwe struck them with the butts of our rifles. Without showing\r\nmuch fear, they dispersed in leisurely fashion, but always\r\ncame together again. It was a tedious business, like mass,\r\nand it lasted for days, like an attack of fever. Luoto, our\r\nnon-commissioned officer, a fine fellow from Abruzzi, himself a\r\npeasant, was anxious and troubled: he turned quite yellow and\r\nthin, and more than once he said to us:\r\n\r\n\"'It's a bad business, boys; it will probably be necessary to\r\nshoot, damn it!'\r\n\r\n\"His grumbling upset us still more; and then, you know, from\r\nevery corner, from every hillock and tree we could see peeping\r\nthe obstinate heads of the peasants; their angry eyes seemed to\r\npierce us. For these people, naturally enough, did not regard\r\nus in a very friendly light....\r\n\r\n\"Once I stood on a small hillock near an olive grove, guarding\r\nsome trees which the peasants had been injuring. At the bottom\r\nof the hill two men were at work, an old man and a youth. They\r\nwere digging a ditch. It was very hot, the sun burnt like fire,\r\none felt irritable, longed to be a fish, and I remember I eyed\r\nthem angrily. At noon they both left off work, and got out some\r\nbread and cheese and a jug of wine. 'Oh, devil take them!'\r\nthought I to myself. Suddenly the old man, who previously had\r\nnot once looked at me, said something to the youth, who shook\r\nhis head disapprovingly, but the old man shouted: 'Go on!' He\r\nsaid this very sternly.\r\n\r\n\"The youth came up to me with the jug in his hand, and said,\r\nnot very willingly, you know: 'My father thinks that you would\r\nlike a drink and offers you some wine.'\r\n\r\n\"I felt embarrassed, but I was pleased. I refused, nodding at\r\nthe same time to the old man and thanking him. He responded by\r\nlooking at the sky. 'Drink it, signor, drink it. We offer this\r\nto you as a man, not as a soldier. We do not expect a soldier\r\nto become kinder because he has drunk our wine!'\r\n\r\n\"'D-- you, don't get nasty,' I thought to myself, and having\r\ndrunk about three mouthfuls I thanked him. Then they began\r\nto eat down below. A little later I was relieved by Ugo from\r\nSalertino. I told him quietly that these two peasants were\r\ngood fellows. The same night, as I stood at the door of a barn\r\nwhere the machinery was kept, a slate fell on my head from the\r\nroof. It did not do much damage, but another slate, striking my\r\nshoulder edgewise, hurt me so severely that my left arm dropped\r\nbenumbed.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker burst into a loud laugh, his mouth wide open, his\r\neyes half-closed. \"Slates, stones, sticks,\" said he, through\r\nhis laughter, \"in those days and at that place were alive. This\r\nindependent action of lifeless things made some pretty big\r\nbumps on our heads. Wherever a soldier stood or walked, a stick\r\nwould suddenly fly at him from the ground, or a stone fall upon\r\nhim from the sky. It made us savage, as you can guess.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of his companion became sad, his face turned pale and\r\nhe said quietly: \"One always feels ashamed to hear of such\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is one to do? People take time to get wise. Then I called\r\nfor help. I was led into a house where another fellow lay, his\r\nface cut by a stone. When I asked him how it happened he said,\r\nsmiling, but not with mirth:\r\n\r\n\"'An old woman, comrade, an old gray witch struck me, and then\r\nproposed that I should kill her!'\r\n\r\n\"'Was she arrested?'\r\n\r\n\"'I said that I had done it myself, that I had fallen and hurt\r\nmyself. The commander did not believe it, I could see it by his\r\neyes. But, don't you see, it was awkward to confess that I had\r\nbeen wounded by an old woman. Eh? The devil! Of course they are\r\nhard pressed, and one can understand that they do not love us!'\r\n\r\n\"'H'm!' thought I. The doctor came and two ladies with him, one\r\nof them fair and very pretty, evidently a Venetian. I don't\r\nremember the other. They looked at my wound. It was slight, of\r\ncourse. They applied a poultice and went away....\r\n\r\n\"My comrade and I used to sit at the window. We sat in such a\r\nway that the light did not fall on us, and there once we heard\r\nthe charming voice of this fair lady. She and her companion\r\nwere walking with the doctor in the garden outside the window\r\nand talking in French, which I understand very well.\r\n\r\n\"'Did you notice the color of his eyes?' she asked. 'He is a\r\npeasant of course, and once he has taken off his uniform will\r\nno doubt become a Socialist, like all of them here. People with\r\neyes like that want to conquer the whole of life, to drive us\r\nout, to destroy us in order that some blind, tedious justice\r\nshould triumph!'\r\n\r\n\"'Foolish fellows,' said the doctor--'half children, half\r\nbrutes.'\r\n\r\n\"'Brutes, that is quite true. But what is there childish about\r\nthem?'\r\n\r\n\"'What about those dreams of universal equality?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, just imagine it. The fellow with the eyes of an ox, and\r\nthe other with the face of a bird--our equals! You and I their\r\nequals, the equals of these people of inferior blood! People\r\nwho can be bidden to come and kill their fellows, brutes like\r\nthem.' ...\r\n\r\n\"She spoke much and vehemently. I listened and thought: 'Quite\r\nright, signora.' I had seen her more than once; and you know,\r\nof course, that no one dreams more ardently of a woman than a\r\nsoldier. I imagined her to be kind and clever and warm-hearted;\r\nand at that time I had an idea that the landed nobility were\r\nespecially clever, or gifted, or something of the kind. I don't\r\nknow why!\r\n\r\n\"I asked my comrade: 'Do you understand this language?'\r\n\r\n\"No, he did not understand. Then I translated for him the\r\nfair lady's speech. The fellow got as angry as the devil, and\r\nstarted to jump about the room, his one eye glistening--the\r\nother was bandaged.\r\n\r\n\"'Is that so?' he murmured. 'Is that possible? She makes use\r\nof me and does not look upon me as a man. For her sake I allow\r\nmy dignity to be offended and she denies it. For the sake of\r\nguarding her property I risk losing my soul.'\r\n\r\n\"He was not a fool and felt that he had been very much\r\ninsulted, and so did I. The following day we talked about this\r\nlady in a loud voice, not heeding Luoto, who only muttered:\r\n\r\n\"'Be careful, boys; don't forget that you are soldiers, and\r\nthat there is such a thing as discipline.'\r\n\r\n\"No, we did not forget it. But many of us, almost all, to tell\r\nyou the truth, became deaf and blind, and these young peasants\r\nmade use of our deafness and blindness to very good purpose.\r\nThey won. They treated us very well indeed. The fair lady could\r\nhave learnt from them: for instance, they could have taught\r\nher very convincingly how honest people should be valued. When\r\nwe left the place whither we had come with the idea of shedding\r\nblood, many of us were given flowers. As we marched along the\r\nstreets of the village, not stones and slates but flowers\r\nwere thrown at us, my friend. I think we had deserved it. One\r\nmay forget a cool reception when one has received such a good\r\nsend-off.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rights of Man\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS PAINE\r\n\r\n(English radical writer, who took a prominent part in the\r\nAmerican and French revolutions; 1737-1809)\r\n\r\nThe superstitious awe, the enslaving reverence, that formerly\r\nsurrounded affluence, is passing away in all countries,\r\nand leaving the possessor of property to the convulsion of\r\naccidents. When wealth and splendor, instead of fascinating the\r\nmultitude, excite emotions of disgust; when, instead of drawing\r\nforth admiration, it is beheld as an insult upon wretchedness;\r\nwhen the ostentatious appearance it makes serves to call the\r\nright of it in question, the case of property becomes critical,\r\nand it is only in a system of justice that the possessor can\r\ncontemplate security.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY OTTO VON BISMARCK\r\n\r\n(German statesman, 1815-1898)\r\n\r\nI believe that those who profess horror at the intervention of\r\nthe state for the protection of the weak lay themselves open to\r\nthe suspicion that they are desirous of using their strength\r\nfor the benefit of a portion, for the oppression of the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Demand of Labor\r\n\r\nBY ABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\n\r\n (President of the United States; 1809-1865. A frequently quoted\r\n passage attributed to Lincoln, prophesying the developments of modern\r\n capitalist industry, has been proven to be spurious. It therefore\r\n seems worth stating that the passages quoted in this volume have been\r\n duly verified)\r\n\r\nInasmuch as most good things are produced by labor, it follows\r\nthat all such things ought to belong to those whose labor has\r\nproduced them. But it has happened in all ages of the world\r\nthat some have labored, and others, without labor, have enjoyed\r\na large proportion of the fruits. This is wrong, and should\r\nnot continue. To secure to each laborer the whole product of\r\nhis labor as nearly as possible is a worthy object of any good\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nBryanism\r\n\r\n(_From the New York \"Tribune\"_)\r\n\r\n (The following passage is given space as a curiosity of the\r\n class-struggle, and by way of encouragement to social reformers who\r\n may suffer under the lash of capitalist abuse. It is from an editorial\r\n published in one of New York City's most conservative and respectable\r\n journals on the day after the presidential election of 1896; its\r\n subject is the Hon. William Jennings Bryan, now a conservative and\r\n plodding Secretary of State)\r\n\r\nThe thing was conceived in iniquity and was brought forth in\r\nsin. It had its origin in a malicious conspiracy against the\r\nhonor and integrity of the nation. It gained such monstrous\r\ngrowth as it enjoyed from an assiduous culture of the basest\r\npassions of the least worthy members of the community. It has\r\nbeen defeated and destroyed because right is right and God\r\nis God. Its nominal head was worthy of the cause. Nominal,\r\nbecause the wretched, rattle-pated boy, posing in vapid vanity\r\nand mouthing resounding rottenness, was not the real leader of\r\nthat league of hell. He was only a puppet in the blood-imbued\r\nhands of Altgeld, the anarchist, and Debs, the revolutionist,\r\nand other desperadoes of that stripe. But he was a willing\r\npuppet, Bryan was--willing and eager. Not one of his masters\r\nwas more apt than he at lies and forgeries and blasphemies\r\nand all the nameless iniquities of that campaign against the\r\nTen Commandments. He goes down with the cause, and must abide\r\nwith it in the history of infamy. He had less provocation than\r\nBenedict Arnold, less intellectual force than Aaron Burr,\r\nless manliness and courage than Jefferson Davis. He was the\r\nrival of them all in deliberate wickedness and treason to\r\nthe Republic. His name belongs with theirs, neither the most\r\nbrilliant nor the most hateful of the list.

And\r\nyou, yourselves--have you forgotten the infamous rôle, the\r\npitiful, sinister comedy they played in the last strike? How,\r\nhaving pushed the workers to a desperate resistance, they gave\r\nthem up weakened, despoiled, bound hands and feet, to the\r\nmaster--the very day where a last effort, a last surge, would\r\nhave compelled him, perhaps, to surrender? Ah, no indeed! I\r\nhave not wished that intriguers, under the pretext of defending\r\nyou, should come to impose upon you combinations--wherein\r\nyou are nothing but a means to maintain and increase their\r\npolitical power--a prey to satisfy their political appetites!\r\nYou have nothing in common with those people! Their interests\r\nare not any more yours--than those of the usurer and the\r\ncreditor, of the assassin and his victim!\r\n\r\nVOICE:--Bravo! It's true! Down with politics! Down with the\r\ndeputies!\r\n\r\nJEAN:--Understand, then, that they exist only by your\r\ncredulity! Your brutalization, they exploit it as a farm--your\r\nservitude, they treat it as an income.

It will appear in the course of\r\nthis address that hitherto all the advance in the German nation\r\nhas originated with the common people; that hitherto all the\r\ngreat national interests have, in the first instance, been\r\nthe affair of the people, have been taken in hand and pushed\r\nforward by the body of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duty of Civil Disobedience\r\n\r\nBY HENRY DAVID THOREAU\r\n\r\n(See pages 295, 600)\r\n\r\nThe mass of men serve the State thus, not as men mainly, but\r\nas machines, with their bodies.

What mattered the stains, the egotism and greed of\r\npoliticians, if humanity were still on the march, ever slowly\r\nand stubbornly stepping forward! What mattered, too, that\r\ncorrupt and emasculate _bourgeoisie_, nowadays as moribund as\r\nthe aristocracy, whose place it took, if behind it there ever\r\ncame the inexhaustible reserve of men who surged up from the\r\nmasses of the country-side and the towns!... If in the depths\r\nof pestilential workshops and factories the slavery of ancient\r\ntimes subsisted in the wage-earning system, if men still died\r\nof want on their pallets like broken-down beasts of burden,\r\nit was nevertheless a fact that once already, on a memorable\r\nday of tempest, Liberty sprang forth from the vat to wing\r\nher flight throughout the world.

Through his thirty-five pounds of skin and bone there\r\nran a tremor of fear, and he struggled forward to tie a broken\r\nthread. I attracted his attention by a touch, and offered him a\r\nsilver dime. He looked at me dumbly through a face that might\r\nhave belonged to a man of sixty, so furrowed, tightly drawn,\r\nand full of pain it was. He did not reach for the money--he\r\ndid not know what it was. There were dozens of such children,\r\nin this particular mill. A physician who was with me said that\r\nthey would all be dead probably in two years, and their places\r\nfilled by others--there were plenty more. Pneumonia carries off\r\nmost of them. Their systems are ripe for disease, and when it\r\ncomes there is no rebound--no response. Medicine simply does\r\nnot act--nature is whipped, beaten, discouraged, and the child\r\nsinks into a stupor and dies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flower Factory\r\n\r\nBY FLORENCE WILKINSON EVANS\r\n\r\n(Contemporary American poetess)\r\n\r\n    Lizabetta, Marianina, Fiametta, Teresina,\r\n    They are winding stems of roses, one by one, one by one,\r\n    Little children who have never learned to play;\r\n    Teresina softly crying that her fingers ache to-day;\r\n\r\n    Tiny Fiametta nodding, when the twilight slips in, gray.\r\n    High above the clattering street, ambulance and fire-gong beat,\r\n    They sit, curling crimson petals, one by one, one by one.\r\n\r\n    Lizabetta, Marianina, Fiametta, Teresina,\r\n    They have never seen a rose-bush nor a dew-drop in the sun.\r\n    They will dream of the vendetta, Teresina, Fiametta,\r\n    Of a Black Hand and a Face behind a grating;\r\n    They will dream of cotton petals, endless, crimson, suffocating,\r\n    Never of a wild rose thicket or the singing of a cricket,\r\n    But the ambulance will bellow through the wanness of their dreams,\r\n    And their tired lids will flutter with the street's hysteric screams.\r\n\r\n    Lizabetta, Marianina, Fiametta, Teresina,\r\n    They are winding stems of roses, one by one, one by one.\r\n    Let them have a long, long play-time, Lord of Toil, when toil is done,\r\n    Fill their baby hands with roses, joyous roses of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beast\r\n\r\nBY BEN B. LINDSEY AND HARVEY J. O'HIGGINS\r\n\r\n (\"The Children's Judge,\" who founded the first children's court\r\n in America, tells the story of his long fight with the powers of\r\n privilege in Colorado. In the following extract, he narrates what came\r\n of a newspaper interview on the subject of the revolting conditions\r\n under which children were kept in prison)\r\n\r\nThe result was an article that took even _my_ breath away when\r\nI read it next day on the front page of the newspaper. It was\r\nthe talk of the town. It was certainly the talk of the Police\r\nBoard; and Mr. Frank Adams talked to the reporters in a high\r\nvoice, indiscreetly. He declared that the boys were liars, that\r\nI was \"crazy,\" and that conditions in the jails were as good\r\nas they could be. This reply was exactly what we wished. I\r\ndemanded an investigation. The Board professed to be willing,\r\nbut set no date. We promptly set one _for_ them--the following\r\nThursday at two o'clock in my chambers at the Court House--and\r\nI invited to the hearing Governor Peabody, Mayor Wright,\r\nfifteen prominent ministers in the city, and the Police Board\r\nand some members of the City Council.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday morning--to my horror--I learned from a friendly\r\nDeputy Sheriff that the subpœnas I had ordered sent to a number\r\nof boys whom I knew as jail victims had not been served. I had\r\nno witnesses. And in three hours the hearing was to begin. I\r\nappealed to the Deputy Sheriff to help me. He admitted that he\r\ncould not get the boys in less than two days. \"Well then,\" I\r\nsaid, \"for heaven's sake, get me Mickey.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mickey? Well, Mickey was known to fame as \"the worst kid\r\nin town.\" As such, his portrait had been printed in the\r\nnewspapers--posed with his shine-box over his shoulder, a\r\ncigarette in the corner of his grin, his thumbs under his\r\nsuspenders at the shoulders, his feet crossed in an attitude\r\nof nonchalant youthful deviltry. He had been brought before\r\nme more than once on charges of truancy, and I had been using\r\nhim in an attempt to organize a newsboys' association under\r\nthe supervision of the court. Moreover, he had been one of the\r\nboys who had been beaten by the jailer, and I knew he would be\r\ngrateful to me for defending him.\r\n\r\nIt was midday before the Sheriff brought him to me. \"Mickey,\" I\r\nsaid, \"I'm in trouble, and you've got to help me out of it. You\r\nknow I helped _you_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Betcher life yuh did, Judge,\" he said. \"I'm wit' yuh. W'at d'\r\nyuh want?\"\r\n\r\nI told him what I wanted--every boy that he could get, who\r\nhad been in jail. \"And they've got to be in this room by two\r\no'clock. Can you do it?\"\r\n\r\nMickey threw out his dirty little hand. \"Sure I kin. Don't yuh\r\nworry, Judge. Get me a wheel--dhat's all.\"\r\n\r\nI hurried out with him and got him a bicycle, and he flew off\r\ndown Sixteenth Street on it, his legs so short that his feet\r\ncould only follow the pedals half way round. I went back to my\r\nchambers to wait....\r\n\r\nAs two o'clock approached, the ministers began to come into my\r\nroom, one by one, and take seats in readiness. Mr. Wilson of\r\nthe Police Board arrived to represent his fellow-commissioners.\r\nThe Deputy District Attorney came, the president of the upper\r\nbranch of the City Council came, Mayor Wright came, and even\r\nGovernor Peabody came--but no boys! I felt like a man who had\r\nordered a big dinner in a strange restaurant for a party of\r\nfriends, and then found that he had not brought his purse....\r\nI was just about to begin my apologies when I heard an excited\r\npatter of small feet on the stairs and the shuffle and crowding\r\nof Mickey's cohorts outside in the hall. I threw open the door.\r\n\"I got 'em, Judge,\" Mickey cried.\r\n\r\nHe had them--to the number of about twenty. I shook him by the\r\nshoulder, speechless with relief. \"I tol' yuh we'd stan' by\r\nyuh, Judge,\" he grinned.\r\n\r\nHe had the worst lot of little jailbirds that ever saw the\r\ninside of a county court, and he pointed out the gem of his\r\ncollection proudly--\"Skinny,\" a lad in his teens, who had been\r\nin jail twenty-two times!\" All right, boys,\" I told them, \"I\r\ndon't know you all, but I'll take Mickey's word for you. You've\r\nall been in jail and you know what you do there--all the dirty\r\nthings you hear and see and do yourselves. I want you to tell\r\nsome gentlemen in here about it. Don't be scared. They're your\r\nfriends the same as I am. The cops say you've been lying to me\r\nabout the way things are down in the jails there, and I want\r\nyou to tell the truth. Nothing but the truth, now. Mickey, you\r\npick them out and send them in one by one--your best witnesses\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\nI went back to my chambers. \"Gentlemen,\" I said, \"we're ready.\"\r\n\r\nI sat down at the big table with the Governor at my right, the\r\nMayor at my left and the president of the Board of Supervisors\r\nand Police Commissioner Wilson at either end of the table. The\r\nministers seated themselves in the chairs about my room. (We\r\nallowed no newspaper reporters in, because I knew what sort of\r\nvile and unprintable testimony was coming.) Mickey sent in his\r\nfirst witness.\r\n\r\nOne by one, as the boys came, I impressed upon them the\r\nnecessity of telling the truth, encouraged them to talk, and\r\ntried to put them at their ease. I started each by asking him\r\nhow often he had been in jail, what he had seen there, and so\r\nforth. Then I sat back and let him tell his story.\r\n\r\nAnd the things they told would raise your hair. I saw the\r\nblushes rise to the foreheads of some of the ministers at\r\nthe first details. As we went on, the perspiration stood\r\non their faces. Some sat pale, staring appalled at these\r\nfreckled youngsters from whose little lips, in a sort of\r\ninfantile eagerness to tell all they knew, there came stories\r\nof bestiality that were the more horrible because they were\r\nso innocently, so boldly given. It was enough to make a man\r\nweep; and indeed tears of compassionate shame came to the\r\neyes of more than one father there, as he listened. One boy\r\nbroke down and cried when he told of the vile indecencies\r\nthat had been committed upon him by the older criminals; and\r\nI saw the muscles working in the clenched jaws of some of our\r\n\"investigating committee\"--saw them swallowing the lump in the\r\nthroat--saw them looking down at the floor blinkingly, afraid\r\nof losing their self-control. The Police Commissioner made the\r\nmistake of cross-examining the first boy, but the frank answers\r\nhe got only exposed worse matters. The boys came and came, till\r\nat last, a Catholic priest, Father O'Ryan, cried out: \"My God!\r\nI have had enough!\" Governor Peabody said hoarsely: \"I never\r\nknew there was such immorality _in the world_!\" Some one else\r\nput in, \"It's awful,--awful!\" in a half groan.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" I said, \"there have been over two thousand Denver\r\nboys put through those jails and those conditions, in the last\r\nfive years. Do you think it should go on any longer?\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Peabody arose. \"No,\" he said; \"no. Never in my life\r\nhave I heard of so much rot--corruption--vileness--as I've\r\nheard today from the mouths of these babies. I want to tell\r\nyou that nothing I can do in my administration can be of more\r\nimportance--nothing I can do will I do more gladly than sign\r\nthose bills that Judge Lindsey is trying to get through the\r\nLegislature to do away with these terrible conditions. And if,\"\r\nhe said, turning to the Police Commissioner, \"Judge Lindsey is\r\n'_crazy_,' I want my name written under his, among the _crazy_\r\npeople. And if any one says these boys are 'liars,' that man is\r\na liar himself!\"\r\n\r\nPhew! The \"committee of investigation\" dissolved, the boys\r\ntrooped away noisily, and the ministers went back to their\r\npulpits to voice the horror that had kept them silent in my\r\nsmall chamber of horrors for two hours. Their sermons went into\r\nthe newspapers under large black headlines; and by the end\r\nof the next week our juvenile court bills were passed by the\r\nLegislature and made law in Colorado.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cry of the Children\r\n\r\nBY ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING\r\n\r\n(See page 644)\r\n\r\n    Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,\r\n      Ere the sorrow comes with years?\r\n    They are leaning their young heads against their mothers--\r\n      And _that_ cannot stop their tears.\r\n    The young lambs are bleating in the meadows;\r\n      The young birds are chirping in the nest;\r\n    The young fawns are playing with the shadows;\r\n      The young flowers are blowing toward the west--\r\n    But the young, young children, O my brothers,\r\n      They are weeping bitterly!\r\n    They are weeping in the playtime of the others,\r\n      In the country of the free.\r\n\r\n    Do you question the young children in the sorrow\r\n      Why their tears are falling so?\r\n    The old man may weep for his to-morrow\r\n      Which is lost in Long Ago;\r\n    The old tree is leafless in the forest,\r\n      The old year is ending in the frost,\r\n    The old wound, if stricken, is the sorest,\r\n      The old hope is hardest to be lost:\r\n    But the young, young children, O my brothers,\r\n      Do you ask them why they stand\r\n    Weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers,\r\n      In our happy Fatherland?\r\n\r\n    They look up with their pale and sunken faces,\r\n      And their looks are sad to see,\r\n    For the man's hoary anguish draws and presses\r\n      Down the cheeks of infancy;\r\n    \"Your old earth,\" they say, \"is very dreary,\r\n      Our young feet,\" they say, \"are very weak;\r\n    Few paces have we taken, yet are weary--\r\n      Our grave-rest is very far to seek.\r\n    Ask the old why they weep, and not the children,\r\n      For the outside earth is cold,\r\n    And we young ones stand without, in our bewildering,\r\n      And the graves are for the old.\" ...\r\n\r\n    \"For oh,\" say the children, \"we are weary,\r\n      And we cannot run or leap;\r\n    If we cared for any meadows, it were merely\r\n      To drop down in them and sleep.\r\n    Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping,\r\n      We fall upon our faces, trying to go;\r\n    And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping,\r\n      The reddest flower would look as pale as snow.\r\n    For, all day, we drag our burden tiring\r\n      Through the coal-dark, underground,\r\n    Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron\r\n      In the factories, round and round.\r\n\r\n    \"For, all day, the wheels are droning, turning;\r\n      Their wind comes in our faces,\r\n    Till our hearts turn, our head, with pulses burning,\r\n      And the walls turn in their places:\r\n    Turns the sky in the high window blank and reeling,\r\n      Turns the long light that drops adown the wall,\r\n    Turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling,\r\n      All are turning, all the day, and we with all.\r\n    And all day, the iron wheels are droning,\r\n      And sometimes we could pray,\r\n    'O ye wheels,' (breaking out in a mad moaning)\r\n      'Stop! be silent for to-day!'\" ...\r\n\r\n    They look up, with their pale and sunken faces,\r\n      And their look is dread to see,\r\n    For they mind you of the angels in their places,\r\n      With eyes turned on Deity.\r\n    \"How long,\" they say, \"how long, O cruel nation,\r\n      Will you stand, to move the world, on a child's heart,--\r\n    Stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation,\r\n      And tread onward to your throne amid the mart?\r\n    Our blood splashes upward, O gold-heaper,\r\n      And your purple shows your path!\r\n    But the child's sob in the silence curses deeper\r\n      Than the strong man in his wrath.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChild Labor in England\r\n\r\n(_From \"An Industrial History of England\"_)\r\n\r\nBY HENRY DE B. GIBBINS\r\n\r\nSometimes regular traffickers would take the place of the\r\nmanufacturer, and transfer a number of children to a factory\r\ndistrict, and there keep them, generally in some dark cellar,\r\ntill they could hand them over to a mill owner in want of\r\nhands, who would come and examine their height, strength, and\r\nbodily capacities, exactly as did the slave owners in the\r\nAmerican markets. After that the children were simply at the\r\nmercy of their owners, nominally as apprentices, but in reality\r\nas mere slaves, who got no wages, and whom it was not worth\r\nwhile even to feed and clothe properly, because they were so\r\ncheap and their places could be so easily supplied. It was\r\noften arranged by the parish authorities, in order to get rid\r\nof imbeciles, that one idiot should be taken by the mill owner\r\nwith every twenty sane children. The fate of these unhappy\r\nidiots was even worse than that of the others. The secret of\r\ntheir final end has never been disclosed, but we can form some\r\nidea of their awful sufferings from the hardships of the other\r\nvictims to capitalist greed and cruelty. The hours of their\r\nlabor were only limited by exhaustion, after many modes of\r\ntorture had been unavailingly applied to force continued work.\r\nChildren were often worked sixteen hours a day, by day and by\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nMill Children\r\n\r\n(_From \"Processionals\"_)\r\n\r\nBY JOHN CURTIS UNDERWOOD\r\n\r\n(American poet, born 1874)\r\n\r\n    We have forgotten how to sing: our laughter is a godless thing:\r\nlistless and loud and shrill and sly.\r\n    We have forgotten how to smile.

It is fascinating to watch them, the new-born,\r\nthe next generation, swaying and stepping, with pretty little\r\nmimicries and graceful inventions all their own, with muscles\r\nthat move swiftly and easily, and bodies that leap airily,\r\nweaving rhythms never taught in dancing school.\r\n\r\nI have talked with these children, here, there, and everywhere,\r\nand they struck me as being bright as other children, and\r\nin many ways even brighter. They have most active little\r\nimaginations. Their capacity for projecting themselves into the\r\nrealm of romance and fantasy is remarkable. A joyous life is\r\nromping in their blood. They delight in music, and motion, and\r\ncolor, and very often they betray a startling beauty of face\r\nand form under their filth and rags.\r\n\r\nBut there is a Pied Piper of London Town who steals them all\r\naway. They disappear. One never sees them again, or anything\r\nthat suggests them. You may look for them in vain among the\r\ngeneration of grown-ups. Here you will find stunted forms, ugly\r\nfaces, and blunt and stolid minds. Grace, beauty, imagination,\r\nall the resiliency of mind and muscle, are gone. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, you may see a woman, not necessarily old, but twisted\r\nand deformed out of all womanhood, bloated and drunken, lift\r\nher draggled skirts and execute a few grotesque and lumbering\r\nsteps upon the pavement. It is a hint that she was once one of\r\nthose children who danced to the organ-grinder. Those grotesque\r\nand lumbering steps are all that is left of the promise of\r\nchildhood. In the befogged recesses of her brain has arisen\r\na fleeting memory that she was once a girl. The crowd closes\r\nin. Little girls are dancing beside her, about her, with all\r\nthe pretty graces she dimly recollects, but can no more than\r\nparody with her body. Then she pants for breath, exhausted, and\r\nstumbles out through the circle. But the little girls dance on.\r\n\r\nThe children of the Ghetto possess all the qualities which make\r\nfor noble manhood and womanhood; but the Ghetto itself, like\r\nan infuriated tigress turning on its young, turns upon and\r\ndestroys all these qualities, blots out the light and laughter,\r\nand moulds those it does not kill into sodden and forlorn\r\ncreatures, uncouth, degraded, and wretched below the beasts of\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlum Children\r\n\r\n(_From \"Songs of Joy\"_)\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM H.

Of this festive composition\r\neach boy had one porringer, and no more--except on occasions of\r\ngreat public rejoicing, when he had two ounces and a quarter\r\nof bread besides. The bowls never wanted washing. The boys\r\npolished them with their spoons till they shone again; and\r\nwhen they had performed this operation (which never took very\r\nlong, the spoons being nearly as long as the bowls) they would\r\nsit staring at the copper, with such eager eyes, as if they\r\ncould have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed;\r\nemploying themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers most\r\nassiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of\r\ngruel that might have been cast thereon. Boys have generally\r\nexcellent appetites. Oliver Twist and his companions suffered\r\nthe tortures of slow starvation for three months; at last they\r\ngot so voracious and wild with hunger, that one boy, who was\r\ntall for his age, and hadn't been used to that sort of thing\r\n(for his father had kept a small cook-shop), hinted darkly to\r\nhis companions, that unless he had another basin of gruel _per\r\ndiem_, he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the\r\nboy who slept next to him, who happened to be a weakly youth\r\nof tender age. He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly\r\nbelieved him. A council was held; lots were cast who should\r\nwalk up to the master after supper that evening, and ask for\r\nmore; and it fell to Oliver Twist.\r\n\r\nThis evening arrived; the boys took their places. The master,\r\nin his cook's uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his\r\npauper assistants ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was\r\nserved out; and a long grace was said over the short commons.\r\nThe gruel disappeared; the boys whispered to each other, and\r\nwinked at Oliver; while his next neighbors nudged him. Child as\r\nhe was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with misery.\r\nHe rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin and\r\nspoon in hand, said, somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, I want some more.\"\r\n\r\nThe master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale.\r\nHe gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for\r\nsome seconds, and then clung for support to the copper. The\r\nassistants were paralyzed with wonder; the boys with fear.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said the master at length, in a faint voice.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir,\" replied Oliver, \"I want some more.\"\r\n\r\nThe master aimed a blow at Oliver's head with the ladle;\r\npinioned him in his arms; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.\r\n\r\nThe board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble\r\nrushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing the\r\ngentleman in the high chair, said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir! Oliver Twist has asked\r\nfor more!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a general start. Horror was depicted on every\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\"For _more_!\" said Mr. Limbkins. \"Compose yourself, Bumble, and\r\nanswer me distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more,\r\nafter he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did, sir,\" replied Bumble.\r\n\r\n\"That boy will be hung,\" said the gentleman in the white\r\nwaistcoat. \"I know that boy will be hung.\"\r\n\r\nNobody controverted the prophetic gentleman's opinion. An\r\nanimated discussion took place. Oliver was ordered into instant\r\nconfinement; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside\r\nof the gate, offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who\r\nwould take Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish. In other\r\nwords, five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man\r\nor woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or\r\ncalling.\r\n\r\n\"I never was more convinced of anything in my life,\" said the\r\ngentleman in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and\r\nread the bill the next morning: \"I never was more convinced of\r\nanything in my life, than I am that that boy will come to be\r\nhung.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Children's Auction\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES MACKAY\r\n\r\n(English Chartist poet, 1814-1889)\r\n\r\n    Who bids for the little children--\r\n      Body, and soul and brain?\r\n    Who bids for the little children--\r\n      Young and without a stain?\r\n    \"Will no one bid,\" said England,\r\n      \"For their souls so pure and white,\r\n    And fit for all good or evil\r\n      The world on their page may write?\"\r\n\r\n    \"We bid,\" said Pest and Famine;\r\n      \"We bid for life and limb;\r\n    Fever and pain and squalor,\r\n      Their bright young eyes shall dim.\r\n    When the children grow too many,\r\n      We'll nurse them as our own,\r\n    And hide them in secret places\r\n      Where none may hear their moan.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I bid,\" said Beggary, howling;\r\n      \"I bid for them one and all!\r\n    I'll teach them a thousand lessons--\r\n      To lie, to skulk, to crawl!\r\n    They shall sleep in my lair like maggots,\r\n      They shall rot in the fair sunshine;\r\n    And if they serve my purpose\r\n      I hope they'll answer thine.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I'll bid you higher and higher,\"\r\n      Said Crime, with a wolfish grin;\r\n    \"For I love to lead the children\r\n      Through the pleasant paths of sin.\r\n    They shall swarm in the streets to pilfer,\r\n      They shall plague the broad highway,\r\n    They shall grow too old for pity\r\n      And ripe for the law to slay.\r\n\r\n    \"Give me the little children,\r\n      Ye good, ye rich, ye wise,\r\n    And let the busy world spin round\r\n      While ye shut your idle eyes;\r\n    And your judges shall have work,\r\n      And your lawyers wag the tongue,\r\n    And the jailers and policemen\r\n      Shall be fathers to the young!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA Modest Proposal\r\n\r\nBY JONATHAN SWIFT\r\n\r\n(English man of letters, 1667-1745; dean of St. Patrick's\r\nCathedral, Dublin. Master of the bitterest satiric pen in\r\nEnglish)\r\n\r\n (_From \"A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People\r\n from Being a Burthen to their Parents or Country, and for making them\r\n Beneficial to the Public\"_)\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great\r\ntown, or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the\r\nroads, and cabin-doors, crowded with beggars of the female\r\nsex, followed by three, four or six children, _all in rags_,\r\nand importuning every passenger for an alms. These mothers\r\ninstead of being able to work for their honest livelihood, are\r\nforced to employ all their time in strolling, to beg sustenance\r\nfor their helpless infants, who, as they grow up, either turn\r\nthieves for want of work, or leave their dear Native Country\r\nto fight for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the\r\nBarbadoes.\r\n\r\nI think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious\r\nnumber of children, in the arms, or on the backs, or at the\r\nheels of their mothers, and frequently of their fathers, is\r\nin the present deplorable state of the kingdom, a very great\r\nadditional grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a\r\nfair, cheap and easy method of making these children sound,\r\nuseful members of the commonwealth would deserve so well of the\r\npublic, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nBut my intention is very far from being confined to provide\r\nonly for the children of professed beggars, it is of much\r\ngreater extent, and shall take in the whole numbers of infants\r\nat a certain age, who are born of parents in effect as little\r\nable to support them, as those who demand our charity in the\r\nstreets....\r\n\r\nThere is another great advantage in my scheme, that it will\r\nprevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice\r\nof women murdering their bastard children, alas, too frequent\r\namong us, sacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to\r\navoid the expense, than the shame, which would move tears and\r\npity in the most savage and inhuman breast....\r\n\r\nI have been assured by a very knowing American of my\r\nacquaintance in London that a young healthy child well nursed\r\nis at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome\r\nfood, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no\r\ndoubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee, or a ragout.\r\n\r\nI do therefore humbly offer it to public consideration, that\r\nof the hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed,\r\ntwenty thousand may be reserved for breed, whereof only one\r\nfourth part to be males, which is more than we allow to sheep,\r\nblack-cattle, or swine; and my reason is that these children\r\nare seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much\r\nregarded by our savages; therefore only one male will be\r\nsufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred\r\nthousand may at a year old be offered in sale to the persons of\r\nquality, and fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the\r\nmother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to\r\nrender them plump, and fat for a good table....\r\n\r\nI am not so violently bent upon my own opinion, as to reject\r\nany offer, proposed by wise men, which shall be found equally\r\ninnocent, cheap, easy, and effectual. But before something of\r\nthat kind shall be advanced in contradiction to my scheme, and\r\noffering a better, I desire the author, or authors will be\r\npleased maturely to consider two points. First, as things now\r\nstand, how they will be able to find food and raiment for an\r\nhundred thousand useless mouths and backs. And secondly, there\r\nbeing a round million of creatures in human figure, throughout\r\nthis kingdom, whose whole subsistence put into a common stock,\r\nwould leave them in debt two millions of pounds sterling,\r\nadding those, who are beggars by profession, to the bulk of\r\nfarmers, cottagers and laborers with their wives and children,\r\nwho are beggars in effect. I desire those politicians, who\r\ndislike my overture, and may perhaps be so bold to attempt an\r\nanswer, that they will first ask the parents of these mortals,\r\nwhether they would not at this day think it a great happiness\r\nto have been sold for food at a year old, in the manner I\r\nprescribe, and thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of\r\nmisfortunes, as they have since gone through, by the oppression\r\nof landlords, the impossibility of paying rent without money or\r\ntrade, the want of common sustenance, with neither house nor\r\nclothes to cover them from the inclemencies of the weather, and\r\nthe most inevitable prospect of entailing the like, or greater\r\nmiseries upon their breed for ever.\r\n\r\nI profess in the sincerity of my heart that I have not the\r\nleast personal interest in endeavoring to promote this\r\nnecessary work, having no other motive than the _public good\r\nof my country, by advancing our trade, providing for infants,\r\nrelieving the poor, and giving some pleasure to the rich_.\r\nI have no children, by which I can propose to get a single\r\npenny; the youngest being nine years old, and my wife past\r\nchild-bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nChild Labor\r\n\r\nBY CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMAN\r\n\r\n(See pages 200, 209, 421)\r\n\r\n    No fledgling feeds the father bird!\r\n      No chicken feeds the hen!\r\n    No kitten mouses for the cat--\r\n      This glory is for men:\r\n\r\n    We are the Wisest, Strongest Race--\r\n      Loud may our praise be sung!\r\n    The only animal alive\r\n      That lives upon its young!\r\n\r\n\r\nMother Wept\r\n\r\nBY JOSEPH SKIPSEY\r\n\r\n(Contemporary English poet, whose work possesses a quaint\r\nsimplicity, often suggesting Blake)\r\n\r\n    Mother wept, and father sighed;\r\n      With delight a-glow\r\n    Cried the lad, \"Tomorrow,\" cried,\r\n      \"To the pit I go.\"\r\n\r\n    Up and down the place he sped,--\r\n      Greeted old and young;\r\n    Far and wide the tidings spread;\r\n      Clapped his hands and sung.\r\n\r\n    Came his cronies; some to gaze\r\n      Rapt in wonder; some\r\n    Free with counsel; some with praise;\r\n      Some with envy dumb.\r\n\r\n    \"May he,\" many a gossip cried,\r\n      \"Be from peril kept;\"\r\n    Father hid his face and sighed,\r\n      Mother turned and wept.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Workingman's Home-Life\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT TRESSALL\r\n\r\n (The life-story of an English house-painter who died of consumption,\r\n leaving behind him a manuscript portraying the pitiful lives of the\r\n half-starved English artisans.

Just the very\r\nthing I wanted.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Frankie amused himself playing with the kitten, which had\r\nbeen provided with another saucer of bread and milk, Owen went\r\ninto the bedroom to put on the dry clothes....\r\n\r\nAfter the child was in bed, Owen sat alone by the table in the\r\ndraughty sitting-room, thinking.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was a bright fire, the room was very cold, being\r\nso close to the roof. The wind roared loudly round the gables,\r\nshaking the house in a way that threatened every moment to hurl\r\nit to the ground.\r\n\r\nStaring abstractedly at the lamp, he thought of the future.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the future had seemed a region of wonderful\r\nand mysterious possibilities of good, but to-night the thought\r\nbrought no such illusions, for he knew that the story of the\r\nfuture was to be much the same as the story of the past. He\r\nwould continue to work, and they would all three have to go\r\nwithout most of the necessaries of life. When there was no work\r\nthey would starve.\r\n\r\nFor himself he did not care much, because he knew that, at\r\nthe best--or worst--it would be only a very few years. Even\r\nif he were able to have proper food and clothing, and take\r\nreasonable care of himself, he could not live much longer; but,\r\nwhen that time came, what was to become of _them_?\r\n\r\nThere would be some hope for the boy if he were more robust and\r\nif his character were less gentle and more selfish. In order to\r\nsucceed in the world it was necessary to be brutal, selfish,\r\nand unfeeling; to push others aside and to take advantage of\r\ntheir misfortunes.\r\n\r\nOwen stood up and began walking about the room, oppressed with\r\na kind of terror. Presently he returned to the fire and began\r\nrearranging his clothes that were drying. He found that the\r\nboots, having been placed too near the fire, had dried too\r\nquickly, and, consequently the sole of one of them had begun\r\nto split away from the upper. He remedied this as well as he\r\nwas able, and, while turning the wetter parts of the clothing\r\nto the fire, he noticed the newspaper in the coat pocket. He\r\ndrew it out with an exclamation of pleasure. Here was something\r\nto distract his thoughts. But, as soon as he opened the paper,\r\nhis attention was riveted by the staring headlines of one of\r\nthe principal columns: TERRIBLE DOMESTIC TRAGEDY. _Wife and Two\r\nChildren Killed. Suicide of the Murderer._\r\n\r\nIt was one of the ordinary crimes of poverty. The man had been\r\nwithout employment for many weeks and they had pawned or sold\r\ntheir furniture and other possessions. But even this resource\r\nmust have failed at last, and one day the neighbors noticed\r\nthat the blinds remained down and that there was a strange\r\nsilence about the house. When the police entered they found, in\r\none of the upper rooms, the dead bodies of the woman and the\r\ntwo children, with their throats cut, laid out side by side\r\nupon the bed, which was saturated with their blood.\r\n\r\nThere was no bedstead, and no furniture in the room except the\r\nstraw mattress and the ragged clothes and blankets upon the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThe man's body was found in the kitchen, lying with\r\noutstretched arms face downward on the floor, surrounded by\r\nthe blood from the terrible wound in his throat, which had\r\nevidently been inflicted by the razor that was grasped in his\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\nNo particle of food was found, but, attached to a nail in the\r\nkitchen wall, was a piece of blood-smeared paper, on which was\r\nwritten in pencil:\r\n\r\n\"This is not _my_ crime, but Society's.\"\r\n\r\nThe report went on to explain that the deed must have been\r\nperpetrated during a fit of temporary insanity brought on by\r\nthe sufferings the man had endured.\r\n\r\n\"Insanity!\" muttered Owen, as he read this glib theory.\r\n\"Insanity! It seems to me that he would have been insane if he\r\nhad _not_ killed them.\"\r\n\r\nSurely it was wiser and better and kinder to send them all to\r\nsleep than to let them continue to suffer.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it seemed strange that the man should have\r\nchosen to do it in that way, when there were so many other\r\ncleaner, easier, and less painful ways of accomplishing his\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nOne could take poison. Of course, there was a certain amount\r\nof difficulty in procuring it, and one would have to be very\r\ncareful not to select a poison that would cause a lot of pain.\r\n\r\nOwen went over to his bookshelf, and took down \"The Cyclopedia\r\nof Practical Medicine,\" an old, rather out-of-date book, which\r\nhe thought might contain the required information. He was\r\nastonished to find what a number of poisons there were within\r\neasy reach of whoever wished to make use of them: poisons\r\nwhich could be relied upon to do their work certainly, quickly,\r\nand without pain. Why, it was not even necessary to buy them;\r\none could gather them from the hedges by the roadside and in\r\nthe fields.\r\n\r\nThe more he thought of it the stranger it seemed that such a\r\nclumsy method as a razor should be so popular. Strangulation,\r\nor even hanging would be better than that, though the latter\r\nmethod could scarcely be adopted in their flat, because there\r\nwere no beams or rafters or anything from which it would be\r\npossible to suspend a cord. Still, he could drive some large\r\nnails or hooks into one of the walls. For that matter, there\r\nwere already some clothes hooks on some of the doors. He began\r\nto think that this would be a more excellent way than poison:\r\nhe could pretend to Frankie that he was going to show him some\r\nnew kind of play. The boy would offer no resistance, and in a\r\nfew minutes it would all be over.\r\n\r\nHe threw down the book and pressed his hands over his ears. He\r\nfancied he could hear the boy's hands and feet beating against\r\nthe panels of the door as he struggled in his death agony.\r\n\r\nThen, as his arms fell nervelessly by his side again, he\r\nthought he heard Frankie's voice calling:\r\n\r\n\"Dad! Dad!\"\r\n\r\nOwen hastily opened the door.\r\n\r\n\"Are you calling, Frankie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I've been calling you quite a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to come here. I want to tell you something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it, dear? I thought you were asleep a long time\r\nago,\" said Owen, as he came into the room.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I want to speak to you about. The kitten's\r\ngone to sleep all right, but I can't go. I've tried all\r\ndifferent ways, counting and all, but it's no use, so I thought\r\nI'd ask you if you'd mind coming and staying with me, and\r\nletting me hold your hand for a little while, and then p'raps I\r\ncould go.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy twined his arms round Owen's neck and hugged him very\r\ntightly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dad, I love you so much!\" he said. \"I love you so much I\r\ncould squeeze you to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you will, if you squeeze me so tightly as that.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy laughed softly as he relaxed his hold.\r\n\r\n\"That _would_ be a funny way of showing you how much I loved\r\nyou, wouldn't it, dad? Squeezing you to death!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I suppose it would,\" replied Owen, huskily, as he tucked\r\nthe bedclothes round the child's shoulders. \"But don't talk any\r\nmore, dear, just hold my hand and try to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nLying there very quietly, holding his father's hand and\r\noccasionally kissing it, the child presently fell asleep....\r\n\r\nOwen lay listening to the howling of the wind and the noise\r\nof the rain as it poured heavily on the roof. But it was not\r\nthe storm only that kept him awake. Through the dark hours of\r\nthe night his thoughts were still haunted by the words on that\r\npiece of blood-stained paper on a kitchen wall: \"This is not my\r\ncrime, but Society's.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBehold the Future\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Red Wave\"_)\r\n\r\nBY JOSEPH-HENRY ROSNY, THE ELDER\r\n\r\n(A glimpse of the home-life of a Syndicalist leader, an\r\ninteresting contrast with the passage from the English book\r\npreceding)\r\n\r\nFrançois raised the little chap in his arms. \"Well, my young\r\nrebel, are you happy to be alive? Tomorrow I will teach you a\r\nnew game: the dance of the bourgeois.\"\r\n\r\nHe seated himself in an arm-chair and gazed at the child with\r\nthe grave and persuasive eyes of a leader of men. \"You will\r\nbe a good Socialist, eh, little Antoine? You will love men;\r\nyou will not separate your life from that of others, like a\r\nRobinson Crusoe of egoism. _Vive la revolution!_\"\r\n\r\n\"_Vive la revolution!_\" cried the child.\r\n\r\n\"Behold the future!\" said François Rougemont, rocking the\r\nlittle one upon his knees. \"It will see the shining of the\r\ngreat dawn, the dawn of a humanity as different from our\r\nown as ours is different from the humanity of the pyramids.\r\nAh, my little man, you will know things beside which steam,\r\nelectricity, and radium are as nothing.

HANFORD HENDERSON\r\n\r\n(American educator; born 1861)\r\n\r\nOne will not talk economics in any formal way to children.\r\nIt is not necessary. But one cannot avoid the economic\r\nimplications upon which our current daily life and all history\r\nand literature quite obviously rest.\r\n\r\nChildren are very explicit in their interest. They want to know\r\nwhat the hero feeds upon, how he is dressed, where he sleeps.\r\nIf great deeds are in prospect, wars to be waged, palaces to\r\nbe built, pleasure parks to be laid out, princesses to be won,\r\ntourneys to be run off, the little reader has a keen eye for\r\nthe sinews of war. In every tale worth the telling, the hero\r\nsets out with the express purpose of seeking his fortune.\r\nParents and teachers do not have to drag in economics by the\r\nheels. They may, of course, ignore the question, and allow the\r\nchildren to grow up with confused and mediæval ideas; but if\r\nthey do so, they fail quite miserably to educate the children\r\nin the fundamentals of a moral individual and social life.\r\nThe bread-and-butter question must be met by each parent and\r\nteacher in his own personal life; and in dealing with the\r\nchildren, it must be met constantly and in the most unexpected\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat to Do\r\n\r\nBY LEO TOLSTOY\r\n\r\n(See pages 88, 110, 148, 276, 374, 416, 555)\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to take a child away from a prostitute, or from\r\na beggar. It is very easy, when one has money, to have him\r\nwashed, cleaned and dressed in good clothes, fed up, and even\r\ntaught various sciences; but for us who do not earn our own\r\nbread, it is not only difficult to teach him to earn his bread,\r\nit is impossible; because by our example, and even by those\r\nmaterial improvements of his life which cost us nothing, we\r\nteach the opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue Education\r\n\r\n(_From \"Zadig\"_)\r\n\r\nBY VOLTAIRE\r\n\r\n(French philosopher and poet, 1694-1778; a skeptic and bitter\r\nsatirist, imprisoned and exiled to England.

Without fear of deceiving ourselves,\r\nwe can restore the child to the environment which entices\r\nit, the environment of nature in which he will be in contact\r\nwith all that he loves, and in which impressions of life will\r\nreplace fastidious book-learning.

This typical American woman behaved very sensibly so long\r\nas her sensible father and mother were alive and until the\r\ncraze for English households arose. She fell into line. But\r\nthe haughty servants were most trying at first. For instance,\r\nshe loved bread spread with molasses. She ate it before the\r\nbutler once; his face told her what a hideous \"break\" she had\r\nmade. She tried to conquer this low taste--never did weak woman\r\nfight harder against the gnawings of sinful appetite. At last\r\nshe gave way, and in secret and in stealth indulged. She was\r\nnot caught and, encouraged, she proceeded to add one low common\r\nhabit to another until she was leading a double life. It had\r\nits terrors; it had its compensating joys. But before she had\r\ngone too far she was happily saved. One morning her maid caught\r\nher, and the whole household was agog.

I was the\r\ngrain of sand, and I resolved to become the diamond. I began\r\nby stealing two horses. I soon got a party of companions. I\r\nput myself in a condition to rob small caravans; and thus,\r\nby degrees, I destroyed the difference which had formerly\r\nsubsisted between me and other men.

I seized this castle\r\nby force. The satrap of Syria had a mind to dispossess me of\r\nit; but I was too rich to have anything to fear. I gave the\r\nsatrap a handsome present, by which I preserved my castle, and\r\nincreased my possessions. He even appointed me treasurer of\r\nthe tributes which Arabia Petraea pays to the king of kings.\r\nI perform my office of receiver with great punctuality; but I\r\ntake the freedom to dispense with that of paymaster.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Other 365 Days\r\n\r\nBY FRANKLIN P.

In the\r\nchoice of your profession or your business employment, let your\r\nfirst thought be: Where can I fit in so that I may be most\r\neffective in the work of the world? Where can I lend a hand in\r\na way most effective to advance the general interests? Enter\r\nlife in such a spirit, choose your vocation in that way, and\r\nyou have taken the first step on the highest road to a large\r\nsuccess. Investigation will show that the great fortunes which\r\nhave been made in this country, and the same is probably true\r\nof other lands, have come to men who have performed great and\r\nfar-reaching economic services--men who, with great faith in\r\nthe future of their country, have done most for the development\r\nof its resources.

In the following passage one of the most learned\r\nof the Penguins pays a visit to America)\r\n\r\nAfter a voyage of fifteen days his steamer entered, during the\r\nnight, the harbor of Titanport, where thousands of ships were\r\nanchored. An iron bridge thrown across the water and shining\r\nwith lights, stretched between two piers so far apart that\r\nProfessor Obnubile imagined he was sailing on the seas of\r\nSaturn, and that he saw the marvellous ring which girds the\r\nplanet of the Old Man. And this immense conduit bore upon it\r\nmore than a quarter of the wealth of the world. The learned\r\nPenguin, having disembarked, was waited on by automatons in a\r\nhotel forty-eight stories high. Then he took the great railway\r\nthat led to Gigantopolis, the capital of New Atlantic. In the\r\ntrain there were restaurants, gaming-rooms, athletic arenas,\r\ntelegraphic, commercial, and financial offices, a Protestant\r\nChurch, and the printing-office of a great newspaper, which\r\nlatter the doctor was unable to read, as he did not know the\r\nlanguage of the New Atlantans. The train passed along the banks\r\nof great rivers, through manufacturing cities which concealed\r\nthe sky with the smoke from their chimneys, towns black in the\r\nday, towns red at night, full of noise by day and full of noise\r\nalso by night.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" thought the doctor, \"is a people far too much engaged\r\nin industry and trade to make war. I am already certain that\r\nthe New Atlantans pursue a policy of peace. For it is an axiom\r\nadmitted by all economists that peace without and peace within\r\nare necessary for the progress of commerce and industry.\"\r\n\r\nAs he surveyed Gigantopolis, he was confirmed in this opinion.\r\nPeople went through the streets so swiftly propelled by hurry\r\nthat they knocked down all who were in their way. Obnubile was\r\nthrown down several times, but soon succeeded in learning how\r\nto demean himself better; after an hour's walking he himself\r\nknocked down an Atlantan.\r\n\r\nHaving reached a great square he saw the portico of a palace\r\nin the classic style, whose Corinthian columns reared their\r\ncapitals of arborescent acanthus seventy metres above the\r\nstylobate.\r\n\r\nAs he stood with his head thrown back admiring the building, a\r\nman of modest appearance approached him and said in Penguin:\r\n\r\n\"I see by your dress that you are from Penguinia.

Peoples who have neither commerce nor industry are not\r\nobliged to make war, but a business people is forced to adopt\r\na policy of conquest. The number of wars necessarily increases\r\nwith our productive capacity. As soon as one of our industries\r\nfails to find a market for its products a war is necessary to\r\nopen new outlets. It is in this way we have had a coal war, a\r\ncopper war, and a cotton war. In Third-Zealand we have killed\r\ntwo-thirds of the inhabitants in order to compel the remainder\r\nto buy our umbrellas and braces.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a fat man who was sitting in the middle of the\r\nassembly ascended the tribune.\r\n\r\n\"I claim,\" said he, \"a war against the Emerald Republic, which\r\ninsolently contends with our pigs for the hegemony of hams and\r\nsauces in all the markets of the universe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is that legislator?\" asked Doctor Obnubile.\r\n\r\n\"He is a pig merchant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any opposition?\" said the President. \"I put the\r\nproposition to the vote.\"\r\n\r\nThe war against the Emerald Republic was voted with uplifted\r\nhands by a very large majority.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Obnubile to the interpreter; \"you have voted a war\r\nwith that rapidity and that indifference!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! it is an unimportant war which will hardly cost eight\r\nmillion dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"And men....\"\r\n\r\n\"The men are included in the eight million dollars.\"\r\n\r\nThen Doctor Obnubile bent his head in bitter reflection.\r\n\r\n\"Since wealth and civilization admit of as many causes of\r\npoverty as war and barbarism, since the folly and wickedness\r\nof men are incurable, there remains but one good action to\r\nbe done.

The power of this wealth is being\r\n wielded in his name by a cynical and unscrupulous oligarchy which has\r\n reduced the populace to a uniformed slave-caste, seething with futile\r\n revolt. The following portrays the newspapers of that new world of\r\n Capitalism triumphant)\r\n\r\nBeyond this place they came into a closed hall, and Graham\r\ndiscovered the cause of the noise that had perplexed him.\r\nHis attention was arrested by a violent, loud hoot, followed\r\nby a vast leathery voice. He stopped and, looking up, beheld\r\na foolish trumpet face. This was the General Intelligence\r\nMachine. For a space it seemed to be gathering breath, and a\r\nregular throbbing from its cylindrical body was audible. Then\r\nit trumpeted \"Galloop, Galloop,\" and broke out again.\r\n\r\n\"Paris is now pacified. All resistance is over. Galloop! The\r\nblack police hold every position of importance in the city.\r\nThey fought with great bravery, singing songs written in\r\npraise of their ancestors by the poet Kipling.

Lively brave\r\nfellows. Let this be a lesson to the disorderly banderlog\r\nof this city. Yah! Banderlog! Filth of the earth! Galloop,\r\nGalloop!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice ceased. There was a confused murmur of disapproval\r\namong the crowd. \"Damned niggers.\" A man began to harangue\r\nnear them. \"Is this the Master's doing, brothers? Is this the\r\nMaster's doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Black police!\" said Graham. \"What is that? You don't mean----\"\r\n\r\nHis companion touched his arm and gave him a warning look, and\r\nforthwith another of these mechanisms screamed deafeningly and\r\ngave tongue in a shrill voice. \"Yahaha! Yahah, Yap! Hear a\r\nlive paper yelp! Live paper. Yaha! Shocking outrage in Paris.\r\nYahahah! The Parisians exasperated by the black police to the\r\npitch of assassination. Dreadful reprisals. Savage times come\r\nagain. Blood! Blood!

Speaking\r\ngenerally, the tendencies of literature, as hitherto pursued,\r\nhave been to make mostly critical and querulous men. It seems\r\nas if, so far, there were some natural repugnance between a\r\nliterary and professional life, and the rude rank spirit of\r\nthe democracies. There is, in later literature, a treatment\r\nof benevolence, a charity business, rife enough it is true;\r\nbut I know nothing more rare, even in this country, than a fit\r\nscientific estimate and reverent appreciation of the People--of\r\ntheir measureless wealth of latent worth and capacity, their\r\nvast, artistic contrasts of lights and shades--with, in\r\nAmerica, their entire reliability in emergencies, and a certain\r\nbreadth of historic grandeur, of peace or war, far surpassing\r\nall the vaunted samples of book-heroes, or any _haut ton_\r\ncoteries, in all the records of the world....\r\n\r\nDominion strong is the body's; dominion stronger is the mind's.\r\nWhat has filled, and fills today our intellect, our fancy,\r\nfurnishing the standards therein, is yet foreign. The great\r\npoems, Shakespeare's included, are poisonous to the idea of\r\nthe pride and dignity of the common people, the life-blood of\r\ndemocracy. The models of our literature, as we get it from\r\nother lands, ultramarine, have had their birth in courts, and\r\nbasked and grown in castle sunshine; all smells of princes'\r\nfavors. Of workers of a certain sort, we have, indeed, plenty,\r\ncontributing after their kind; many elegant, many learned,\r\nall complacent. But touched by the national test, or tried by\r\nthe standards of democratic personality, they wither to ashes.\r\nI say I have not seen a single writer, artist, lecturer, or\r\nwhat not, that has confronted the voiceless but ever erect and\r\nactive, pervading, underlying will and typic inspiration of the\r\nland, in a spirit kindred to itself. Do you call these genteel\r\nlittle creatures American poets? Do you term that perpetual,\r\npistareen, pastepot work, American art, American drama, taste,\r\nverse? I think I hear, echoed as from some mountain-top afar in\r\nthe west, the scornful laugh of the Genius of these States....\r\n\r\nDid you, too, O friend, suppose democracy was only for\r\nelections, for politics, and for a party name? I say democracy\r\nis only of use there that it may pass on and come to its flower\r\nand fruit in manners, in the highest forms of interaction\r\nbetween men, and their beliefs--in religion, literature,\r\ncolleges, and schools--democracy in all public and private\r\nlife, and in the army and navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nToday\r\n\r\nBY HELEN GRAY CONE\r\n\r\n(Contemporary American poet)\r\n\r\n    Voice, with what emulous fire thou singest free hearts of old fashion,\r\n      English scorners of Spain, sweeping the blue sea-way,\r\n    Sing me the daring of life for life, the magnanimous passion\r\n      Of man for man in the mean populous streets of To-day!\r\n\r\n    Hand, with what color and power thou couldst show, in the ring\r\nhot-sanded,\r\n      Brown Bestiarius holding the lean tawn tiger at bay,\r\n    Paint me the wrestle of Toil with the wild-beast Want, bare-handed;\r\n      Shadow me forth a soul steadily facing Today!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Art?\r\n\r\nBY LEO TOLSTOY\r\n\r\n(See pages 88, 110, 148, 276, 374, 416, 555, 674)\r\n\r\nArt of the future, that is to say, such part of art as will\r\nbe chosen from among all the art diffused among mankind,\r\nwill consist, not in transmitting feelings accessible only\r\nto members of the rich classes, as is the case today, but in\r\ntransmitting such feelings as embody the highest religious\r\nperceptions of our times. Only those productions will be\r\nconsidered art which transmit feelings drawing men together\r\nin brotherly union, or such universal feelings as can unite\r\nall men. Art transmitting feelings flowing from antiquated,\r\nworn-out religious teachings--church art, patriotic art,\r\nvoluptuous art, transmitting feelings of superstitious fear,\r\nof pride, of vanity, of ecstatic admiration for national\r\nheroes--art exciting exclusive love of one's own people, or\r\nsensuality, will be considered bad, harmful art, and will be\r\ncensured and despised by public opinion. All the rest of art,\r\ntransmitting feelings accessible only to a section of the\r\npeople, will be considered unimportant, and will be neither\r\nblamed nor praised. And the appraisement of art in general\r\nwill devolve, not, as is now the case, on a separate class\r\nof rich people, but on the whole people; so that for a work\r\nto be esteemed good, and to be approved of and diffused, it\r\nwill have to satisfy the demands, not of a few people living\r\nin identical and often unnatural conditions, but it will have\r\nto satisfy the demands of all those great masses of people who\r\nare situated in the natural conditions of laborious life. And\r\nthe artists producing art will not be, as now, merely a few\r\npeople selected from a small section of the nation, members of\r\nthe upper classes or their hangers-on, but will consist of all\r\nthose gifted members of the whole people who prove capable of,\r\nand are inclined towards, artistic activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Catechism for Workers\r\n\r\nBY AUGUST STRINDBERG\r\n\r\n (Swedish poet, dramatist and novelist, 1849-1912; author of over a\r\n hundred volumes, and probably the greatest genius that Sweden has\r\n produced. It is not generally known that he was a Socialist, although\r\n the labor unions and Social-democrats of his country marched in a body\r\n at his funeral. The following are a few paragraphs from a \"catechism\"\r\n covering every aspect of life from the worker's point of view)\r\n\r\n_What is philosophy_?\r\n\r\nA seeking of the truth.\r\n\r\n_Then how can philosophy be the friend of the upper classes?_\r\n\r\nThe upper classes pay the philosopher, in order that he may\r\ndiscover only such truths as are expedient in their eyes.\r\n\r\n_But suppose uncomfortable truths should be discovered?_\r\n\r\nThey are called lies, and the philosopher gets no pay.\r\n\r\n_What is history?_\r\n\r\nThe story of the past, presented in a light favorable to the\r\ninterests of the upper classes.\r\n\r\n_Suppose the light is unfavorable?_\r\n\r\nThat is scandalous.\r\n\r\n_What is a scandal?_\r\n\r\nAnything offending the upper classes.\r\n\r\n_What is esthetics?_\r\n\r\nThe art of praising or belittling works of art.\r\n\r\n_What works of art must be praised?_\r\n\r\nThose that glorify the upper classes.\r\n\r\nTherefore Raphael and Michaelangelo are the most famous\r\nartists, for they glorified the religious falsehoods of\r\nthe upper classes.

HERRON\r\n\r\n(American clergyman and college professor, born 1862; resigned\r\nto become an active Socialist)\r\n\r\nIt is customary to speak of the unpreparedness of the\r\nproletary for Socialism. But I am sure that, even today, the\r\nworking-class would give a vastly better organization of\r\nindustrial forces, a profoundly nobler and freer society, than\r\never the world has had. The ignorance of the working-class\r\nand the superior intelligence of the privileged class are\r\nsuperstitions--are superstitions fostered by intellectual\r\nmercenaries, by universities and churches, and by all\r\nthe centers of privilege. And the assumption of superior\r\nintelligence on the part of the privileged is not warranted by\r\na single historical experience. The derangements and miseries\r\nof mankind are precisely due to the ignorant and arrogant rule\r\nof \"superior\" classes and persons. The mental and spiritual\r\ncapacity of these classes is a myth; their so-called culture\r\nbut thinly veneers their essential savagery, their social\r\nrapacity and impudence....\r\n\r\nThe system that divides society into classes can bring forth no\r\ntrue knowledge, no living truth, no industrial competence, no\r\nfundamental social decency. It can only continue the desolation\r\nof labor and increase the blindness and depravity of the\r\nprivileged. So long as some people own the tools upon which\r\nothers depend for bread, so long as the few possess themselves\r\nof the fruits of the labor of the many, so long as the arts\r\nand the institutions and the sciences are built upon exploited\r\nworkers, just so long will our so-called progress be through\r\nthe perennial exhaustion of generations and races; just so long\r\nwill successive civilizations be but voracious parasites upon\r\nthe spirit and body of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Midnight Lunch Room\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Frozen Grail and Other Poems\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ELSA BARKER\r\n\r\n(See pages 315, 359)\r\n\r\n    With little silver one may enter here,\r\n      And yet those hungry faces watch outside\r\n      The frosty window--and the door is wide!\r\n    The clatter to my unaccustomed ear\r\n    Of dishes and harsh tongues, is like a spear\r\n      Shaken within the sensitive wounded side\r\n      Of Silence. Soiled, indifferent hands provide\r\n    Pitiful fare, and cups of pallid cheer.\r\n\r\n    In my warm, fragrant home an hour ago\r\n      I wrote a sonnet on the peace they win\r\n    Who worship Beauty! Let me breathe it low.\r\n      What would it mean if chanted in this din?\r\n    What would it say to those out in the snow,\r\n      Who hunger, and who may not enter in?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Life Means to Me\r\n\r\n(_From \"Revolution\"_)\r\n\r\nBY JACK LONDON\r\n\r\n(See pages 62, 125, 139, 519, 609, 649)\r\n\r\nI was born into the working class. I early discovered\r\nenthusiasm, ambition, and ideals; and to satisfy these became\r\nthe problem of my childlife. My environment was crude and rough\r\nand raw. I had no outlook, but an uplook rather. My place\r\nin society was at the bottom. Here life offered nothing but\r\nsordidness and wretchedness, both of the flesh and the spirit;\r\nfor here flesh and spirit were alike starved and tormented.\r\n\r\nAbove me towered the colossal edifice of society, and to\r\nmy mind the only way out was up. Into this edifice I early\r\nresolved to climb. Up above, men wore black clothes and boiled\r\nshirts, and women dressed in beautiful gowns. Also, there were\r\ngood things to eat, and there was plenty to eat. This much for\r\nthe flesh. Then there were the things of the spirit. Up above\r\nme, I knew, were unselfishness of the spirit, clean and noble\r\nthinking, keen intellectual living. I knew all this because I\r\nread \"Seaside Library\" novels, in which, with the exception\r\nof the villains and adventuresses, all men and women thought\r\nbeautiful thoughts, spoke a beautiful tongue, and performed\r\nglorious deeds. In short, as I accepted the rising of the sun,\r\nI accepted that up above me was all that was fine and noble and\r\ngracious, all that gave decency and dignity to life, all that\r\nmade life worth living and that remunerated one for his travail\r\nand misery.\r\n\r\nBut it is not particularly easy for one to climb up out of\r\nthe working class--especially if he is handicapped by the\r\npossession of ideals and illusions. I lived on a ranch in\r\nCalifornia, and I was hard put to find the ladder whereby to\r\nclimb. I early inquired the rate of interest on invested money,\r\nand worried my child's brain into an understanding of the\r\nvirtues and excellences of that remarkable invention of man,\r\ncompound interest. Further, I ascertained the current rates of\r\nwages for workers of all ages, and the cost of living. From all\r\nthese data I concluded that if I began immediately and worked\r\nand saved until I was fifty years of age, I could then stop\r\nworking and enter into participation in a fair portion of the\r\ndelights and goodnesses that would then be open to me higher up\r\nin society. Of course, I resolutely determined not to marry,\r\nwhile I quite forgot to consider at all that great rock of\r\ndisaster in the working class world--sickness.\r\n\r\nBut the life that was in me demanded more than a meager\r\nexistence of scraping and scrimping. Also, at ten years of\r\nage, I became a newsboy on the streets of a city, and found\r\nmyself with a changed uplook. All about me were still the same\r\nsordidness and wretchedness, and up above me was still the\r\nsame paradise waiting to be gained; but the ladder whereby to\r\nclimb was a different one. It was now the ladder of business.\r\nWhy save my earnings and invest in government bonds, when by\r\nbuying two newspapers for five cents, with a turn of the wrist\r\nI could sell them for ten cents and double my capital? The\r\nbusiness ladder was the ladder for me, and I had a vision of\r\nmyself becoming a baldheaded and successful merchant prince....\r\n\r\n[The author became the owner of an oyster-boat, and thereby a\r\ncapitalist; but was ruined by the burning of his boat.]\r\n\r\nFrom then on I was mercilessly exploited by other capitalists.\r\nI had the muscle, and they made money out of it while I made\r\nbut a very indifferent living out of it. I was a sailor before\r\nthe mast, a longshoreman, a roustabout; I worked in canneries,\r\nand factories, and laundries; I mowed lawns, and cleaned\r\ncarpets, and washed windows. And I never got the full product\r\nof my toil. I looked at the daughter of the cannery owner, in\r\nher carriage, and knew that it was my muscle, in part, that\r\nhelped drag along that carriage on its rubber tires. I looked\r\nat the son of the factory owner, going to college, and knew\r\nthat it was my muscle that helped, in part, to pay for the wine\r\nand good-fellowship he enjoyed.\r\n\r\nBut I did not resent this. It was all in the game. They were\r\nthe strong. Very well, I was strong. I would carve my way to a\r\nplace among them, and make money out of the muscles of other\r\nmen. I was not afraid of work. I loved hard work. I would pitch\r\nin and work harder than ever and eventually become a pillar of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nAnd just then, as luck would have it, I found an employer that\r\nwas of the same mind. I was willing to work, and he was more\r\nthan willing that I should work. I thought I was learning a\r\ntrade. In reality, I had displaced two men. I thought he was\r\nmaking an electrician out of me; as a matter of fact, he was\r\nmaking fifty dollars per month out of me. The two men I had\r\ndisplaced had received forty dollars each per month; I was\r\ndoing the work of both for thirty dollars per month.\r\n\r\nThis employer worked me nearly to death. A man may love\r\noysters, but too many oysters will disincline him toward that\r\nparticular diet. And so with me. Too much work sickened me. I\r\ndid not wish ever to see work again. I fled from work. I became\r\na tramp, begging my way from door to door, wandering over the\r\nUnited States, and sweating bloody sweats in slums and prisons.\r\n\r\nI had been born in the working class, and I was now, at the age\r\nof eighteen, beneath the point at which I had started. I was\r\ndown in the cellar of society, down in the subterranean depths\r\nof misery about which it is neither nice nor proper to speak.\r\nI was in the pit, the abyss, the human cesspool, the shambles\r\nand the charnel house of our civilization. This is the part of\r\nthe edifice of society that society chooses to ignore. Lack of\r\nspace compels me here to ignore it, and I shall say only that\r\nthe things I there saw gave me a terrible scare....\r\n\r\n[The author reflected, and decided that it was better to sell\r\nbrains than muscle.] Then began a frantic pursuit of knowledge.\r\nI returned to California and opened the books. While thus\r\nequipping myself to become a brain merchant, it was inevitable\r\nthat I should delve into sociology. There I found, in a\r\ncertain class of books, scientifically formulated, the simple\r\nsociological concepts I had already worked out for myself.\r\nOther and greater minds, before I was born, had worked out all\r\nthat I had thought, and a vast deal more. I discovered that I\r\nwas a Socialist.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists were revolutionists, inasmuch as they\r\nstruggled to overthrow the society of the present, and out\r\nof the material to build the society of the future. I, too,\r\nwas a Socialist, and a revolutionist. I joined the groups\r\nof working-class and intellectual revolutionists, and for\r\nthe first time came into intelligent living. Here I found\r\nkeen-flashing intellects and brilliant wits; for here I met\r\nstrong and alert-brained, withal horny-handed, members of\r\nthe working class; unfrocked preachers too wide in their\r\nChristianity for any congregation of Mammon-worshippers;\r\nprofessors broken on the wheel of university subservience to\r\nthe ruling class and flung out because they were quick with\r\nknowledge which they strove to apply to the affairs of mankind.\r\n\r\nHere I found, also, warm faith in the human, glowing idealism,\r\nsweetness of unselfishness, renunciation and martyrdom--all\r\nthe splendid, stinging things of the spirit. Here life was\r\nclean, noble, and alive. Here life rehabilitated itself, became\r\nwonderful and glorious; and I was glad to be alive. I was\r\nin touch with great souls who exalted flesh and spirit over\r\ndollars and cents; and to whom the thin wail of the starved\r\nslum-child meant more than all the pomp and circumstance of\r\ncommercial expansion and world-empire. All about me were\r\nnobleness of purpose and heroism of effort, and my days and\r\nnights were sunshine and starshine, all fire and dew, with\r\nbefore my eyes, ever burning and blazing, the Holy Grail,\r\nChrist's own Grail, the warm human, long suffering and\r\nmaltreated, but to be rescued and saved at the last....\r\n\r\nAs a brain merchant I was a success. Society opened its\r\nportals to me. I entered right in on the parlor floor, and my\r\ndisillusionment proceeded rapidly. I sat down to dinner with\r\nthe masters of society, and with the wives and daughters of\r\nthe masters of society. The women were gowned beautifully, I\r\nadmit; but to my naive surprise I discovered that they were of\r\nthe same clay as all the rest of the women I had known down\r\nbelow in the cellar. \"The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady were\r\nsisters under their skins\"--and gowns.\r\n\r\nIt was not this, however, so much as their materialism, that\r\nshocked me. It is true these beautifully gowned, beautiful\r\nwomen prattled sweet little ideals and dear little moralities;\r\nbut in spite of their prattle the dominant key of the life\r\nthey lived was materialistic. And they were so sentimentally\r\nselfish! They assisted in all kinds of sweet little charities,\r\nand informed one of the fact, while all the time the food they\r\nate and the beautiful clothes they wore were bought out of\r\ndividends stained with the blood of child labor, and sweated\r\nlabor, and of prostitution itself. When I mentioned such facts,\r\nexpecting in my innocence that these sisters of Judy O'Grady\r\nwould at once strip off their blood-dyed silks and jewels,\r\nthey became excited and angry, and read me preachments about\r\nthe lack of thrift, the drink, and the innate depravity that\r\ncaused all the misery in society's cellar. When I mentioned\r\nthat I couldn't quite see that it was the lack of thrift, the\r\nintemperance, and the depravity of a half-starved child of six\r\nthat made it work twelve hours every night in a Southern cotton\r\nmill, these sisters of Judy O'Grady attacked my private life\r\nand called me an \"agitator\"--as though that, forsooth, settled\r\nthe argument.\r\n\r\nNor did I fare better with the masters themselves. I had\r\nexpected to find men who were clean, noble and alive, whose\r\nideals were clean, noble and alive. I went out amongst the men\r\nwho sat in the high places, the preachers, the politicians, the\r\nbusiness men, the professors, and the editors. I ate meat with\r\nthem, drank wine with them, automobiled with them, and studied\r\nthem. It is true, I found many that were clean and noble; but,\r\nwith rare exceptions, they were not alive. I do verily believe\r\nI could count the exceptions on the fingers of my two hands.\r\nWhere they were not alive with rottenness, quick with unclean\r\nlife, they were merely the unburied dead--clean and noble, like\r\nwell-preserved mummies, but not alive. In this connection I may\r\nespecially mention the professors I met, the men who live up\r\nto that decadent university ideal, \"the passionless pursuit of\r\npassionless intelligence.\"\r\n\r\nI met men who invoked the name of the Prince of Peace in\r\ntheir diatribes against war, and who put rifles in the hands\r\nof Pinkertons with which to shoot down strikers in their\r\nown factories. I met men incoherent with indignation at the\r\nbrutality of prize-fighting, and who, at the same time, were\r\nparties to the adulteration of food that killed each year more\r\nbabies than even red-handed Herod had killed....\r\n\r\nI discovered that I did not like to live on the parlor floor of\r\nsociety. Intellectually I was bored. Morally and spiritually\r\nI was sickened. I remembered my intellectuals and idealists,\r\nmy unfrocked preachers, broken professors, and clean-minded,\r\nclass-conscious workingmen. I remembered my days and nights of\r\nsunshine and starshine, where life was all a wild wonder, a\r\nspiritual paradise of unselfish adventure and ethical romance.\r\nAnd I saw before me, ever blazing and burning, the Holy Grail.\r\n\r\nSo I went back to the working-class, in which I had been born\r\nand where I belonged. I care no longer to climb. This imposing\r\nedifice of society above my head holds no delight for me. It\r\nis the foundation of the edifice that interests me. There I am\r\ncontent to labor, crowbar in hand, shoulder to shoulder with\r\nintellectuals, idealists, and class-conscious workingmen,\r\ngetting a solid pry now and again and setting the whole edifice\r\nrocking. Some day, when we get a few more hands and crowbars\r\nto work, we'll topple it over, along with all its rotten\r\nlife and unburied dead, its monstrous selfishness and sodden\r\nmaterialism. Then we'll cleanse the cellar and build a new\r\nhabitation for mankind, in which there will be no parlor floor,\r\nin which all the rooms will be bright and airy, and where the\r\nair that is breathed will be clean, noble and alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nFires\r\n\r\nBY WILFRID WILSON GIBSON\r\n\r\n(Contemporary English poet of the lives of the poor)\r\n\r\n    Snug in my easy chair,\r\n      I stirred the fire to flame.\r\n    Fantastically fair\r\n      The flickering fancies came,\r\n    Born of heart's desire:\r\n      Amber woodlands streaming;\r\n      Topaz islands dreaming,\r\n      Sunset-cities gleaming,\r\n    Spire on burning spire;\r\n      Ruddy-windowed taverns;\r\n    Sunshine-spilling wines;\r\n      Crystal-lighted caverns\r\n    Of Golconda's mines;\r\n      Summers, unreturning;\r\n      Passion's crater yearning;\r\n      Troy, the ever-burning;\r\n    Shelley's lustral pyre;\r\n      Dragon-eyes, unsleeping;\r\n      Witches' cauldrons leaping;\r\n      Golden galleys sweeping\r\n    Out from sea-walled Tyre:\r\n      Fancies, fugitive and fair,\r\n      Flashed with winging through the air;\r\n      Till, dazzled by the drowsy glare,\r\n    I shut my eyes to heat and light;\r\n    And saw, in sudden night,\r\n    Crouched in the dripping dark,\r\n    With streaming shoulders stark,\r\n    The man who hews the coal to feed my fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlton Locke\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES KINGSLEY\r\n\r\n(A young poet is taken out by an old Scotchman, to make his\r\nfirst acquaintance with the world of misery)\r\n\r\nIt was a foul, chilly, foggy Saturday night.

Blood and sewer-water crawled from under doors\r\nand out of spouts, and reeked down the gutters among the\r\noffal, animal and vegetable, in every stage of putrefaction.\r\nFoul vapors rose from cowsheds and slaughter-houses, and the\r\ndoorways of undrained alleys, where the inhabitants carried\r\nthe filth out on their shoes from the back-yard into the court,\r\nand from the court up into the main street; while above,\r\nhanging like cliffs over the streets--those narrow, brawling\r\ntorrents of filth, and poverty, and sin--the houses with their\r\nteeming load of life were piled up into the dingy, choking\r\nnight. A ghastly, deafening, sickening sight it was.

See there, there stream the legions\r\nfrom the factories; they have made and fashioned lordly\r\nstuffs,--themselves and children, they are naked, frozen,\r\nhungry; for not to them belongs the fruit of all their labor,\r\nbut to the rich and mighty one who calls men and the earth his\r\nown! So, there they troop, from fields and farmyards; they have\r\ntilled the earth and turned it to a smiling garden, and fruits\r\nin plenty, enough for all who live, have paid their pains,--yet\r\npoor are they, and naked, starving; for not to them, nor to\r\nothers who are needy, belongs earth's blessing, but solely to\r\nthe rich and mighty one who calls men and the earth his own.\r\nThey all, the hundred-thousands, millions, are camped upon\r\nthe hills and gaze into the distance, where thickening clouds\r\nproclaim the advent of emancipating Revolution; they all, to\r\nwhom nothing is left to grieve for, from whom men rob the sons\r\nto train them into sturdy gaolers of their fathers; whose\r\ndaughters walk the city's streets with burden of their shame,\r\nan offering to the baser lusts of rich and mighty; they all,\r\nwith the sallow, careworn faces, the limbs devoured by frost\r\nand hunger, they all who have never known joy, encamp there on\r\nthe heights and strain their eyes in blissful expectation of\r\nits coming, and listen in rapt silence to the rustle of the\r\nrising storm, which fills their ears with Revolution's greeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Refusal\r\n\r\n(_Addressed to General Sebastiani_)\r\n\r\nBY PIERRE JEAN DE BERANGER\r\n\r\n(French lyric poet, of great popularity, 1780-1857; twice\r\nprosecuted by the government for his republican utterances)\r\n\r\n    A minister offers me gold!\r\n    Not a creature, of course, to be told,\r\n      Not a word to appear in the press!\r\n    My wants are but few, to be sure,\r\n    And yet, when I think of the poor,\r\n      I long to be rich, I confess!\r\n\r\n    With the poor, as the world is aware,\r\n    Stars and ribands one cannot well share,\r\n      But gold is a different thing!\r\n    Yes, just for a hundred francs down\r\n    I'd cheerfully pawn both my crown\r\n      And my sceptre, if I were king!\r\n\r\n    When money does come in my way,\r\n    It goes the next moment astray,\r\n      How and where I can't really explain;\r\n    My pocket is cursed with a hole\r\n    Which my grandmother, excellent soul,\r\n      All her days would have stitched at in vain!\r\n\r\n    All the same, my good friend, keep your gold!\r\n    In my teens, if the truth must be told,\r\n      Proud Freedom I fervently woo'd;\r\n    Yes, I, who have vaunted in song\r\n    Lax loveliness all my life long,\r\n      Am wedded in fact to a prude!\r\n\r\n    Ay, Liberty, Sir, you must learn,\r\n    Is a bigot inflexibly stern,\r\n      Who, heedless of time and of place,\r\n    Directly the tinsel she spies\r\n    On Servility's livery, cries,\r\n      \"Away with the rascally lace!\"\r\n\r\n    Your dross she an insult would deem!\r\n    But, frankly, how came you to dream\r\n      Of attempting to treat with _my_ muse?\r\n    As it is, I'm at least a good \"sou,\"\r\n    But lacquer me over, and you\r\n      Make me counterfeit ev'n among \"sous.\"\r\n\r\n    Keep your pelf; I'm no hero, I fear,\r\n    But if the world happens to hear\r\n      Of this secret you think so profound,\r\n    You'll know whence the story has sprung--\r\n    My heart's like a lyre newly strung,\r\n      One touch, and you make it resound!\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Retainers\r\n\r\n(_From \"Socialism and Success\"_)\r\n\r\nBY W. J. GHENT\r\n\r\n(American Socialist writer, born 1866)\r\n\r\nYou retainers and servitors of the men of wealth--you who\r\nfrom rostrum, pulpit and sanctum, from bar and bench, defend\r\nthe existing régime and oppose the struggles of the working\r\nclass for a better life; you whose business it is to find a\r\npractical, a judicial, an ethical and even a spiritual sanction\r\nfor things as they exist, and who devise the cheap moralities\r\nwhich are the reflex of the interests of the class that employs\r\nyou--there is a word to say to you which needs to be spoken.\r\nUpon those who take part in the forward movement of the time no\r\nmore pressing duty is laid than that of telling you in plain\r\nwords what millions of men are thinking of you....\r\n\r\nWith what eager impulse and with what compliant will do you\r\nmake yourselves the defenders of the present scheme of things\r\nand the assailants of the coming order! Now that in every\r\ncivilized land the working class, sick of the reign of cruelty\r\nand wrong, is awakening to a consciousness of its power, and\r\nto a determination to ordain a fairer life, you take upon\r\nyourselves the mission to ridicule its aims and ideals and to\r\ndiscredit its leaders.\r\n\r\nIt is only the unsuccessful, you say, who attack our existing\r\ninstitutions. You cannot understand, such is your subservient\r\ncomplacence, that multitudes among this revolutionary working\r\nclass are proud of their unsuccess and wear it as a badge of\r\nhonor. Pray you, under the existing scheme of things, how many,\r\nand what quality of men achieve \"success,\" and what must they\r\ndo to achieve it? It is not, except in rare cases, probity,\r\nhonor, truthfulness, nor humaneness, nor fellow service, that\r\nwins this fallacious good. It is, in the majority of cases,\r\ngrafting and lying, fawning and cringing, selfishness and\r\nbrutality, restrained only by that Chinese ethical standard,\r\nthe necessity of \"saving your face,\" that give victory in the\r\nstruggle. And the men who are seeking the overthrow of this\r\nsystem disdain to make use of these means. They leave that\r\nfunction to you. They do not, like your bishops, lend their\r\npresence to chambers of commerce at banquets, and give to the\r\ngamblers in the world's wealth the benediction of divine favor.\r\nThey do not, like your Board of Foreign Missions, solicit the\r\nprofits of law breaking and theft for their propaganda, and\r\npromise an intercession at the throne of grace. They do not,\r\nlike your college heads, prescribe the dainty punishment of\r\n\"social ostracism\" for the world's robbers, crying out from\r\ntheir gables, \"Bring on your tainted money!\" Nor do they, like\r\nyour journalists, make themselves the servile lackeys of the\r\nruling class; nor, like your economists, constitute themselves\r\nthe secular priests of capital, perpetually renewing their\r\ncharacter of \"pests of society and persecutors of the poor.\"\r\nMany of them might be \"successful\" if they chose to do these\r\nthings. Rather they chose, like Francis of Assisi, the bride of\r\nPoverty, instead of the harlot Success. And so you are right in\r\nyour statement. But you utter your own condemnation when you\r\nspeak it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAd Valorem\r\n\r\nBY JOHN RUSKIN\r\n\r\n(See pages 106, 491)\r\n\r\nIn a community regulated by laws of demand and supply, but\r\nprotected from open violence, the persons who become rich are,\r\ngenerally speaking, industrious, resolute, proud, covetous,\r\nprompt, methodical, sensible, unimaginative, insensitive, and\r\nignorant.

This epoch-making ten-volume novel, probably the greatest\r\n published in France since \"Les Miserables,\" tells the life story of\r\n a German-born musician. The following passage describes his attitude\r\n towards the revolutionary movement in Paris)\r\n\r\nChristophe was dragged into the wake of force in the track of\r\nthe army of the working-classes in revolt. But he was hardly\r\naware that it was so; and he would tell his companions in the\r\nrestaurant that he was not with them.\r\n\r\n\"As long as you are only out for material interests,\" he would\r\nsay, \"you don't interest me. The day when you march out for a\r\nbelief, then I shall be with you. Otherwise, what have I to\r\ndo with the conflict between one man's belly and another's? I\r\nam an artist; it is my duty to defend art; I have no right to\r\nenroll myself in the service of a party. I am perfectly aware\r\nthat recently certain ambitious writers, impelled by a desire\r\nfor an unwholesome popularity, have set a bad example. It seems\r\nto me that they have not rendered any great service to the\r\ncause which they defended in that way; but they have certainly\r\nbetrayed art. It is our business--the artists'--to save the\r\nlight of the intellect. We have no right to obscure it with\r\nyour blind struggles. Who shall hold the light aloft if we let\r\nit fall? You will be glad enough to find it still intact after\r\nthe battle. There must always be workers busy keeping up the\r\nfire in the engine, while there is fighting on the deck of the\r\nship. To understand everything is to hate nothing. The artist\r\nis the compass which, through the raging of the storm, points\r\nsteadily to the north.\"\r\n\r\nThey regarded him as a maker of phrases, and said that, if he\r\nwere talking of compasses, it was very clear that he had lost\r\nhis: and they gave themselves the pleasure of indulging in\r\na little friendly contempt at his expense. In their eyes an\r\nartist was a shirker who contrived to work as little and as\r\nagreeably as possible.\r\n\r\nHe replied that he worked as hard as they did, even harder, and\r\nthat he was not nearly so afraid of work. Nothing disgusted him\r\nso much as _sabotage_, the deliberate bungling of work, and\r\nskulking raised to the level of a principle.\r\n\r\n\"All these wretched people,\" he would say, \"afraid for their\r\nown skins!... Good Lord! I've never stopped working since I was\r\neight. You people don't love your work; at heart you're just\r\ncommon men.... If only you were capable of destroying the old\r\nworld! But you can't do it. You don't even want to. No, you\r\ndon't even want to. It is all very well for you to go about\r\nshrieking menace and pretending you're going to exterminate the\r\nhuman race. You have only one thought: to get the upper hand\r\nand lie snugly in the warm beds of the middle classes....\"\r\n\r\nThereupon they would all lose their tempers and all talk at\r\nonce. And in the heat of the argument it would often happen\r\nthat Christophe, whirled away by his passion, would become more\r\nrevolutionary than the others. In vain did he fight against\r\nit; his intellectual pride, his complacent conception of a\r\npurely esthetic world, made for the joy of the spirit, would\r\nsink deep into the ground at the sight of injustice. Esthetic,\r\na world in which eight men out of ten live in nakedness and\r\nwant, in physical and moral wretchedness? Oh, come! A man must\r\nbe an impudent creature of privilege who would dare to claim\r\nas much. An artist like Christophe, in his inmost conscience,\r\ncould not but be on the side of the working-classes. What\r\nman more than the spiritual worker has to suffer from the\r\nimmorality of social conditions, from the scandalously unequal\r\npartition of wealth among men? The artist dies of hunger or\r\nbecomes a millionaire for no other reason than the caprice\r\nof fashion and of those who speculate on fashion. A society\r\nwhich suffers its best men to die or gives them extravagant\r\nrewards is a monstrous society: it must be swept and put\r\nin order. Every man, whether he works or no, has a right\r\nto a living minimum. Every kind of work, good or mediocre,\r\nshould be rewarded, not according to its real value--(who\r\ncan be the infallible judge of that?)--but according to the\r\nnormal legitimate needs of the worker. Society can and should\r\nassure the artist, the scientist, and the inventor an income\r\nsufficient to guarantee that they have the means and the time\r\nyet further to grace and honor it. Nothing more. The _Gioconda_\r\nis not worth a million. There is no relation between a sum\r\nof money and a work of art: a work of art is neither above\r\nnor below money: it is outside it. It is not a question of\r\npayment: it is a question of allowing the artist to live. Give\r\nhim enough to feed him, and allow him to work in peace. It is\r\nabsurd and horrible to try to make him a robber of another's\r\nproperty. This thing must be put bluntly: every man who has\r\nmore than is necessary for his livelihood and that of his\r\nfamily, and for the normal development of his intelligence, is\r\na thief and a robber. If he has too much, it means that others\r\nhave too little. How often have we smiled sadly to hear tell\r\nof the inexhaustible wealth of France, and the number of great\r\nfortunes--we workers, and toilers, and intellectuals, and men\r\nand women who from our very birth have been given up to the\r\nwearying task of keeping ourselves from dying of hunger, often\r\nstruggling in vain, often seeing the very best of us succumbing\r\nto the pain of it all,--we who are the moral and intellectual\r\ntreasure of the nation! You who have more than your share of\r\nthe wealth of the world are rich at the cost of our suffering\r\nand our poverty. That troubles you not at all; you have\r\nsophistries and to spare to reassure you: the sacred rights of\r\nproperty, the fair struggle for life, the supreme interests of\r\nthat Moloch, the State, and Progress, that fabulous monster,\r\nthat problematical Better to which men sacrifice the Good,--the\r\nGood of other men. But for all that, the fact remains, and all\r\nyour sophistries will never manage to deny it: \"You have too\r\nmuch to live on. We have not enough. And we are as good as\r\nyou. And some of us are better than the whole lot of you put\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Problem Play\r\n\r\nBY G. BERNARD SHAW\r\n\r\n(See pages 193, 212, 263, 402)\r\n\r\nWhen we succeed in adjusting our social structure in such a\r\nway as to enable us to solve social questions as fast as they\r\nbecome really pressing, they will no longer force their way\r\ninto the theatre. Had Ibsen, for instance, had any reason to\r\nbelieve that the abuses to which he called attention in his\r\nprose plays would have been adequately attended to without his\r\ninterference, he would no doubt have gladly left them alone.\r\nThe same exigency drove William Morris in England from his\r\ntapestries, his epics, and his masterpieces of printing, to try\r\nand bring his fellow citizens to their senses by the summary\r\nprocess of shouting at them in the streets and in Trafalgar\r\nSquare. John Ruskin's writing began with Modern Painters;\r\nCarlyle began with literary studies of German culture and the\r\nlike; both were driven to become revolutionary pamphleteers. If\r\npeople are rotting and starving in all directions, and nobody\r\nelse has the heart or brains to make a disturbance about it,\r\nthe great writers must.\r\n\r\n\r\nFleet Street Eclogues\r\n\r\nBY JOHN DAVIDSON\r\n\r\n (In these dialogues a number of English journalists discuss their\r\n views of life.

See page 104)\r\n\r\nHis name was Harold Biffen, and, to judge from his appearance,\r\nhe did not belong to the race of common mortals. His excessive\r\nmeagerness would all but have qualified him to enter an\r\nexhibition in the capacity of living skeleton, and the garments\r\nwhich hung upon this framework would perhaps have sold for\r\nthree and sixpence at an old-clothes dealer's. But the man was\r\nsuperior to these accidents of flesh and raiment. He had a fine\r\nface: large, gentle eyes, nose slightly aquiline, small and\r\ndelicate mouth. Thick black hair fell to his coat-collar; he\r\nwore a heavy moustache and a full beard. In his gait there was\r\na singular dignity; only a man of cultivated mind and grateful\r\ncharacter could move and stand as he did.\r\n\r\nHis first act on entering the room was to take from his pocket\r\na pipe, a pouch, a little tobacco-stopper, and a box of\r\nmatches, all of which he arranged carefully on a corner of the\r\ncentral table. Then he drew forward a chair and seated himself.\r\n\r\n\"Take your top-coat off,\" said Reardon.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, not this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why the deuce not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not this evening, thanks.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason, as soon as Reardon sought for it, was obvious.\r\nBiffen had no ordinary coat beneath the other. To have referred\r\nto this fact would have been indelicate; the novelist of\r\ncourse understood it, and smiled, but with no mirth.\r\n\r\n\"Let me have your Sophocles,\" were the visitor's next words.\r\n\r\nReardon offered him a volume of the Oxford Pocket Classics.\r\n\r\n\"I prefer the Wunder, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's gone, my boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wanted a little cash.\"\r\n\r\nBiffen uttered a sound in which remonstrance and sympathy were\r\nblended.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that; very sorry. Well, this must do. Now, I\r\nwant to know how you scan this chorus in the 'Oedipus Rex.'\"\r\n\r\nReardon took the volume, considered, and began to read aloud\r\nwith metric emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Choriambics, eh?\" cried the other. \"Possible, of course; but\r\ntreat them as Ionics _a minore_ with an anacrusis, and see if\r\nthey don't go better.\"\r\n\r\nHe involved himself in terms of pedantry, and with such delight\r\nthat his eyes gleamed. Having delivered a technical lecture,\r\nhe began to read in illustration, producing quite a different\r\neffect from that of the rhythm as given by his friend. And the\r\nreading was by no means that of a pedant, rather of a poet.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour the two men talked Greek metres as if they\r\nlived in a world where the only hunger known could be satisfied\r\nby grand or sweet cadences....\r\n\r\nBiffen was always in dire poverty, and lived in the oddest\r\nplaces; he had seen harder trials than even Reardon himself.\r\nThe teaching by which he partly lived was of a kind quite\r\nunknown to the respectable tutorial world. In these days\r\nof examinations, numbers of men in a poor position--clerks\r\nchiefly--conceive a hope that by \"passing\" this, that, or the\r\nother formal test they may open for themselves a new career.\r\nNot a few such persons nourish preposterous ambitions; there\r\nare warehouse clerks privately preparing (without any means or\r\nprospect of them) for a call to the Bar, drapers' assistants\r\nwho \"go in\" for the preliminary examination of the College\r\nof Surgeons, and untaught men innumerable, who desire to\r\nprocure enough show of education to be eligible for a curacy.\r\nCandidates of this stamp frequently advertise in the newspapers\r\nfor cheap tuition, or answer advertisements which are intended\r\nto appeal to them; they pay from sixpence to half a crown\r\nan hour--rarely as much as the latter sum. Occasionally it\r\nhappened that Harold Biffen had three or four such pupils in\r\nhand, and extraordinary stories he could draw from his large\r\nexperience in this sphere....\r\n\r\n\r\n_Biffen Falls in Love_\r\n\r\nA fatal day. There was an end of all his peace, all his\r\ncapacity for labor, his patient endurance of penury. Once,\r\nwhen he was about three and twenty, he had been in love with\r\na girl of gentle nature and fair intelligence; on account\r\nof his poverty, he could not even hope that his love might\r\nbe returned, and he went away to bear the misery as best he\r\nmight. Since then the life he had led precluded the forming of\r\nsuch attachments; it would never have been possible for him\r\nto support a wife of however humble origin. At intervals he\r\nfelt the full weight of his loneliness, but there were happily\r\nlong periods during which his Greek studies and his efforts in\r\nrealistic fiction made him indifferent to the curse laid upon\r\nhim. But after that hour of intimate speech with Amy, he never\r\nagain knew rest of mind or heart....\r\n\r\nHe was not the kind of man that deceives himself as to his own\r\naspect in the eyes of others. Be as kind as she might, Amy\r\ncould not set him strutting Malvolio-wise; she viewed him as\r\na poor devil who often had to pound his coat--a man of parts\r\nwho could never get on in the world--a friend to be thought\r\nof kindly because her dead husband had valued him. Nothing\r\nmore than that; he understood perfectly the limits of her\r\nfeeling. But this could not put restraint upon the emotion\r\nwith which he received any trifling utterance of kindness from\r\nher. He did not think of what was, but of what, under changed\r\ncircumstances, might be. To encourage such fantasy was the\r\nidlest self-torment, but he had gone too far in this form of\r\nindulgence. He became the slave of his inflamed imagination....\r\n\r\nCompanionless, inert, he suffered the tortures which are so\r\nludicrous and contemptible to the happily married. Life was\r\nbarren to him, and would soon grow hateful; only in sleep could\r\nhe cast off the unchanging thoughts and desires which made all\r\nelse meaningless. And rightly meaningless; he revolted against\r\nthe unnatural constraints forbidding him to complete his\r\nmanhood. By what fatality was he alone of men withheld from the\r\nwinning of a woman's love?\r\n\r\nHe could not bear to walk the streets where the faces of\r\nbeautiful women would encounter him. When he must needs leave\r\nthe house, he went about in the poor, narrow ways, where only\r\nspectacles of coarseness, and want, and toil would be presented\r\nto him. Yet even here he was too often reminded that the\r\npoverty-stricken of the class to which poverty is natural were\r\nnot condemned to endure in solitude. Only he who belonged to\r\nno class, who was rejected alike by his fellows in privation\r\nand by his equals in intellect, must die without having known\r\nthe touch of a loving woman's hand.\r\n\r\nThe summer went by, and he was unconscious of its warmth and\r\nlight. How his days passed he could not have said....\r\n\r\nOne evening in early autumn, as he stood before the book-stall\r\nat the end of Goodge Street, a familiar voice accosted him. It\r\nwas Whelpdale's. A month or two ago he had stubbornly refused\r\nan invitation to dine with Whelpdale and other acquaintances,\r\nand since then the prosperous young man had not crossed his\r\npath.\r\n\r\n\"I've something to tell you,\" said the assailer, taking hold\r\nof his arm. \"I'm in a tremendous state of mind, and want\r\nsomeone to share my delight.... You know Dora Milvain; I have\r\nasked her to marry me, and, by the Powers! she has given me an\r\nencouraging answer! Not an actual yes, but encouraging! She's\r\naway in the Channel Islands, and I wrote----\"\r\n\r\nHe talked on for a quarter of an hour. Then, with a sudden\r\nmovement, the listener freed himself.\r\n\r\n\"I can't go any farther,\" he said hoarsely. \"Goodbye!\"\r\n\r\nWhelpdale was disconcerted.\r\n\r\n\"I have been boring you. That's a confounded fault of mine; I\r\nknow it.\"\r\n\r\nBiffen had waved his hand, and was gone.\r\n\r\nA week or two would see him at the end of his money. He had no\r\nlessons now, and could not write; from his novel nothing was\r\nto be expected. He might apply again to his brother, but such\r\ndependence was unjust and unworthy. And why should he struggle\r\nto preserve a life which had no prospect but of misery?...\r\n\r\nIt was in the hours following his encounter with Whelpdale\r\nthat he first knew the actual desire of death, the simple\r\nlonging for extinction. One must go far in suffering before\r\nthe innate will-to-live is thus truly overcome; weariness of\r\nbodily anguish may induce this perversion of the instincts;\r\nless often, that despair of suppressed emotion which had fallen\r\nupon Harold. Through the night he kept his thoughts fixed on\r\ndeath in its aspect of repose, of eternal oblivion. And herein\r\nhe found solace.\r\n\r\nThe next night it was the same. Moving among many common needs\r\nand occupations, he knew not a moment's cessation of heartache,\r\nbut when he lay down in the darkness a hopeful summons\r\nwhispered to him. Night, which had been the worst season of his\r\npain, had now grown friendly; it came as an anticipation of the\r\nsleep that is everlasting.\r\n\r\nA few more days, and he was possessed by a calm of spirit such\r\nas he had never known. His resolve was taken, not in a moment\r\nof supreme conflict, but as the result of a subtle process by\r\nwhich his imagination had become in love with death. Turning\r\nfrom contemplation of life's one rapture, he looked with the\r\nsame intensity of desire to a state that had neither fear nor\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon he went to the Museum Reading Room, and was busy\r\nfor a few minutes in consultation of a volume which he took\r\nfrom the shelves of medical literature. On his way homeward\r\nhe entered two or three chemists' shops. Something of which\r\nhe had need could be procured only in very small quantities;\r\nbut repetition of his demand in different places supplied him\r\nsufficiently. When he reached his room, he emptied the contents\r\nof sundry little bottles into one larger, and put this in his\r\npocket. Then he wrote rather a long letter, addressed to his\r\nbrother in Liverpool....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Jasper, \"one can't grieve. There seemed no\r\npossibility of his ever earning enough to live decently\r\nupon. But why the deuce did he go all the way out there?\r\nConsideration for the people in whose house he lived, I dare\r\nsay; Biffen had a good deal of native delicacy....\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he still so very poor?\" asked Amy, compassionately.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid so. His book failed utterly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I had imagined him still in such distress, surely I\r\nmight have done something to help him!\"--So often the regretful\r\nremark of one's friends, when one has been permitted to perish.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter to the Earl of Chesterfield\r\n\r\nBY SAMUEL JOHNSON\r\n\r\n (English man of letters, 1709-1784; maker of a celebrated English\r\n dictionary, and the subject of one of the world's most famous\r\n biographies. Dr. Johnson might be called the first professional\r\n literary man; the first who lived by his trade and was respected for\r\n it. So the present letter, addressed to one of the most powerful\r\n personages of the time, may be said to mark the end of the age of\r\n patronage in the literary world: the system whereby authors dedicated\r\n their works to noblemen, and received food and favors in return)\r\n\r\nMy Lord, I have been lately informed, by the proprietor\r\nof the World, that two papers, in which my Dictionary is\r\nrecommended to the publick, were written by your Lordship. To\r\nbe so distinguished, is an honour, which, being very little\r\naccustomed to favours from the great, I know not well how to\r\nreceive, or in what terms to acknowledge.\r\n\r\nWhen, upon some slight encouragement, I first visited your\r\nLordship, I was overpowered, like the rest of mankind, by\r\nthe enchantment of your address, and could not forbear to\r\nwish that I might boast myself _Le vainquer du vainqueur de\r\nla terre_;--that I might obtain that regard for which I saw\r\nthe world contending; but I found my attendance so little\r\nencouraged, that neither pride nor modesty would suffer me\r\nto continue it. When I had once addressed your Lordship in\r\npublick, I had exhausted all the art of pleasing which a\r\nretired and uncourtly scholar can possess. I had done all that\r\nI could; and no man is well pleased to have his all neglected,\r\nbe it ever so little.\r\n\r\nSeven years, my Lord, have now past, since I waited in your\r\noutward rooms, or was repulsed from your door; during which\r\ntime I have been pushing my work through difficulties, of which\r\nit is useless to complain, and have brought it, at last, to the\r\nverge of publication, without one act of assistance, one word\r\nof encouragement, or one smile of favour. Such treatment I did\r\nnot expect, for I never had a Patron before.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd in Virgil grew at last acquainted with Love, and\r\nfound him a native of the rocks.\r\n\r\nIs not a Patron, my Lord, one who looks with unconcern on a\r\nman struggling for life in the water, and, when he has reached\r\nground, encumbers him with help? The notice which you have\r\nbeen pleased to take of my labours, had it been early, had\r\nbeen kind; but it has been delayed till I am indifferent, and\r\ncannot enjoy it; till I am solitary, and cannot impart it; till\r\nI am known, and do not want it. I hope it is no very cynical\r\nasperity, not to confess obligations where no benefit has been\r\nreceived, or to be unwilling that the Publick should consider\r\nme as owing that to a Patron, which Providence has enabled me\r\nto do for myself.\r\n\r\nHaving carried my work thus far with so little obligation to\r\nany favourer of learning, I shall not be disappointed though\r\nI should conclude it, if less be possible, with less; for I\r\nhave been long wakened from that dream of hope in which I once\r\nboasted myself with so much exultation,\r\n\r\n  My Lord,\r\n    Your Lordship's most humble\r\n      Most obedient servant,\r\n                               SAM.

He comes with a heart trembling with gladness; he\r\ncomes with tears of rapture in his eyes. He comes with bosom\r\nheaving and throat choking and heart breaking. He comes with\r\ntenderness and with trust, with joy in the beauty that he\r\nbeholds. He comes a minstrel, with a harp in his hand--and you\r\nset your dogs upon him, you drive him torn and bleeding from\r\nyour gates!\r\n\r\nThe poet! You make him go out into the market and chaffer for\r\nhis bread! You subject him to the same law to which you subject\r\nyour loafers and your louts--that he who will not work cannot\r\neat! Your drones and your drunkards--and your poets! Every man\r\nmust earn for himself, every man must pay his way! No man must\r\nask favors, no man must be helped, no man shall be different\r\nfrom other men! For shame! For shame!...\r\n\r\nI am to die now, therefore let me write it: that I was a man\r\nof Genius. And that you have trodden me down in the struggle\r\nfor existence. I saw things that no other man has ever seen,\r\nI would have written things that no other man can ever write.\r\nAnd you have trodden me down in the struggle for existence--you\r\nhave trodden me down because I could not earn my bread!\r\n\r\nThis is what I tell you--this is what I cry out to you, that\r\nthe man of Genius _cannot_ earn his bread; that the work by\r\nwhich he develops his power is something absolutely and utterly\r\ndifferent from the work by which he earns his bread; and that\r\nevery hour which he gives to the one, he lessens his power and\r\nhis capacity for the other. Every hour that he gives to the\r\nearning of his bread, he takes from his soul, he weakens his\r\nwork, he destroys beauty which never again can he know or dream.\r\n\r\nAnd this again is what I tell you, this again is what I cry\r\nout to you: that the power by which a man of Genius does his\r\nwork, and the power by which he earns his bread, are things so\r\nentirely distinct that _they may not occur together at all_!\r\nThe man may have both, but then again he may only have the\r\nformer. And in that case he will die like a poisoned rat in a\r\nhole.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast Verses\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS CHATTERTON\r\n\r\n (This boy, 1752-1770, came to London friendless and unknown, and on\r\n account of starvation committed suicide at the age of eighteen.

The American college student has the gravity and\r\nmental habits of a Supreme Court judge; his \"wild oats\" are\r\nrarely spiritual; the critical, analytical habit of mind is\r\ndistrusted. We say that \"knocking\" is a sign of the \"sorehead\"\r\nand we sublimate criticism by saying that \"every knock is a\r\nboost.\" America does not play with ideas; generous speculation\r\nis regarded as insincere, and shunned as if it might endanger\r\nthe optimism which underlies success. All this becomes such an\r\ninsulation against new ideas that when the Yankee goes abroad\r\nhe takes his environment with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning\r\n\r\n(_From \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\"_)\r\n\r\nBY FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE\r\n\r\n(German philosopher, 1844-1900, whose lofty utterance has\r\nsuffered from materialistic interpreters)\r\n\r\nAs I lay in sleep a sheep ate up the ivy crown of my head--ate\r\nand then said: \"Zarathustra is no more a scholar.\"\r\n\r\nSaid it and went strutting away, and proud.

What do you find? You find some rich and idle,\r\nwasting unearned wealth to their own shame and injury, and the\r\nshame and injury of others. You find hard-working people packed\r\naway in vile, unhealthy streets. You find little children,\r\nfamished, dirty, and half naked outside the luxurious clubs,\r\nshops, hotels, and theatres. You find men and women overworked\r\nand underpaid. You find vice and want and disease cheek by jowl\r\nwith religion and culture and wealth. You find the usurer,\r\nthe gambler, the fop, the finnikin fine lady, and you find\r\nthe starveling, the slave, the vagrant, the drunkard, and the\r\nharlot.\r\n\r\nIs it nothing to you, John Smith? Are you a citizen? Are you a\r\nman? And will not strike a blow for the right nor lift a hand\r\nto save the fallen, nor make the smallest sacrifice for the\r\nsake of your brothers and your sisters! John, I am not trying\r\nto work upon your feelings. This is not rhetoric, it is hard\r\nfact. Throughout these letters I have tried to be plain and\r\npractical, and moderate. I have never so much as offered you\r\na glimpse of the higher regions of thought. I have suffered\r\nno hint of idealism to escape me. I have kept as close to the\r\nearth as I could. I am only now talking street talk about the\r\ncommon sights of the common town. I say that wrong and sorrow\r\nare here crushing the life out of our brothers and sisters. I\r\nsay that you, in common with all men, are responsible for the\r\nthings that are. I say that it is your duty to seek the remedy;\r\nand I say that if you seek it you will find it.\r\n\r\nThese common sights of the common streets, John, are very\r\nterrible to me. To a man of a nervous temperament, at once\r\nthoughtful and imaginative, those sights must be terrible. The\r\nprostitute under the lamps, the baby beggar in the gutter, the\r\nbroken pauper in his livery of shame, the weary worker stifling\r\nin his filthy slums, the wage slave toiling at his task,\r\nthe sweater's victim \"sewing at once, with a double thread,\r\na shroud as well as a shirt,\" these are dreadful, ghastly,\r\nshameful facts which long since seared themselves upon my heart.\r\n\r\nAll this sin, all this wretchedness, all this pain, in spite of\r\nthe smiling fields and the laughing waters, under the awful and\r\nunsullied sky. And no remedy!\r\n\r\nThese things I saw, and I knew that I was responsible as a man.\r\nThen I tried to find out the causes of the wrong and the remedy\r\ntherefor. It has taken me some years, John. But I think I\r\nunderstand it now, and I want you to understand it, and to help\r\nin your turn to teach the truth to others.\r\n\r\nSometimes while I have been writing these letters I have felt\r\nbitter and angry. More than once I have thought that when I\r\ngot through the work I would ease my heart with a few lines of\r\nirony or invective. But I have thought better of it. Looking\r\nback now I remember my own weakness, folly, cowardice. I have\r\nno heart to scorn or censure other men. Charity, John, mercy,\r\nJohn, humility, John. We are poor creatures, all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sign of the Son of Man\r\n\r\nBY VIDA D.

I am not an unselfish person,\r\nnor an evangelical one; I have no particular pleasure in doing\r\ngood; neither do I dislike doing it so much as to expect to be\r\nrewarded for it in another world. But I simply cannot paint,\r\nnor read, nor look at minerals, nor do anything else I like,\r\nand the very light of the morning sky has become hateful to me,\r\nbecause of the misery that I know of, and see signs of where I\r\nknow it not, which no imagination can interpret too bitterly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe One Duty\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Measure of the Hours\"_)\r\n\r\nBY MAURICE MAETERLINCK\r\n\r\n(Belgian poet, dramatist and philosopher, born 1862)\r\n\r\nLet us start fairly with the great truth: for those who possess\r\nthere is only one certain duty, which is to strip themselves\r\nof what they have so as to bring themselves into the condition\r\nof the mass that possesses nothing. It is understood, in every\r\nclear-thinking conscience, that no more imperative duty exists;\r\nbut, at the same time, it is admitted that this duty, for lack\r\nof courage, is impossible of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, in the heroic history of duties, even at the\r\nmost ardent period, even at the beginning of Christianity and\r\nin the majority of the religious orders that made a special\r\ncult of poverty, this is perhaps the only duty that has\r\nnever been completely fulfilled. It behooves us, therefore,\r\nwhen considering our subsidiary duties, to remember that the\r\nessential one has been knowingly evaded. Let this truth govern\r\nus. Let us not forget that we are speaking in shadow, and that\r\nour boldest, our utmost steps will never lead us to the point\r\nat which we ought to have been from the first.\r\n\r\n\r\nLand Titles\r\n\r\nBY HERBERT SPENCER\r\n\r\n(See page 460)\r\n\r\nIt can never be pretended that the existing titles to landed\r\nproperty are legitimate. The original deeds were written with\r\nthe sword, soldiers were the conveyancers, blows were the\r\ncurrent coin given in exchange, and for seals, blood. Those who\r\nsay that \"time is a great legaliser\" must find satisfactory\r\nanswers to such questions as--How long does it take for what\r\nwas originally wrong to become right? At what rate per annum do\r\ninvalid claims become valid?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rights of Labor\r\n\r\nBY ABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\n\r\n(See pages 234, 623)\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that labor is available only in connection with\r\ncapital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning\r\ncapital, somehow by the use of it, induces him to labor. This\r\nassumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital\r\nshall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own\r\nconsent, or buy them and drive them to do it without their\r\nconsent. Having proceeded so far, it is naturally concluded\r\nthat all laborers are either hired laborers or what we call\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nNow, there is no such relation between capital and labor as\r\nhere assumed.... Labor is prior to and independent of capital.\r\nCapital is only the fruit of labor, could never have existed if\r\nlabor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital,\r\nand deserves much the higher consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Marching Song\r\n\r\nBY ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE\r\n\r\n(See pages 376, 637)\r\n\r\n            We mix from many lands,\r\n              We march for very far;\r\n            In hearts and lips and hands\r\n              Our staffs and weapons are;\r\n    The light we walk in darkens sun and moon and star.\r\n\r\n            It doth not flame and wane\r\n              With years and spheres that roll,\r\n            Storm cannot shake nor stain\r\n              The strength that makes it whole,\r\n    The fire that moulds and moves it of the sovereign soul....\r\n\r\n            From the edge of harsh derision,\r\n              From discord and defeat,\r\n            From doubt and lame division,\r\n              We pluck the fruit and eat;\r\n    And the mouth finds it bitter, and the spirit sweet....\r\n\r\n            O nations undivided,\r\n              O single people and free,\r\n            We dreamers, we derided,\r\n              We mad blind men that see,\r\n    We bear you witness ere ye come that ye shall be.\r\n\r\n            Ye sitting among tombs,\r\n              Ye standing round the gate,\r\n            Whom fire-mouthed war consumes,\r\n              Or cold-lipped peace bids wait,\r\n    All tombs and bars shall open, every grave and grate....\r\n\r\n            O sorrowing hearts of slaves,\r\n              We heard you beat from far!\r\n            We bring the light that saves,\r\n              We bring the morning star;\r\n    Freedom's good things we bring you, whence all good things are....\r\n\r\n            Rise, ere the dawn be risen;\r\n              Come, and be all souls fed;\r\n            From field and street and prison\r\n              Come, for the feast is spread;\r\n    Live, for the truth is living; wake, for night is dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duties of Man\r\n\r\nBY GIUSEPPE MAZZINI\r\n\r\n(Italian patriot and statesman, 1805-1872; the deliverer of his\r\ncountry here urges the deliverance of mankind)\r\n\r\nWe improve with the improvement of Humanity; nor without the\r\nimprovement of the whole can you hope that your own moral and\r\nmaterial conditions will improve. Generally speaking, you\r\ncannot, even if you would, separate your life from that of\r\nHumanity; you live in it, by it, for it. Your souls, with the\r\nexception of the very few men of exceptional power, cannot\r\nfree themselves from the influence of the elements amid which\r\nthey exist, just as the body, however robust its constitution,\r\ncannot escape from the effects of corrupt air around it. How\r\nmany of you have the strength of mind to bring up your sons to\r\nbe wholly truthful, knowing that you are sending them forth\r\nto persecution in a country where tyrants and spies bid them\r\nconceal or deny two-thirds of their real opinions? How many\r\nof you resolve to educate them to despise wealth in a society\r\nwhere gold is the only power which obtains honors, influence,\r\nand respect, where indeed it is the only protection from the\r\ntyranny and insults of the powerful and their agents? Who is\r\nthere among you who in pure love and with the best intentions\r\nin the world has not murmured to his dear ones in Italy, _Do\r\nnot trust men_; _the honest man should retire into himself\r\nand fly from public life_; _charity begins at home_,--and\r\nsuch-like maxims, plainly immoral, but prompted by the general\r\nstate of society? What mother is there among you who, although\r\nshe belongs to a faith which adores the cross of Christ, the\r\nvoluntary martyr for humanity, has not flung her arms around\r\nher son's neck and striven to dissuade him from perilous\r\nattempts to benefit his brothers? And even if you had strength\r\nto teach the contrary, would not the whole of society, with its\r\nthousand voices, its thousand evil examples, destroy the effect\r\nof your words? Can you purify, elevate your own souls in an\r\natmosphere of contamination and degradation?\r\n\r\nAnd, to descend to your material conditions, do you think they\r\ncan be lastingly ameliorated by anything but the amelioration\r\nof all? Millions of pounds are spent annually here in\r\nEngland, where I write, by private charity, for the relief of\r\nindividuals who have fallen into want; yet want increases here\r\nevery year, and charity to individuals has proved powerless to\r\nheal the evil--the necessity of collective organic remedies is\r\nmore and more universally felt....\r\n\r\nThere is no hope for you except in universal reform and in\r\nthe brotherhood of all the peoples of Europe, and through\r\nEurope of all humanity. I charge you then, O my brothers, by\r\nyour duty and by your own interest, not to forget that your\r\nfirst duties--duties without fulfilling which you cannot hope\r\nto fulfil those owed to family and country--are to Humanity.\r\nLet your words and your actions be for all, since God is for\r\nall, in His Love and in His Law. In whatever land you may be,\r\nwherever a man is fighting for right, for justice, for truth,\r\nthere is your brother; wherever a man suffers through the\r\noppression of error, of injustice, of tyranny, there is your\r\nbrother. Free men and slaves, YOU ARE ALL BROTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Revolution to Revolution\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE D. HERRON\r\n\r\n(See page 730)\r\n\r\nWe have talked much of the brotherhood to come; but brotherhood\r\nhas always been the fact of our life, long before it became a\r\nmodern and insipid sentiment. Only we have been brothers in\r\nslavery and torment, brothers in ignorance and its perdition,\r\nbrothers in disease and war and want, brothers in prostitution\r\nand hypocrisy. What happens to one of us sooner or later\r\nhappens to all; we have always been unescapably involved in\r\na common destiny. We are brothers in the soil from which we\r\nspring; brothers in earthquakes, floods and famines; brothers\r\nin la grippe, cholera, smallpox and priestcraft. It is to the\r\ninterests of the whole of mankind to stamp out the disease that\r\nmay be starting tonight in some wretched Siberian hamlet; to\r\nrescue the children of Egypt and India from the British cotton\r\nmills; to escape the craze and blight of some new superstition\r\nspringing up in Africa or India or Boston. The tuberculosis of\r\nthe East Side sweatshops is infecting the whole of the city\r\nof New York, and spreading therefrom to the Pacific and back\r\nacross the Atlantic. The world constantly tends to the level of\r\nthe downmost man in it; and that downmost man is the world's\r\nreal ruler, hugging it close to his bosom, dragging it down to\r\nhis death. You do not think so, but it is true, and it ought to\r\nbe true. For if there were some way by which some of us could\r\nget free apart from others, if there were some way by which\r\nsome of us could have heaven while others had hell, if there\r\nwere some way by which part of the world could escape some form\r\nof the blight and peril and misery of disinherited labor, then\r\nwould our world indeed be lost and damned; but since men have\r\nnever been able to separate themselves from one another's woes\r\nand wrongs, since history is fairly stricken with the lesson\r\nthat we cannot escape brotherhood of some kind, since the whole\r\nof life is teaching us that we are hourly choosing between\r\nbrotherhood in suffering and brotherhood in good, it remains\r\nfor us to choose the brotherhood of a co-operative world, with\r\nall its fruits thereof--the fruits of love and liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe March of the Workers\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM MORRIS\r\n\r\n(English poet and artist, 1834-1896; founder of the \"Arts and\r\nCrafts\" movement, and a lifelong Socialist)\r\n\r\n    What is this--the sound and rumor? What is this that all men hear,\r\n    Like the wind in hollow valleys when the storm is drawing near,\r\n    Like the rolling-on of ocean in the eventide of fear?\r\n                'Tis the people marching on.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n\r\n    Hark the rolling of the thunder!\r\n    Lo! the sun! and lo! thereunder\r\n    Riseth wrath, and hope, and wonder,\r\n      And the host comes marching on.\r\n\r\n    Forth they come from grief and torment; on they go towards\r\nhealth and mirth.\r\n    All the wide world is their dwelling, every corner of the earth.\r\n    Buy them, sell them for thy service! Try the bargain what 'tis worth,\r\n                For the days are marching on. (Chorus)\r\n\r\n    Many a hundred years passed over have they labored deaf and blind;\r\n    Never tidings reached their sorrow, never hope their toil might find.\r\n    Now at last they've heard and hear it, and the cry comes down the wind\r\n                And their feet are marching on. (Chorus)\r\n\r\n    \"Is it war then? Will ye perish as the dry wood in the fire?\r\n    Is it peace? Then be ye of us, let your hope be our desire.\r\n    Come and live! for life awaketh, and the world shall never tire;\r\n                And hope is marching on. (Chorus)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Working Day\r\n\r\n(_From \"Capital\"_)\r\n\r\nBY KARL MARX\r\n\r\n(A German Jew, father of modern revolutionary Socialism,\r\n1818-1883. Of his epoch-making work the scope of this\r\ncollection permits but a brief passage, by way of illustration)\r\n\r\nWhat is a working day? What is the length of time during\r\nwhich capital may consume the labor-power whose daily value\r\nit buys? How far may the working-day be extended beyond the\r\nworking time necessary for the reproduction of labor-power\r\nitself? It has been seen that to these questions capital\r\nreplies: the working day contains the full twenty-four hours,\r\nwith the deduction of the few hours of repose without which\r\nlabor-power absolutely refuses its services again. Hence it is\r\nself-evident that the laborer is nothing else, his whole life\r\nthrough, than labor-power; that therefore all his disposable\r\ntime is by nature and law labor-time, to be devoted to the\r\nself-expansion of capital. Time for education, for intellectual\r\ndevelopment, for the fulfilling of social functions and for\r\nsocial intercourse, for the free-play of his bodily and mental\r\nactivity, even the rest time of Sunday (and that in a country\r\nof Sabbatarians!)--moonshine! But in its blind, unrestrainable\r\npassion, its were-wolf hunger for surplus-labor, capital\r\noversteps not only the moral, but even the merely physical\r\nmaximum bounds of the working-day. It usurps the time for\r\ngrowth, development, and healthy maintenance of the body. It\r\nsteals the time required for the consumption of fresh air\r\nand sunlight. It higgles over a meal-time, incorporating\r\nit where possible with the process of production itself,\r\nso that food is given to the laborer as to a mere means of\r\nproduction, as coal is supplied to the boiler, grease and oil\r\nto the machinery. It reduces the sound sleep needed for the\r\nrestoration, reparation, refreshment of the bodily powers, to\r\njust so many hours of torpor as the revival of an organism,\r\nabsolutely exhausted, renders essential. It is not the normal\r\nmaintenance of the labor-power which is to determine the\r\nlimits of the working-day; it is the greatest possible daily\r\nexpenditure of labor-power, no matter how diseased, compulsory\r\nand painful it may be, which is to determine the limits of\r\nthe laborers' period of repose. Capital cares nothing for the\r\nlength of life of labor-power. All that concerns it is simply\r\nand solely the maximum of labor-power, that can be rendered\r\nfluent in a working-day. It attains this end by shortening\r\nthe extent of the laborer's life, as a greedy farmer snatches\r\nincreased produce from the soil by robbing it of its fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Organization of Labor\r\n\r\nBY LOUIS BLANC\r\n\r\n(Early French Utopian Socialist, 1811-1882)\r\n\r\nWhat is competition, from the point of view of the workman? It\r\nis work put up to auction. A contractor wants a workman; three\r\npresent themselves.\r\n\r\n\"How much for your work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Half a crown; I have a wife and children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well; and how much for yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two shillings; I have no children, but I have a wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; and now how much for yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"One and eightpence are enough for me; I am single.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you shall have the work.\"\r\n\r\nIt is done; the bargain is struck. And what are the other two\r\nworkmen to do? It is to be hoped they will die quietly of\r\nhunger. But what if they take to thieving? Never fear; we have\r\nthe police. To murder? We have the hangman. As for the lucky\r\none, his triumph is only temporary. Let a fourth workman make\r\nhis appearance, strong enough to fast every other day, and his\r\nprice will run down still lower; there will be a new outcast,\r\nperhaps a new recruit for the prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wastes of Capitalism\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Laws of Social Evolution\"_)\r\n\r\nBY THEODOR HERTZKA\r\n\r\n (An Austrian economist, one of the few in the world who have dealt\r\n with the real problem of economic science, the elimination of waste\r\n and the rationalizing of the system of production. In the following\r\n passage he investigates the question what proportion of human labor\r\n is lost through our competitive methods of industry. The passage has\r\n been frequently quoted, in a mistranslation which obscures its real\r\n significance. The following is not so much a translation as a summary\r\n of the essential statements)\r\n\r\nWe are to investigate what labor-power is required, under\r\ncircumstances now existing in Austria (1886), to produce the\r\nmost essential food-stuffs, and suitable housing and clothing.\r\nFor every family has been allowed a separate, five-roomed\r\nhouse, about forty feet square, and calculated to last fifty\r\nyears. I have reckoned all men between the ages of sixteen and\r\nfifty as capable of working: there being of such in Austria\r\nabout five million. I find that it requires the labor of\r\n615,000 workers to supply the population of 22,000,000 with\r\nfood, clothing and shelter: that is to say, it requires only\r\n12.3 per cent of available labor-power, and each worker needs\r\nto labor only six weeks in the year, in order to provide for\r\nhimself and his family the necessary means of life.\r\n\r\nIn order that no one should conclude that the production of the\r\nluxuries of the better situated part of the population consumes\r\nthe balance of the available labor-power, let us add the\r\nlabor-cost of all the luxury-industries in the widest sense.\r\nIncluding the labor-cost of transportation, these require\r\n315,000 workers, or 6.3 per cent of the available labor-power.\r\nAs a precaution, I increase the total of 18.6 per cent to 20\r\nper cent, and so find that by working sixty days in the year,\r\nthe actual existing consumption should be fully satisfied.\r\nThere remains now this double question: What becomes of the\r\nadditional two hundred and forty days, which are actually spent\r\nin labor? What abyss swallows up the other 80 per cent of the\r\nnation's labor-power? And second, how can it be that in spite\r\nof hard work, the majority are the prey of misery, when at the\r\nutmost 20 per cent of the available labor-power should suffice\r\nfor the maintenance of all?\r\n\r\n\r\nBY G.

HERRON\r\n\r\n(See pages 730, 792)\r\n\r\nUnder the Socialist movement there is coming a time, and the\r\ntime may be even now at hand, when improved conditions or\r\nadjusted wages will no longer be thought to be an answer to\r\nthe cry of labor; yes, when these will be but an insult to\r\nthe common intelligence. It is not for better wages, improved\r\ncapitalist conditions, or a share of capitalist profits that\r\nthe Socialist movement is in the world; it is here for the\r\nabolition of wages and profits, and for the end of capitalism\r\nand the private capitalist. Reformed political institutions,\r\nboards of arbitration between capital and labor, philanthropies\r\nand privileges that are but the capitalist's gifts--none of\r\nthese can much longer answer the question that is making the\r\ntemples, thrones and parliaments of the nations tremble. There\r\ncan be no peace between the man who is down and the man who\r\nbuilds on his back. There can be no reconciliation between\r\nclasses; there can only be an end of classes. It is idle to\r\ntalk of good will until there is first justice, and idle to\r\ntalk of justice until the man who makes the world possesses the\r\nwork of his own hands. The cry of the world's workers can be\r\nanswered with nothing save the whole product of their work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Internationale\r\n\r\nBY EUGENE POTTIER\r\n\r\n(Hymn of the revolutionary working-class of all nations)\r\n\r\n    Arise, ye pris'ners of starvation!\r\n      Arise, ye wretched of the earth,\r\n    For Justice thunders condemnation,\r\n      A better world's in birth.\r\n    No more tradition's chains shall bind us,\r\n      Arise, ye slaves!

It was no longer\r\na question of brandishing the torch. It was necessary to\r\nunderstand and to will, to organize social experience, to wage\r\npetty warfare--sallies, raids, ambuscades; to entertain cold\r\nhatreds, logical and continuous, to haggle over wages as the\r\nNorman peasant haggles over chickens, and above all to create\r\na sort of happy excitement, a fraternal exaltation which would\r\nbring to the gatherings ideas of security, of trust, of mutual\r\naid.\r\n\r\nThe strikes will be beautiful schools of social struggle.\r\nThey will open the path for magnanimous instincts, heroic and\r\nadventurous, which air the human soul. Always better organized,\r\nthey will no longer reduce the artisan to famine, they will\r\ndemand of him only to undergo some privations which the\r\nbeauty of revolt will render almost joyous. They will develop\r\ngenerosity, abnegation, the richest spirit of sacrifice. Their\r\nrecollection will awaken magnificent and powerful images; they\r\nwill lend to the social life that passionate unforeseen, which\r\nis evoked in us by the virgin forest, the open plain, the\r\npalpitant sea....

Lassalle was arrested and sentenced to prison for\r\ndelivering the address from which the following paragraph is\r\ntaken)\r\n\r\nWhoever invokes the idea of the working-class as the ruling\r\nprinciple of society, does not put forth a cry that divides and\r\nseparates the classes of society. On the contrary, he utters a\r\ncry of reconciliation, a cry which embraces the whole of the\r\ncommunity, a cry for the abolishing of all the contradictions\r\nin every circle of society; a cry of union, in which all should\r\njoin who do not wish for privileges, for the oppression of the\r\npeople by privileged classes; a cry of love, which having once\r\ngone up from the heart of the people, will forever remain the\r\ntrue cry of the people, and whose meaning will still make it a\r\ncry of love, even when it sounds as the people's war cry.\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis Hears a Socialist Speech\r\n\r\n(_From \"The Jungle\"_)\r\n\r\nBY UPTON SINCLAIR\r\n\r\n(See pages 43, 143, 194, 274, 403, 776)\r\n\r\nIt was like coming suddenly upon some wild sight of nature--a\r\nmountain forest lashed by a tempest, a ship tossed about upon\r\na stormy sea. Jurgis had an unpleasant sensation, a sense of\r\nconfusion, of disorder, of wild and meaningless uproar. The man\r\nwas tall and gaunt, as haggard as his auditor himself; a thin\r\nblack beard covered half of his face, and one could see only\r\ntwo black hollows where the eyes were. He was speaking rapidly,\r\nin great excitement; he used many gestures--as he spoke he\r\nmoved here and there upon the stage, reaching with his long\r\narms as if to seize each person in his audience. His voice was\r\ndeep, like an organ; it was some time, however, before Jurgis\r\nthought of the voice--he was too much occupied with his eyes\r\nto think of what the man was saying. But suddenly it seemed\r\nas if the speaker had been pointing straight at him, as if he\r\nhad been singled out particularly for his remarks; and so\r\nJurgis became suddenly aware of the voice, trembling, vibrant\r\nwith emotion, with pain and longing, with a burden of things\r\nunutterable, not to be compassed by words. To hear it was to be\r\nsuddenly arrested, to be gripped, transfixed.\r\n\r\n\"You listen to these things,\" the man was saying, \"and you say,\r\n'Yes, they are true, but they have been that way always.' Or\r\nyou say, 'Maybe it will come, but not in my time--it will not\r\nhelp me.' And so you return to your daily round of toil, you\r\ngo back to be ground up for profits in the world-wide mill of\r\neconomic might! To toil long hours for another's advantage;\r\nto live in mean and squalid homes, to work in dangerous and\r\nunhealthful places; to wrestle with the spectres of hunger\r\nand privation, to take your chances of accident, disease and\r\ndeath. And each day the struggle becomes fiercer, the pace more\r\ncruel; each day you have to toil a little harder, and feel the\r\niron hand of circumstance close upon you a little tighter.\r\nMonths pass, years maybe--and then you come again; and again\r\nI am here to plead with you, to know if want and misery have\r\nyet done their work with you, if injustice and oppression\r\nhave yet opened your eyes! I shall still be waiting--there\r\nis nothing else that I can do. There is no wilderness where\r\nI can hide from these things, there is no haven where I can\r\nescape them; though I travel to the ends of the earth, I find\r\nthe same accursed system,--I find that all the fair and noble\r\nimpulses of humanity, the dreams of poets and the agonies of\r\nmartyrs, are shackled and bound in the service of organized\r\nand predatory Greed! And therefore I cannot rest, I cannot\r\nbe silent; therefore I cast aside comfort and happiness,\r\nhealth and good repute--and go out into the world and cry out\r\nthe pain of my spirit! Therefore I am not to be silenced by\r\npoverty and sickness, not by hatred and obloquy, by threats\r\nand ridicule--not by prison and persecution, if they should\r\ncome--not by any power that is upon the earth or above the\r\nearth, that was, or is, or ever can be created. If I fail\r\ntonight, I can only try tomorrow; knowing that the fault must\r\nbe mine--that if once the vision of my soul were spoken upon\r\nearth, if once the anguish of its defeat were uttered in human\r\nspeech, it would break the stoutest barriers of prejudice, it\r\nwould shake the most sluggish soul to action! It would abash\r\nthe most cynical, it would terrify the most selfish; and the\r\nvoice of mockery would be silenced, and fraud and falsehood\r\nwould slink back into their dens, and the truth would stand\r\nforth alone! For I speak with the voice of the millions\r\nwho are voiceless! Of them that are oppressed and have no\r\ncomforter! Of the disinherited of life, for whom there is no\r\nrespite and no deliverance, to whom the world is a prison,\r\na dungeon of torture, a tomb! With the voice of the little\r\nchild who toils tonight in a Southern cotton-mill, staggering\r\nwith exhaustion, numb with agony, and knowing no hope but the\r\ngrave! Of the mother who sews by candle-light in her tenement\r\ngarret, weary and weeping, smitten with the mortal hunger of\r\nher babes! Of the man who lies upon a bed of rags, wrestling\r\nin his last sickness and leaving his loved ones to perish! Of\r\nthe young girl who, somewhere at this moment, is walking the\r\nstreets of this horrible city, beaten and starving, and making\r\nher choice between the brothel and the lake! With the voice\r\nof those, whoever and wherever they may be, who are caught\r\nbeneath the wheels of the juggernaut of Greed! With the voice\r\nof humanity, calling for deliverance!

In the following passage\r\n from his memoirs he tells of his first imprisonment, as a part of\r\n Bismarck's long campaign to destroy the Socialist movement in Germany)\r\n\r\nThe jury comprised six tradesmen, one aristocratic landowner,\r\none head forester, and a few small landowners. The court\r\nwas crowded every day. The Minister of Justice and the\r\nAttorney-General were present on several occasions. As the\r\nleading papers of Germany gave extensive reports of the\r\ntrial, their readers became for the first time aware of what\r\nSocialism meant and at what it aimed. The trial thus became\r\neminently serviceable from the propagandist point of view;\r\nand we, especially Liebknecht, who was the chief propagandist,\r\nwere not loath to avail ourselves of this opportunity. But\r\nour opponents, day after day, were hard at work seeking to\r\nprejudice the jury against us, meeting them in the restaurant,\r\nwhen the events of the day were discussed, and exploiting these\r\nto our disadvantage.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth day the \"pleadings\" for and against us\r\ncommenced. The Public Prosecutor closed his speech with the\r\nwords: \"If you do not find against the accused, you will\r\nsanction high treason for all time to come.\"\r\n\r\nOur counsel replied, and tore the indictment to tatters; but\r\nafter two and a half hours of deliberation the jury came in\r\nwith a verdict of guilty. The Public Prosecutor demanded\r\ntwo years' imprisonment in a fortress, and the court passed\r\njudgment accordingly.\r\n\r\nOur party friends were exceedingly angry on hearing the verdict\r\nand sentence; but I, feeling reckless, proposed that we should\r\ngo together to Auerbach's cellar--rendered famous by the scene\r\nin Goethe's _Faust_--and have a bottle of wine. Our wives,\r\nwho received us with tears, were not pleased with our levity;\r\nbut finally, plucky women that they were, they came with us.\r\nMy doctor consoled my wife in a curious way. \"Frau Bebel,\" he\r\nsaid, \"if your husband gets a year in prison you may rejoice,\r\nfor he needs a rest!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONCE YE HAVE SEEN MY FACE YE DARE NOT MOCK\r\n\r\nCARTOON FROM THE \"NEW AGE,\" LONDON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUSTICE\r\n\r\nWALTER CRANE\r\n\r\n(_English artist and Socialist, 1845-1915_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nJimmie Higgins\r\n\r\nBY BEN HANFORD\r\n\r\n(A New York printer who literally gave his life for the\r\nSocialist movement, dying of consumption caused by overwork. He\r\nwas the party's candidate for Vice-president in 1904)\r\n\r\nA comrade who shall be called Jimmie Higgins because that is\r\nnot his name, and who shall be styled a painter for the very\r\ngood reason that he is not a painter, has perhaps had a greater\r\ninfluence in keeping me keyed up to my work in the labor\r\nmovement than any other person.\r\n\r\nJimmie Higgins is neither broad-shouldered nor thick-chested.\r\nHe is neither pretty nor strong. A little, thin, weak,\r\npale-faced chap. But he is strong enough to support a mother\r\nwith equal physical disabilities. Strong enough to put in ten\r\nyears of unrecognized and unexcelled service to the cause of\r\nSocialism.\r\n\r\nWhat did he do? Everything.\r\n\r\nHe has made more Socialist speeches than any man in America.\r\nNot that he did the talking; but he carried the platform on his\r\nbent shoulders when the platform committee failed to be on hand.\r\n\r\nThen he hustled around to another branch and got their platform\r\nout. Then he got a glass of water for \"the speaker.\" That\r\nsame evening or the day before he had distributed hand-bills\r\nadvertising the meeting.\r\n\r\nPreviously he had informed his branch as to \"the best corner\"\r\nin the district for drawing a crowd. Then he distributed\r\nleaflets at the meeting, and helped to take the platform down\r\nand carry it back to headquarters, and got subscribers for\r\nSocialist papers.\r\n\r\nThe next day the same, and so on all through the campaign, and\r\none campaign after another. When he had a job, which was none\r\ntoo often, for Jimmie was not an extra good workman and was\r\nalways one of the first to be laid off, he would distribute\r\nSocialist papers among his fellows during the noon hour, or\r\ntake a run down to the gate of some factory and give out\r\nSocialist leaflets to the employees who came out to lunch.\r\n\r\nWhat did he do? Jimmie Higgins did everything, anything.\r\nWhatever was to be done, THAT was Jimmie's job.\r\n\r\nFirst to do his own work; then the work of those who had become\r\nwearied or negligent. Jimmie Higgins couldn't sing, nor dance,\r\nnor tell a story--but he could DO the thing to be done.\r\n\r\nBe you, reader, ever so great, you nor any other shall ever do\r\nmore than that. Jimmie Higgins had no riches, but out of his\r\npoverty he always gave something, his all; be you, reader, ever\r\nso wealthy and likewise generous, you shall never give more\r\nthan that.\r\n\r\nJimmie Higgins never had a front seat on the platform; he never\r\nknew the tonic of applause nor the inspiration of opposition;\r\nhe never was seen in the foreground of the picture.\r\n\r\nBut he had erected the platform and painted the picture;\r\nthrough his hard, disagreeable and thankless toil it had come\r\nto pass that liberty was brewing and things were doing.\r\n\r\nJimmie Higgins. How shall we pay, how reward this man? What\r\ngold, what laurels shall be his?\r\n\r\nThere's just one way, reader, that you and I can \"make good\"\r\nwith Jimmie Higgins and the likes of him. That way is to be\r\nlike him.\r\n\r\nTake a fresh start and never let go.\r\n\r\nThink how great his work, and he has so little to do with. How\r\nlittle ours in proportion to our strength!\r\n\r\nI know some grand men and women in the Socialist movement. But\r\nin high self-sacrifice, in matchless fidelity to truth, I shall\r\nnever meet a greater man than Jimmie Higgins.\r\n\r\nAnd many a branch has one of him.\r\n\r\nAnd may they have more of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS\r\n\r\nFor ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men\r\nafter the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:\r\nbut God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound\r\nthe things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and\r\nthings which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things\r\nwhich are not, to bring to naught things that are.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy I Voted the Socialist Ticket\r\n\r\nBY VACHEL LINDSAY\r\n\r\n(See pages 335, 599, 672, 699)\r\n\r\n    I am unjust, but I can strive for justice.\r\n      My life's unkind, but I can vote for kindness.\r\n    I, the unloving, say life should be lovely.\r\n      I, that am blind, cry out against my blindness.\r\n\r\n    Man is a curious brute--he pets his fancies--\r\n      Fighting mankind to win sweet luxury;\r\n    So he will be, tho' law be clear as crystal,\r\n      Tho' all men plan to live in harmony.\r\n\r\n    Come, let us vote against our human nature,\r\n      Crying to God in all the polling places\r\n    To heal our everlasting sinfulness\r\n      And make us sages with transfigured faces.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgressivism and After\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM ENGLISH WALLING\r\n\r\n(American Socialist writer, born 1877)\r\n\r\nA certain measure of progress is to be expected through the\r\nself-interest of the governing classes. This is the national,\r\nor industrial, efficiency movement.\r\n\r\nFar greater progress is to be expected from the successive\r\nrise into power and prosperity of new elements of the\r\nmiddle-class--and of the upper layers of the wage-earners. This\r\nis the progressive and the Laborite movement.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest progress is to be expected as a direct or\r\nindirect result of the revolt of the lower classes. For this is\r\nthe only force that can be relied upon to put an end to class\r\ngovernment and class exploitation of industry, and to establish\r\nthat social democracy which is the real or professed aim of\r\nevery progressive movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY OTTO VON BISMARCK\r\n\r\n(Speech in the German Reichstag, 1884)\r\n\r\nI acknowledge unconditionally the right to work, and I will\r\nstand up for it as long as I am in this place.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race\r\n\r\n(_From the Preface_)\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT OWEN\r\n\r\n(Early English Utopian Socialist, 1771-1858)\r\n\r\nThe Past has been inevitable, and necessary to produce the\r\nPresent; as the Present will necessarily produce the Future\r\nstate of human existence. The past has produced a repulsive,\r\nunorganized, ignorant, and to a great extent, miserable state\r\nof society, over the world, as now existing. The present,\r\nhowever, has been made to develop all the materials requisite\r\nto produce an attractive, organized, enlightened and happy\r\nfuture, for the human race, in all parts of the globe.\r\n\r\nThose informed know that all the materials are amply prepared,\r\nready to create a happy future; but that to effect this result,\r\nthe materials must be wisely applied, to form a scientific\r\narrangement of society, based on an accurate knowledge of human\r\nnature. Means are, therefore, now required to induce the public\r\nto investigate this important subject, which is in direct\r\nopposition to the false and fatal association of ideas which,\r\nfrom birth, have been forced into the minds and upon the habits\r\nof people.\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning a Socialist Paper\r\n\r\n(_From \"Comrade Yetta\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ALBERT EDWARDS\r\n\r\n(See pages 205, 244)\r\n\r\nFor half an hour they bent their heads over balance-sheets.\r\nIt was an appalling situation. The debt was out of all\r\nproportion to the property. To be sure much of it was held by\r\nsympathizers, who were not likely to foreclose. But there was\r\nno immediate hope of decreasing the burden. Any new income\r\nwould have to go into improvements. The future of the paper\r\ndepended not only on its ability to carry this dead weight, but\r\non the continuance of the Pledge Fund and on Isadore's success\r\nin begging about a hundred dollars a week.\r\n\r\n\"It's hopeless,\" Yetta said. \"You might run a good weekly on\r\nthese resources, but you need ten times as much to keep up a\r\ngood daily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you feel that way about it, Yetta, I hope you'll\r\nresign at to-night's meeting.\" His eyes turned away from her\r\nface about the busy room, and his discouraged look gave place\r\nto one of conviction. A note of dogged determination rang in\r\nhis voice.--\"Because it isn't hopeless! Our only real danger\r\nis that the executive committee may kill us with cold water.\r\nIf we can get a committee that believes in us, we'll be all\r\nright. A paper like this isn't a matter of finance. That's what\r\nyou--and the other discouragers--don't see. You look at it from\r\na bourgeois dollar-and-cents point of view. It's hopeless,\r\nis it? Well, we've been doing this impossible thing for more\r\nthan a year. It's hopeless to carry such indebtedness? Good\r\nGod! We started with nothing but debts--nothing at all to\r\nshow. Every number that comes out makes it more hopeful. The\r\nadvertising increases. The Pledge Fund grows. Why, we've got\r\ntwelve thousand people in the habit of reading it now. That\r\nhabit is an asset which doesn't show in the books. Six months\r\nago we had nothing!--not even experience. Why, our office force\r\nwasn't even organized!

A stenographer in a\r\nfar corner began to count, \"One! two! three!\" Every one in the\r\noffice, even the linotypers and printer's devil beyond the\r\npartition took up the slogan.\r\n\r\n\"O-o-oh! Cut it out and work for Socialism.\"\r\n\r\nThe tense expression on Isadore's face relaxed into a confident\r\ngrin.\r\n\r\n\"That's it. You think we need money to run this paper?

I do not call to mind a single human being\r\nwho has steadily denied the authority of the laws, on the\r\nsimple ground of his own moral nature. Such designs, full\r\nof genius and full of fate as they are, are not entertained\r\nexcept avowedly as air-pictures. If the individual who exhibits\r\nthem dare to think them practicable, he disgusts scholars and\r\nchurchmen; and men of talent, and women of superior sentiments,\r\ncannot hide their contempt. Not the less does nature continue\r\nto fill the heart of youth with suggestions of this enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New State\r\n\r\n(_From the \"Panama-Pacific Ode\"_)\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE STERLING\r\n\r\n(See pages 504, 552, 597)\r\n\r\n    O dark and cruel State,\r\n    Whose towers are altars unto self alone,--\r\n            Whose streets with tears are wet,\r\n    And half thy councils given unto hate!\r\n    Shall Time not hurl thy temples stone from stone,\r\n            And o'er the ruin set\r\n    A fairer city than the years have known?\r\n    Out of thy darkness do we find us dreams,\r\n            And on the future gleams\r\n    The vision of thy ramparts built anew.\r\n    Mammon and War sit now a double throne,\r\n    Yet what we dream, a wiser Age shall do.\r\n\r\n    Be ye lift up, O everlasting gates\r\n    Of that far City men shall build for man!\r\n            O fairer Day that waits,\r\n    The splendor of whose dawn we shall not see,\r\n    When selfish bonds of family and clan\r\n    Melt in the higher love that yet shall be!\r\n    O State without a master or a slave,\r\n            Whose law of light we crave\r\n    Ere morning widen on a world set free!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coming Dawn\r\n\r\n(_From \"Woman\"_)\r\n\r\nBY AUGUST BEBEL\r\n\r\n(See page 807)\r\n\r\nEvery day furnishes fresh proof of the rapid growth and\r\nspread of the ideas that we represent.

And if, in the\r\ncourse of this great battle for the emancipation of the human\r\nrace, we should fall, those now in the rear will step forward;\r\nand we shall fall with the consciousness of having done our\r\nduty as human beings, and with the conviction that the goal\r\nwill be reached, however the powers hostile to humanity may\r\nstruggle or strain in resistance. _Ours is the world, despite\r\nall; that is, for the workers and the woman._\r\n\r\n\r\nLabor Irresistible\r\n\r\n(_From \"Violence and the Labor Movement\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT HUNTER\r\n\r\n(American Socialist writer, born 1874)\r\n\r\nHere it is, \"the self-conscious, independent movement of the\r\nimmense majority, in the interest of the immense majority,\"\r\nalready with its eleven million voters and its fifty million\r\nsouls. It has slowly, patiently, painfully toiled up to a\r\nheight where it is beginning to see visions of victory. It has\r\nfaith in itself and in its cause. It believes it has the power\r\nof deliverance for all society and for all humanity. It does\r\nnot expect the powerful to have faith in it; but, as Jesus\r\ncame out of despised Nazareth, so the new world is coming out\r\nof the multitude, amid the toil and sweat and anguish of the\r\nmills, mines, and factories of the world. It has endured much;\r\nsuffered long ages of slavery and serfdom. From being mere\r\nanimals of production, the workers have become the \"hands\"\r\nof production; and they are now reaching out to become the\r\nmasters of production. And, while in other periods of the\r\nworld their intolerable misery led them again and again to\r\nstrike out in a kind of torrential anarchy that pulled down\r\nsociety itself, they have in our time, for the first time in\r\nthe history of the world, patiently and persistently organized\r\nthemselves into a world power. Where shall we find in all\r\nhistory another instance of the organization in less than half\r\na century of eleven million people into a compact force for\r\nthe avowed purpose of peacefully and legally taking possession\r\nof the world? They have refused to hurry. They have declined\r\nall short cuts. They have spurned violence. The \"bourgeois\r\ndemocrats,\" the terrorists, and the syndicalists, each in\r\ntheir time, have tried to point out a shorter, quicker path.\r\nThe workers have refused to listen to them. On the other hand,\r\nthey have declined the way of compromise, of fusions, and of\r\nalliances, that have also promised a quicker and shorter road\r\nto power. With most maddening patience they have declined to\r\ntake any other path than their own--thus infuriating not only\r\nthe terrorists in their own ranks but those Greeks from the\r\nother side who came to them bearing gifts. Nothing seems to\r\ndisturb them or to block their path. They are offered reforms\r\nand concessions, which they take blandly, but without thanks.\r\nThey move on and on, with the terrible, incessant, irresistible\r\npower of some eternal, natural force. They have been fought;\r\nyet they have never lost a single great battle. They have\r\nbeen flattered and cajoled, without ever once anywhere being\r\nappeased. They have been provoked, insulted, imprisoned,\r\ncalumniated, and repressed. They are indifferent to it all.\r\nThey move on and on--with the patience and the meekness of a\r\npeople with the vision that they are soon to inherit the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Magnificat\r\n\r\nBY MARY, MOTHER OF JESUS\r\n\r\nHe hath showed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the\r\nproud in the imagination of their hearts.

In the character of \"Owen,\" the author here\r\ntells of his own efforts to awaken his fellow-workers in\r\nEngland)\r\n\r\nToward the end of March the outlook began to improve. By\r\nthe middle of April Rushton and Company were working eleven\r\nand a half hours a day. In May, as the jobs increased and\r\nthe days grew longer, they were allowed to put in overtime;\r\nand, as the summer months came round, once more the crowd of\r\nragged-trousered philanthropists began to toil and sweat at\r\ntheir noble and unselfish task of making money for Mr. Rushton.\r\nPapering, painting, white-washing, distempering, digging\r\nup drains, repairing roofs, their zeal and enthusiasm were\r\nunbounded. Their operations extended all over the town. At all\r\nhours of the day they were to be seen going to or returning\r\nfrom jobs, carrying planks and ladders, paint and whitewash,\r\nchimney pots and drain pipes, a crowd of tattered Imperialists,\r\nin broken boots, paint-splashed caps, their clothing saturated\r\nwith sweat and plastered with mortar. The daily spectacle of\r\nthe workmen, tramping wearily home along the pavement of the\r\nGrand Parade, caused some annoyance to the better classes, and\r\na letter appeared in _The Obscurer_ suggesting that it would\r\nbe better if they walked on the road. When they heard of this\r\nletter most of the men adopted the suggestion and left the\r\npavement for their betters.\r\n\r\nOn the jobs themselves, meanwhile, the same old conditions\r\nprevailed, the same frenzied hurry, the same scamping of the\r\nwork, slobbering it over, cheating the customers; the same\r\ncurses behind the foreman's back, the same groveling in his\r\npresence, the same strident bellowing from Misery: \"Get it\r\n_Done_! For Gord's sake, get it _Done_! 'Aven't you finished\r\nyet? We're losing money over this! If you chaps can't tear into\r\nit we'll have an _Alteration_!\" and the result was that the\r\nphilanthropists often tore into it to such an extent that they\r\nworked themselves out of a job, for business fluctuated, and\r\noccasionally everybody was \"stood off\" for a few days....\r\n\r\nThey were putting new floors where the old ones were decayed,\r\nand making two rooms into one by demolishing the parting wall\r\nand substituting an iron girder. They were replacing window\r\nframes and sashes, replastering cracked ceilings and walls,\r\ncutting openings and fitting doors where no doors had ever been\r\nbefore. They were taking down broken chimney pots and fixing\r\nnew ones in their places. They were washing the old whitewash\r\noff the ceilings, and scraping the old paper off the walls. The\r\nair was full of the sounds of hammering and sawing, the ringing\r\nof trowels, the rattle of pails, the splashing of water brushes\r\nand the scraping of the stripping knives. It was also heavily\r\nladen with dust and disease germs, powdered mortar, lime,\r\nplaster, and the dirt that had been accumulating within the old\r\nhouse for years. In brief, those employed there might be said\r\nto be living in a Tariff Reform Paradise--they had Plenty of\r\nWork.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock Bob Crass, the painter's foreman, blew a\r\nprolonged blast upon a whistle and all hands assembled in the\r\nkitchen, where Bert the apprentice had already prepared the tea\r\nin the large galvanized iron pail placed in the middle of the\r\nfloor. By the side of the pail were a number of old jam jars,\r\nmugs, dilapidated teacups, and one or two empty condensed milk\r\ntins. Each man on the \"job\" paid Bert threepence a week for\r\nthe tea and sugar--they did not have milk--and although they\r\nhad tea at breakfast time as well as at dinner the lad was\r\ngenerally considered to be making a fortune....\r\n\r\nAs each man came in he filled his cup, jam jar, or condensed\r\nmilk tin with tea from the steaming pail, before sitting down.\r\nMost of them brought their food in little wicker baskets, which\r\nthey held on their laps, or placed on the floor beside them.\r\n\r\nAt first there was no attempt at conversation and nothing was\r\nheard but the sounds of eating and drinking and the frizzling\r\nof the bloater which Easton, one of the painters, was toasting\r\non the end of a pointed stick at the fire.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think much of this bloody tea,\" suddenly remarked\r\nSawkins, one of the laborers.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it oughter be all right,\" retorted Bert; \"it's bin\r\nbilin' ever since 'arf past eleven....\"\r\n\r\n\"Has anyone seen old Jack Linden since 'e got the push?\"\r\ninquired Harlow.\r\n\r\n\"I seen 'im Saturday,\" said Slyme.\r\n\r\n\"Is 'e doin' anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know: I didn't 'ave time to speak to 'im.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, 'e ain't got nothing,\" remarked Philpot. \"I seen 'im\r\nSaturday night, an' 'e told me 'e's been walkin' about ever\r\nsince.\"\r\n\r\nPhilpot did not add that he had \"lent\" Linden a shilling, which\r\nhe never expected to see again.\r\n\r\n\"'E won't be able to get a job again in a 'urry,\" remarked\r\nEaston; \"'e's too old.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know, after all, you can't blame Misery for sackin' 'im,\"\r\nsaid Crass after a pause. \"'E was too slow for a funeral.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how much _you'll_ be able to do when you're as old as\r\nhe is?\" said Owen.\r\n\r\n\"Praps I won't want to do nothing,\" replied Crass, with a\r\nfeeble laugh. \"I'm goin' to live on me means.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say the best thing old Jack could do would be to go\r\nin the workhouse,\" said Harlow.\r\n\r\n\"Yes: I reckon that's what'll be the end of it,\" said Easton,\r\nin a matter-of-fact tone.\r\n\r\n\"It's a grand finish, isn't it?\" observed Owen. \"After working\r\nhard all one's life to be treated like a criminal at the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you call bein' treated like criminals,\"\r\nexclaimed Crass. \"I reckon they 'as a bloody fine time of it,\r\nan' we've got to find the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for Gord's sake, don't start no more arguments,\" cried\r\nHarlow, addressing Owen. \"We 'ad enough of that last week. You\r\ncan't expect a boss to employ a man when 'e's too old to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" said Crass.\r\n\r\nOld Joe Philpot said--nothing.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see no sense in always grumblin',\" Crass proceeded;\r\n\"these things can't be altered. You can't expect there can be\r\nplenty of work for everyone with all this 'ere labor-savin'\r\nmachinery what's been invented.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Harlow, \"the people what used to be employed\r\non the work what's now done by machinery has to find something\r\nelse to do. Some of 'em goes to our trade, for instance. The\r\nresult is there's too many at it, and there ain't enough work\r\nto keep 'em all goin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Crass, eagerly, \"that's just what I say. Machinery\r\nis the real cause of all the poverty. That's what I said the\r\nother day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Machinery is undoubtedly the cause of unemployment,\" replied\r\nOwen, \"but it's not the cause of poverty; that's another matter\r\naltogether.\"\r\n\r\nThe others laughed derisively.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it seems to me to amount to the same thing,\" said\r\nHarlow, and nearly everyone agreed.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't seem to me to amount to the same thing,\" Owen\r\nreplied. \"In my opinion we are all in a state of poverty even\r\nwhen we have employment. The condition we are reduced to when\r\nwe're out of work is more properly described as destitution.\r\n\r\n\"Poverty,\" continued Owen after a short silence, \"consists in a\r\nshortage of the necessaries of life. When those things are so\r\nscarce or so dear that people are unable to obtain sufficient\r\nof them to satisfy all their needs, they are in a condition\r\nof poverty. If you think that the machinery which makes it\r\npossible to produce all the necessaries of life in abundance\r\nis the cause of the shortage, it seems to me there must be\r\nsomething the matter with your minds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course we're all bloody fools, except you,\" snarled\r\nCrass. \"When they was servin' out the sense they give you such\r\na 'ell of a lot there wasn't none left for nobody else.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there wasn't something wrong with your minds,\" continued\r\nOwen, \"you would be able to see that we might have 'Plenty\r\nof Work' and yet be in a state of destitution. The miserable\r\nwretches who toil sixteen or eighteen hours a day--father,\r\nmother, and even the little children--making matchboxes, or\r\nshirts or blouses, have 'Plenty of Work,' but I for one don't\r\nenvy them. Perhaps you think that if there was no machinery,\r\nand we all had to work thirteen or fourteen hours a day in\r\norder to obtain a bare living, we should not be in a condition\r\nof poverty? Talk about there being something the matter with\r\nyour minds--if there were not you wouldn't talk one day about\r\nTariff Reform as a remedy for unemployment, and then the next\r\nday admit that machinery is the cause of it! Tariff Reform\r\nwon't do away with machinery, will it?\" ...\r\n\r\nNo one answered, because none of them knew of any remedy; and\r\nCrass began to feel sorry that he had reintroduced the subject\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\"In the near future,\" continued Owen, \"it is probable that\r\nhorses will be almost entirely superseded by motor cars and\r\nelectric trams. As the services of horses will no longer be\r\nrequired, all but a few will die out; they will no longer\r\nbe bred to the same extent as formerly. We can't blame the\r\nhorses for allowing themselves to be exterminated. They have\r\nnot sufficient intelligence to understand what's being done.\r\nTherefore, they will submit tamely to the extinction of the\r\ngreater number of their kind.\r\n\r\n\"As we have seen, a great deal of the work which was formerly\r\ndone by human beings is now being done by machinery. This\r\nmachinery belongs to a few people; it is being worked for the\r\nbenefit of those few, just the same as were the human beings it\r\ndisplaced.\r\n\r\n\"These few have no longer any need of the services of so\r\nmany human workers, so they propose to exterminate them! The\r\nunnecessary human beings are to be allowed to starve to death!\r\nAnd they are also to be taught that it is wrong to marry and\r\nbreed children, because the Sacred Few do not require so many\r\npeople to work for them as before!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and you'll never be able to prevent it, mate!\" shouted\r\nCrass.\r\n\r\n\"Why can't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it can't be done!\" cried Crass, fiercely. \"It's\r\nimpossible!\" ...\r\n\r\nThere was a general murmur of satisfaction. Nearly everyone\r\nseemed very pleased to think that the existing state of things\r\ncould not possibly be altered.\r\n\r\n\r\nWealth Against Commonwealth\r\n\r\nBY HENRY DEMAREST LLOYD\r\n\r\n(American social reformer, pioneer in what later came to be\r\nknown as \"muck-raking\"; 1847-1903)\r\n\r\nOne of the largest stones in the arch of \"consolidation,\"\r\nperhaps the keystone, is that men have become so intelligent,\r\nso responsive and responsible, so co-operative, that they can\r\nbe trusted in great masses with the care of vast properties\r\nowned entirely by others; and with the operation of complicated\r\nprocesses, although but a slender cost of subsistence is\r\nawarded them out of fabulous profits. The spectacle of the\r\nmillion and more employees of the railroads of this country\r\ndespatching trains, maintaining tracks, collecting fares and\r\nfreights, and turning over hundreds of millions of net profits\r\nto the owners, not one in a thousand of whom would know how\r\nto do the simplest of these things himself, is possible only\r\nwhere civilization has reached a high average of morals and\r\nculture. More and more the mills and mines and stores, and\r\neven the farms and forests, are being administered by other\r\nthan the owners. The virtue of the people is taking the place\r\nPoor Richard thought only the eye of the owner could fill. If\r\nmankind driven by their fears and the greed of others can do\r\nso well, what will be their productivity and cheer when the\r\n\"interest of all\" sings them to their work?\r\n\r\n\r\nMutual Aid as a Factor in Evolution\r\n\r\nBY PETER KROPOTKIN\r\n\r\n (This work of the great Russian scientist is a most important\r\n contribution to modern thought, overthrowing as it does the\r\n old-fashioned view of \"Nature red in tooth and claw with ravin,\" which\r\n was the basis of early biologic teaching and is still the basis of all\r\n bourgeois economic ideas)\r\n\r\nAs soon as we study animals--not in laboratories and museums\r\nonly, but in the forest and prairie, in the steppe and in\r\nthe mountains--we at once perceive that though there is an\r\nimmense amount of warfare and extermination going on amidst\r\nvarious species, and especially amidst various classes of\r\nanimals, there is, at the same time, as much, or perhaps\r\neven more, of mutual support, mutual aid, and mutual defence\r\namidst animals belonging to the same species or, at least, to\r\nthe same society. Sociability is as much a law of nature as\r\nmutual struggle. Of course it would be extremely difficult to\r\nestimate, however roughly, the relative numerical importance\r\nof both these series of facts. But if we resort to an indirect\r\ntest, and ask Nature: \"Who are the fittest: those who are\r\ncontinually at war with each other, or those who support one\r\nanother?\" we at once see that those animals which acquire\r\nhabits of mutual aid are undoubtedly the fittest. They have\r\nmore chances to survive, and they attain, in their respective\r\nclasses, the highest development and bodily organization. If\r\nthe numberless facts which can be brought forward to support\r\nthis view are taken into account, we may safely say that mutual\r\naid is as much a law of animal life as mutual struggle; but\r\nthat as a factor of evolution, it most probably has a far\r\ngreater importance, inasmuch as it favors the development\r\nof such habits and characters as insure the maintenance and\r\nfurther development of the species, together with the greatest\r\namount of welfare and enjoyment of life for the individual,\r\nwith the least waste of energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-operation and Nationality\r\n\r\nBY \"A.E.\" (GEORGE W. RUSSELL)\r\n\r\n(See pages 252, 513)\r\n\r\nWherever there is mutual aid, wherever there is constant give\r\nand take, wherever the prosperity of the individual depends\r\ndirectly and obviously on the prosperity of the community about\r\nhim, there the social order tends to produce fine types of\r\ncharacter, with a devotion to public ideas; and this is the\r\nreal object of all government. The worst thing which can happen\r\nto a social community is to have no social order at all, where\r\nevery man is for himself and the devil may take the hindmost.\r\nGenerally in such a community he takes the front rank as well\r\nas the stragglers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Worlds for Old\r\n\r\nBY H. G. WELLS\r\n\r\n(See pages 519, 675, 712)\r\n\r\nSocialism is to me a very great thing indeed, the form and\r\nsubstance of my ideal life and all the religion I possess. I\r\nam, by a sort of predestination, a Socialist. I perceive I\r\ncannot help talking and writing about Socialism, and shaping\r\nand forwarding Socialism. I am one of a succession--one of a\r\ngrowing multitude of witnesses, who will continue. It does\r\nnot--in the larger sense--matter how many generations of us\r\nmust toil and testify. It does not matter, except as our\r\nindividual concern, how individually we succeed or fail, what\r\nblunders we make, what thwartings we encounter, what follies\r\nand inadequacies darken our private hopes and level our\r\npersonal imaginations to the dust. We have the light. We know\r\nwhat we are for, and that the light that now glimmers so dimly\r\nthrough us must in the end prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialism and Motherhood\r\n\r\nBY JOHN SPARGO\r\n\r\n(American Socialist writer and lecturer, born in England, 1876)\r\n\r\nThe message of Socialism is a message of Life and Liberty\r\nand Love. It promises to destroy the political, social, and\r\neconomic disabilities imposed upon womanhood; to give the\r\nmothers of the race equal freedom with the fathers of the race.\r\nIt pledges itself to destroy those conditions of life and labor\r\nwhich weaken the mothers and deny to their babies the right to\r\nbe well born. It claims for every child all the advantages of\r\nhealthful and beautiful environment. It would destroy the dread\r\nfear of want which drives the mother from the service of her\r\nchild into the service of a great factory. It would bestow upon\r\nevery child, as its rightful heritage, opportunity to develop\r\nall its powers. It would apply the principles of the family to\r\nthe state. It would abolish the body and soul debasing labor of\r\nchildren, and give to the little ones their Kingdom of Laughter\r\nand Dreams. It would end the waste of human lives by poverty,\r\nand make true wealth possible for all. It would put an end to\r\nwar--the war of classes as well as the war of nations--and\r\norganize and direct the genius and power of the race, now so\r\nlargely given to destruction, to the enrichment of life for all\r\nand the realization of Human Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nSocialism comes to the mother as an Angel of Light and Life,\r\nbearing the torch of a great hope. \"I am Life Abundant,\"\r\ncries the angel, \"and I bring you as gifts the Freedom and\r\nOpportunity and Joy and Peace for which you have prayed. See,\r\nmy Sister, Mother of Men, all these are yours if you will put\r\nforth your hand and receive them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress in Medicine\r\n\r\nBY JAMES P.

One was\r\nburned to the stake and the other was mobbed for his pains. The\r\nwhole history of medicine, with its splendid list of martyrs,\r\nis a glorious refutation of the sophistry that competition for\r\nprofits is important to human progress.

HERRON\r\n\r\n(See pages 730, 792, 799)\r\n\r\nDespite the paradoxical and deathful nature of our capitalist\r\ncivilization, despite the industrial insanity and spiritual\r\nchaos, a new world is surely forming; dimly may we discern the\r\nwhite pinnacles and the green gardens of the gathering city\r\nof man. There is approaching--and it is not so far off as it\r\nseems--a world arranged by the wisdom hid in the human heart;\r\na world that is the organization of a strong and universal\r\nkindness; a world redeemed from the fear of institutions and of\r\npoverty. Even now, derided and discouraged as it is, socially\r\nuntrained and inexperienced as it is, if the instinctual and\r\nrepressed kindness of mankind were suddenly let loose upon the\r\nearth, sooner than we think would we be members one of another,\r\nsitting around one family hearthstone, and singing the song of\r\nthe new humanity....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XVII\r\n\r\n_The New Day_\r\n\r\nThe deliverance of humanity and the triumph of labor\r\nenfranchised; passages from Utopias new and old, and the\r\nraptures of poets and prophets contemplating \"the good time\r\ncoming.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a Strong Bird on Pinions Free\r\n\r\nBY WALT WHITMAN\r\n\r\n(See pages 174, 268, 578, 726)\r\n\r\n    Beautiful World of new, superber Birth, that rises to my eyes,\r\n    Like a limitless golden cloud, filling the western sky....\r\n    Thou Wonder World, yet undefined, unformed--neither do I define thee;\r\n    How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of the future?\r\n    I feel thy ominous greatness, evil as well as good;\r\n    I watch thee, advancing, absorbing the present, transcending the past;\r\n    I see thy light lighting and thy shadow shadowing, as if the\r\nentire globe;\r\n    But I do not undertake to define thee--hardly to comprehend thee;\r\n    I but thee name--thee prophesy--as now!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kingdom of Man\r\n\r\nBY E. RAY LANKESTER\r\n\r\n(English scientist, professor in the University of London, born\r\n1847)\r\n\r\nThe new knowledge of Cature, the newly-ascertained capacity\r\nof man for a control of Nature so thorough as to be almost\r\nunlimited, has not as yet had an opportunity of showing what\r\nit can do. No power has called on man to arise and enter upon\r\nthe possession of this kingdom--the \"Kingdom of Man\" foreseen\r\nby Francis Bacon and pictured by him to an admiring but\r\nincredulous age with all the fervor and picturesque detail of\r\nwhich he was capable. And yet at this moment the mechanical\r\ndifficulties, the want of assurance and of exact knowledge,\r\nwhich necessarily prevented Bacon's schemes from taking\r\npractical shape, have been removed. The will to possess this\r\nvast territory is alone wanting.\r\n\r\nThe weariness which is so largely expressed today in regard to\r\nhuman effort is greatly due to the fact that we have exhausted\r\nold sources of inspiration, and have not yet learned to believe\r\nin the new. It is time for man to take up whole-heartedly the\r\nKingdom of Nature which it is his destiny to rule. New hope,\r\nnew life will, when he does this, be infused into every line of\r\nhuman activity. To a community which believes in the destiny\r\nof man as the controller of Nature and has consciously entered\r\nupon its fulfilment, there can be none of the weariness and\r\neven despair which comes from an exclusive worship of the past.\r\nThere can be only encouragement in every victory gained, hope\r\nand the realization of hope.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a Steamship\r\n\r\nBY UPTON SINCLAIR\r\n\r\n(See pages 43, 143, 194, 274, 403, 776, 803)\r\n\r\n    All night, without the gates of slumber lying,\r\n    I listen to the joy of falling water,\r\n    And to the throbbing of an iron heart.\r\n\r\n    In ages past, men went upon the sea,\r\n    Waiting the pleasure of the chainless winds:\r\n    But now the course is laid, the billows part;\r\n    Mankind has spoken: \"Let the ship go there!\"\r\n\r\n    I am grown haggard and forlorn, from dreams\r\n    That haunt me, of the time that is to be,\r\n    When man shall cease from wantonness and strife,\r\n    And lay his law upon the course of things.\r\n    Then shall he live no more on sufferance,\r\n    An accident, the prey of powers blind;\r\n    The untamed giants of nature shall bow down--\r\n    The tides, the tempest and the lightning cease\r\n    From mockery and destruction, and be turned\r\n    Unto the making of the soul of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS CARLYLE\r\n\r\n(See pages 31, 74, 133, 488, 553, 652)\r\n\r\nWe must some day, at last and forever, cross the line between\r\nNonsense and Common Sense.

Rustling\r\nshe comes, the ever-rejuvenating mother of mankind; destroying\r\nand fulfilling, she fares across the earth; before her soughs\r\nthe storm, and shakes so fiercely at man's handiwork that vast\r\nclouds of dust eclipse the sky, and where her mighty foot is\r\nset, there falls in ruins what an idle whim had built for\r\naeons; the hem of her robe sweeps its last remains away. But in\r\nher wake there opens out a never-dreamt paradise of happiness,\r\nillumined by kindly sunbeams; and where her foot had trodden\r\ndown, spring fragrant flowers from the soul, and jubilant songs\r\nof freed mankind fill the air, scarce silent from the din of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Memoriam\r\n\r\nBY ALFRED TENNYSON\r\n\r\n(See pages 77, 486, 652)\r\n\r\n    Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,\r\n      The flying clouds, the frosty light:\r\n      The year is dying in the night;\r\n    Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.\r\n\r\n    Ring out the old, ring in the new,\r\n      Ring, happy bells, across the snow:\r\n      The year is going, let him go;\r\n    Ring out the false, ring in the true.\r\n\r\n    Ring out the grief that saps the mind,\r\n      For those that here we see no more;\r\n      Ring out the feud of rich and poor,\r\n    Ring in redress to all mankind....\r\n\r\n    Ring out false pride in place and blood,\r\n      The civic slander and the spite;\r\n      Ring in the love of truth and right,\r\n    Ring in the common love of good.\r\n\r\n    Ring out old shapes of foul disease;\r\n      Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;\r\n      Ring out the thousand wars of old,\r\n    Ring in the thousand years of peace.\r\n\r\n    Ring in the valiant man and free,\r\n      The larger heart, the kindlier hand;\r\n      Ring out the darkness of the land,\r\n    Ring in the Christ that is to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY ISAIAH\r\n\r\nThey shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for\r\nthe earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the\r\nwaters cover the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nMakar's Dream\r\n\r\nBY VLADAMIR G. KOROLENKO\r\n\r\n (Contemporary Russian novelist. In this short story a drunken old\r\n peasant is taken in a dream before the Taion, or god of the forest,\r\n to be judged for his many sins. The sins are piled upon a wooden\r\n scale-pan and the virtues upon a golden one--but alas, the virtues\r\n rise high into the air. Thereupon old Makar, driven to despair, breaks\r\n out into protest so eloquent that the judge is puzzled)\r\n\r\nThe scales trembled again ... the old Taion was lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\"How is this?\" said he. \"There are good people still living\r\non the earth. Their eyes are bright, and their faces shine,\r\nand their robes are spotless.... Their hearts are as tender\r\nas good soil; they receive the good seed, and bring forth\r\nbeautiful fruit and the perfume is sweet in my nostrils. Look\r\nat yourself!\"\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned towards Makar, who felt ashamed of his\r\nappearance. He knew that his eyes were not bright, and his\r\nface begrimed, his hair and beard matted and tangled, and his\r\nclothes torn. True, he had been thinking of buying a pair of\r\nboots before his death, in order to appear at the judgment seat\r\nas behooves an honest peasant. But he had always spent the\r\nmoney on drink, and now he stood before the Taion in ragged\r\nshoes, like the last of the Yakouts.... He would gladly have\r\nsunk under the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Thy face is dark,\" went on the Taion. \"Thy eyes are not\r\nbright, and thy clothes are torn. And thy heart is overgrown\r\nwith weeds and thorns. That is the reason why I love mine own\r\nthat are pure and good and holy, and turn my face away from\r\nsuch as you are.\"\r\n\r\nMakar's heart was ready to break. He felt ashamed of his\r\nexistence. He hung his head, but suddenly lifted it and began\r\nto speak again.\r\n\r\nWho were those just and good men the Taion was speaking about?\r\nIf he meant those who were living in fine palaces on the earth\r\nat the same time as Makar did, he knew them well enough. Their\r\neyes were bright because they had not shed as many tears as\r\nhe had, and their faces shone because they were bathed in\r\nperfume, and their clean garments had been wrought by other\r\npeople's hands. Did he not see that he too had been born like\r\nthe others, with bright, open eyes, in which heaven and earth\r\nwere reflected as in a mirror, and with a pure heart which was\r\nready to take in all that was beautiful in the world. And if he\r\nlonged now to hide his wretched self under the ground, it was\r\nno fault of his ... he did not know whose fault it was ... all\r\nhe knew was that all the patience had died in his heart.\r\n\r\nIf Makar had seen the effect which his speech had produced on\r\nthe old Taion, and that every word he said fell on the golden\r\nscale like a weight of lead, his rebellious heart would have\r\nbeen soothed. But he saw nothing, because he was full of blind\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nHe thought of his past life, which had been so hard. How had he\r\nbeen able to bear it so long? He had borne it because the star\r\nof hope had shone through the darkness. And now the star had\r\nvanished, and the hope was dead.... Darkness fell on his soul,\r\nand a storm rose in it like the storm-wind which flies across\r\nthe steppe in the dead of night. He forgot where he was, before\r\nwhom he stood--forgot everything except his anger.\r\n\r\nBut the old Taion said to him: \"Wait, poor man! You are no\r\nlonger on earth. There is justice for you here.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Makar trembled. He realized that they pitied him; his\r\nheart was softened; and, as he thought of his wretched life,\r\nhe burst into tears, weeping over himself. The old Taion wept\r\ntoo, and so did the old father Ivan. Tears flowed from the eyes\r\nof the young serving-men, and they wiped them with their wide\r\nsleeves.\r\n\r\nAnd the scales trembled, and the wooden scale rose higher and\r\nhigher!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Desire of Nations\r\n\r\nBY EDWIN MARKHAM\r\n\r\n(See pages 27, 199)\r\n\r\n    Earth will go back to her lost youth,\r\n    And life grow deep and wonderful as truth,\r\n    When the wise King out of the nearing Heaven comes\r\n    To break the spell of long millenniums--\r\n    To build with song again\r\n    The broken hope of men--\r\n    To hush and heroize the world,\r\n    Beneath the flag of brotherhood unfurled.\r\n    And He will come some day;\r\n    Already is His star upon the way!\r\n    He comes, O world, He comes!\r\n    But not with bugle-cry nor roll of doubling drums....\r\n\r\n    And when He comes into the world gone wrong,\r\n    He will rebuild her beauty with a song.\r\n    To every heart He will its own dream be:\r\n    One moon has many phantoms in the sea.\r\n    Out of the North the norns will cry to men:\r\n    \"Baldur the Beautiful has come again!\"\r\n    The flutes of Greece will whisper from the dead:\r\n    \"Apollo has unveiled his sunbright head!\"\r\n    The stones of Thebes and Memphis will find voice:\r\n    \"Osiris comes: O tribes of Time, rejoice!\"\r\n    And social architects who build the State,\r\n    Serving the Dream at citadel and gate,\r\n    Will hail Him coming through the labor-hum.\r\n    And glad quick cries will go from man to man:\r\n    \"Lo, he has come, our Christ the Artisan,\r\n    The King who loved the lilies, He has come!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Change\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE D.

I\r\nam trembling. A figure rather taller than myself stands against\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\nHe comes toward me, and I, as I advance to meet him, stumble\r\nagainst a chair. Then, still without a word, we are clasping\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nI stand now so that the light falls upon him, and I can see his\r\nface better. He is a little taller than I, younger looking and\r\nsounder looking; he has missed an illness or so, and there is\r\nno scar over his eye. His training has been subtly finer then\r\nmine; he has made himself a better face than mine.... These\r\nthings I might have counted upon. I can fancy he winces with a\r\ntwinge of sympathetic understanding at my manifest inferiority.\r\nIndeed, I come, trailing clouds of earthly confusion and\r\nweakness; I bear upon me all the defects of my world. He wears,\r\nI see, that white tunic with the purple band that I have\r\nalready begun to consider the proper Utopian clothing for grave\r\nmen, and his face is clean shaven. We forgot to speak at first\r\nin the intensity of our mutual inspection....\r\n\r\nI think of the confessions I have just made to him, the\r\nstrange admissions both to him and myself. I have stirred up\r\nthe stagnation of my own emotional life, the pride that has\r\nslumbered, the hopes and disappointments that have not troubled\r\nme for years. There are things that happened to me in my\r\nadolescence that no discipline of reason will ever bring to a\r\njust proportion for me, the first humiliations I was made to\r\nsuffer, the waste of all the fine irrevocable loyalties and\r\npassions of my youth. The dull base caste of my little personal\r\ntragi-comedy--I have ostensibly forgiven, I have for the most\r\npart forgotten--and yet when I recall them I hate each actor\r\nstill. Whenever it comes into my mind--I do my best to prevent\r\nit--there it is, and these detestable people blot out the stars\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nI have told all that story to my double, and he has listened\r\nwith understanding eyes. But for a little while those squalid\r\nmemories will not sink back into the deeps.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY ISAIAH\r\n\r\nThe ransomed of the Lord shall return: they shall obtain joy\r\nand gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncentives\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES FOURIER\r\n\r\n(See page 202)\r\n\r\nUp to the present time politicians and philosophers have not\r\ndreamed of rendering industry attractive; to enchain the mass\r\nto labor, they have discovered no other means, after slavery,\r\nthan the fear of want and starvation; if, however, industry is\r\nthe destiny which is assigned to us by the creator, how can we\r\nthink that he would wish to force us to it by violence, and\r\nthat he has no notion how to put in play some more noble lever,\r\nsome incentive capable of transforming its occupations into\r\npleasures?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Lyric Labor\r\n\r\nBY ELIZABETH WADDELL\r\n\r\n(Apropos of a remark, attributed to an Italian girl of the\r\nGarment Workers' Union, \"It wouldn't be so bad if they would\r\nonly let us sing at our work\")\r\n\r\n    Child of the Renaissance, and little sister\r\n      Of Ariosto and of Raphael,\r\n    If any hush the song within your bosom,\r\n      By all your lyric land, he does not well!\r\n\r\n    One day a traveller from our songless country,\r\n      Passing at morning through Saint Mark's great Square,\r\n    Marvelled, from workmen on the campanile,\r\n      To hear a song arising on the air.\r\n\r\n    Marvelled to see those stones of Venice rising\r\n      To Labor's matin chant intoned so clear,\r\n    As the great towers builded by Amphion\r\n      Rose to the lyre's strong throbbing, tier on tier.\r\n\r\n    Give us, O Child, the gifts we lack full sorely--\r\n      Give us your heritage of art and song,\r\n    The soul that in your fathers grew, sun-nourished,\r\n      Soaring above its poverty and wrong.\r\n\r\n    Of singing vintagers and laughing reapers\r\n      Teach us your happy, sunland way, nor we\r\n    In blind greed longer lay a stern proscription\r\n      Upon your song, O Heart of Italy!\r\n\r\n    Free and serene, in his reward unstinted,\r\n      The workman's hand shall mould his rhythmic thought;\r\n    How candid to the keen-eyed gods' appraisal\r\n      Shall be the work of Song's great ardor wrought--\r\n\r\n    When our young land, reborn in Beauty's image,\r\n      Unto the Morn of Prophecy shall come,\r\n    And every tower be raised with mirth and music,\r\n      And every harvest brought with singing home.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY ISAIAH\r\n\r\nThe Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\r\nhe hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim\r\nliberty to the captives.

C. 429-347. His \"Republic\" is the first, and\r\n perhaps the most famous, of all efforts to portray an ideal Society.\r\n The argument is in the form of a discussion between Socrates and some\r\n of his friends and pupils)\r\n\r\nFirst, then (said Socrates), let us consider in what manner\r\nthose who dwell in the city shall be supported. Is there any\r\nother way than by making bread and wine, and clothes and\r\nshoes, and building houses? They will be nourished, partly\r\nwith barley, making meal of it, and partly with wheat, making\r\nloaves, boiling part, and toasting part, putting fine loaves\r\nand cakes over a fire of stubble, or over dried leaves, and\r\nresting themselves on couches strewed with smilax and myrtle\r\nleaves. They and their children will feast, drinking wine, and\r\ncrowned, and singing to the Gods; and they will pleasantly\r\nlive together, begetting children not beyond their substance,\r\nguarding against poverty or war.\r\n\r\nGlauco, replying, said: You make the men to feast, as it\r\nappears, without meats.\r\n\r\nYou say true, said I: for I forget that they need have meats\r\nlikewise. They shall have salt and olives and cheese, and\r\nthey shall boil bulbous roots and herbs of the field; and we\r\nset before them desserts of figs and vetches and beans; and\r\nthey toast at the fire myrtle berries and the berries of the\r\nbeech-tree, drinking in moderation. Thus passing their life in\r\npeace and health, and dying, as is likely, in old age, they\r\nwill leave to their children another such life.\r\n\r\nIf you had been making, Socrates, said he, a city of hogs, what\r\nelse would have fed them but these things?\r\n\r\nBut how should we do, Glauco, said I?\r\n\r\nWhat is usually done, said he. They must, as I imagine, have\r\ntheir beds and tables, and meats and desserts, as we now have,\r\nif they are not to be miserable.\r\n\r\nBe it so, said I: I understand you. We consider, it seems, not\r\nonly how a city may exist, but a luxurious city; and perhaps it\r\nis not amiss; for in considering such a one, we may probably\r\nsee how justice and injustice have their origin in cities. The\r\ntrue city seems to me to be such as we have described, like one\r\nwho is healthy; but if you prefer that we likewise consider\r\na city that is corpulent, nothing hinders it. For these\r\nthings will not, it seems, please some, nor this sort of life\r\nsatisfy them; but there shall be beds and tables and all other\r\nfurniture, seasonings, ointments, and perfumes, mistresses, and\r\nconfections: and various kinds of these. And we must no longer\r\nconsider as alone necessary what we mentioned at the first,\r\nhouses and clothes and shoes, but painting, too, and all the\r\ncurious arts must be set agoing, and carving, and gold, and\r\nivory; and all these things must be got, must they not?\r\n\r\nYes, said he.\r\n\r\nMust not the city, then, be larger? For that healthy one is\r\nno longer sufficient, but is already full of luxury, and of a\r\ncrowd of such as are in no way necessary to cities; such as all\r\nkinds of sportsmen, and the imitative artists, many of them\r\nimitating in figures, and colors; and others in music; and\r\npoets too, and their ministers, rhapsodists, actors, dancers,\r\nundertakers, workmen of all sorts of instruments, and what\r\nhath reference to female ornament, as well as other things. We\r\nshall need likewise many more servants. Do you not think they\r\nwill need pedagogues, and nurses, and tutors, hair-dressers,\r\nbarbers, victuallers too, and cooks? And further still, we\r\nshall want swineherds likewise; of these there were none in the\r\nother city (for there needed not); but in this we shall want\r\nthese, and many other sorts of herds likewise, if any eat the\r\nseveral animals, shall we not?\r\n\r\nWhy not?\r\n\r\nShall we not, then, in this manner of life be much more in need\r\nof physicians than formerly?\r\n\r\nMuch more.\r\n\r\nAnd the country, which was then sufficient to support the\r\ninhabitants, will, instead of being sufficient, become too\r\nlittle; or how shall we say?\r\n\r\nJust so, said he.\r\n\r\nMust we not then encroach upon the neighboring country, if we\r\nwant to have sufficient for plough and pasture, and they in\r\nlike manner upon us, if they likewise suffer themselves to\r\naccumulate wealth to infinity, going beyond the boundaries of\r\nnecessaries?\r\n\r\nThere is great necessity for it, Socrates.\r\n\r\nShall we afterwards fight, Glauco, or how shall we do?\r\n\r\nWe shall certainly, said he.\r\n\r\nWe say nothing, said I, whether war does any evil or any good,\r\nbut this much only: _that we have found the origin of war, from\r\nwhich most especially arise the greatest mischiefs to states,\r\nboth private and public_.\r\n\r\n\r\nUtopia\r\n\r\nBY SIR THOMAS MORE\r\n\r\n (The word \"Utopia\" means \"No Place.\" It was first used in this book,\r\n and has come to be a general name for pictures of a future society.\r\n The book was written in Latin, and first published in Belgium in 1516.\r\n The translation here quoted was published in England in 1551)\r\n\r\nEvery Cytie is devided into foure equall partes or quarters.\r\nIn the myddes of every quarter there is a market place of all\r\nmaner of things. Thether the workes of every familie be brought\r\ninto certeyne houses. And everye kynde of thing is layde up\r\nseverall in bernes or store houses. From hence the father of\r\neverye familye, or every householder fetchethe whatsoever he\r\nand his have neade of, and carieth it away with him without\r\nmoney, without exchaunge, without any gage, pawne, or pledge.\r\nFor whye shoulde any thing be denyed unto him? Seynge there\r\nis abundance of all things, and that it is not to bee feared,\r\nleste anye man wyll aske more then he neadeth.

The whyche kynde of vice amonge the\r\nUtopians can have no place.\r\n\r\nNowe I have declared and described unto you, as truelye as I\r\ncoulde the fourme and ordre of that common wealth, which verely\r\nin my judgment is not only the beste, but also that which\r\nalone of good right maye claime and take upon it the name of\r\na commonwealth or publique weale. For in other places they\r\nspeake stil of the common wealth. But every man procureth his\r\nowne private gaine. Here where nothinge is private, the commen\r\naffaires bee earnestlye loked upon.... For there nothinge is\r\ndistributed after a nyggyshe sorte, neither there is anye poore\r\nman or beggar. And thoughe no man have anye thinge, yet everye\r\nman is ryche. For what can be more ryche, than to lyve joyfully\r\nand merely, without al griefe and pensifenes: not caring\r\nfor his owne lyving, nor vexed or troubled with his wifes\r\nimportunate complayntes, nor dreadynge povertie to his sonne,\r\nnor sorrowyng for his doughters dowrey?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Soul of Man Under Socialism\r\n\r\nBY OSCAR WILDE\r\n\r\n(See page 155)\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that civilization requires slaves. The Greeks\r\nwere quite right there. Unless there are slaves to do the\r\nugly, horrible, uninteresting work, culture and contemplation\r\nbecome almost impossible. Human slavery is wrong, insecure,\r\nand demoralizing. On mechanical slavery, on the slavery of the\r\nmachine, the future of the world depends.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS\r\n\r\n(See page 477)\r\n\r\nProclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the\r\ninhabitants thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nCities, Old and New\r\n\r\n(_From \"In the Days of the Comet\"_)\r\n\r\nBY H.

Where is London, that somber city\r\nof smoke and drifting darkness, full of the deep roar and\r\nhaunting music of disorder, with its oily, shining, mud-rimmed,\r\nbarge-crowded river, its black pinnacles, and blackened dome,\r\nits sad wildernesses of smut-grayed houses, its myriads\r\nof draggled prostitutes, its millions of hurrying clerks?\r\nThe very leaves upon its trees were foul with greasy black\r\ndefilements. Where is the lime-white Paris, with its green and\r\ndisciplined foliage, its hard unflinching tastefulness, its\r\nsmartly organized viciousness, and the myriads of workers,\r\nnoisily shod, streaming over the bridges in the gray cold\r\nlight of dawn? Where is New York, the high city of clangor and\r\ninfuriated energy, wind swept and competition swept, its huge\r\nbuildings jostling one another and straining ever upward for a\r\nplace in the sky, the fallen pitilessly overshadowed? Where are\r\nits lurking corners of heavy and costly luxury, the shameful\r\nbludgeoning bribing vice of its ill ruled underways, and all\r\nthe gaunt extravagant ugliness of its strenuous life?...\r\n\r\nAll these vast cities have given way and gone, even as my\r\nnative Potteries and the Black Country have gone, and the lives\r\nthat were caught, crippled, starved, and maimed amidst their\r\nlabyrinths, their forgotten and neglected maladjustments,\r\nand their vast, inhuman, ill-conceived industrial machinery\r\nhave escaped--to life. Those cities of growth and accident\r\nare altogether gone, never a chimney smokes about our world\r\ntoday, and the sound of the weeping of children who toiled and\r\nhungered, the dull despair of overburdened women, the noise of\r\nbrute quarrels in alleys, all shameful pleasures and all the\r\nugly grossness of wealthy pride have gone with them, with the\r\nutter change of our lives. As I look back into the past I see a\r\nvast exultant dust of house-breaking and removal rise up into\r\nthe clear air; I live again the Year of Tents, the Years of\r\nScaffolding, and like the triumph of a new theme in a piece of\r\nmusic--the great cities of our new days arise.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaesar and Cleopatra\r\n\r\nBY G.

On that day we have music and dancing,\r\nand merry games and happy feasting on the site of some of the\r\nworst of the old slums, the traditional memory of which we have\r\nkept. On that occasion the custom is for the prettiest girls to\r\nsing some of the old revolutionary songs, and those which were\r\nthe groans of discontent, once so hopeless, on the very spots\r\nwhere those terrible crimes of class-murder were committed day\r\nby day for so many years. To a man like me, who has studied\r\nthe past so diligently, it is a curious and touching sight\r\nto see some beautiful girl, daintily clad, and crowned with\r\nflowers from the neighboring meadows, standing among the happy\r\npeople, on some mound where of old time stood the wretched\r\napology for a house,--a den in which men and women lived packed\r\namong the filth like pilchards in a cask; lived in such a way\r\nthat they could only have endured it, as I said just now, by\r\nbeing degraded out of humanity. To hear the terrible words of\r\nthreatening and lamentation coming from her sweet and beautiful\r\nlips, and she unconscious of their real meaning; to hear her\r\nsinging Hood's 'Song of the Shirt,' and think all the time\r\nshe does not understand what it is all about--a tragedy grown\r\ninconceivable to her and her listeners. Think of that if you\r\ncan, and of how glorious life is grown!\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said I, \"it is difficult for me to think of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Utopian City\r\n\r\n(_From \"A Modern Utopia\"_)\r\n\r\nBY H.

Here will be stupendous\r\nlibraries, and a mighty organization of museums. About these\r\ncentres will cluster a great swarm of people, and close at\r\nhand will be another centre,--for I who am an Englishman must\r\nneeds stipulate that Westminster shall still be a seat of\r\nworld Empire, one of several seats, if you will--where the\r\nruling council of the world assembles. Then the arts will\r\ncluster round this city, as gold gathers about wisdom, and\r\nhere Englishmen will weave into wonderful prose and beautiful\r\nrhythms and subtly atmospheric forms, the intricate, austere\r\nand courageous imagination of our race.\r\n\r\nOne will come into this place as one comes into a noble\r\nmansion. They will have flung great arches and domes of glass\r\nabove the wider spaces of the town, the slender beauty of\r\nthe perfect metal-work far overhead will be softened to a\r\nfairy-like unsubstantiality by the mild London air. It will be\r\nthe London air we know, clear of filth and all impurity, the\r\nsame air that gives our October days their unspeakable clarity\r\nand makes every London twilight mysteriously beautiful. We\r\nshall go along avenues of architecture that will be emancipated\r\nfrom the last memories of the squat temple boxes of the Greek,\r\nthe buxom curvatures of Rome; the Goth in us will have taken\r\nto steel and countless new materials as kindly as once he took\r\nto stone. The gay and swiftly moving platforms of the public\r\nways will go past on either hand, carrying sporadic groups of\r\npeople, and very speedily we shall find ourselves in a sort\r\nof central space, rich with palms and flowering bushes and\r\nstatuary. We shall look along an avenue of trees, down a wide\r\ngorge between the cliffs of crowded hotels that are still\r\nglowing with internal lights, to where the shining morning\r\nriver streams dawnlit out to sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Utopia of Syndicalism\r\n\r\n(_From \"Syndicalism and the Co-operative Commonwealth\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ÉMILE PATAUD AND ÉMILE POUGET\r\n\r\n (Two of the most prominent leaders of the revolutionary trade unions\r\n of France have in this story, published in 1912, portrayed the\r\n overthrow of the capitalist state by the method of the general strike,\r\n and the form of society which they anticipate from the \"direct action\"\r\n of the workers).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Trade Union Congress_\r\n\r\nDelegates came from all parts of France. They came from all\r\ntrades, from all professions. In the enormous hall in which\r\nthe Congress was held, peasants, teachers, fishermen, doctors,\r\npostmen, masons, sat beside market-gardeners, miners and\r\nmetal-workers. An epitome of the whole of society was there.\r\n\r\nIt was a stirring scene, this assembly, where were gathered\r\ntogether the most energetic and most enthusiastic of the\r\ncombatants for the Revolution, who, inaugurating a new era,\r\nwere about to disentangle and sum up the aspirations of the\r\npeople; to point out the road along which they were resolved to\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nThe old militants, who had seen so many Congresses; who had\r\nfought rough fights, and known the bitterness of struggles\r\nagainst the employers and the State; who in their hours of\r\nanxiety and doubt had despaired of ever seeing their hopes\r\nmaterialize, were radiant with joy. Their bold thoughts of past\r\nyears were taking shape, they lived their dream! A happy moment\r\nit was, when old comrades greeted each other. They met, their\r\nhands held out; and trembling, and deeply moved, they embraced\r\neach other--transfigured, radiant.\r\n\r\nThe new delegates, out of their element at first, in the midst\r\nof this fever of life, were soon caught by the atmosphere of\r\nenthusiasm. Many of them were the product of events. Before the\r\nRevolution, they were ignorant of their own capacities; and if\r\nit had not come to shake them out of their torpor, they would\r\nhave continued to vegetate; passive, indifferent, hesitating.\r\nThanks to it, their inner powers were revealed to themselves;\r\nand now, overflowing with passion, energy, and enthusiasm, they\r\nvibrated with an immense force.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Distribution of Wealth_\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a resolution was taken which there was\r\nno need to discuss, or even to explain--it was so logical\r\nand inevitable: the charging the community with the care of\r\nthe children, the sick, and the aged. This was a question of\r\nprinciple which had the advantage of demonstrating, to those\r\nwho still retained prejudices with regard to the new régime,\r\nhow little the future was going to be like the past....\r\n\r\nTwo tendencies were shown; one, that of pure Communism,\r\nwhich advocated complete liberty in consumption, without any\r\nrestriction; the other, inspired with Communist ideas, but\r\nfinding their strict application premature, and advocating a\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\nThe latter view predominated. It was therefore agreed as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nThat every human being, whatever his social function might be,\r\nhad a right to an equal remuneration, which would be divided\r\ninto two parts: the one for the satisfaction of ordinary needs;\r\nthe other for the needs of luxury. The remuneration would be\r\nobtained, with regard to the first, by a permanent Trade Union\r\ncard; and with regard to the second, by a book of consumers'\r\n\"notes.\"\r\n\r\nThe first class included all kinds of commodities, all food\r\nproducts, clothing, all that would be in such abundance that\r\nthe consumption of it need not be restricted; each one would\r\nhave the right to draw from the common stock, according to\r\nhis needs, without any other formality than having to present\r\nhis card in the shops and depots, to those in charge of\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nIn the second class would be placed products of various kinds,\r\nwhich, being in too small a quantity to allow of their being\r\nput at the free disposition of all, retained a purchase value,\r\nliable to vary according to their greater or less rarity,\r\nand greater or less demand. The price of these products was\r\ncalculated according to the former monetary method, and the\r\nquantity of work necessary to produce them would be one of\r\nthe elements in fixing their value; they would be delivered on\r\nthe payment of \"consumers' notes,\" the mechanism of whose use\r\nrecalled that of the cheque.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, agreed that in proportion as the products of\r\nthis second class became abundant enough to attain to the level\r\nnecessary for free consumption, they should enter into the\r\nfirst class; and ceasing to be considered as objects of luxury,\r\nthey should be, without rationing, placed at the disposal of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nBy this arrangement society approached, automatically, more and\r\nmore towards pure Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Nationalism\r\n\r\nBY THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\n(Ex-president of the United States, born 1858)\r\n\r\nPractical equality of opportunity for all citizens, when we\r\nachieve it, will have two great results. First, every man will\r\nhave a fair chance to make himself all that in him lies; to\r\nreach the highest point to which his capacities, unassisted\r\nby special privilege of his own and unhampered by the special\r\nprivilege of others, can carry him, and to get for himself\r\nand for his family substantially what he has earned. Second,\r\nequality of opportunity means that the commonwealth will get\r\nfrom every citizen the highest service of which he is capable.\r\nNo man who carries the burden of the special privileges of\r\nanother can give to the commonwealth that service to which it\r\nis fairly entitled.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking Backward\r\n\r\nBY EDWARD BELLAMY\r\n\r\n(A story of the experience of a man who goes to sleep and wakes\r\nup a hundred years later.

How is the amount\r\nof credit given respectively to the workers in different\r\nlines determined? By what title does the individual claim his\r\nparticular share?

The basis of\r\nhis claim is the fact that he is a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact that he is a man!\" I repeated, incredulously. \"Do you\r\npossibly mean that all have the same share?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most assuredly.\" ...\r\n\r\n\"But what inducement,\" I asked, \"can a man have to put\r\nforth his best endeavors when, however much or little he\r\naccomplishes, his income remains the same? High characters may\r\nbe moved by devotion to the common welfare under such a system,\r\nbut does not the average man tend to rest back on his oar,\r\nreasoning that it is of no use to make a special effort, since\r\nthe effort will not increase his income, nor its withholding\r\ndiminish it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it then really seem to you,\" answered my companion, \"that\r\nhuman nature is insensible to any motives save fear of want and\r\nlove of luxury, that you should expect security and equality of\r\nlivelihood to leave them without possible incentives to effort?\r\nYour contemporaries did not really think so, though they might\r\nfancy they did. When it was a question of the grandest class\r\nof efforts, the most absolute self-devotion, they depended on\r\nquite other incentives. Not higher wages, but honor and hope of\r\nmen's gratitude, patriotism and the inspiration of duty, were\r\nthe motives which they set before their soldiers when it was a\r\nquestion of dying for the nation; and never was there an age of\r\nthe world when these motives did not call out what is best and\r\nnoblest in men. And not only this, but when you come to analyze\r\nthe love of money which was the general impulse to effort\r\nin your day, you find that the dread of want and desire of\r\nluxury were two of several motives which the pursuit of money\r\nrepresented; the others, and with many the more influential,\r\nbeing desire of power, of social position and reputation for\r\nability and success. So you see that though we have abolished\r\npoverty and the fear of it, and inordinate luxury with the hope\r\nof it, we have not touched the greater part of the motives\r\nwhich underlay the love of money in former times, or any of\r\nthose which prompted the supremer sorts of effort. The coarser\r\nmotives, which no longer move us, have been replaced by high\r\nmotives wholly unknown to the mere wage earners of your age.\r\nNow that industry of any sort is no longer self-service, but\r\nservice of the nation, patriotism, passion for humanity, impel\r\nthe workers as in your day they did the soldier. The army\r\nof industry is an army, not alone by virtue of its perfect\r\norganization, but by reason also of the ardor of self-devotion\r\nwhich animates its members.\r\n\r\n\"But as you used to supplement the motives of patriotism\r\nwith the love of glory, in order to stimulate the value of\r\nyour soldiers, so do we. Based as our industrial system is\r\non the principle of requiring the same unit of effort from\r\nevery man, that is the best he can do, you will see that the\r\nmeans by which we spur the workers to do their best must be\r\na very essential part of our scheme. With us, diligence in\r\nthe national service is, the sole and certain way to public\r\nrepute, social distinction, and official power. The value of\r\na man's services in society fixes his rank in it. Compared\r\nwith the effect of our social arrangements in impelling men to\r\nbe zealous in business, we deem the object-lessons of biting\r\npoverty and wanton luxury on which you depended a device as\r\nweak and uncertain as it was barbaric.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLiberty in Utopia\r\n\r\n(_From \"A Modern Utopia\"_)\r\n\r\nBY H. G. WELLS\r\n\r\n(See pages 519, 675, 712, 830, 844, 853, 856)\r\n\r\nThe idea of individual liberty is one that has grown in\r\nimportance and grows with every development of modern thought.\r\nTo the classical Utopists freedom was relatively trivial.\r\nClearly they considered virtue and happiness as entirely\r\nseparable from liberty, and as being altogether more important\r\nthings. But the modern view, with its deepening insistence\r\nupon individuality and upon the significance of its uniqueness,\r\nsteadily intensifies the value of freedom, until at last we\r\nbegin to see liberty as the very substance of life, that indeed\r\nit is life, and that only the dead things, the choiceless\r\nthings, live in absolute obedience to law. To have free play\r\nfor one's individuality is, in the modern view, the subjective\r\ntriumph of existence, as survival in creative work and\r\noffspring is its objective triumph....\r\n\r\nA Utopia such as this present one, written on the opening\r\nof the Twentieth Century, and after the most exhaustive\r\ndiscussion--nearly a century long--between Communistic and\r\nSocialistic ideas on the one hand, and Individualism on\r\nthe other, emerges upon a sort of effectual conclusion to\r\nthese controversies.... In the very days when our political\r\nand economic order is becoming steadily more Socialistic,\r\nour ideals of intercourse turn more and more to a fuller\r\nrecognition of the claims of individuality. The State is to be\r\nprogressive, it is no longer to be static, and this alters the\r\ngeneral condition of the Utopian problem profoundly; we have to\r\nprovide not only for food and clothing, for order and health,\r\nbut for initiative. The factor that leads the World State on\r\nfrom one phase of development to the next is the interplay of\r\nindividualities; to speak teleologically, the world exists for\r\nthe sake of and through initiative, and individuality is the\r\nmethod of initiative.... The State is for Individuals, the law\r\nis for freedoms, the world is for experiment, experience and\r\nchange: these are the fundamental beliefs upon which modern\r\nUtopia must go.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE EPISTLE OF JAMES\r\n\r\nWhoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth\r\ntherein, he not being a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the\r\nwork, this man shall be blessed in his deed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Social Revolution and After\r\n\r\nBY KARL KAUTSKY\r\n\r\n(German Socialist editor, generally recognized as the\r\nintellectual leader of the modern Social-democratic movement in\r\nhis country)\r\n\r\nFreedom of education and of scientific investigation from the\r\nfetters of capitalist dominion; freedom of the individual\r\nfrom the oppression of exclusive, exhaustive physical labor;\r\ndisplacement of capitalist industry in the intellectual\r\nproduction of society by the free unions--along this road\r\nproceeds the tendency of the proletarian régime....\r\n\r\nRegulation of social chaos and liberation of the\r\nindividual--these are the two historical tasks that capitalism\r\nhas placed before society. They appear to be contradictory, but\r\nthey are simultaneously soluble because each of them belongs to\r\na different sphere of social life. Undoubtedly whoever should\r\nseek to rule both spheres in the same manner would find himself\r\ninvolved in insoluble contradictions....\r\n\r\n_Communism in material production, anarchism in intellectual._\r\nThis is the type of the Socialist productive system which will\r\narise from the dominion of the proletariat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Understanding of Nature\r\n\r\n(_From \"Studies in Socialism\"_)\r\n\r\nBY JEAN LEON JAURÈS\r\n\r\n(See page 589)\r\n\r\nWhen Socialism has triumphed, when conditions of peace have\r\nsucceeded to conditions of combat, when all men have their\r\nshare of property in the immense human capital, and their share\r\nof initiative and of the exercise of free-will in the immense\r\nhuman activity, then all men will know the fulness of pride\r\nand joy; and they will feel that they are co-operators in the\r\nuniversal civilization, even if their immediate contribution\r\nis only the humblest manual labor; and this labor, more noble\r\nand more fraternal in character, will be so regulated that the\r\nlaborers shall always reserve for themselves some leisure hours\r\nfor reflection and for a cultivation of the sense of life.\r\n\r\nThey will have a better understanding of the hidden meaning of\r\nlife, whose mysterious aim is the harmony of all consciences,\r\nof all forces, and of all liberties. They will understand\r\nhistory better and will love it, because it will be their\r\nhistory, since they are the heirs of the whole human race.\r\nFinally, they will understand the universe better; because,\r\nwhen they see conscience and spirit triumphing in humanity,\r\nthey will be quick to feel that this universe which has given\r\nbirth to humanity cannot be fundamentally brutal and blind;\r\nthat there is spirit everywhere, soul everywhere, and that the\r\nuniverse itself is simply an immense confused aspiration toward\r\norder, beauty, freedom, and goodness. Their point of view will\r\nbe changed; they will look with new eyes not only at their\r\nbrother men, but at the earth and the sky, rocks and trees,\r\nanimals, flowers, and stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Future of Art\r\n\r\n(_From \"Collectivism and Industrial Evolution\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ÉMILE VANDERVELDE\r\n\r\n(Belgian Socialist leader, since the war a member of the\r\nCabinet)\r\n\r\nMany a time it has been said that art under all its forms is\r\nonly the mirror, more or less distorted, yet always faithful,\r\nof society. Today it reflects the discouragements of a dying\r\n_bourgeoisie_, the torments, the anguish, and also the hopes of\r\na proletariat which lives and grows in the midst of suffering.\r\nTomorrow, it will reflect the calm and peace of happy\r\ngenerations which, escaped from the mire of poverty, will have\r\nfounded through their own efforts the sovereignty of labor and\r\nthe reign of brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt After the Revolution\r\n\r\n(_From \"Syndicalism and the Co-operative Commonwealth\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ÉMILE PATAUD AND ÉMILE POUGET\r\n\r\n(See page 857)\r\n\r\nLife was now to take its revenge. The human being was no longer\r\nriveted to the chain of wages; his aim in life passed beyond\r\nthe mere struggle for a living. Industry was no longer his\r\nmaster, but his servant. Freed from all hindrances, he would\r\nbe able to develop without constraint.\r\n\r\nAnd there was no need to fear that the level of art would be\r\nlowered as it became universalized. Far from this, it would\r\ngain in extent and depth. Its domain would be unlimited. It\r\nwould enter into all production. It would not restrict itself\r\nto painting large canvasses, to sculpturing marble, to moulding\r\nbronze. There would be art in everything.\r\n\r\nAnd we should no longer see great artists stifled by misery,\r\nlost in the quicksands of indifference, as was too often the\r\ncase formerly.\r\n\r\n\r\nPunishment in Utopia\r\n\r\n(_From \"A Modern Utopia\"_)\r\n\r\nBY H. G. WELLS\r\n\r\n(See pages 519, 675, 712, 830, 844, 853, 856, 863)\r\n\r\nYou see the big convict steamship standing in to the Island of\r\nIncurable Cheats. The crew are respectfully at their quarters,\r\nready to lend a hand overboard, but wide awake, and the captain\r\nis hospitably on the bridge to bid his guests good-bye and keep\r\nan eye on the movables. The new citizens for this particular\r\nAlsatia, each no doubt with his personal belongings securely\r\npacked and at hand, crowd the deck and study the nearing coast.\r\nBright, keen faces would be there, and we, were we by any\r\nchance to find ourselves beside the captain, might recognize\r\nthe double of this great earthly magnate or that, Petticoat\r\nLane and Park Lane cheek by jowl. The landing part of the\r\njetty is clear of people, only a government man or so stands\r\nthere to receive the boat and prevent a rush; but beyond the\r\ngates a number of engagingly smart-looking individuals loiter\r\nspeculatively. One figures a remarkable building labeled Custom\r\nHouse, an interesting fiscal revival this population has made,\r\nand beyond, crowding up the hill, the painted walls of a number\r\nof comfortable inns clamor loudly. One or two inhabitants in\r\nreduced circumstances would act as hotel touts, there are\r\nseveral hotel omnibuses and a Bureau de Change, certainly a\r\nBureau de Change. And a small house with a large board, aimed\r\npoint-blank seaward, declares itself a Gratis Information\r\nOffice, and next to it rises the graceful dome of a small\r\nCasino. Beyond, great hoardings proclaim the advantages of\r\nmany island specialities, a hustling commerce, and the opening\r\nof a Public Lottery. There is a large cheap-looking barrack,\r\nthe school of Commercial Science for gentlemen of inadequate\r\ntraining....\r\n\r\nAltogether a very go-ahead looking little port it would be,\r\nand though this disembarkation would have none of the flow of\r\nhilarious good fellowship that would throw a halo of genial\r\nnoise about the Islands of Drink, it is doubtful if the new\r\narrivals would feel anything very tragic in the moment. Here at\r\nlast was scope for adventure after their hearts.\r\n\r\nThis sounds more fantastic than it is. But what else is there\r\nto do, unless you kill? You must seclude, but why should you\r\ntorment? All modern prisons are places of torture by restraint,\r\nand the habitual criminal plays the part of a damaged mouse\r\nat the mercy of the cat of our law. He has his little painful\r\nrun, and back he comes again to a state more horrible even\r\nthan destitution. There are no Alsatias left in the world. For\r\nmy own part I can think of no crime, unless it is reckless\r\nbegetting or the wilful transmission of contagious disease,\r\nfor which the bleak terrors, the solitudes and ignominies of\r\nthe modern prison do not seem outrageously cruel. If you want\r\nto go as far as that, then kill. Why, once you are rid of them,\r\nshould you pester criminals to respect an uncongenial standard\r\nof conduct? Into such islands of exile as this a modern Utopia\r\nwill have to purge itself. There is no alternative that I can\r\ncontrive.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Preface to Politics\r\n\r\nBY WALTER LIPPMANN\r\n\r\n(See page 779)\r\n\r\nYou don't have to preach honesty to men with a creative\r\npurpose. Let a human being throw the energies of his soul into\r\nthe making of something, and the instinct of workmanship will\r\ntake care of his honesty. The writers who have nothing to say\r\nare the ones you can buy; the others have too high a price. A\r\ngenuine craftsman will not adulterate his product; the reason\r\nisn't because duty says he shouldn't, but because passion says\r\nhe couldn't.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Triumph of Love\r\n\r\n(_From \"Labor\"_)\r\n\r\nBY ÉMILE ZOLA\r\n\r\n (In this novel the French writer gives his solution of the labor\r\n problem, in the story of a young engineer who is led by the study of\r\n Fourier to found a co-operative steel mill, which in the course of\r\n time replaces all the old competitive establishments, and brings about\r\n a reign of human brotherhood)\r\n\r\nThe triumphant spectacle that Luc had now always before his\r\neyes, that city of happiness, the gayly colored roofs of which\r\nwere spread out before his window, was admirable. The march of\r\nprogress which a former generation, sunk in ancient error, and\r\ncontaminated by an iniquitous environment, had so mournfully\r\nbegun in the midst of many obstacles and former hatreds, was to\r\nbe pursued by their children, instructed and disciplined by the\r\nschools and workshops, advancing with a cheerful step, even to\r\nthe attainment of aims formerly declared chimerical. The long\r\neffort of struggling humanity resulted in the free expansion\r\nof the individual, in a society completely satisfied; in man\r\nbeing fully man, and living his life in its entirety. The happy\r\ncity was thus realized in the religion of life; the religion\r\nof humanity, freed at length from dogmas, became in itself all\r\nglory and all joy....\r\n\r\nAuthority was at an end; the new social system had no other\r\nfoundation than the tie of labor accepted as necessary by all,\r\ntheir law and the object of their worship. A number of groups\r\nadopted the new system, breaking off from the old groups of\r\nbuilders, dealers in clothing, metal-workers, artisans, and\r\nfarm laborers, each group increasing in number, each different,\r\neach making itself essential to the rest, and satisfying\r\nindividual wants as well as the needs of a community. Nothing\r\nimpeded any man's expansion; a citizen working as a laborer\r\nmight unite himself with as many groups as he thought proper....\r\n\r\nAnd in the city all was love. A pervading sense of love,\r\nincreasing, wholesome, purifying, became the perfume and the\r\nsacred flame of daily life. Love, general and universal, had\r\nits birth in youth; then it passed on and became mother love,\r\nfather love, filial love; it spread to relations, to neighbors,\r\nto fellow-citizens, to all men upon earth, and as its waves\r\nswept on and became stronger, it seemed to become a great sea\r\nof love, bathing the shores of the whole earth. Charity--that\r\nis, love of one's neighbors--was like the fresh air which\r\nfills the lungs of all who breathe it; everywhere there was\r\nthis feeling of brotherly love; love alone had proved able to\r\nrealize the unity men had so long dreamed of, bringing all\r\ninto divine harmony. The human race, at last as well balanced\r\nas the planets in their orbits by the law of attraction, the\r\nlaws of justice, solidarity, and love, would go joyfully on\r\nits round through the ages of eternity. Such was the harvest\r\never renewed and renewing, the great harvest of tenderness and\r\nloving kindness, that Luc every morning saw growing up around\r\nhim in spots where he had sown his seed so bountifully in his\r\nearly days. In his whole city, in his school-rooms, in his\r\nwork-shops, in each house, and almost in each heart, for many\r\nyears he had been sowing the good seed with lavish hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City of the Sun\r\n\r\nBY CAMPANELLA\r\n\r\n (A picture of an ideal community written about A.D. 1600 by an Italian\r\n student who was imprisoned for twenty-seven years, and nine times\r\n tortured by the Spanish Inquisition. See page 438)\r\n\r\nLove is foremost in attending to the charge of the race. He\r\nsees that men and women are joined together, that they bring\r\nforth the best offspring. Indeed, they laugh at us who exhibit\r\na studious care for our breed of horses and dogs, but neglect\r\nthe breeding of human beings. Thus the education of children\r\nis under his rule. So also is the medicine that is sold, the\r\nsowing and collecting of fruits of the earth and of trees,\r\nagriculture, pasturage, the preparations for the months, the\r\ncooking arrangements, and whatever has any reference to food,\r\nclothing, and the intercourse of the sexes. Love himself is\r\nruler, but there are many male and female magistrates dedicated\r\nto these arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nLove in Utopia\r\n\r\n(_From \"News from Nowhere\"_)\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM MORRIS\r\n\r\n(See pages 793, 855)\r\n\r\n (A famous English Socialist romance; the dream of a poet made\r\n heartsick by the sights and sounds of a machine civilization, and\r\n yearning for beauty, simplicity, and peace)\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said I, \"no doubt you wanted to keep them out of the\r\nDivorce Court; but I suppose it often has to settle such\r\nmatters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you suppose nonsense,\" said he. \"I know that there\r\nused to be such lunatic affairs as divorce courts; but just\r\nconsider, all the cases that came into them were matters of\r\nproperty quarrels; and I think, dear guest, that though you do\r\ncome from another planet, you can see from the mere outside\r\nlook of our world that quarrel about private property could not\r\ngo on among us in our days.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, my drive from Hammersmith to Bloomsbury, and all the\r\nquiet, happy life I had seen so many hints of, even apart from\r\nmy shopping, would have been enough to tell me that \"the sacred\r\nrights of property,\" as we used to think of them, were now no\r\nmore. So I sat silent while the old man took up the thread of\r\nthe discourse again....\r\n\r\n\"You must understand once for all that we have changed these\r\nmatters; or rather, that our way of looking at them has changed\r\nwithin the last two hundred years. We do not deceive ourselves,\r\nindeed, or believe that we can get rid of all the trouble that\r\nbesets the dealings between the sexes. We know that we must\r\nface the unhappiness that comes of man and woman confusing\r\nthe relations between natural passion and sentiment, and the\r\nfriendship which, when things go well, softens the awakening\r\nfrom passing illusions; but we are not so mad as to pile up\r\ndegradation on that unhappiness by engaging in sordid squabbles\r\nabout livelihood and position, and the power of tyrannizing\r\nover the children who have been the results of love or lust.\"\r\n...\r\n\r\nHe was silent for some time, and I would not interrupt him.\r\nAt last he began again: \"But you must know that we of these\r\ngenerations are strong and healthy of body, and live easily; we\r\npass our lives in reasonable strife with nature, exercising not\r\none side of ourselves only, but all sides, taking the keenest\r\npleasure in all the life of the world. So it is a point of\r\nhonor with us not to be self-centered,--not to suppose that the\r\nworld must cease because one man is sorry; therefore we should\r\nthink it foolish, or if you will, criminal, to exaggerate these\r\nmatters of sentiment and sensibility; we are no more inclined\r\nto eke out our sentimental sorrows than to cherish our bodily\r\npains; and we recognize that there are other pleasures besides\r\nlove-making. You must remember, also, that we are long-lived,\r\nand that therefore beauty both in man and woman is not so\r\nfleeting as it was in the days when we were burdened so heavily\r\nwith self-inflicted diseases. So we shake off these griefs in\r\na way which perhaps the sentimentalist of other times would\r\nthink contemptible and unheroic, but which we think necessary\r\nand manlike. As on the one hand, therefore, we have ceased to\r\nbe commercial in our love-matters, so also we have ceased to\r\nbe artificially foolish. The folly which comes by nature, the\r\nunwisdom of the immature man, or the older man caught in a\r\ntrap, we must put up with that, nor are we much ashamed of it;\r\nbut to be conventionally sensitive or sentimental--my friend, I\r\nam old and perhaps disappointed, but at least I think that we\r\nhave cast off _some_ of the follies of the older world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nParentage and the State\r\n\r\nBY H.

It must be\r\npaid for like any other public service; in any completely\r\ncivilized state it must be sustained, rewarded, and controlled.\r\nAnd this is to be done not to supersede the love, pride, and\r\nconscience of the parent, but to supplement, encourage, and\r\nmaintain it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Deliverance of Woman\r\n\r\n(_From \"Woman and Labor\"_)\r\n\r\nBY OLIVE SCHREINER\r\n\r\n(See pages 240, 247, 502, 579)\r\n\r\nAlways in our dreams we hear the turn of the key that shall\r\nclose the door of the last brothel; the clink of the last coin\r\nthat pays for the body and soul of a woman; the falling of the\r\nlast wall that encloses artificially the activity of woman and\r\ndivides her from man; always we picture the love of the sexes\r\nas once a dull, slow, creeping worm; then a torpid, earthy\r\nchrysalis; at last the full-winged insect, glorious in the\r\nsunshine of the future.\r\n\r\nToday, as we row hard against the stream of life, is it only\r\nblindness in our eyes, which have been too long strained,\r\nwhich makes us see, far up the river where it fades into the\r\ndistance, through all the mists that rise from the river-banks,\r\na clear, golden light?

Let every woman whose heart bleeds for\r\nthe sufferings of her sex, hasten to declare herself and to\r\nconstitute herself, as far as she possibly can, a free woman.\r\nLet her accept the term with all the odium that belongs to it;\r\nlet her insist on her right to speak, dress, think, act, and\r\nabove all to use her sex, as she deems best; let her face the\r\nscorn and ridicule; let her \"lose her own life\" if she likes;\r\nassured that only so can come deliverance, and that only when\r\nthe free woman is honored will the prostitute cease to exist.\r\nAnd let every man who really would respect his counterpart,\r\nentreat her also to act so; let him never by word or deed\r\ntempt her to grant as a bargain what can only be precious as\r\na gift; let him see her with pleasure stand a little aloof;\r\nlet him help her to gain her feet; so at last, by what slight\r\nsacrifices on his part such a course may involve, will it dawn\r\nupon him that he has gained a real companion and helpmate on\r\nlife's journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Free Woman\r\n\r\nBY WALT WHITMAN\r\n\r\n(See pages 184, 268, 578, 726, 835)\r\n\r\n    She is less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever,\r\n    The gross and soil'd she moves among do not make her gross and soiled,\r\n    She knows the thoughts as she passes, nothing is concealed from her,\r\n    She is none the less considerate or friendly therefor,\r\n    She is the best belov'd, it is without exception; she has no\r\nreason to fear, and she does not fear.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coming Singer\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE STERLING\r\n\r\n(See pages 504, 552, 597, 816)\r\n\r\n    The Veil before the mystery of things\r\n      Shall stir for him with iris and with light;\r\n      Chaos shall have no terror in his sight\r\n    Nor earth a bond to chafe his urgent wings;\r\n    With sandals beaten from the crown of kings\r\n      He shall tread down the altars of their night,\r\n      And stand with Silence on her breathless height,\r\n    To hear what song the star of morning sings.\r\n\r\n    With perished beauty in his hands as clay,\r\n      Shall he restore futurity its dream.\r\n    Behold! his feet shall take a heavenly way\r\n      Of choric silver and of chanting fire,\r\n    Till in his hands unshapen planets gleam,\r\n      'Mid murmurs from the Lion and the Lyre.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus Spake Zarathustra\r\n\r\nBY FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE\r\n\r\n(See page 779)\r\n\r\nWhen Zarathustra came into the next city, which lay beside the\r\nforest, he found in that place much people gathered together\r\nin the market; for they had been called that they should see a\r\nrope-dancer.

It is so eloquent, and yet so exact. I\r\nmust restrain myself or you may misunderstand.--_David Graham\r\nPhillips._\r\n\r\nIn this fearful story the horrors of industrial slavery are\r\nas vividly drawn as if by lightning. It marks an epoch in\r\nrevolutionary literature.--_Eugene V. Debs._\r\n\r\n    Mr. Heinemann isn't a man to bungle;\r\n    He's published a book which is called \"The Jungle.\"\r\n    It's written by Upton Sinclair, who\r\n    Appears to have heard a thing or two\r\n    About Chicago and what men do\r\n    Who live in that city--a loathsome crew.\r\n    It's there that the stockyards reek with blood,\r\n    And the poor man dies, as he lives, in mud;\r\n    The Trusts are wealthy beyond compare,\r\n    And the bosses are all triumphant there,\r\n    And everything rushes without a skid\r\n    To be plunged in a hell which has lost its lid.\r\n    For a country where things like that are done\r\n    There's just one remedy, only one,\r\n    A latter-day Upton Sinclairism\r\n    Which the rest of us know as Socialism.\r\n    Here's luck to the book! It will make you cower,\r\n    For it's written with wonderful, thrilling power.\r\n    It grips your throat with a grip Titanic,\r\n    And scatters shams with a force volcanic.\r\n    Go buy the book, for I judge you need it,\r\n    And when you have bought it, read it, read it.\r\n\r\n                                                  --_Punch_ (_London_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A book which has been absolutely boycotted by the literary\r\nreviews of America._\r\n\r\nTHE PROFITS OF RELIGION\r\n\r\nBY UPTON SINCLAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nA study of Supernaturalism as a Source of Income and a\r\nShield to Privilege; the first examination in any language\r\nof institutionalized religion from the economic point of\r\nview. \"Has the labour as well as the merit of breaking virgin\r\nsoil,\" writes Joseph McCabe. The book has had practically\r\nno advertising and only two or three reviews in radical\r\npublications; yet forty thousand copies have been sold in the\r\nfirst year.\r\n\r\n _From the Rev. John Haynes Holmes_: \"I must confess that it has fairly\r\n made me writhe to read these pages, not because they are untrue or\r\n unfair, but on the contrary, because I know them to be the real facts.\r\n I love the church as I love my home, and therefore it is no pleasant\r\n experience to be made to face such a story as this which you have\r\n told. It had to be done, however, and I am glad you have done it, for\r\n my interest in the church, after all, is more or less incidental,\r\n whereas my interest in religion is a fundamental thing.... Let me\r\n repeat again that I feel that you have done us all a service in the\r\n writing of this book. Our churches today, like those of ancient\r\n Palestine, are the abode of Pharisees and scribes. It is as spiritual\r\n and helpful a thing now as it was in Jesus' day for that fact to be\r\n revealed.\"\r\n\r\n _From Luther Burbank_: \"No one has ever told 'the truth, the whole\r\n truth, and nothing but the truth' more faithfully than Upton Sinclair\r\n in 'The Profits of Religion.'\"\r\n\r\n _From Louis Untermeyer_: \"Let me add my quavering alto to the chorus\r\n of applause of 'The Profits of Religion.' It is something more than a\r\n book--it is a Work!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCloth $1.50; paper $1.00\r\n\r\n\r\n  UPTON SINCLAIR\r\n  Station A, Pasadena, California\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCO-OP\r\n\r\n_A Novel of Living Together_\r\n\r\n_By_ UPTON SINCLAIR\r\n\r\n\r\n _From a Sociologist_:\r\n\r\nEvery evening at 10:30 and again at 11:00 I lay down Sinclair's\r\n\"Co-op\" to go to bed, but in half a minute I pick it up and go\r\non. It is the best thing of his I have ever read. It abounds\r\nin character-drawing, incident, adventure, tension, climax,\r\nhumor and instruction. It is a ripping story. May it circulate\r\na million!\r\n\r\n  E. A. ROSS, UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN.\r\n\r\n _From a Philosopher_:\r\n\r\nI began reading \"Co-op\" Friday p. m. and hardly laid it down\r\ntill I finished it Saturday. It is one of the finest things you\r\nhave done--or anybody else on the American scene has done.\r\n\r\n  JOHN DEWEY\r\n\r\n _From a Novelist_:\r\n\r\nI feel that it is socially important and that it would be a\r\nfortunate thing for this country if it were widely read. I\r\nreally feel that if most of the previous works of Sinclair,\r\nparticularly \"Oil,\" \"The Brass Check,\" \"The Profits of\r\nReligion,\" \"King Coal,\" \"100%,\" \"The Goose Step,\" \"Money\r\nWrites,\" had been widely read and distributed, this country\r\nwould be in a much better position to understand itself than it\r\nis now. \"Co-op\" is a logical outcome of all the things which\r\nSinclair has protested against during his literary life. I\r\ncertainly wish for it a wide sale and consideration.\r\n\r\n  THEODORE DREISER.\r\n\r\n _From an Editor_:\r\n\r\nEvery word is priceless. It's a GRAND JOB, Uppie, and I will\r\nsing its song.... Your \"Co-op\" is a thrilling tale, beautifully\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n  ROB WAGNER.\r\n\r\n _From a Reviewer_:\r\n\r\nThis is an engrossing, great-hearted and, of course,\r\ndesperately earnest novel that Upton Sinclair has written\r\nin celebration of and pleading for the 250 co-operatives of\r\nunemployed in America, most of them in California.... Not for a\r\nlong time has Upton Sinclair written so absorbing a novel, as\r\na novel, giving us fine human stories, produced so moving and\r\nwarming a book. It is a book as honest as the day is long....\r\nDon't get it into your head that because this is a novel of\r\nimmediate intent it is a bore like campaign biographies and\r\nnovels of campaign issues and propaganda tracts. You don't\r\nhave to believe in the future of EPIC any more than I do\r\nto recognize it as a great humanitarian story, alive and\r\npowerful--and effective. It belongs to our times as \"The\r\nJungle\" belonged to its time. It belongs, too, on that shelf\r\nwhich contains the noblest of social literature.\r\n\r\n  FRED T.

And whose propaganda?\r\n\r\nWho furnishes the raw material for your thoughts about life? Is\r\nit honest material?\r\n\r\nNo man can ask more important questions than these; and here\r\nfor the first time the questions are answered in a book.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of this book, 23,000 copies, was sold out\r\ntwo weeks after publication. Paper could not be obtained for\r\nprinting, and a carload of brown wrapping paper was used. The\r\nprintings to date amount to 144,000 copies. The book is being\r\npublished in Great Britain and colonies, and in translations\r\nin Germany, France, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Italy,\r\nHungary and Japan.\r\n\r\n _HERMANN BESSEMER, in the \"Neues Journal,\" Vienna_:\r\n\r\n \"Upton Sinclair deals with names, only with names, with balances, with\r\n figures, with documents, a truly stunning, gigantic fact-material. His\r\n book is an armored military train which with rushing pistons roars\r\n through the jungle of American monster-lies, whistling, roaring,\r\n shooting, chopping off with Berserker rage the obscene heads of these\r\n evils. A breath-taking, clutching, frightful book.\"\r\n\r\n _From the pastor of the Community Church, New York_:\r\n\r\n \"I am writing to thank you for sending me a copy of your new book,\r\n 'The Brass Check.' Although it arrived only a few days ago, I have\r\n already read it through, every word, and have loaned it to one of my\r\n colleagues for reading. The book is tremendous. I have never read a\r\n more strongly consistent argument or one so formidably buttressed\r\n by facts. You have proved your case to the handle. I again take\r\n satisfaction in saluting you not only as a great novelist, but as the\r\n ablest pamphleteer in America today. I am already passing around the\r\n word in my church and taking orders for the book.\"--John Haynes Holmes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSingle copy, cloth, $2.00; paper, $1.00 postpaid\r\n\r\n\r\nUPTON SINCLAIR, Pasadena, California\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nItalic text is denoted by _underscores_.\r\n\r\nObvious printer's errors corrected, including unambiguous\r\ntypos, missing periods at the end of several sentences, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully\r\nas possible, including obsolete and variant spellings,\r\nnon-standard punctuation, inconsistently hyphenated words, and\r\nother inconsistencies.",
